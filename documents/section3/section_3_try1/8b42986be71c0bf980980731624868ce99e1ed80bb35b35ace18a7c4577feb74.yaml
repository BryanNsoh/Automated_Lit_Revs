    The cyber-agricultural system (CAS) integrates cybersystems with the physical
    world of agriculture via sensing, modeling, and actuation, and leverages the three
    pillars of functional cyber-physical systems (CPSs): computation, control, and
    communication: Advances in computation (i.e., ubiquitous, multimodal sensing,
    modeling/reasoning enabled by complex computation capabilities, and off-the-shelf
    deep learning models) have opened up numerous opportunities in CAS. Progress in
    control/actuation is characterized by advanced agricultural machinery and the
    rise of agricultural robotics (e.g., dexterous manipulation and harvesting, interactive
    sensing, precision spraying, mechanical operations, and weed culling). Advanced
    communication is enabling sensors, actuators, and platforms to coordinate and
    collaborate using internet of things (IoT) principles/tools. Abstract The cyber-agricultural
    system (CAS) represents an overarching framework of agriculture that leverages
    recent advances in ubiquitous sensing, artificial intelligence, smart actuators,
    and scalable cyberinfrastructure (CI) in both breeding and production agriculture.
    We discuss the recent progress and perspective of the three fundamental components
    of CAS – sensing, modeling, and actuation – and the emerging concept of agricultural
    digital twins (DTs). We also discuss how scalable CI is becoming a key enabler
    of smart agriculture. In this review we shed light on the significance of CAS
    in revolutionizing crop breeding and production by enhancing efficiency, productivity,
    sustainability, and resilience to changing climate. Finally, we identify underexplored
    and promising future directions for CAS research and development. Previous article

    systems Cyber-physical systems (CPSs; see Glossary) are natural or human-engineered
    systems that deeply integrate computation (cyber) and physical processes. In a
    CPS, the physical space is the source of information, and the cyberspace uses
    the generated information to make decisions which are then implemented back into
    the physical space [1]. In addition to memory, computation, and communication
    constraints, the information processing and control algorithms in the cyberspace
    also consider the aspects of physical constraints such as time, energy, and safety.
    A typical CPS comprises three modules, namely sensing, modeling, and actuation,
    that form a closed-loop system that leverages the three functional pillars – communication,
    computation, and control (Figure 1A, Key figure). Download : Download high-res

    of cyber-agricultural systems (CASs). (A) Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are engineered
    systems with deep integration between the physical and the cyberspace. The three
    technical modules of CPS – sensing, modeling, and actuation – leverage the three
    functional pillars – communication, computation, and control. (B) The future vision
    of CAS – an individualized plant management paradigm that senses and models up
    to basal individual plants and organs and applies treatments at the plant level
    rather than the field level by replacing heavy machinery with multiple small,
    lightweight units. (C) The CAS vision to transform conventional agriculture into
    a highly sustainable system by reducing the disadvantages of widespread chemical
    usage and significant capital input required by conventional large-scale farming,
    for example leading to chemical runoff and soil compaction. Advanced automation
    improves the abilities of farmers to manage their operations by reducing work
    stress, improving accuracy and precision, reducing physical strain, and minimizing
    safety concerns. In a CPS, the sensing devices ''sense'' or collect specific information
    from the physical system or environment that is being monitored and controlled.
    The sensed data are either processed in situ or transmitted through communication
    channels to the servers for storage, further processing, and analysis. Data analysis
    often involves cloud computing, which not only offers cost-effectiveness and flexibility
    but also demonstrates resource elasticity to allow dynamic allocation and scaling
    of computing resources based on demand. The sensing module is followed by the
    modeling module which utilizes decision-making algorithms such as machine learning
    (ML) models to extract actionable information from the data and construct computational
    models. These models enable reasoning and control of the underlying system, thus
    allowing predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and optimization. Finally, the
    control and actuation module regulates the CPS to achieve the desired performance
    safely and efficiently. Although a CPS can be a monolithic system such as an autonomous
    vehicle, it can also be a distributed system (e.g., an electric power grid) through
    which many subsystems are connected via a communication network [2,3]. In this
    age of Industry 4.0 [4], examples of real-world CPS applications can be found
    in every sector – from smart cities, smart power grids, autonomous vehicles, and
    intelligent transportation systems to advanced manufacturing and industrial control
    systems, and robotic systems. Exactly as in all these sectors, the CPS paradigm
    is poised to fundamentally change agriculture, making it significantly more efficient,
    profitable, sustainable, and safe. The objective of this review is to present
    the significance of CPS in plant agriculture. The vision of agricultural CPS or
    cyber-agricultural systems (CASs), as illustrated in Figure 1B, is already showing
    immense possibilities by leveraging the power of advanced sensing, artificial
    intelligence (AI), ML, computational modeling, robotics, wireless communication,
    and scalable cyberinfrastructure (CI). For example, in the case of US agriculture,
    CAS has the ability to alter the current paradigm of large farms (∼70% of US farmland
    is in holdings of >500 acres) that are characterized by large machinery and a
    large swath of chemical applications that have increased input costs [5,6]. Conventional
    big agricultural practices have helped to improve agricultural outputs but have
    also produced unintended negative consequences that affect farm economic health
    and environmental sustainability [7,8], especially when combating plant pathogens,
    weeds, and insects that reduce US crop yields. For example, US agriculture loses
    US$60.66 per acre due to soybean diseases [9], and global estimates suggest 21.4%
    yield loss [10]. Large farms counteract these stressors by large-scale and frequent
    application of chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [11].
    However, this increased chemical application directly affects run-off, which impacts
    on water quality across all watershed scales, including the oceans [12]. Large-scale
    chemical applications also deteriorate the quality of soil and impact on the food
    chain; overuse of chemicals results in chemical resistance with cascading negative
    consequences [13]. The vision of CAS can alleviate many of these challenges by
    achieving ultra-precision agriculture with integration of improved sustainability,
    profitability, and technology, as shown in Figure 1C. It is worth noting that
    the principles of CAS have been previously applied to crop improvement [14] and
    protection, encompassing sensing (e.g., phenotyping), modeling (e.g., breeding
    methodologies), and actuation (e.g., selection decisions and farm management).
    However, with advances in sensing, communication, data management, AI, and robotics
    technologies, this process has become more efficient and intelligent in recent
    times. Specifically, to address crop breeding problems, efficient sensing, monitoring,
    analysis, and characterization of plant traits, known as phenomics or plant phenotyping,
    is crucial. Several research questions pertaining to breeding and phenomics are
    illustrated in [15]. Although the notion of precision agriculture has been demonstrated
    and adopted in recent years to some extent, the framework of CAS can push the
    boundary further. It can enable an individualized plant management paradigm (enabled
    by individualized sensing, individualized modeling, and individualized actuation,
    as illustrated in Figure 1B) that applies treatments (i.e., actuation) at the
    plant level rather than the field level by replacing heavy machinery with multiple
    small, lightweight platforms [4]. We refer to this individualized CAS paradigm
    as ultra-precision agriculture because it offers greater flexibility of scale
    (i.e., scale-agnostic, equally effective for small and large fields), higher functionality
    (more effective management and outcomes), increased resilience (e.g., ability
    to adapt to changing climate), greater profitability (e.g., reduced costs of operations),
    enhanced autonomy, and reduced soil compaction by utilizing small and lightweight
    platforms. For example, the authors of [16] describe a CAS framework with a monitoring,
    managing, and adapting (MMA) approach. They also discuss how connectivity is ensured
    among the edge computing devices to perform cloud computing and dissemination
    of real-time or near real-time information in production agriculture. In summary,
    the concept of CAS lies at the intersection of precision agriculture, digital
    agriculture, and smart agriculture that can address various efficiency, sustainability,
    and resiliency issues faced by current agricultural practices. In the following
    sections we discuss the three fundamental components (sensing, modeling, and actuation)
    of CAS (Figure 2 for a conceptual illustration of these three components), followed
    by a brief discussion of agricultural digital twins (DTs), a recently emerging
    concept in the context of CAS. Finally, we provide a discussion on CI, a key enabler
    of the CAS paradigm. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    information processing This section delves into the realm of the sensing element
    within a CAS, and offers a comprehensive overview of different types of CAS sensors,
    their measurement capabilities, and advanced and recent information processing
    techniques employed for analyzing the sensed data. High-throughput phenotyping
    Among various CAS sensing applications, high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) or phenomics
    has recently emerged as one of the most useful frameworks [17]. HTP leverages
    both state-of-the-art technologies and analytics to provide a significantly faster
    and non-invasive alternative to conventional phenotyping methods. Moreover, HTP
    helps to explore the nexus between several forms of ''omics'' that together provide
    a holistic information of plants to better characterize plant health and performance.
    Hence, it is extremely useful for making many important crop breeding decisions
    [18,19]. HTP of plants use various remote sensing techniques to allow large-scale
    non-destructive measurement of plant traits [20]. In addition, for both crop breeding
    and production, by employing a diverse array of sensors, both proximal and remote,
    we can facilitate envirotyping and effectively measure and characterize physical
    and environmental variables. This enables us to model plant–environment relations
    and unlock the hidden genetic variations within the latent characteristics [21].
    In addition to remote sensing tools, plant phenotyping can be carried out using
    various proximal sensing platforms in which the sensors are not very far from
    the objects of interest and are installed on platforms such as handheld, fixed
    installations, robots, tractors, and drones [22,23]. These sensors are predominantly
    imaging devices (e.g., simple RGB or grayscale cameras, and thermal, multispectral,
    or hyperspectral cameras) [24]. By contrast, a variety of handheld sensors and
    in planta sensors are used to estimate phenotypes such as plant chlorophyll fluorescence,
    canopy temperature, leaf area, nitrogen content, and plant height. Instead of
    directly enabling HTP, these sensors essentially help to provide the ground-truth
    for validating the model-derived phenotypic estimates [23,25]. However, efforts
    are ongoing that help to provide a proxy measurement of these traits using digital
    technologies. In addition to sensors, CAS also leverages measurements in semi-
    or high-throughput manner. For example, plant morphological traits are phenotyped
    using automated screening systems [26., 27., 28., 29.]. CAS ideally comprises
    a collection of sensors or sensing units to enable organ- to plant- to canopy-level
    sensing and measurement. Although such applications provide rapid measurements
    with affordable solutions, they provide limited physiological information, involve
    complex data reconstruction and extraction methods, and are also limited to specific
    illumination requirements besides the effects of spatial heterogeneity (due to
    changing gradients of environmental factors). The HTP advances have also benefited
    root trait studies through phenotyping platforms as well as sensing and imaging
    technologies [30]. These complex datastreams (spatial and temporal) require ML-
    and computer vision (CV)-based advanced information processing methods that constitute
    a crucial part of the sensing components in CAS. Role of computer vision and machine
    learning With the rapid rise in deep learning (DL) applications [31], many trait-specific
    pipelines or architectures have been developed [32., 33., 34., 35., 36., 37.].
    There are numerous examples of the use of image-based phenotyping aided by computer
    vision and/or ML to study root traits [38., 39., 40., 41., 42., 43., 44., 45.,
    46., 47.], which aid mostly semi-automated analysis of root morphogeometric parameters,
    although end-to-end phenotyping pipelines have been developed [48,49]. Nodule
    features were studied and counted using a soybean nodule acquisition pipeline
    (SNAP) system that combines two convolutional neural network (CNN) models for
    nodule segmentation [50]. Similarly, published studies that leverage ML for phenotyping
    plant traits are rapidly accumulating. These include plant segmentation and image
    analysis to automate the temporal mapping of plant parameters [51], an image segmentation-oriented
    HTP system for temporal analysis of projected leaf area using distributed learning
    to train the CNN model [52], a leaf-tracking algorithm for motion estimation from
    time-lapse images to compared drought-tolerant and wild-type plants [53], compression
    of very deep CNN for easy in-field deployment that allows pixel-wise segmentation
    of plants into multiple classes [54], a 3D sensing-based stereo-imaging system
    to measure plant stem diameter [55], plant organ-level point cloud segmentation
    [56], and deep multiview image fusion for yield estimation and prediction [57],
    and prescriptive breeding [58,59]. Multimodal data assimilation In many CAS instances,
    sensing involves multiple modalities in which a variety of traits are measured
    and then leveraged to estimate the derived features. The incorporation of multiple
    modalities often adds complexity to the reasoning process, and requires updating
    the single-modality models with multimodal measurements to estimate the CAS state
    variables. Furthermore, these measurements could be performed at different scales
    of environmental conditions and plant physiology that very likely require dealing
    with degraded sensing environments. However, the fusion process needs to be task-driven
    because different cross-modal features could be more informative for different
    decision objectives [60,61]. Hence, robust ML approaches will be necessary for
    feature extraction and fusion of multiscale, multimodal data to update the models.
    The schematic of such a framework is compared to a single modality in Figure 2A.
    One of the earliest applications of sensor fusion in this area can be traced to
    [62] in which plant diseases were detected using a fusion of hyperspectral images
    by Kohonen maps. Several other works [63., 64., 65., 66.] primarily consider sensor
    fusion using IR thermography, chlorophyll fluorescence, hyperspectral imagery,
    light detection and ranging (LiDAR), among others, for several types of plant
    disease detection and vegetation monitoring. One of the earliest scalable multimodal
    open-source frameworks, namely the integrated analysis platform (IAP), handles
    different image sources and organizes phenotypic data by maintaining the metadata
    from the input in the result data [67]. On a smaller field scale, the field scanalyzeri
    gantry system is an advanced three-axis sensor-to-plant phenotyping system designed
    with a rail-based x axis, customizable widths for the y axis, and precise vertical
    movement capability in the z axis, enabling sub-centimeter precision during scheduled
    measurements. A multimodal sensor suite and data analysis pipeline for field phenotyping
    has also been implemented using unpiloted aircraft systems (UAS) [68., 69., 70.,
    71.]. GPhenoVision [72] is another notable multimodal system, comprising a high-clearance
    tractor and sensing and electrical systems, that substantially employs image-segmentation
    and point cloud reconstruction algorithms for deriving multiple phenotypic estimates.
    The modalities of its sensing system include a distributed structure that integrates
    environmental sensors, real-time GPS, and multi-imaging sensors such as RGB-D,
    thermal, and hyperspectral cameras. Similarly, NU-Spidercam [73] was also proposed
    as a large-scale and automated sensing/robotics system that integrates various
    sensor modules for field phenotyping. This system enabled the extraction of time-series
    canopy temperature and spectral induced fluorescence (SIF) traits. Thus, fundamentally,
    CAS is a leap towards realizing large-scale, ultra-precision agriculture and smart
    agriculture that intricately rely on sensing and advanced information processing.
    Modeling and reasoning Upon gathering heterogeneous information from multiple
    CAS sensing units, computational modeling and reasoning frameworks are necessary
    to make optimized farm management or crop breeding decisions. This section highlights
    some of the key aspects of CAS modeling and reasoning strategies. Computational
    modeling of crop systems Crop modeling is a mature field of research that has
    produced several biophysical process-based models for various types of decision
    making. An incomplete list of well-used models includes APSIM [74], DSSAT [75],
    and MLCan [76]. However, in the context of CAS, computational modeling frameworks
    ideally need to include both data-driven and process-based models for reliable
    biophysical characterization of the plants, trait prediction (for instance, yield,
    phenology, stress response), and decision support – in both short(er)-term (production
    application) and longer-term (prescriptive breeding) applications. Although process-based
    models are useful, they suffer from crucial deficiencies necessitating this complementary
    (data + process) strategy for CAS applications. Key deficiencies include (i) incomplete
    knowledge of all the mechanisms impacting the quality of the modeled states, (ii)
    incorporation of latent variables that are often difficult to directly measure
    or are only empirically estimated, making transferability and personalization
    of process models very challenging, (iii) numerical and representational ''brittleness''
    due to mismatch between the length- and time-scales of parameters input to the
    submodels, their calibration with averaged properties, and their subjectivity.
    These deficiencies reduce the utility of any ensuing management decision and limit
    any decision necessarily to a coarse scale. On the other hand, data-driven approaches
    have begun to show promise in various crop modeling applications. For example,
    early works in this field relied on utilizing a single data modality for crop
    yield prediction [77., 78., 79., 80.], disease identification [81], and irrigation
    optimization [82,83]. Even natural language processing and network theory have
    been proposed to compute phenotypic descriptions for novel candidate gene prediction
    [84]. However, with the advent of internet of things (IoT) devices in data collection
    from multiple modalities, decision making has distanced itself from previous single-mode
    ML approaches. For example, the authors of [85] have shown that publicly available
    weather and soil data can be relatively effective in county-level corn yield prediction
    for the US Midwestern region. Similarly, DL models have been developed to integrate
    genotype and environmental variables for crop yield prediction [86., 87., 88.].
    Whereas traditional DL models tend to be ''black box'' (i.e., models without clear
    understanding of the inner workings) in nature, explainable DL models have been
    shown to uncover useful insights about important predictors in yield prediction
    problems [89]. However, purely data-driven models often fail miserably to provide
    meaningful outcomes even slightly outside their training data support. Carefully
    incorporating biophysical knowledge may alleviate such issues while also potentially
    reducing the need for extremely large amounts of data for training. Therefore,
    several ML-based studies have begun to work towards assimilating data from high-throughput
    imaging/sensing platforms to rapidly, precisely, and accurately model plant traits
    at different growth stages, and integrate these data with (incomplete) knowledge
    models to create flexible, hybrid AI representations. For example, a knowledge-guided
    ML model for rice growth simulation has been proposed recently [90]. Similarly,
    coupling of ML and crop modeling was shown to improve crop yield prediction in
    the US Corn Belt [91]. Thus, the availability of hybrid data–biophysics models
    has the potential to transform plot-, field-, and region-level models from ad
    hoc calibration to a more principled CPS approach [92,93]. However, this remains
    a nascent area of research and there is no consensus yet in the community regarding
    the most effective ways to integrate knowledge and ML for modeling crop growth
    and production. Reasoning frameworks for crop management With a computational
    model in place that can simulate crop growth and production under various environmental
    conditions, as well as management inputs, reasoning and decision-making tools
    can leverage that model to generate optimized crop management prescriptions, as
    shown in Figure 2B. There have been several attempts to build such decision-making
    frameworks in the context of CAS. Among various techniques, reinforcement learning
    (RL)-based frameworks for planning and supervisory decision making have emerged
    as a popular choice [94], primarily driven by the popularity of advanced deep
    RL tools in various application sectors. Examples include control crop irrigation
    [95., 96., 97.] and crop yield prediction [98]. The objective of an RL agent is
    to learn a policy for dictating a sequence of optimal actions that maximize the
    cumulative rewards over a particular time horizon [99]. The application of RL
    (specifically deep RL) in CAS is an active research area, especially for engineering
    a proper representation of the environment states, actions, and rewards. Ideally,
    an RL agent should directly interact with the real physical system to arrive at
    an optimal policy, but it typically has a very large sample complexity – it needs
    many iterations of interactions with the underlying system to obtain an optimal
    policy. On top of that, during such a training process, utterly suboptimal actions
    can be taken by the RL agent that may be completely unacceptable for an actual
    crop farm. Therefore, a standard practice is to build reliable simulated environments
    (that can leverage the computational models, as described before) to train RL
    policies, followed by fine-tuning the policies to effectively transfer them from
    simulation to real (Sim2Real) environments. In the RL literature, these simulation
    platforms are referred to as gym environments, and these have also started emerging
    for CAS. For example, CropGym was proposed as a RL environment for crop management
    [95]. Actuation and in-field Intelligence In the CAS setting for crop production,
    actuation refers to the use of mechanical and electrical systems to control and
    automate various processes in farming to optimize agricultural goals [100]. In
    plant breeding and crop improvement, actuation refers to decision making following
    sensing and modeling to decide the outcome of tested varieties – whether it will
    be culled or retained for further testing or release to farmers. Advanced robotic
    actuation in CAS Agricultural robots can be divided into a few categories based
    on their characteristics. According to their working environment, agricultural
    robots are divided into indoor and outdoor robots [101]. Indoor robots are mainly
    utilized in greenhouses and indoor settings, such as for indoor harvesting, flower
    cutting, fruit and vegetable grasping, and greenhouse automation control systems
    [102., 103., 104.]. Outdoor robots such as spraying robots, weeding robots, nursery
    robots, tractors, and fruit-harvesting robots [69,105., 106., 107., 108., 109.],
    on the other hand, are used in large-scale farmland, pasture, and other outdoor
    environments. These include both aerial robots, such as unpiloted aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), and ground robots, such as unpiloted ground vehicles (UGVs), based on
    their operational domain. In addition, they also can be classified into robots
    for seeding, planting, harvesting, weeding, and pesticide application [102,110.,
    111., 112.]. Regarding agricultural management approaches, actuators can be categorized
    into soil management robots, field mapping robots, irrigation management robots,
    harvesting management robots, and weather tracking and forecasting platforms [100,113.,
    114., 115.]. Moreover, from the mechanical point of view, agricultural robots
    have an actuation system as the key component which, depending on their specific
    use, can be one or a combination of electric, piezoelectric, hydraulic, and pneumatic
    systems [116., 117., 118., 119., 120.]. The CAS vision is to have teams of semi-
    or fully autonomous mobile robots that can provide avant-garde actuation options
    to farmers that improve the production efficiency and quality of agricultural
    products [121., 122., 123.]. Such teams can scale from a small group of robots
    or UAVs to a large swarm depending on the scale of operation, the size and capability
    of the platforms, and cost. Technical and digital advances in crop production,
    sensing, and phenotyping include an interest in automating in-field actions using
    robots and drones (e.g., the ''see and spray'' technology) [124]. To execute diverse
    in-field actions, the robot/UAV teams can be composed of homogeneous (i.e., similar
    capability, performing similar tasks) and heterogeneous (i.e., different capability,
    performing different tasks) platforms. To enable autonomous fleets of robots in
    agriculture with minimal human intervention, it is imperative to build scalable
    electrified agricultural systems and use energy optimally. The authors of [125]
    perform a cost analysis considering battery charge and health behavior for autonomous
    electric field tractors. The works presented in [126., 127., 128.] also offer
    valuable insights into power management, life maximization, and battery balancing
    strategies related to agricultural applications. However, further research in
    this area will be necessary to realize the potential of electrification in promoting
    sustainable agriculture, including power optimization in scalable and connected
    electric-powered agriculture. For instance, although teams of mobile robots equipped
    with plant manipulation systems could help to alleviate the acute labor shortage
    in agriculture [129], it is also crucial to consider optimizing the power management
    of this robot network for sustained, autonomous operation. In-field intelligence
    ML has greatly enhanced the capabilities of agriculture robots of all categories,
    particularly those designed for sensing and actuation. These intelligent robots
    range from small robots in greenhouses to UAVs and tractors in the outside field,
    which are equipped with ML algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data collected
    by sensors/cameras to identify agricultural data patterns and make decisions.
    For instance, UAVs equipped with high-resolution cameras and sensors can be used
    to monitor crop health and growth patterns, and identify any potential issues
    such as pests, diseases, or irrigation problems [22,130., 131., 132.]. Recently,
    the use of ML algorithms with multiple connected drones in agriculture has enhanced
    field mapping, thus providing a more comprehensive view of the farmland, which
    leads to improving the land management practices [133,134]. Similarly, automatic
    navigation of tractors using machine vision algorithms (e.g., object detection,
    segmentation) enhances accuracy by mapping the crop lines and navigation routes
    in real time to improve efficiency in agriculture operations [135., 136., 137.].
    A key challenge in enabling envisaged CPS for large-scale row-crops is long-duration
    reliable autonomy in harsh and changing field environments at low cost. One way
    to achieve this is to use intelligent software that makes the most out of cheaper
    sensors. For example, low-cost LiDARs with inertial sensors and encoders could
    enable robust row-following [138,139], and vision sensors can be used to replace
    LiDAR sensors which are comparatively more expensive [140]. However, it is relatively
    challenging to reduce the cost and effort required for programming robot tasks
    while still reaching high accuracy in the perception process to avoid wrong actions
    in the field. In addition, an active area of work includes automatic detection
    of traversable regions through improved robot mission programming [141., 142.,
    143., 144., 145.]. Such intelligent coordination of agricultural robot teams enables
    mechanical tasks such as weed removal using planning algorithms [146., 147., 148.],
    speeding of route schedules on the aisles for complex tasks such as harvesting
    in vineyards and pruning trees in orchards [105], and dexterity for tasks such
    as harvesting and grasping. These tasks require actuation components such as drive
    systems, controllers, robotic arms, end-effectors, and environmental perception
    components such as radar and cameras with DL-based detection algorithms [149.,
    150., 151., 152., 153.]. Figure 2C showcases that agricultural robots need to
    be dexterous (to achieve human level performance) but must be able to scale up
    to millions of acres of farming. This means that plant manipulation needs to be
    robust, reliable, and fast. This is, of course, highly challenging owing to clutter,
    occlusion, and the soft nature of fruits and other plant organs. Adding to this
    is the challenge that the robots must be cost-effective, precluding the use of
    expensive industrial rigid arms and expensive sensors. There is considerable promise
    in soft-robots [154], but the underlying control and sensing challenges require
    further work. Digital twins Building on the three technical modules of a CAS,
    as described above, the concept of agricultural DT has recently started to emerge.
    The notion of a DT brings together the sensing, modeling, control, and actuation
    aspects of the CPS under a single conceptual umbrella. DTs have found extensive
    utility in engineered systems [155,156] as well as in logistics and supply chains
    [157]. Plant sciences and agriculture are ripe for the development and deployment
    of DTs across the spectrum of applications from basic research [158] to breeding
    [159] to precision agriculture [160,161] to policy [162]. The basic idea of a
    DT in agriculture is a data and software framework that serves as a digital replica
    of the agricultural physical system [163]. That is, the DT mirrors the behavior
    of the physical object over its lifetime. This includes mimicking the physiological
    state, growth, and development of a plant (in case of a plant DT), or of a field
    (in case of a field DT), as illustrated in Figure 3A. Building the DT starts with
    identifying the states that are most important, the measurements that are being
    made, and the management decisions (formally, control inputs). We note that the
    definition of DTs (i.e., their digital states) will be highly context-specific,
    and depend on the key properties of interest and the associated rewards. Download

    (D) Conceptual illustration of a CAS with a team of robots working together to
    maximize productivity and profitability by using fundamentally more sustainable
    actuation options, including see-and-spray, mechanical weeding, and cover-crop
    planting. Reliable data travel and networking solutions are a key enabler of such
    a vision. As discussed earlier, crop models play a crucial role in understanding
    plant physiology, growth, development, and management. However, it is useful to
    distinguish between such agricultural simulators (or crop models) and a DT [158].
    A primary difference is that a DT must – by definition – be able to update its
    digital state continuously (or periodically) using measurements made on its physical
    counterpart. This includes both physical state measurements (phenotyping, physiological
    measurements, etc.) as well as environmental measurements (soil, weather, and
    management) that impact on its state. In addition, the DT (in its various formulations)
    provides a principled approach to account for known dynamics (as encoded in a
    crop model) with unknown dynamics (as encoded in physical measurements). This
    is especially important in biological DT because no complete first-principle models
    exist (unlike engineered systems where models can completely describe behavior
    with no tunable parameters). Finally, a desirable property of a DT is its ability
    to be transferable to different scenarios. This is particularly useful to evaluate
    various what-if scenarios to identify the best control action. Another exciting
    technological option for CAS and DT is augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
    (VR) which were earlier proposed for precision farming [164]. AR and VR can play
    an important role in sensing, reasoning, and future actuation applications via
    remote robotic manipulation. Utilization of AR and VR allows researchers and (in
    future) farmers to conduct various experiments and operations (e.g., remote scouting,
    as illustrated in Figure 3B) with significantly less effort. For example, through
    VR simulations, researchers can gain insights into how robots navigate, interact
    with crops, and execute specific tasks, thus facilitating the identification of
    potential improvements and optimizations in their behavior. Furthermore, virtual
    experiment runs using VR allow researchers to collect valuable data on robot performance,
    thereby enabling them to refine algorithms, adjust parameters, and enhance the
    overall efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural robots before deploying them
    in real-world scenarios. DT concepts have recently been used in a variety of contexts
    in agriculture. They have been used across species, with applications to row crops,
    orchards, viticulture, gardens, and horticulture. DTs can also be defined, constructed,
    and deployed at different length scales, and recent studies have been performed
    at the organ, plant, field, and farm/greenhouse scales [165., 166., 167.]. Finally,
    DTs can be deployed for a variety of end-goals ranging from monitoring and real-time
    diagnosis to maximizing yield and/or profitability [161,168., 169., 170.], breeding
    decision support, and autonomous field operations. The next goal for research
    in DT would be to successfully create an ''intelligent digital twin'' (IDT) [168],
    which means a DT that can self-learn and decide what is best for the farm. ML
    methods can be used for adding intelligence to DT, as discussed in [168]. A few
    more studies have explored IDT, mostly utilizing generative models as the basis
    of DTs [171,172]. These intelligent twins can self-learn with different levels
    of data integration. Therefore, the integration of ML and large-scale sensing
    with autonomous systems provides significant opportunities to build DT for CASs.
    Cyberinfrastructure Although sensing, modeling, and actuation are the technical
    pillars of a CPS, scalable and robust CI is a key enabler of such a framework.
    In this section we discuss some of the major components of CAS CI. Data management
    Data management in a CI framework substantially differs from traditional data
    representations that are not suitable for large-scale, real-time analysis, visualization,
    and information dissemination for complex dynamic phenomena. By contrast, CAS
    platforms need to offer access to suitable software and hardware that can handle
    various data types and scale computations. This entails having access to a shared
    data storage system that can efficiently and securely transfer large datasets,
    connections to the proper computational hardware such as high-memory computers
    and virtual machines for analysis, the ability to label and retrieve data using
    descriptive metadata, and identity management systems for secure data sharing
    with reliable entities [173]. Hence, with rapid development of sensor networks,
    IoT systems, hardware-accelerated graphic cards, and computer vision, CI data
    are distributed in cyberspace [174]. These sensor observation data are multivariate,
    space/time-sensitive, and are found in different types, formats, dimensions, sources,
    and structures [175]. In distributed CAS, different observation sites or nodes
    sense/observe different sets of variables, mostly collected at different frequencies,
    resulting in streaming of heterogeneous data. Such data require complex data structures
    for storing, representation, and management techniques involving cloud computing
    infrastructure. In CAS, the IoT is a vital component because it involves the deployment
    of IoT devices such as Raspberry Pi cameras, irrigation sensors, and geographic
    information systems (GISs) in farms to gather data from the fields. These data
    are then transmitted to the server (computer unit) for further processing and
    analysis. With a distributed framework, these sensing units hierarchically operate
    at the edge, fog computing, and cloud layers. The data feed is ideally scheduled
    such that historical field data serve as input iteratively for informed and improved
    decision making. In addition, there is the option of smart warehousing, which
    makes use of these data to improve post-harvest storage and enable big data-enabled
    warehousing. This assists farmers in making decisions about how much produce to
    store and sell [176]. Some instances of data management systems and CI-enabled
    consortiums are iRODS [177], IBPii, NEVPiii, and SERNECiv [173,178,179] that assist
    with data analysis and sharing. Computing Li et al. [174] highlight the difficulties
    involved in managing multivariate data collected across modalities from a distributed
    sensor network, which is commonly observed in CAS. The study suggests that, to
    address those challenges and improve online interactive visual analysis, conventional
    data integration methods must be revamped to support more efficient, scalable,
    and collaborative visual analysis. Hence, multimodal data fusion that has already
    proved to be very efficient in improving accuracy and robustness by combining
    learning over multiple modalities is integral to computing in a CI [180,181].
    For computational efficiency, it is imperative to learn from a compressed representative
    set of the overall sensor data that can also be converted to human-interpretable
    actionable insights. These computations are generally scheduled and performed
    in a central computing unit or in distributed units that are connected to the
    cloud [182,183]. These computations make decisions based on area-specific knowledge
    as well as business intelligence. As a result, CAS can also function as a decision
    support system (DSS) for users (e.g., farmers). The decisions made can be sent
    to the end-users through WiFi-enabled smartphones or computers that act as an
    interface to enable the user to control all the activities taking place in the
    field from their computer or smartphone; it therefore enables a service platform
    for the end-user [176]. Edge, fog, and cloud computing Despite the advantages
    of IoT, it is challenging to transmit a large amount of sensory data from agricultural
    fields to the back-end servers, whether they are in the cloud or in data centers.
    Such communication requires significant energy, causes delays in communication,
    and generates substantial network traffic. For example, reliable communication
    between coordinated robots in an intelligent system is crucial; however, low-range
    (LoRa) high-bandwidth wireless connectivity (in the 2.5–5 GHz range) and larger
    power-demand make it challenging. Figure 3D depicts an example CPS where multiple
    robots work together through reliable communication to enable fundamentally more
    sustainable actuation for agriculture. There are multiple technology options for
    communication, such as 5G and MIoTy [184]. However, in many rural areas, broadband
    technologies such as 5G may not be available. LoRA communication and other low-bandwidth
    options could help, but significant edge computing is required so that only essential
    messages need to be exchanged [185]. Another challenge here is in creating reliable
    predictive models and keeping their prediction on track using feedback-like mechanisms
    [186]. Edge computing refers to the process of locally storing and processing
    data near end devices or users [187,188]. This reduces the energy consumption
    and communication delay required to transmit the collected data. Recent advances
    in compression/decompression methods using ML models have further helped to decrease
    the data size at edge/local devices [189., 190., 191., 192.]. However, edge devices
    (e.g., sensors) have limited resources and cannot efficiently execute DL. To address
    this, a recent approach has been proposed that utilizes efficient online computation
    offloading through deep RL for extensive mobile edge computing [193]. To address
    the computing limitation of edge devices, an edge–fog architecture is introduced
    to process IoT data in an efficient way while avoiding the communication delay
    that occurs in cloud computing [194]. As argued in [195], the three layers (edge,
    fog, and cloud) architecture in smart agriculture, as shown in Figure 3C, would
    reduce energy consumption, network traffic, and communication delay. Moreover,
    a state-of-the-art survey on fog computing for IoT was proposed in [196]. Fog
    devices (e.g., laptops or low- end computing machines) are usually equipped with
    more resources than edge devices, and are mostly located at closer communication
    distance than the cloud. DL with light configuration (few layers and neurons)
    may be executed efficiently in the fog. Specifically, energy-aware fog-based frameworks
    were recently studied for mobile crowdsensing, where farmers use smartphones to
    supply high-quality information [197,198]. However, edge computing is not a replacement
    for the cloud, and thus the cloud services are still preferable for performing
    heavy computational tasks in IoT-based farming; for instance, big data analysis
    and execution of resource-intensive DL models (e.g., ResNet [199]) for real-time
    crop monitoring. Data travel and networking The objective of any CPS is to connect
    embedded systems with the help of worldwide networks and to enable communication
    as well as back-coupling between the digital and the physical worlds [200]. Ideally,
    a CPS comprises several interconnected layers that facilitate secure data travel
    (between the end users and the cloud) from the physical layer to the IoT layer.
    The data captured in the IoT layer is moved to the cyber layer, which is enabled
    with a DT that allows the experts to study system behavior virtually and observe
    the analytical outcomes by iteratively predicting, modeling, analyzing, and actuating
    on the cyber platform [201]. The cyber layer connects the edge tier to the data
    analytics platform tier, followed by the enterprise layer that accounts for business
    intelligence and decision making. Finally, the cloud tier stores and handles the
    big data and connects to the application tier forming the service platform for
    the farmers/stakeholders [176]. However, this data travel requires a cybersecurity
    strategy to guarantee that sensitive information is only accessed by authenticated
    entities [202,203]. In addition, meeting the time requirements for such data transfer
    between and within the layers is extremely crucial [200]. Hence, the identification
    and tracking technologies, and the networking and communication technologies,
    play a key role in making the whole integration functional. The most common identification
    and tracking technologies include radio-frequency identification devices (RFIDs)
    and intelligent sensors [204]. For interconnecting the sensors and actuators,
    the prevalent wireless network protocols used in CPS typically include Bluetooth,
    WirelessHART, ZigBee, and WiFi [203]. With a goal to provide internet access to
    rural areas, existing solutions utilize either short-range technologies (e.g.,
    WiFi, and Bluetooth) or long-range solutions (e.g., 3G/4G/5G, WiMax, LTE/LTE-A)
    or a combination thereof. The long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) has recently
    been suggested as a solution to meet the needs of providing connectivity in agricultural
    environments owing to its scalable network architecture and straightforward access
    method, thus enabling long-range communication with low energy consumption [205].
    Although LoRaWAN provides promising applications in the agricultural domain, it’s
    very limited data rates prohibit the adoption of many broadband solutions in a
    rural context. As an example, transferring large hyperspectral images collected
    by a drone would be infeasible with a low data rate technology such as LoRaWAN
    [206,207]. Concluding remarks and future perspectives Bringing CPS concepts to
    agriculture, both for crop breeding and production, has enormous potential to
    enhance productivity, profitability, and resiliency while lowering the environmental
    footprint. This review article presents the current state of CAS development as
    well as the trends of innovation that will determine the near and distant future
    of CAS. CAS tools are at various levels of technology readiness and market adoption.
    Given the enormous uncertainties stemming from many confounding factors such as
    disruptive innovations (e.g., generative AI), manufacturing and supply chain issues,
    market economy, labor market situation, and environmental regulations, it is difficult
    to forecast precise future trends and timelines. However, we provide a broad discussion
    here based on our views and understanding (also see Outstanding questions). We
    summarize the main takeaways from the paper in Box 1 and suggest some best practices
    for future research in Box 2. Box 1 Key take-away points for practitioners CAS
    tools are at various levels of technology readiness. For example, many high- throughput
    phenotyping tools are available and deployable today; AI-driven farm management
    decision support tools will also be starting to roll out soon. However, fully
    autonomous robots running a farm may not become a reality immediately. Designing
    a specific CAS framework, such as an appropriate choice of platform – drones,
    ground robots, traditional machinery, or static sensors – depends on the objective
    (e.g., stress identification and mitigation, or yield estimation), scale of application,
    cost, and resource availability. A scalable cyberinfrastructure solution that
    is the backbone of a CAS should range from edge to fog to cloud computing. Advanced
    wireless communication technology is another key enabler of a CAS, and improving
    rural connectivity will act as a catalyst for accelerated development and deployment
    of CAS technologies in farms. Remark: despite excellent progress in the area of
    CAS research over the past few years, significant effort will still be required
    for a transition of many of these tools into practice. Although some CAS tools
    will be more readily adopted by the farming and research community, other aspects
    will need a more drastic overhaul of the system, and hence may take longer for
    market penetration. Different parts of the world may also see different trajectories
    for adoption, depending on various factors such as economic status, labor market
    situation, and environmental regulations. Therefore, it is imperative for CAS
    researchers to continuously consider any adoption issues alongside the challenges
    and advances of science, engineering, and technology. Box 2 Best practices for
    using CAS tools Multimodal, multiscale (spatial and spectral) data collection
    is crucial for greater effectiveness of CAS tools. Hybrid modeling approaches
    that can seamlessly combine process models and data-driven models are more robust
    for in-field applications. A scale-agnostic approach to actuation using collaborative
    teams of (autonomous) heterogeneous platforms will be a more sustainable solution
    for future agriculture with a low entry barrier. Leveraging advanced data warehousing
    and machine learning operations (MLOps) to manage data and generate insights is
    an important design choice that streamlines the development, deployment, and maintenance
    of CAS tools. In the context of CAS sensing tools, many high-throughput phenotyping
    tools are available and deployable today. Although the commercially available
    tools primarily enable extraction of relatively simpler traits (e.g., plant height,
    canopy volume, detection and counting of fruits, and estimation of yield), capabilities
    to extract more complex traits (e.g., identification, classification, and quantification
    of biotic and abiotic stresses, pests) will also be starting to roll out soon.
    Research and development in this area can specifically benefit from data sharing
    and open innovations. Although the CAS community has made many datasets publicly
    available as benchmarks, data sharing needs to be further incentivized to trigger
    widespread open innovation. Widely collected citizen science data can also be
    extremely useful in this regard [208]. Data annotation (especially by experts)
    is still a major bottleneck to train ML models in this regard. However, the rise
    of foundation models in ML is helping to address this issue at least partially
    [209]. AI-driven farm management decision support tools are next in line to be
    deployed commercially. Within the next 5–10 years, breeders and producers should
    have many technology options to turn their data into decisions using CAS modeling
    and reasoning tools for making optimal choices in choosing seeds, deciding planting
    dates, farm management (e.g., irrigation, applying fertilizers and pesticides)
    and scheduling harvest. In many cases, these products may be available as ''software
    as service'', thus lowering the barrier to adoption by the farming community.
    However, the cost of sensing infrastructure and data privacy are common bottlenecks
    in this regard. Although ''economy of scale'' can alleviate the cost issue in
    future, the research community and the AgTech industry need to engage with the
    farming community extensively to raise awareness about CAS capabilities for technology
    adoption. In terms of actuation, design modification and retrofitting of large
    equipment (e.g., autonomous tractors) for increased levels of automation have
    already been commercialized. However, the vision of fleets of autonomous robots
    and drones running a farm with little human supervision may not become a reality
    immediately. Although there have been several successful proof-of-concept demonstrations
    of autonomous field robots performing several tasks such as planting, chemical
    spraying, and harvesting, fine manipulation and individual plant-level actuation
    remain challenging. In addition, the technology needs to be hardened further to
    handle the harsh agricultural environment. Apart from the technical issues, various
    social (e.g., uncertainty about the future of work and employment), legal (e.g.,
    regulation, liability, certification), and economic (e.g., manufacturing cost)
    issues also remain in this regard. However, these problems can be very different
    in different parts of the world depending on the scale of farming, the type of
    crops, climate, communication infrastructure, economy, and cost of labor. Finally,
    deployment of CPS tools at scale relies heavily on communication and computation
    infrastructure. However, high-quality broadband connectivity may still not be
    available in many rural areas, and this poses a significant challenge in deploying
    advanced CAS solutions in rural agriculture. Hence, the CAS research community
    has been focusing on developing edge computing solutions to reduce the need for
    extensive communication. With recent advances in both hardware and software for
    edge computing, hybrid edge–cloud solutions are becoming increasingly feasible
    and cost-effective for deploying CAS solutions. Outstanding questions How can
    we ensure a high degree of reliability of a CAS ''in the wild'' that would guarantee
    performance under environmental uncertainties, system faults, and natural edge
    cases? How can we build and maintain reliable 4D (3D + time) in-field (as opposed
    to controlled environment) DT models from plant to plot to field scale? How can
    we achieve the ''economy of scale'' for advanced CAS sensing and actuation solutions
    (i.e., to enable widespread adoption and reduce costs as well as barriers to entry)?
    How can we build fully autonomous (i.e., level 5 autonomy which does not require
    human attention) platforms for CAS operations? Acknowledgments This work was supported

    Article Open access 13 August 2022 1 Introduction Farming is concerned with a
    variety of choices as well as uncertainties. Owing to the variation of weather
    from season to season, fluctuation in the farming materials prices, soil degradations,
    unviable crops, suffocation of crops by weeds, pests damaging the crops, and changing
    of climates, the farmers are required to cope with these uncertainties. Moreover,
    with the advancement of technology in this digital world, the human-beings have
    extended their thinking process limits and have been actively trying to combine
    normal-brain with an artificial one leading to the new area of “artificial intelligence
    (AI)” by an intelligent-machine can be built. Therefore, the application of AI
    becomes vast in agriculture in view of the management of soils, crops, diseases
    and pests-control. With the global population growth, it becomes imperative to
    review the agricultural activities with the aim of extending innovative approaches
    for the sustainability and improvement of agricultural practices. In agricultural
    sectors, the introduction of AI will be enabled by technological advancements
    such as “big data analytics, internet of things, robotics, utilization of sensors
    and cameras, and drone-technology”, etc. Moreover, the AI systems help in providing
    predictive insights for agricultural activities like plantation and harvesting
    information by analyzing soil-management data-sources such as weather, temperature,
    analysis of soils, moistures, and crop performance history, and thus, improving
    the crop-yields by decreasing water uses, fertilizers as well as pesticides. With
    the application of AI technologies in agriculture, a considerable reduction of
    the impacts on natural-ecosystems and workers-safety can be achieved, which will
    further keep decreased food-prices and augmented food-production rates with the
    increasing population. By examining data sources related to soil management, AI
    helps to provide predictive insights for agricultural operations such as \"plantation-
    and harvesting-information\" (Spanaki et al. 2021). These data sources include
    historical crop performance data, soil and moisture studies, and temperature and
    meteorological data. As a consequence, it is possible to boost agricultural yields
    while lowering the usage of pesticides, fertilizer, and water. The negative effects
    on natural ecosystems and the safety of agricultural workers might be significantly
    reduced as a result of the expanded usage of AI technology in agriculture. This
    will help maintain lower food costs and more food production, which will help
    feed the world''s expanding population. Since the beginning of time, there has
    been interest in the topic of AI (Spanaki et al. 2021, 2022a, 2022b), and it has
    been envisioned as a smart-machine superiority that would rule the world and perform
    the menial, everyday duties (Yigitcanlar et al. 2020). AI has become a key component
    of many firms'' business strategies due to its significant advantages and better
    performance (Burström et al. 2021). This is because AI has developed into a strategic
    system that can be used in various sectors. Numerous conceptual and empirical
    investigations have been conducted recently, and in many cases, the use of AI
    by national and international governments has been shown from both the academic
    and professional viewpoints (Mustak et al. 2021). Numerous conceptual and empirical
    researches have also been carried out. Several opportunities have been created
    by AI in a number of industries, including healthcare, agriculture, industry,
    and the environment (Kumar et al. 2021a, 2021b). The majority of emerging nations
    are making the switch from subsistence to commercial agriculture, according to
    Mukherjee and Maity (2015). As a result, these nations'' agriculture is making
    extensive use of AI, IoT, and other information and communication-based technologies.
    Consequently, India is also seeing the same trend. In India, agriculture must
    contend with problems such uneven weather conditions, low productivity, infestations
    of insects and diseases, unstable market prices, inadequate infrastructure, and
    slow agricultural growth (Anirban et al. 2018; Mukherjee and Maity 2015). Although
    major farmer clusters have changed into a more competitive environment as a result
    of advances in AI technology, marginal and small farmers still face difficulties
    in adopting these new technologies, necessitating studies on AI implementation-related
    issues in Indian agriculture and related sectors. Additionally, AI is advancing
    into the digital era and rapidly replacing intellectual resources as a driver
    of growth in the economy (Anirban et al. 2018; Lee and Trimi 2018). However, the
    outbreak of COVID-19 in the late 2019 has posed a serious-threat all around the
    world. As the infections are rising at a rapid rate, the initiations taken by
    many governments throughout the world include severe lock-downs, curfews, social-distancing,
    and the options of working from home in order to reduce the spreading rate of
    the virus. Moreover, every attempt is being made for ensuring help to victims
    and to stop the spreads. Almost every sector is getting in troubles due to this
    pandemic outbreak including the labour-intensive agricultural sectors in India.
    The farmers are facing a larger crisis of their agricultural outputs and so the
    economy level also getting down. As this has been addressed as one of the severe
    issue in most of the agricultural sectors, technology-empowered solutions can
    be a better and efficient deal with such crisis. Although, AI has not completely
    evolved in overcoming a pandemic, but as compared to previous pandemics, a noticeably
    higher role of AI exists during COVID-19, and it can be used appropriately as
    a tool to complement the human intelligence in various sectors including the agriculture.
    As most AI systems are based on internet that restricts and reduces their usage
    in rural areas of India. Moreover, the farming community in the rural areas in
    India is mostly illiterate about the use of computers and internet facilities
    (Mishra and Satapathy 2020). Thus, the government needs to support farmers through
    web-service enabling devices design with lesser tariff for working with the AI
    systems and adequate training. Although, there has been some remarkable improvement
    by the use of AI in the agricultural sectors, but it has still a lesser impact
    on the agricultural activities in view of its impacts as well as potentials in
    other sectors. Moreover, the application of AI can result in a significant benefit
    in the Indian agricultural sectors not only during this pandemic COVID-19 outbreak
    period, but also in a long-term basis that needs to be addressed and initiated
    in order to improve the agricultural activities. The present study aimed at identifying
    the benefits and the challenges in the implementation of AI in the Indian agricultural
    sectors, such that due consideration can be given for the adoption of possible
    mitigation measures by the government and competent authorities. The “Research
    Questions (RQs)” for the present study can be stated as: RQ1: What are AI and
    its role in Indian agriculture in post-covid era? RQ2: What are the major hindrances/challenges/factors/barriers
    faced by Indian agricultural farm sector in post-covid era? RQ3: How to visualize
    the challenges with respect to the problem and the appropriate solutions? Thus,
    based on the RQs, the main objectives of this work included: a) identification
    of the benefits and the awareness among the Indian farmers about the use of AI
    in agriculture with regard to the present pandemic situation; b) identification
    of the significant challenges associated with the implementation of AI in agriculture;
    and c) development and analysis of suitable model based on the interrelations
    among the challenging parameters involved. In order to achieve the objectives
    and answer the RQs of the intended research, this work was organized in the following
    manner: Sect. 1 illustrating the introduction to the theme of work and discussing
    the related literatures including “Innovative technology applications in agriculture;
    AI during pandemic COVID-19; and AI in agriculture during COVID-19 and its’ implementation
    challenges”. Section 2 described the detailed research methodology used comprising
    of “Study population; Design of questionnaires and collection of data; and Interpretive
    Structural Modelling (ISM) and ISM model-generation”. Section 3 summarized the
    “results”, followed by “discussion” in Sect. 4. The Sect. 5 highlighted the “managerial
    implications” which was followed with the final ‘Sect. 6’ with “conclusion and
    future scope” of the complete work. 1.1 Literature review 1.1.1 Innovative technology
    applications in agriculture Sustainable economy largely relies on agriculture
    (Kekane 2013), which plays a vital role for long-term economic-development as
    well as structural-transformation (Mogili and Deepak 2018; Shah et al. 2019).
    In the past, most of the agricultural activities were limited to production of
    crops and foods (Fan et al. 2012). However, in the last two decades, the agriculture
    has been involved in production, processing, marketing in addition to distributing
    of crops and livestock products. At present, it serves as the basic source of
    livelihood and the subsequent improvement of GDP (Oyakhilomen and Zibah 2014),
    which not only act as national trade source, but also help to reduce the unemployment,
    provide raw-materials for other industrial production activities, and thus develop
    the overall economy levels (Awokuse 2009; Badiene 2008; Block and Timmer 1994).
    An integral part of agriculture is soil management and the knowledge of various
    types of soils and conditions ensure in enhancement of crop-yield as well as conservation
    of soil-resources. Through soil management the effects of soil-borne pathogens
    can be controlled in the production of vegetables and other edible crops (Abawi
    and Widmer 2000). The AI-based soil management-technique, such as “Management-oriented
    modelling (MOM)” that consist of a set of generated plausible-management alternatives
    help in minimizing the nitrate-leaching. It contains a simulator for evaluating
    each alternative, and an evaluator for determining the user-weighted multiple-criteria
    alternative (Li and Yost 2000). A remote sensing device embedded in a “higher-order
    neural-network (HONN)” was found suitable for the characterization and estimation
    of the soil-moisture dynamics (Elshorbagy and Parasuraman 2008). An “artificial
    neural network (ANN)” model help in predicting soil-textures (clay, sand and silt
    contents) on the basis of the attributes from existing coarse-resolution soil-maps
    that are combined with hydrographical-parameters derived from a “digital elevation-model
    (DEM)” (Zhao et al. 2009). The crop management commences with sowing and monitoring
    of growth, harvesting & storage of crops in addition to distribution. An agricultural
    management system such as “precision crop management (PCM)” is designed to focus
    on crops and soil-inputs in accordance with the field requirements for the optimization
    of profitability and protection of environment. The lack of timely as well as
    distributed-information on crops and soil-conditions has been reported of hampering
    PCM (Moran et al. 1997). In order to cope with water deficits that result from
    soils, weather or limited-irrigation, the farmers need to combine various strategies
    of crop management. The important features to be chosen among cropping alternatives
    in flexible crop management systems that are based on decision-rules include proper-timing,
    intensity as well as drought predictability (Debaeke and Aboudrare 2004). Weed
    causes a consistent reduction of the farmers’ expected yields and profits (Harker
    2001). An un-controlled weed infestation results in half yield reduction for corn
    crops and dried beans (Harker 2001), and about 48% loss in wheat-yield (Fahad
    et al. 2015; Khan and Haq 2002). A “global positioning-system (GPS)” controlled
    patch-spraying based on AI approach can be used for weed control in maize, sugar-beet,
    winter-wheat, and winter-barley, respectively (Gerhards and Christensen 2003).
    A drone travelled at a speed of 1.2 km per hour has been successfully used in
    weed control (Granados 2011). There is a need for the application of AI approaches
    for disease-control as well as its’ management. For live interactions, a “text
    to speech (TTS)” converter has been used to provide capability of text to talking
    user interface that provided highly effective interactive user-interface on web
    (Kolhe et al. 2011). For the detection of diseases and providing treatment suggestions,
    a rule-based and forward-chaining inference-engine has been used (Munirah et al.
    2013). The prediction of suitable crop can be achieved by sensing of various parameters
    related to soil and the atmosphere like soil-type, PH, phosphate, nitrogen, potassium,
    calcium, organic-carbon, sulphur, magnesium, copper, manganese, depth, iron, humidity,
    rainfall, and temperature (Snehal and Sandeep 2014). Usually, the crops are organized
    in rows and thus, the use of a crop row-detection algorithm helps in separating
    properly the weeds and crops pixels (Ortiz et al. 2016), which can be utilized
    by an “unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)” for an effective weed control. Since crops
    are usually organized in rows, the use of a crop row detection algorithm helps
    to separate properly weed and crop pixels, which is a common handicap given the
    spectral similitude of both (Ortiz et al. 2016). 1.1.2 AI during the pandemic
    COVID-19 AI is getting an increasingly demand with the technological advancements
    for doing the complicated tasks more rapidly as well as efficiently, and at a
    lower-cost to solve complex problems. Moreover, AI in healthcare has been found
    to be advantageous over the traditional clinical and analytics decision-making
    practices. Even before the emergence of coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, there
    has been contribution of AI in new drug-discovery (Coldeway 2019; Fleming 2018;
    Segler et al. 2018; Smith 2018). In addition to the official-data, AI ensures
    in gathering information in multiple-languages across the world from news-outlets,
    healthcare-reports, forums, social-media posts, travel-data, and others by the
    use of “natural language processing (NLP)” techniques and standardizing their
    priority. A variety of data including the case history of patients, geographical-events,
    and social-media posts have been processed at rapid-rate regarding a recent pneumonia,
    with a higher performance-computing for the prediction of a possible pandemic-outbreak
    (Hamet and Tremblay 2017; Wallis 2019). During the coronavirus crisis, the application
    of innovative-technology based on AI can be a better solution (Reddy et al. 2019).
    AI has been used to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, such as it was used as
    an early outbreak warning-system that spotted COVID-19 before 9 days of the alerting-statement
    by the WHO about the novel coronavirus emergence to the peoples (Niiler 2020).
    Naudé (2020) has discussed regarding the key areas for the contribution of AI
    in order to the fight-against COVID-19. It was further concluded that the use
    of AI has been hampered by a lack-of-data as well as by too-much-data, and in
    order to overcome such constraints, there has been a requirement of careful-balance
    between data-privacy and public-health, and rigorous-interaction between human
    & AI. In addition to the potentiality of tracking and prediction of the spreading
    of COVID-19, for the disease diagnosis as well as prognosis also AI can be used.
    In fact, an accurate and faster diagnosis of COVID-19 will not only help in saving
    lives, but also will limit the disease spreading, and in generating data in order
    to train AI-models. By the use of chest radiography images, there has been an
    increasing effort to train AI-models for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In a recent
    study on AI applications against COVID-19, Bullock et al. (2020) have suggested
    AI to be accurate as humans that can save-time of radiologists, in addition to
    performing of diagnosis at faster as well as cheaper in comparison to the standard-tests
    for COVID-19. Further, AI has the potentiality of making contribution in fighting
    against COVID-19 by identifying possible vaccines as well as treatments. Moreover,
    AI has been found to be useful in social-control for managing the COVID-19 pandemic
    by the use of thermal-imaging to scan the public-spaces for infectious people,
    and by enforcement of social-distancing as well as lockdown-measures (Chun 2020;
    Rivas 2020). With the use of advanced designing-software along with digital manufacturing-technologies
    like 3D-printing for printing of the required medical-parts are carried out (Haleem
    et al. 2019; Ruan et al. 2020). Moreover, at present the “Industry 4.0” technologies
    taking the real-time information that are provided by AI, IoT and other digital
    technologies, have the capability to provide better digital-solutions for our
    daily-lives during the crisis of pandemic COVID-19 (Ahmed et al. 2020). Javaid
    et al. (2020) have summarized various benefits of “Industry 4.0” technologies
    as: helpful to plan COVID-19 related activities, providing of better experience
    without any kind of risks enforcement to health-care and other workers, active
    engagement to manufacture precautionary-item related to the virus, providing medical-parts
    in time by the use of smart supply-chain, utilization of robotic-based treatment
    of the infected patients for reducing the risks to doctors, use virtual-reality
    for the purpose of training, promoting of a flexible work-environment of treatment,
    helping peoples in performing their daily life works during the lockdown periods,
    providing a wide range of innovations with the help of advanced manufacturing
    as well as digital technology, useful to researchers for employing these technologies
    for social as well as media platforms for the identification of unusual-information,
    utilization for better risk-assessments and global public-health emergencies of
    the coronavirus (Ren et al. 2020). Panpatte (2018) has suggested that AI enables
    to assemble larger amount of data from public-websites as well as from the government,
    and then, analyzes & provides solutions to farmers for a diverse range of ambiguous-issues.
    Moreover, it provides a smarter irrigation way resulting in higher-yield to the
    farmers. There has been a remarkable-transformation in many of the industrial
    sectors across the globe with the advancement of technology (Kakkad et al. 2019).
    In order to modify the environment around us, AI has begun to play a major role
    in daily-lives with the extension of our perceptions as well as abilities (Gandhi
    et al. 2020; Kundalia et al. 2020). 1.1.3 AI in agriculture during COVID-19 and
    its’ implementation challenges An intelligent system’s major attribute is considered
    to be its’ ability in executing required tasks in a very short-time with accuracy.
    Most of the systems fail in achieving the required accuracy or response-time or
    both. However, the selection of task strategy for users gets affected by system-delay
    and the selection of strategy is usually hypothesized to be based on a cost-function
    that combines the factors such as: the required efforts in synchronizing the availability
    of input-system, and the accuracy-level afforded. Normally, people looking for
    minimum efforts and maximum accuracy-level tend to choose among three-strategies:
    automatic-performance, rapidity, and monitoring (Teal and Rudnicky 1992). The
    volume of input data influences the strength of an intelligent system. An immense
    volume of data is required to be monitored by a real-time AI system that needs
    to filter-out much of the incoming data. However, to significant or unexpected
    events, it should remain responsive (Washington and Roth 1989). In order to improve
    the speed and accuracy of systems, only very relevant-data should be used with
    an in-depth knowledge of the task of the system. For developing an agricultural
    intelligent system, combined efforts of agriculture specialists from various fields
    are required along with the cooperation of the farmers (Rajotte et al. 1992).
    For agricultural management, the emerging expert or intelligent systems have been
    useful tools in providing integrated, area-specific, and interpreted guidance.
    However, as the development of these intelligent systems is fairly recent for
    agriculture, the use of these systems in commercial-agriculture is limited (Rajotte
    et al. 1992). In a study a discussion has been made on various application of
    thermal-imaging like “Pre-harvest operations, Field-nursery, Yield-Forecasting,
    Irrigation-scheduling, Termite-attack, Green-house gases, and Farm-machinery (Manickavasagan
    et al. 2005). A distributed wireless-network was used for controlling of irrigation-process
    from a remote-location (Kim et al. 2008). As the farming is still at a nascent-stage,
    so the applications need to be more robust in agriculture for exploring the enormous-scope
    of AI (Slaughter et al. 2008). The outcome of cultivation largely depends on various
    cognitive-solutions’ reception. While, a larger scale of research is still in
    progress and the industry has been under-served, with the availability of some
    applications in the market (Shobila and Mood 2014). An automated irrigation-system
    using the GPRS module as communicating-device was developed where the system was
    programmed into a microprocessor based gateway for controlling the quantity of
    water. It was found to result in water-savings of 90% more than the conventional
    irrigation-system (Gutiérrez et al. 2014). Katariya et al. (2015) have made a
    discussion on the use of robot in the agricultural fields for spraying of pesticides,
    dropping of seeds, water-supply and ploughing activities. The working of the robot
    was designed to follow white-line track of the needy tasks, while other surfaces
    were regarded as black/brown. Kodali and Sahu (2016) have discussed regarding
    the use of “Losant platform” in order to monitor the agricultural land and also,
    for intimating the farmers via SMS/e-mail in case of any variances in the system.
    Roopaei et al. (2017) have discussed regarding the use of cloud-based thermal-imaging
    system for the irrigation in agricultural sector. Since, AI uses big data, thus
    the looking-up method and training need to be properly defined in order to achieve
    speed and accuracy (Dharmaraj and Vijayanand 2018). Although, the AI-based systems
    are gradually embedded in variety of products as well as services, but there has
    been a challenge to ensure the successful working of human and AI together. A
    strong attribute of any AI based system is its flexibility/versatility. A flexibility
    of the subsystems is required that will enable the interfacing of subsystems into
    an integrated environment for AI-based robotics-technology (Mowforth and Bratko
    1987), and also it should have more capabilities in accommodating a large amount
    of user data from the field-expert. AI-based systems are unable to learn from
    their environment like human-being. However, even though the AI-based systems
    perform better with given parameters and rules, but the major limitations of these
    systems are with decision-making where context plays significant-role. Moreover,
    there has been a fear among the agricultural workers on a daily-wage basis that
    the increase in automation will lead to their job losses. The various cognitive
    solutions available for agriculture are very expensive, and thus the AI solutions
    need to be more viable to the farming-community (Dharmaraj and Vijayanand 2018).
    A digital agriculture refers to the use of hi-tech computer-systems for calculating
    a number of parameters like weed-detection, crop-prediction, yield-detection,
    crop-quality and many more techniques of machine learning (Liakos et al. 2018).
    Bannerjee et al. (2018) have segregated category-wise advancements with a brief-overview
    on various AI techniques by covering major penetration in the agriculture domain
    from early 1980s to 2018. Jha et al. (2019) have discussed about different automation-practices
    like IoT, Wireless-Communications, Machine-learning, AI, and Deep-learning. Further,
    they discussed about a proposed system’s implementation in botanical-farm for
    leaf and flower identification in addition to watering by the use of IoT. The
    agriculture sector needs a huge up-gradation in order to survive the changing
    conditions of Indian economy. The major categories of applications of AI in agriculture
    are “Agricultural Robotics, Crop and Soil Health Monitoring, Predictive Agricultural
    Analytics and Agri Supply Chain”. AI can impact 70 million farmers in 2020, adding
    $9 billion to farmer incomes. AI comes as a great boon to the agricultural sector
    which is heavily dependent on climatic conditions which are often unpredictable
    (Nayak et al. 2019).The growing demand towards the “AgTech industry” with the
    use of computer-vision and AI might be a path for sustainability in food-production
    for feeding the future (Kakani et al. 2020). Talaviya et al. (2020) have discussed
    the implementation and the various methods used by drones in agriculture for spraying
    in addition to crop-monitoring. From the vast literature review, the following
    research gaps were identified: AI is at its infant stage in Indian agricultural
    context and there is a lot to explore in its applicability in the field. Further,
    covid pandemic marks the beginning of a new era of digital technology where farmers
    need time to get acclimatized to use these high profile and sophisticated AI techniques.
    It is a new research area; hence, the availability of research is very limited
    especially in the field of agriculture. These recent trends in applicability of
    AI in farming are the propelling force to pursue this research. 2 Research Methodology
    2.1 Study population The targeted population in this study included the farmers
    from the rural-areas of Odisha (India). Because of the movement restrictions,
    a total of 32 adjacent villages were selected from Khorda district in the state
    of Odisha. Out of 32 numbers of villages, a total of 560 farmers having good knowledge;
    in farming and utilizing modern tools and techniques in agri-activities were selected
    randomly with the help and guidance of respective village-heads for the subsequent
    studies. The information was gathered between the months of March and July of
    2021, which is the mid-period of the year. 2.2 Design of questionnaires and collection
    of data The major novelty of this research lied in the design of questionnaire
    based on existing literature along with consultation with experts in the field
    and collection of data. The questionnaire was designed for collecting the detailed
    socio-demographic information and awareness of farmers about the use of AI & its’
    usefulness during this pandemic COVID-19. The socio-demographic information included
    the age, sex, family-sizes, education-levels, primary as well as secondary occupations,
    expertise in farming, and type of farming-lands’ ownership. While, the questionnaire
    related to awareness of farmers included the knowledge levels and the benefits
    of using AI in agriculture in addition to its’ context in association with the
    COVID-19. However, after distributing the questionnaires personally as well as
    through farmer-to-farmer contact to all the 560 selected farmers, only 523 responses
    were collected. 2.3 Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and ISM model-generation
    In order to identify the relationships among different items that help in describing
    a problem, the “Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM)” has been found to be
    a well-established methodology. As, any complex-problem is considered to be associated
    with a number of related factors, thus the direct and indirect relationships among
    those factors help in depicting the situation more correctly in comparison to
    individual-factors. However, a collective understanding was provided by ISM for
    these relationships, which has been applied by various authors for different fields
    of applications (Kumar et al. 2009; Mishra and Satapathy 2020). In this study,
    the ISM was thus used to find interrelation among the challenging parameters in
    implementing AI in the agricultural sectors of India during the pandemic COVID-19.
    In this study with the help of six-experts’ having doctoral, MBA and accountancy
    qualifications from different areas of expertise among which three were from medical
    background, in addition to an in-depth review of literature and subsequent discussion
    with farmers, the present problems or challenging parameters associated with the
    implementation of AI in the agricultural sectors of India during this pandemic
    COVID-19 were identified accordingly. Further, the interrelations among these
    challenging parameters in the implementation of AI were measured and an ISM model
    was developed. In general, the ISM starts with identification of relevant-variables
    to the problem through extensive-review of literatures as well as experts’ opinion,
    which extends with the selection of a contextually-relevant subordinate-relation.
    In this study, on the basis of the judgment on element-set as well as the contextual-relation,
    a “structural-self interaction-matrix (SSIM)” was derived from ‘pair-wise comparison’
    of variables. Then, the relative relationships along with the associated-direction
    of relationships between various variables were identified, and the symbols that
    were used in denoting of the relationship-direction linking the “variables (i,
    j)” were “V, A, X & O” (V: factor i helps to achieve factor j; A: factor j helps
    to achieve factor i; X: factor i and j help to achieve each other; and O: factor
    i and j are unrelated), respectively. Further, in the subsequent step, the SSIM
    was converted into a “reachability-matrix (RM)” and its’ transitivity was checked.
    After completion of the transitivity-embedding, a matrix-model was obtained, and
    with subsequent partitioning of the elements, the structural-model called ISM
    was derived. 3 Results 3.1 The socio-demographic information and awareness of
    farmers The socio-demographic information as well as awareness of farmers regarding
    the usefulness of Al in agriculture during COVID-19 was illustrated in Table 1.
    It was observed from a total of 523 numbers of farmers that, the majority of responded
    farmers were in the age group of 36 to 45 years (46.65%), males (63.67%), education-levels
    of ≤ 10th (37.09%), agriculture as primary-occupation (100%), none as secondary-occupation
    (96.56%), household members’ numbers of 1 to 8 (95.41%), expertise in farming
    of 0 to 15 years (62.33%), and with farm land ownership (95.79%), respectively.
    Based on the awareness of farmers, it was found that 478 farmers (91.39%) preferred
    to use conventional farming techniques. The AI knowledge was 60.61%, with the
    preference of agricultural use of AI to be 23.32%. Further, the understanding
    of the COVID-19 pandemic coronavirus outbreak was among all the 523 farmers (100%),
    and only 44.55% of farmers believe that using AI in agriculture will be advantageous,
    revealing a lack of knowledge among the majority of the agricultural community
    regarding technology advancements, which was corroborated by previous researches
    (Bansal et al. 2022; Parmar et al. 2019). Table 1 Information on farmers’ socio-demography
    and awareness (n = 523) Full size table 3.2 Development of ISM model The different
    significant challenging parameters associated with the implementation of AI in
    the agricultural sectors of India during this pandemic COVID-19 were identified
    as illustrated in Table 2. Further, the identified eight-numbers of challenging
    parameters were considered to find their interrelations in order to generate the
    ISM model for the possible mitigation measures by competent authorities. Table
    2 The challenging parameters associated in implementing AI in the agricultural
    sectors of India during this pandemic COVID-19 Full size table On the basis of
    similar contextual-relationships, the development of SSIM for all the eight challenging
    parameters from Table 2 were completed by using the symbols like “V, A X and O”
    as shown in Table 3. Then, the transformation of SSIM into a binary-matrix was
    obtained called the “initial reachability-matrix” by the substitution of “1 and
    0” in places of “V, A, X and O” as per the cases, respectively (Table 3). Further,
    the “final reachability-matrix with transitivity-relationship” was obtained by
    showing the driving-power as well as dependence of each parameter (Table 4) where
    the driving-power of a parameter represented the total number of parameters inclusive
    of itself that it helps to achieve. Similarly, the dependence represented the
    total number of parameters that it helps to achieve. Then from the final reachability-matrix
    (Table 5), the corresponding reachability as well as antecedent set for each-element
    was found, where the reachability-set included the same parameter and other parameters
    that it helps to achieve, and similarly, the antecedent-set also included the
    same parameter in addition to other parameters that help in achieving it (Mishra
    and Satapathy 2020). Moreover, the intersection-set was derived with the positioning
    of top-level in ISM hierarchy for the parameter having same reachability as well
    as intersection set. The similar procedure was adopted for the identification
    of the elements in the subsequent levels that continued till identifying the levels
    of each element (Table 6, 7, and 8, respectively). The identified levels were
    used in building the diagraph along with the ISM final-model. It may be noted
    that during the subsequent iteration-processes, the elimination of few parameters
    took-place, and the ISM model for the parameters was generated followed by the
    final ISM model as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Table 3 Structural self-interaction

    d''Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (MICMAC)” analysis,
    is a study between driving power and dependence power of the various factors/parameters.
    It has four quadrants representing autonomous factors, linkage factors, driving
    and dependent factors. MICMAC analysis involves the development of a graph that
    classifies factors based on driving power and dependence power. It is used to
    classify the factors and validate the interpretive structural model factors in
    the study to reach their results and conclusions (Mishra et al. 2023). The factors/parameters
    were classified into four-groups such as “excluded, dependent, relay and influential”,
    so as to classify different parameters for subsequent analysis of the influence
    of driving-power and dependence on such parameters. For the MICMAC analysis, the
    dependence was plotted on X-axis, while the drive-power was plotted on Y-axis,
    as shown in Fig. 3. In view of the fact that, any parameters’ changes of any cluster
    could have reflected-back through corresponding parameters’ changes in other clusters,
    it may be assumed to be the system as stable. The cluster’s classification in
    MICMAC analysis along with their usual-meanings was as follows: Fig. 3 Diagraph
    of MICMAC analysis Full size image 4 a) Cluster-I: This group is known as “excluded-enablers
    or autonomous”, with “weak driving-power in addition to weak-dependence”, which
    appear quite out-of-line with only fewer-links with the system. In this study,
    the challenging parameters CP4, CP6 and CP8, such as “big data costs; versatility;
    and loss of employment” were under this category. 5 b) Cluster-II: These enablers
    are known as “dependent-enablers or result-enablers”, with “weak driving-power
    in addition to strong-dependence” and are “little-influent as well as very-dependent”.
    None of the challenging parameters were found under this category. 6 c) Cluster-III:
    These enablers are “very-influent and dependent”. These are also known as “relay
    or linkage enablers” that are “unstable” with “strong driving-power in addition
    to strong-dependence”. The challenging parameters CP1, CP2, CP3, and CP5 (e.g.,
    “responsive time and accuracy levels; the absence of standardisation; a need for
    huge data; and method of implementation”) were found under this category. 7 d)
    Cluster-IV: These enablers are “very-influent and little-dependent” conditioning
    the rest of the system, and are also known as “determinant-enablers or drivers
    or independent” with “strong driving-power in addition to weak-dependence”. These
    are also known to be the “entry-enablers” in the system. The challenging parameter
    CP7 i.e. “insufficient awareness of context” was found under this category. The
    Fig. 3 shows the final ISM model. It is evident that “big data costs” is the immediate
    problem or short-term focus. This leads to a set of interrelated challenges such
    as ‘the absence of standardisation’, ‘method of implementation’, and ‘insufficient
    awareness of context’. This further leads to a set of four parameters, with ‘responsive
    time and accuracy levels’ and ‘a need for huge data’ corresponding to each other.
    The ‘versatility’ corresponds to ‘a need for huge data’ as well as ‘loss of employment’
    and ‘responsive time and accuracy levels’ simultaneously. This level determines
    parameters of solutions to the problem of ‘big data costs’. The interrelationships
    show that each parameter of the concerned level is highly reciprocating in nature.
    So, they should be analyzed carefully for the trade-offs in calculating costs
    of AI/big data implementation. 8 Discussion The sustainability of India''s agricultural
    industry is crucial for maintaining economic expansion. Adoption of AI is thought
    to benefit India''s agricultural practises as they expand and evolve. It has the
    potential to provide practical answers to most problems, including rising labour
    costs, cultivation costs, crop failures brought on by diseases with unpredictable
    yields, unpredictable rainfall, climatic changes, depletion of soil fertility,
    and fluctuating price levels for agricultural products. In these conditions, AI
    can provide superior agricultural techniques to overcome the challenges. The challenging
    parameters identified included “responsive time and accuracy levels; the absence
    of standardisation; a need for huge data; big data costs; method of implementation;
    versatility; insufficient awareness of context; and loss of employment;” respectively.
    The parameters indicated how they interact with one another to produce the ISM
    model that was subsequently investigated by a MICMAC analysis to look for possible
    approaches to mitigation. The parameters, including “big data costs; versatility;
    and loss of employment;\" were detected in the autonomous category based on the
    cluster''s categorization in the MICMAC analysis. These parameters seem to be
    troublesome for a variety of reasons, including uncertainty about the safety of
    the AI. The parameters such as “responsive time and accuracy levels; the absence
    of standardisation; a need for huge data; and method of implementation” were revealed
    as influential factors. By utilizing AI platforms, which may be done with the
    available resources, farmers may be able to handle the complicated issues facing
    the business. However, due to the high cost of developing agricultural infrastructure,
    rural farmers must contact the government since they cannot afford to invest in
    the suggested procedure. The amount of income of the rural farmers has a considerable
    impact on the number of projects proposed and fully supported by the government.
    While low-income farmers typically refrain from initiating such efforts, high-income
    farmers may fund the building of agricultural infrastructure on their own without
    placing a financial strain on the government (Liu and Ji 2020). The use of AI
    is very advantageous and has the ability to advance technology in many different
    fields. AI-based systems are still in their infancy in the context of COVID-19;
    therefore it could be some time before they become apparent (Petropoulos 2020).
    Furthermore, only a small number of AI systems now exist those are operationally
    developed. Despite this, the COVID-19 epidemic has made it very difficult for
    farmers to perform their agricultural duties. Developing nations are just now
    starting to experiment with the technology, despite notable differences in the
    rate of AI adoption between nations (Wang et al. 2020). The academic and scientific
    groups are becoming more and more interested in creating AI techniques (Duan et
    al. 2019). It is thought that the deployment of AI would provide businesses a
    competitive edge since it would in some ways boost productivity. Only a small
    number of researches have attempted to understand the use and, consequently, the
    barriers to implementing AI (Zuiderwijk et al. 2021). Although AI and ML are highly
    popular as a predictive, multidisciplinary method to enhance food and agriculture
    practises, stakeholders need to be aware of some limitations (Ben Ayed and Hanana
    2021). The most important socioeconomic problem is without a doubt the potential
    for having too few employments. There will be a huge decline in human engagement
    when robots and intelligent technology take over the majority of repetitious work.
    In the event that AI gets implemented, the skills required will mostly move from
    front-end activities to back-office operations. There are also additional technological
    obstacles to overcome, such as robots that can only perform the jobs or tasks
    for which they were trained; otherwise, they commonly falter or create unrelated
    results. Another technological constraint is the high expense of building and
    maintaining computers and intelligent devices. This is especially true when hardware
    and software are updated often to keep up with changing needs. Machine maintenance
    and repair is an expensive venture. The comparatively high cost of these applications
    might raise the price of the agricultural output as a whole. Beyond the benefits
    provided by automated and intelligent technology, there could also be hazards
    and difficulties relating to sustainability. It covers themes including high energy
    use, e-waste problems, fierce competition, job losses, and even moral principles
    (Patelli and Mandrioli 2020; Ricciardi et al. 2018). When adopting AI technology,
    it is important to keep in mind that the majority of rural farmers have small
    landholdings and a constricted resource base. Farmers must be encouraged to view
    agriculture as a business in order to use AI technology to sustainably increase
    their profitability. Furthermore, farmers'' interest in using the already accessible
    AI model has to be aroused. Farmers need to be properly instructed and shown how
    to employ certain technology based on AI As a result, using AI technology to solve
    real-world issues is necessary. AI needs to be flexible, affordable, accessible,
    realistic, and sustainable in order to be widely adopted. AI has a significant
    potential in the next years, particularly in underdeveloped countries. The potential
    of AI technology in agriculture contributes to increased agricultural growth as
    a result of improvements in the IT infrastructure (Shee et al. 2021). Farmers,
    especially those in rural areas, lack technical knowledge and are unaware of such
    technologies. When knowledge is enhanced and technologies are made more accessible
    to the average farmer, with AI guiding the way, agriculture may become somewhat
    autonomous. 9 Managerial Implications The technology driven agriculture has got
    deep realizations and implications for the modern managers-cum-farmers. In this
    highly sophisticated and modern environment, with pressure to enhance productivity,
    AI cladded techniques are a real boon. Some of the most tedious and critical work
    in farming can be easily performed and monitored in real time. Moreover, the accuracy
    and precision involved is much more superior to control and monitoring by traditional
    methods. The ISM model delineates all the identified parameters into four groups
    from which the immediate focus/problem and the long term goal to be achieved are
    elucidated with clarity. This analysis opens the managers to ways of identify
    the parameters of various nature and to fix modality of its implementation with
    success, efficiency and effectiveness. 10 Conclusion and Future Scope The future
    of India depends on the growth of its agriculture. As the AI is sweeping throughout
    the world and is entering in to the daily life activities of human-beings, its
    role in shaping Indian agricultural growth and development has been a significant
    issue. AI can provide efficient and practical solutions for most of the problems
    in agriculture like increase in labour costs, increase in cultivation cost and
    crop-failures due to diseases with unpredictable yield, rainfall uncertainties,
    climatic alterations and soil-fertility degradation, and the fluctuating market-prices
    for agriculture products. In such condition, with the application of AI, advanced
    farming procedures can be adopted in order to reduce losses to farmers as well
    as by providing with higher yield. AI is very useful for the social-needs in agriculture
    as well as to enhance the agricultural productivity and production for fulfilling
    the ever-growing food requirement demands of the world population, and thereby
    preventing in starvation. By using AI platforms, the farmers can be able in solving
    the uncertain-issues faced in the agriculture sectors by optimizing the utilization
    of resources. The implementation of AI in Indian agriculture is quite useful that
    can bring technological-revolution in these sectors. In context to COVID-19, AI
    based-systems are still at an initial-stage that will take time before the visibility
    of AI measures’ result, with the operational-maturity of very few AI systems at
    this stage. However, as the farmers have been facing a lot of difficulties to
    carry out the agricultural activities during this pandemic COVID-19, AI has the
    potential to be used as a tool to overcome such difficulties in this as well as
    similar pandemics. We have chosen a sample from Khordha district of Odisha. As
    other areas have variant degree of advancement than this district of the ‘Capital
    city” of Bhubaneswar, the results will vary from region to region although challenges
    remain more or less same. Depending upon the nature and ambience of two regions,
    the conclusion may be generalized. In this study, the challenging parameters in
    implementing AI in the agricultural sectors in India in view of the pandemic COVID-19
    impacts on agricultural activities have been identified. Further, these challenging
    parameters were considered to find their interrelations in order to generate the
    ISM model followed by MICMAC analysis for consideration as well as adoption of
    the possible mitigation measures by the government and competent authorities.
    This research is one of the precursors for several further researches in the field
    of farming with AI techniques. It would act as a guide for both academicians and
    practitioners to enhance farm-based activities to bring about higher productivity,
    lesser waste and optimum utilization of resources. It is evident that the analysis
    would open-up a sea of opportunities for researchers around the globe to accelerate
    this entirely new dimension to farming. The pursuit for excellence can only be
    achieved by quality and rigor of research to which this paper may act as a formidable
    base. It is also highly anticipated that this paper would be a trendsetter to
    analysis of Hi-tech farming involving AI. References Abawi GS, Widmer TL (2000)

    1. Adaptation of data-driven approaches in water management, as opposed to precision
    agriculture Smart agriculture is an example of water-impacted area where remote
    sensing and other data-driven approaches have been intensively utilized. Unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAV, i.e., drones) are now routinely used in agronomic research
    and at commercial farms to some extent. Autonomous navigation is more challenging
    for ground robots because of obstacles (e.g., leaves in cluttered rows) and blocked
    global positioning system (GPS) signals (e.g., for small robots working under
    crop canopies) (Gai et al., 2021). Typically, aerial images are collected using
    hyperspectral, thermal, infrared, and/or visible (red, green, and blue, i.e.,
    RGB) cameras (Burnette et al., 2018). Above-canopy RGB cameras rely on reflectance
    between plants and background. Light detection and ranging sensor (LiDAR) is an
    example of alternative three-dimensional (3D) sensor with lesser illumination
    inconsistencies or effects of shadow (Gai et al., 2021). Collected two-dimensional
    (2D) and 3D images are computationally costly datasets to store and analyze. As
    a result, data needs to be trimmed down to extract index parameters for chlorophyll
    and other crop yield indicators for interpretation. Breeding and yield prediction
    are the main purposes of high-throughput aerial (by drones) and ground (by robots
    or stationary/hand-held sensors) phenotyping (Watanabe et al., 2017). Additional
    focus areas of precision agriculture include robotics for greenhouse operations
    including sterilized (heated) harvesting (Van Henten et al., 2002). Sensors wirelessly
    connected to internet of things (IoT) enable precise water (smart irrigation)
    and fertilizer application, and to monitor crop growth especially under the controlled
    environment of IoT greenhouses (Kim et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2022). In summary,
    big data is collected (by remote sensing and IoT sensors) specifically to evaluate
    crop growth/health as a function of genotype (G; crop variety or cultivar), environment
    (E; e.g., weather including drought and other water stress, pest, and disease),
    and management practice (M; e.g., fertilizer application, irrigation, and planting/harvesting
    schedule) parameters, often termed G x E x M interactions (Benes et al., 2020).
    Above-described data driven techniques have not been adequately adapted in water
    quality and related environmental research fields. Water research has more diverse
    and less focused goals than the agriculture specifically targeting crop yields.
    Remote sensing studies in environmental chemistry journals are limited primarily
    to air pollution monitoring. Air pollutants from combustive emissions (e.g., vehicle
    exhaust) and wildfire are monitored aerially and on the ground (Stockwell et al.,
    2022). Some recent studies utilized remote sensing to monitor waste flows in national
    parks (Chen et al., 2021); to estimate carbon stocks in forests (Omasa et al.,
    2003); and to monitor water quality parameters including dissolved organic carbon
    (DOC) (Fichot et al., 2016). However, environmental monitoring of dioxins and
    other high public interest “pollutant of the moment” (e.g., lead in pipes and
    persistent organic pollutants) is historically performed at local hot spots (Uchimiya
    et al., 2007). Some individual laboratories made local monitoring data publicly
    available. Examples of such open datasets include congener profiles of dioxins
    and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Yokohama National University, 2022), raw
    analytical data (e.g., near infrared (NIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
    and fluorescence) for soil, food, and other diverse sample sets (University of
    Copenhagen, 2022). Those open databases allowed other researchers to perform chemometrics
    and advanced data analytics to interpret and make wider use of monitoring data.
    In addition, cloud (e.g., Google Earth Engine (Tamiminia et al., 2020)) and satellite
    (e.g., ECOSTRESS for evapotranspiration (Fisher et al., 2020) and GOME-2 for drought
    (Sun et al., 2015)) based open data and resources are already available yet underutilized
    in environmental cheminformatics. In 1987, Wolman noted “a major difficulty in
    assessing the effects of pollution control programs and other influences on national
    and regional water quality has been the problem of obtaining reliable information
    on water-quality trends for a representative sample of the nation''s rivers” (Smith
    et al., 1987). Some 35 years later, public databases and open dashboards are available
    in county levels for surface and groundwater quality (e.g., temperature, specific
    conductance, pH, nutrients, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds) (USGS,
    2022); soil classification (including physicochemical properties and some soil
    health parameters) (USDA-NRCS, 2022); and wastewater surveillance for COVID-19
    and other public health emergencies (CDC, 2022). As datasets are curated and become
    publicly available, data utilization has become a new challenge in big data (Lovett
    et al., 2007). Even in radiology and other medical fields where image-based diagnostics
    are traditionally employed, lack of biomarker standardization and cross-calibration
    protocols can lead to different interpretations depending on the algorithm used
    to process images (Zwanenburg et al., 2020). Artificial intelligence (AI) (including
    machine learning) is not a new concept and has been utilized in drug (receptor
    models relevant to environmental toxicology) (Young et al., 2008; Bansal et al.,
    2014) and material (e.g., sorbents and photovoltaics) (Olivares-Amaya et al.,
    2011; Azzan et al., 2022) design areas of relevance to environmental chemistry.
    Yet, there remains a gap between basic laboratory experiments and real-world environmental
    chemistry phenomena, even though a large amount of field monitoring data are publicly
    available. For example, relative importance of different reaction pathways (photochemical,
    redox, microbial, etc.) or actual concentrations of reactants and products in
    a particular river, soil, or sediment site could be theoretically conceptualized,
    but have not been visualized in a real time. Field experiments have been limited
    to monitoring or to obtain samples to conduct laboratory validation experiments.
    However, findings from laboratory experiments cannot be directly extrapolated
    back to the complex spatiotemporal biogeochemistry of the field site. Above discussion
    identifies the current transdisciplinary challenge in big data approach: interpretation
    and calibration of data for cross-system utilization. Water research community
    has a unique opportunity in this arena. First, no method currently exists to directly
    extrapolate findings from basic laboratory experiments to the actual environmental
    biogeochemistry occurring at a field site of interest. Second, systematic experiments
    (as a function of aquatic chemistry parameters with controls) are often impractical
    on-site at rivers, estuaries, and other waterways or soils and sediments. Well-controlled
    experiments can be conducted with repeated trials and errors on digital twins
    of environmental systems using available open databases of soil and water quality,
    weather, and geography described above. Digital twin has been proposed but not
    yet effectively utilized in water management (Huang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022;
    Sookhak Lari et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022). In agriculture (Maimaitijiang et
    al., 2020; Pylianidis et al., 2021; Knapp-Wilson et al., 2023), advancement in
    remote sensing is enabling yield forecasting at and before maturity and harvesting
    (Bhandari et al., 2023; Gadepally et al., 2023). Early yield forecasting could
    be expanded to use satellite data, in addition to UAV. As summarized below, digital
    twin is different from conventional geospatial models derived from first principles.
    Digital twin continuously learns from data fed from its physical counterpart.
    Simulation is constantly evolving and is not based on a fixed model, because of
    the feedback loops. Digital twin is a virtual replication of the physical system.
    Data collected by sensors at critical process flow points of the physical system
    can be used to continuously train its virtual twin. Developed digital twin could
    be used to conduct virtual experiments to reduce costly trial and error efforts
    in its physical counterpart. Digital twin has been successfully used in automobile,
    aerospace, and electronics manufacturing as a part of digital transformation (DX)
    (NEC, 2022). Additional areas of utilization include material design (Azzan et
    al., 2022), education (Xie et al., 2021), and smart city (Deguchi et al., 2020)
    including water supply and treatment infrastructure (White et al., 2021). Following
    steps are required to build a digital twin (NEC, 2022). IoT sensors and cameras
    with 5G wireless high speed data transfer capacity are used to collect data at
    the physical space in a real time. AI is used to analyze collected big data. Augmented
    reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are used to visualize the digitally built
    space. Computer aided simulation (CAE) performs simulation in the digital space.
    In many cases, it is too costly and resource intensive for individual manufacturers
    to build its own digital twin. In such cases, cloud-based software as a service
    (SaaS) offers necessary tools and solutions for end-users (e.g., manufacturers
    and other entities committed to DX) instead of constructing digital twin platforms
    on their own. Subsequent sections show how digital twins could be built for any
    systems in the physical space ranging in scales of complexity from rhizosphere
    to water-impacted infrastructure. Built cyber twins of systems allow in silico
    experiments that cannot be safely conducted in the physical space, e.g., natural
    disaster and climate impact. 2. Digital twin in water realm: Nutrient uptake to
    disaster preparedness An open-sourced community-developed (Git) plant architectural
    model with advanced visualization is available to simulate nutrient uptake, evapotranspiration,
    and various other plant responses to environmental perturbations (Benes et al.,
    2020). Because of known phenotypic plasticity, genotype alone cannot predict plant''s
    response to different environmental cues (Benes et al., 2020). Simulations allow
    experimentalists to test various scenarios of environmental perturbations, as
    it is impractical to test all environmental stressors in field experiments. Virtual
    twin can be used to phenotype a crop variety for untested environments, including
    future environmental conditions such as extreme weather. In silico approach will
    also reduce the number of trials and errors in greenhouse and field experiments
    to determine the application rates of fertilizer and pesticides. As an example
    related to water, Fig. A.1 in Appendix A shows simulation results for nutrient
    uptake by plant roots (Postma et al., 2017; Benes et al., 2020). Because phosphorus
    (P) binds soil surfaces, soluble concentration decreases with depth (red to blue
    color shift reflecting available P concentration in Fig. A.1(a) in Appendix A).
    As a result, root branching density decreases with the soil depth for root systems
    exhibiting high plasticity (Fig. A.1(a) in Appendix A). In contrast, nitrate is
    soluble and has lesser effects on the root branching density (Fig. A.1(b)). Soil
    view of nitrate concentration in Fig. A.1(c) in Appendix A reflects changes caused
    by the root uptake in a real time. In summary, Fig. A.1 in Appendix A illustrates
    experiments conducted on virtual plants (plant in silico). The simulation visualized
    nutrient fate in complex root/soil systems. Next example will show a larger scale
    application of digital twin in smart city focused on water-related disaster, such
    as flooding. Smart city is a larger scale digital twin application that contains
    water distribution infrastructure including drinking water. Virtual Singapore,
    digital twin of Dublin (White et al., 2021), and Society 5.0 (Deguchi et al.,
    2020) are becoming accessible on the internet. Open digital twins provide an interactive
    platform where user feedback serves as the additional data for AI-driven model
    training and simulation. Simulation results can then be used for disaster preparedness,
    e.g., for early warning on smartphone apps. Fig. A.2 in Appendix A illustrates
    how digital twin could be utilized in water problems, using smart city as an example
    infrastructure where the digital twin approach has been successfully applied.
    Physical twin (blue boxes in Fig. A.2 in Appendix A) is the existing city infrastructure
    consisting of terrain (soil), buildings, utility (including drinking water and
    sewage), and various forms of transportation. Smart city is built by collecting
    data in physical layers using sensors and cameras. Big data collected in the physical
    world (including rainfall, soil property, and other environmental data) is used
    to build its virtual twin using AI, machine learning, and other models and data
    analytics. Built digital twin (red boxes) is continuously trained using big data
    fed from its physical twin. By making the digital twin open and interactive, citizen
    feedback could be used as additional data for training and simulation. For example,
    a picture posted on a social media at early stage of a disaster (e.g., flooding)
    can be used to simulate the damage in wider regions. The simulation will use additional
    data such as 3D maps, rainfall trends, and historical pedological and geographical
    data collection. Such simulation can then be used for early warning on a smartphone
    app (Spectee, 2022). AI-based emergency response app is commercially available
    in Japan and has been utilized by the regional governments for early warning and
    rescue operations (Spectee, 2022). Various data sources are used to simulate flood
    and other natural disasters: pictures posted at social networking service (SNS)
    sites, weather data, images from around 10 000 river and roadway monitoring cameras
    managed by local and central government, satellite images, traffic GPS data from
    government and automobile company (navigation data), and human traffic data (Spectee,
    2022). AI analyzes those databases for risk visualization and prediction, e.g.,
    to classify pixels of images to detect fire, smoke, and water in a picture. During
    the initial stage of flooding, one SNS photo allows AI to analyze water depth
    and location based on rainfall/geographical data to create a real time 3D flood
    simulation map predicting affected areas with water depth. In addition to commercial
    apps, freely accessible digital twin platforms are becoming available. For example,
    digital twins of archeological sites (AIST, 2022) around Japan was developed using
    cloud data as a part of Society 5.0 (Deguchi et al., 2020), and is open to the
    public. Digital twin allows underground to aboveground visualization of archeological
    sites for preservation (protection of underground archeological sites from unintentional
    damage during construction) and discovery without excavation. Open digital twin
    platforms have the advantage of receiving citizen feedback as additional data
    and feedback loops to improve simulation results. In summary, digital twin could
    be built from big data for systems of diverse complexities ranging from plant
    root systems, soils, archeological sites, and cities to the entire country. Flood
    simulation in digital twin (red box in Fig. A.2 in Appendix A) cannot be investigated
    as experiments in the physical world. There are diverse areas of application for
    digital twin in water chemistry research to explore untested conditions including
    extreme climate, emerging pollutants, and new vectors of public health concern.
    Availability of open models, cloud-based data repository, and data visualization
    will be the challenge in data-driven water research, much like in agricultural
    bioinformatics (Marshall-Colon et al., 2017). 3. Data-driven research agenda in
    environmental chemistry Historically, environmentally relevant concentration and
    condition have been the prerequisite for designing laboratory experiments for
    environmental chemistry including pollutant fate and treatment effects. However,
    “environmentally relevant concentration” is unknown or widely varies across environments
    for many pollutants of interest. As a result, concentrations of target pollutants
    (or initial loading for nanomaterials) are set as low as analytically possible
    to justify environmental relevance of the experiment. Remote sensing could aid
    pollutant distribution screening to capture more realistic, as opposed to assumed
    environmental concentrations and conditions to design controlled laboratory experiments.
    As an example, quinone redox cycling is historically believed to play a central
    role in environmental redox chemistry; yet, no monitoring data is available to
    validate its well-accepted importance in environmental chemistry. Quinones are
    a known redox catalyst in photosystem II (Saito et al., 2013), and have been proposed
    to play similar roles in microbial mineral respiration (Lovley et al., 1996) and
    pollutant degradation (Perlinger et al., 1996) as plant/microbial exudates or
    natural organic matter (NOM) components (Uchimiya and Stone, 2009). Semiquinone
    radicals are responsible, because they are reactive yet persistent in aquatic
    environments (Kiruri et al., 2013; Uchimiya, 2020). Yet, relative importance of
    quinones in biogeochemical redox cycle is currently unknown because no method
    exists for field validation. Quinones could serve as the indicator to test environmental
    health, if the data mining approach could be established. Fluorescence sensors
    could take advantage of higher aromaticity in reduced quinone to monitor the relative
    importance of quinones in NOM redox chemistry (Klapper et al., 2002). Although
    the purpose is different, fluorescence is utilized in remote sensing for satellite
    imaging of chlorophyll (Gamon et al., 1990). Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
    (SIF) has been used as the proxy to measure the plant response to perturbations
    including drought (Sun et al., 2015). Unlike normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) and hydrology monitoring, SIF captures changes in chlorophyll biomarker
    and elucidates different drought mechanisms and respective plant responses: prolonged
    versus flush drought events leading to different soil moisture regimes and photosynthetic
    responses (Sun et al., 2015). A close agreement was reported between the photosynthetic
    signal by SIF and gross primary production, offering a high resolution spatiotemporal
    imaging to monitor terrestrial carbon cycles (Sun et al., 2017). Another satellite
    data of relevance to the environmental community is ECOTRESS to monitor evapotranspiration
    (Fisher et al., 2020). Remote sensing can be combined with GPS to map drought
    and heat stress (Crain et al., 2018). Within the environmental chemistry community,
    current challenge in data driven research is utilization of different data sources
    to solve problems with the aid of AI. Unlike the past high visibility research
    areas such as nanomaterials, big data has not yet become active in water research,
    partly because AI requires coding skills and computational capacity. In addition,
    lack of commonly used indicator parameters (e.g., yield in agronomy) makes remote
    sensing in water research less widespread. Databases are already available to
    aid AI-driven discoveries on how different environments (e.g., soil and sediment)
    buffer, attenuate, and adjust to perturbations. The top-down approach is possible
    in environmental research by combining site monitoring with weather, satellite,
    and other relevant publicly available spatiotemporal datasets. Areas of water
    research where AI and big data could be utilized include environmental forensics
    and remediation; precision characterization of NOM and other essential environmental
    constituents; reactivity and fate monitoring for natural and anthropogenic constituents;
    and climate impact on waterways. As illustrated in Fig. A.2 in Appendix A for
    digital twin as an example, big data analytics involves the following process
    flow: data acquisition by geospatial, spectral, microscopic, and other sensing
    techniques; data reduction and parameterization; continuous model training and
    optimization by data/process flow information feedback loops; and forecasting.
    As illustrated in the subsequent section, microbiome is an example of environmental
    field that succeeded in deducing governing principles from big data. Analogous
    approaches could be adapted to data-driven water research for early warning and
    disaster response simulations for environmental catastrophe (including drinking
    water contamination); elucidation of master variables controlling the environmental
    risk of diverse classes of contaminants; and development of a methodology to link
    food, energy, and water nexus (Pitts et al., 2020; Lodge et al., 2023). Soil microbiome
    is a research area that requires data mining to extract governing principles and
    elucidate mechanisms. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker gene is commonly used
    to characterize microbial communities in diverse systems ranging from soil and
    ocean, to human/animal gut (Kanehisa et al., 2016). The 16S rRNA gene is universally
    present across bacteria, and is highly conserved with nine hypervariable regions
    (Nguyen et al., 2016). Database of the 16S rRNA gene sequence is available for
    thousands of species (Earl et al., 2018). Bioinformatics (omics mining of advanced
    gene sequencing data) revealed the following governing principles in complex microbiome
    of environmental samples (Fierer, 2017). First, high microbial diversity, functional
    stability (despite large species turnover), and stable population equilibrium
    are consistently observed regardless of the environment (soil, ocean, human body)
    (Goldford et al., 2018). Second, phylogeny and function are strongly correlated
    (Langille et al., 2013), allowing metagenomic prediction based on the marker gene
    sequencing data alone (Douglas et al., 2020). Finally, few environmental factors
    (pH > total organic carbon (TOC) > redox > soil moisture) drive the soil microbiome
    composition (Fierer, 2017). Collectively, master variables of environmental chemistry
    (pH, organic carbon, and redox potential (Eh)) also control the microbial community
    composition in the environment. Above-described governing principles in soil microbiome
    could enable the reverse approach. That is, the genome content may relate to the
    metabolic rate (Flamholz and Newman, 2022), as suggested recently from the laboratory
    experiments on denitrification (Gowda et al., 2022). Because nutrients constrain
    microbial composition, species (with overlapping metabolism) composition varies
    substantially between environmental samples (Flamholz and Newman, 2022) (Fig.
    A.3 in Appendix A). Shared metabolic genes are much more stable across samples,
    and could predict denitrification by a community of microbes performing complete
    or parts of sequential reduction from , , and NO to N2 (Fig. A.3 in Appendix A)
    (Gowda et al., 2022). In various ecosystems, functional composition of communities
    is highly conserved (Fig. A.3(c) in Appendix A), despite large species variations
    (Fig. A.3(b) in Appendix A) (Flamholz and Newman, 2022). This widely observed
    functional redundancy suggests that community function is more important than
    the composition (Fig. A.3 in Appendix A), and both are driven by environmental
    chemistry variables. Similar approach could be explored in environmental chemoinformatics.
    Microbial species in Fig. A.3(b) in Appendix A (estimated 106 total bacteria and
    archaeal) (Flamholz and Newman, 2022) could be replaced by diverse classes of
    pollutants at a target site, e.g., heavy metals and congeners of per- and polyfluoroalkyl
    substances (PFAS). Relative importance of environmental parameters may correlate
    with some (e.g., Pb) more than others (e.g., Cd) (Uchimiya et al., 2020) in a
    particular class of pollutants. In Fig. A.3 in Appendix A, although genome is
    not available for contaminants, chemical speciation (for inorganic pollutants)
    and reactive versus inert functional groups (for organic pollutants) could serve
    to compose a big data. The resulting big data could be used to predict the contaminant
    fate with AI-driven data analytics to account for matrix effects, replicate errors,
    and other parameters influencing the fate and concentrations of individual contaminants.
    In summary, soil bioinformatics revealed how first principles of water chemistry
    govern the genetic composition in diverse environments (Goldford et al., 2018).
    Explained drivers of soil microbiome have potentials to predict metabolic functions
    based on gene sequencing (e.g., in nitrification where redox chemistry occurs
    in a series, and microbes participate in parts or a whole) (Gowda et al., 2022).
    Same drivers can predict the impact of soil additives (fertilizers, composts,
    biosolids, and other amendments) on the soil microbial community. Would the analogous
    big data approach explain the linkage between food, water and energy nexus (INFEWS)
    (NSF, 2022)? Cheminformatics could offer a way to link INFEWS by utilizing big
    data approaches employed in soil bioinformatics. The very concept of INFEWS is
    to link three complex systems (food, energy, and water), beyond case studies with
    life cycle assessments. This goal of INFEWS makes statistical classification,
    prediction, and other data-driven modeling approaches (Reichstein et al., 2019)
    particularly relevant. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no

  description: 'Nanosensors refer to a miniature electronic sensing device that works
    on a "Nano-scale" region. A nanosensor is a device that can transfer information
    and data on the behaviour and characteristics of tiny particles to a higher degree
    of visibility. Nanosensors can be used to distinguish chemical or mechanical data,
    such as the presence of material species and nanoparticles, or to screen real
    limitations on the nanoscale, such as temperature. Nanosensors are categorised
    depending on their design and intended use. Based on their structure, nanosensors
    are classified into two types: optical nanosensors and electrochemical nanosensors.
    Depending on the application, the nanosensor can be purchased as a material nanosensor,
    biosensor, electrometer, or deployable nanosensor. Nanosensors can measure down
    to the level of a single particle. Nanosensors include an analyte, sensor, transducer,
    and indicator. Nanosensors work by continuously monitoring electrical changes
    in sensor materials. The analyte diffuses from the solution for the sensor''s
    outer layer and responds explicitly and competently, changing the physicochemical
    properties of the transducer surface, prompting an adjustment of the optical or
    electronic properties of the transducer''s outer layer, and this change is converted

  description: An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled human-centered smart healthcare
    monitoring system can be useful in life saving, specifically for diabetes patients.
    Diabetes and heart patients need real-time and remote monitoring and recommendation-based
    medical assistance. Such human-centered smart healthcare systems can not only
    provide continuous medical assistance to diabetes patients but can also reduce
    overall medical expenses. In the last decade, machine learning has been successfully
    implemented to design more accurate and precise medical applications. In this
    paper, a smart sensing technologies-based architecture is proposed that uses AI
    and the Internet of Things (IoT) for continuous monitoring and health assistance
    for diabetes patients. The designed system senses various health parameters, such
    as blood pressure, blood oxygen, blood glucose (non-invasively), body temperature,
    and pulse rate, using a wrist band. We also designed a non-invasive blood sugar
    sensor using a near-infrared (NIR) sensor. The proposed system can predict the
    patient’s health condition, which is evaluated by a set of machine learning algorithms
    with the support of a fuzzy logic decision-making system. The designed system
    was validated on a large data set of 50 diabetes patients. The results of the
    simulation manifest that the random forest classifier gives the highest accuracy
    in comparison to other machine learning algorithms. The system predicts the patient’s
    condition accurately and sends it to the doctor’s portal.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled human-centered

    Keywords: human-centered application; IoT; machine learning; smart healthcare
    prediction; fuzzy logic; decision support system 1. Introduction The Internet
    of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) are two rapidly evolving technologies
    that have profoundly impacted the healthcare section [1]. The convergence of these
    technologies has given rise to innovative and smart solutions in the form of IoT-based
    human-centered healthcare applications utilizing ML [2]. IoT-based healthcare
    applications for portable and remote monitoring with a focus on human-centricity
    are needed by those who live in underdeveloped or remote areas. Diseases like
    high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes are long-lasting and require
    continuous monitoring [3,4]. In IoT-based applications, sensors enable real-time
    data collection from diabetic patients, providing a continuous stream of vital
    signs and other health-related information. This constant monitoring ensures a
    comprehensive view of the patient’s health status. This vast amount of data is
    processed via ML to identify patterns, anomalies, and trends, assisting in personalized
    diagnosis and treatment plans. It can predict disease conditions and evaluate
    factors, on the basis of which risk assessments can be made for personalized interventions
    [5]. ML algorithms heavily rely on the quality and quantity of data. Existing
    data on diabetic patients are for patients who are demographically different and
    have different levels of health-service challenges as compared to local-area patients.
    Thus, inherent biases exist due to diverse demographic and environmental factors
    that affect human health. Inadequate or biased data may lead to incorrect predictions
    and recommendations [4,6]. According to the best of our knowledge, the specific
    data set related to diabetic patients in Pakistan is limited as compared to the
    data sets of other countries. Looking for data on diabetic patients in Pakistan,
    we need to contact healthcare institutions, hospitals, research organizations,
    researchers, and government health departments. We cannot gain access to specific
    sensor data through our contacts and by meeting with them. Thus, we decided to
    design and develop an IoT system for data collection for local patients for the
    betterment of Pakistan’s underdeveloped areas like [7,8]. When accessing and using
    healthcare data, especially patient-related data, ethical and legal guidelines
    must be followed. Data privacy and consent are critical considerations when working
    with sensitive health information. Our whole work focused on smart health applications
    rather than simple health applications. A comparison between the pillars of smart
    health applications and simple health applications and their implementation is
    essential to understand the differences and similarities between these two approaches
    to healthcare technology, as described in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 1. Comparison
    between smart health and simple health [3,4,9,10]. Table 2. Advanced feature analysis
    between smart and simple health applications [11,12,13,14,15]. Smart health applications
    involve some advanced technologies like ML and AI (Table 2). Remote health monitoring
    with privacy and security concerns under the supervision of professionals is also
    a feature of smart health. All these smart health features of Table 2 are depicted
    in our layered architecture in Figure 1 and also in our component-based architecture
    in methodology section. Figure 1. Layered architecture of the designed system.
    IoT devices facilitate personalized care by tailoring interventions based on individual
    health data. Patients receive custom alerts, recommendations, and treatment plans,
    enhancing engagement and outcomes. Customization may require sophisticated and
    resource-intensive IoT infrastructure, potentially increasing the overall cost
    of healthcare services. ML enhances personalization by analyzing data to create
    precise models for each diabetic patient. Like ML, decision support systems in
    human-centered IoT devices with healthcare applications can trigger real-time
    alerts for healthcare professionals or caregivers in case of emergencies or abnormal
    health parameters. This enables timely interventions and improved patient safety.
    ML algorithms can provide automated decision support systems by analyzing incoming
    data and suggesting appropriate actions based on established patterns and medical
    guidelines, for instance, in diseases affecting factors like normal, high, and
    low ranges of vital signals, especially blood glucose levels [10,16,17,18]. Bandyopadhyay
    et al. [19] discuss the fact that accessibility and scalability are challenges
    for increasing numbers of patients when it comes to dealing with large amounts
    of data during continuous remote monitoring. IoT solutions can be scalable to
    accommodate a large number of users and devices [8,17]. Diabetic patients need
    to check their glucose levels after and before every meal and take doses accordingly.
    Cloud-based architectures facilitate easy accessibility and data sharing across
    healthcare systems. Considering all these points, a smart and intelligent decision-making
    system is presented here for diabetes patients. The proposed smart health architecture
    consists of five sensors for the measurement of health conditions, namely, temperature,
    heart rate, oxygen level, blood pressure, and blood glucose level via non-invasive
    measurement through an infrared (IR) sensor. A gateway node, the Arduino Nano,
    is used that collects all the data through sensors and sends them to an online
    server through Wi-Fi connectivity. Secondly, we propose a smart algorithm to effectively
    send data to a server that gives priority to abnormal ranges of data, which can
    eventually lead to unhealthy and critical condition prediction by the ML algorithms
    that are applied so that doctors can effectively deal with emergency patients,
    prioritizing them over patients whose body vital measurements, like BP, heart
    rate, temperature, blood glucose level, and oxygen saturation, are in normal ranges.
    Thirdly, we have designed a hardware circuit for the non-invasive measurement
    of blood glucose levels, as glucometers available in underdeveloped areas are
    dependent on invasive methods of measurement. Frequent penetration of needles
    for continuous monitoring is painful and skin-damaging. The proposed glucose sensor
    for diabetic patients is a wearable sensor on the thumb, and there is only a need
    for light penetration and keeping the thumb in a direction such that the LED light
    does not face the nail portion of the thumb. The details of this sensor are discussed
    in the proposed methodology and architecture section. In addition to this, we
    validate our proposed smart wearable healthcare system architecture and its measurements
    with standard apparatus measurements that are already available in hospitals.
    Moreover, our system also predicts a patient’s current health condition based
    on the sensor data measures collectively using ML algorithms. We use support vector,
    Gaussian Naïve Bayes, decision tree classifier, random forest, and Bernoulli NB
    and ML techniques for the prediction of health conditions, including healthy,
    moderately unhealthy, unhealthy, very unhealthy, critical, and very critical,
    based on classified sensed data. For accurate health condition predictions, appropriate
    rules and fuzzy sets are needed; thus, using fuzzy logic, we developed a fuzzy
    logic-based decision support system for making decisions about patient’s health
    conditions. We achieved results in the form of accuracy, precision, recall, and
    F1 scores for our proposed system’s patient records and also for the standard
    apparatus’ records and compared them. When designing a healthcare system using
    non-invasive glucose measurement and performing clinical procedures with NIR light,
    it is important to make certain assumptions to simplify the model and provide
    a basis for its development and performance evaluation. Here are some assumptions
    we made: It was assumed that patients do not have serious skin diseases that cause
    redness or itching due to light absorption. It was assumed that patients will
    not have applied any medicine or compound on a skin area that faces the hardware,
    such that measurements will not be affected. To address the skin issues in a clinical
    scenario, users and healthcare professionals have to be educated about the system’s
    limitations and the best practices for using the device in patients with dermatological
    conditions. Proper sensor placement and skin preparation help in mitigating some
    challenges [20,21]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses
    related work. Section 3 presents the proposed architecture and the work methodology.
    Section 4 presents the results and discussion. Finally, conclusions and future
    work are outlined in Section 5. 2. Related Work Diabetes is a chronic disease
    or group of metabolic disorders. Blood glucose levels in the body are elevated,
    which is either due to a lack of insulin production or high sugar levels in the
    circulatory system [18]. This is due to malfunction of the pancreatic beta cells.
    It affects different parts of the body, and risks include pancreatic disease,
    heart disease, hypertension, kidney failure, pancreatic problems, nerve damage,
    foot problems, ketoacidosis, visual impairment, and many more. Eye problems, waterfalls,
    and glaucoma are also potential risks. There are various reasons behind the causes,
    such as lifestyle, lack of activity, weight gain, smoking, high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia),
    high blood pressure (hyperglycemia), and others, which can be targeted to treat
    diabetes. It affects various age groups, from adolescence to adulthood. The pancreas
    is an organ located in the midriff area. Gangil et al. [15] proposed a strategy
    that uses an ML technique, namely, an SVM, for classification for diabetes analysis.
    The ML strategy for diabetes management is based on a high-dimensional therapeutic
    data set. The experiment proved that the vector machine could be used to effectively
    diagnose diabetes. Jara et al. [10] discussed smart sensing technologies that
    provide foundational data collection capabilities for IoT applications. Boursianis
    et al. [2] described the varieties of smart monitoring applications that have
    revolutionized several services not only in healthcare but in many other domains,
    like agriculture, networks, traffic control, and education, and in emergencies
    like fire disasters [22]. Challoner et al. [16] described smart healthcare services
    and digital health diagnosis performed using IoT. Alturjman et al. [4] discussed
    the authentication, integrity, and privacy of data using WSN in IoT. Rghioui et
    al. considered [23] continuous monitoring of patients using an IoT embedded system
    that makes health predictions based on machine learning algorithms, where an SMO
    algorithm gave the best results. Its results were evaluated in terms of accuracy,
    precision, and sensitivity. The IoT plays a dynamic role in the integration of
    physical and virtual items, as stated by Kavithamani et al. [1], who also discussed
    a health monitoring system based on IoT. IoT is crucial for developing cutting-edge
    technologies like wireless sensor networks, AI, cloud computing, robotics, transportation,
    and healthcare systems. According to the authors of [1,24], healthcare systems
    have seen many improvements, but glucose monitoring systems are still expensive
    and have several other drawbacks. The authors discuss the design of a glucose
    monitoring system based on IoT sensor devices in this work. The system can monitor
    real-time glucose levels, body temperature, and contextual data and give them
    to doctors and patients in a graphical and understandable format. Additionally,
    this model added push notifications to alerts. Smart healthcare or e-health plays
    a vital role in treatment and smart health prediction in diabetes. With the integration
    of technology and data-driven approaches, healthcare providers can offer more
    personalized and efficient care to diabetes patients [25]. Islam et al. [26] introduced
    the development of a smart healthcare monitoring system in an IoT environment.
    Five sensors are used: a heartbeat sensor, a body temperature sensor, a room temperature
    sensor, a CO sensor, and a CO2 sensor. The patient readings are conveyed to the
    doctor’s portal and the doctor will give recommendations accordingly. The hardware
    they used was an ESP32, a heartbeat sensor, a temperature sensor, a CO sensor,
    and a CO2 sensor. The architecture of this paper involves the collection of data
    from the sensors that are received by the ESP32, and then these measurements are
    transferred to a web server which is connected to the user interface of medical
    staff. The implementation details involve actual readings compared with observed
    readings for their proposed system [18]. We also followed this basic architecture
    of data collection, sending them to the gateway, and then to a server for doctors’
    access, additionally giving ML support for data classification. To demonstrate
    the novelty of the work, we also needed to give collective results for all classes
    and thus used fuzzy logic for making rules and finally predicting the patient’s
    health condition accurately [27]. The predicted health condition is a predicted
    doctor’s decision which can be analyzed by the doctor, and they can give recommendations
    based on it. The system helps make doctors’ decisions smarter. Rghioui et al.
    [23] worked on a smart architecture for diabetic patient monitoring using ML algorithms.
    They monitored blood sugar levels, temperature, and physical activity using portable
    sensors and collected data. They collected data day-wise, in the morning, afternoon,
    and evening, in addition to the no. of steps taken in a day. The data are classified
    with a number of ML algorithms and compared, and the performance results are transferred
    to the doctor for deciding on the patient’s health. Chatrati et al. [28] presented
    a smart home health monitoring system for predicting type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
    For these two diseases, they collected readings of blood pressure and blood glucose
    levels. For the prediction of status, they used ML algorithms and then gave notifications
    of status. The traditional approach was used; no rules were defined in it. The
    status representation is in the form of a category they found. Qureshi et al.
    [29] presented an accurate and dynamic predictive model for a smart M-Health system
    using machine learning which they used to collect data through mobile applications.
    They proposed a secure Android application and reliable data storage and then
    transferred data for further ML processing. By means of ML algorithms, they classified
    cardiovascular diseases according to the seriousness of the conditions. They split
    the data into four folds, and predictive model decision trees and an SVM are used
    for prediction analysis. The performance of the predictive model with the benchmark
    was obtained in the form of accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. Istepanian et
    al. [7] focused on the diagnosis of diabetes patients, and Rghioui et al. [23]
    worked on 5G technology, an invasive blood glucose measurement technique, and
    data classification utilizing ML algorithms. The data collection of sensors and
    smart devices like microcontrollers that receive data signals from sensors and
    deliver them to a server over Wi-Fi was also covered in this article. Similarly,
    Kavithmani et al. [1] employed NIR and continuous monitoring for diabetic patients
    to measure blood glucose levels. Photoplethysmography was used in this article
    for light with wavelengths of 525 nm, 660 nm, and 950 nm. Additionally, the authors
    contrasted the data gathered using the suggested system method versus conventional
    techniques. Rghioui et al. [23], suggested an IoT system for tracking health,
    and they also provided an alarm system for examination and analysis by doctors.
    They also made use of sensors for blood pressure, temperature, respiration rate,
    and heart rate, and data were collected through a gateway MCU (microcontroller
    unit). As a result, continuous health monitoring systems are becoming more and
    more developed over time as a result of the present need to stop the spread of
    diseases and reduce the death rate. A smart monitor study also suggested an IoT
    healthcare system that works on two sets of data connected to physiological activity
    and uses advanced electronic instruments for signal measurement like myRIO [30].
    To separate features from a variety of sensory data, they presented a deep neural
    network. There has been a lot of effort and research on medical IoT in recent
    years, covering a variety of topics. One illustration is the use of mobile devices
    in the control of diabetes. To enable their services to be completed in the future,
    new technologies are being implemented, such as the connection of IPV6 and 6loWPAN
    in fourth-generation networks [10]. Rghiui et al. [23], in comparison to data
    gathering in non-real-time environments without temporal accuracy, adopted this
    technology for glucose monitoring, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate data
    over a given period [11]. The system uses non-invasive sensors to measure glucose
    levels. By using the opto-physiological model, such measurements are attainable.
    There are diverse healthcare systems for diseases like blood pressure, hypertension,
    and diabetes [25]. These diseases require long-run continuous monitoring; thus,
    there is a need for portable smart healthcare systems that gather sensitive data
    from the patient’s body and transfer it to the relevant physician. Abrar et al.
    [5] focused on hypertension as a problem for health since it can cause several
    chronic heart conditions, including stroke, renal failure, and cardiac arrest.
    Multiple risk factors, including a person’s lifestyle and genetics, can result
    in hypertension. For doctors, it is challenging to stop certain illnesses developing
    early. Although there have been many ML-based solutions suggested, none of them
    has been tailored for the diagnosis of hypertension. Existing models are not updated
    with fresh data. Since there is no method for identifying anomalies in data, the
    outcomes are unpredictable. This research introduced a multi-agent system that
    can compute missing values concerning time and provide personalized prediction
    of the risk of hypertension. Abrar et al. [5] obtained real-time blood pressure
    readings using a Gaussian process model. The new input data are also learned by
    this model. The Framingham estimator, which can compute data over four years,
    was used to estimate the risk of hypertension. Blood pressure data for the Malaysian
    population were used to calculate the mean absolute error, the root mean square
    error, and the mean square error. The proposed multi-agent model was more accurate
    at making predictions than the current prediction techniques. A framework that
    utilizes a multi-agent approach was suggested in this paper. The development of
    a personalized system that can forecast the possibility of hypertension was the
    aim of this framework. This technology collects blood pressure readings at regular
    intervals and evaluates the results 24 h later. It foretells the likelihood of
    hypertension. The multi-agent-based methodology was used for that system. This
    method allows for the division of the work among four separate agents, each of
    which carries out a specific mission. Munir et al. [31] described an intelligent
    and smart watering system that uses fuzzy logic and blockchaining for correct
    decisions about the consumption of water in small gardens. Thus, fuzzy logic is
    a supportive technique for decision making in smart systems. CR-based smart healthcare
    systems using tree-based ML algorithms were used in [32]. Through this article,
    we learn that ML is helpful and playing a role in healthcare systems. Here, we
    propose a patient monitoring system for diabetic patients that involves changes
    to the architecture described in this article in terms of the sensors used and
    the inclusion of a smart algorithm, an AI and ML hybrid approach being used in
    our proposal. As our architecture for transferring data from the sensor to the
    application was also layered, Table 3 provides a comparative analysis of IoT systems
    that employ a layered architecture and sensing parameters for data collection.
    Sarwar et al. [27] worked on a fire detection system using an adaptive neuro fuzzy
    inference system. True detection of likelihood of fire is a novelty of their work.
    The implementation was performed in MATLAB. This system uses smart sensing technology
    for fire detection. Afreen et al. [33] worked on an IoT-based monitoring and notification
    system using predictive analysis via an artificial neural network. Fruits and
    vegetables play an important role in minimizing the impact of some diseases; thus,
    the work focused on cold storage. The factors analyzed by the monitoring system
    were gauge temperature, relative humidity, and other vital ambient environmental
    parameters, such as luminosity and the concentration of gases. Shafi et al. [12]
    also utilized IoT and machine learning for an agricultural storage combustion
    system. Cotton storage has a number of limitations and challenges, i.e., heat
    due to microbial growth, exothermic and endothermic reactions in storage areas,
    and extreme weather conditions in storage areas. Monitoring and real-time sensing
    predictions are performed by an artificial network and machine learning to control
    sudden change and to avoid damage to the quality of cotton. Saifullah et al. [34]
    also introduced a smart sensing system for radiation monitoring and a warning
    system. Radiofrequency electromagnetic rays have a significant impact on the human
    body; thus, using machine learning, various levels of EMR intensities are analyzed.
    Table 3. Comparison between related work and proposed model.  There were three
    articles found on IoT-based human-centered healthcare systems. A comparative analysis
    of key features of these three contributions is shown in Table 4. The key features
    discussed for comparative analysis are the ML algorithms used in each article;
    the data collection approach is smart sensing for remote monitoring with wearable
    sensors. Healthcare services can be handled at a personalized level, but their
    level, medium or high, varies according to the article. Smart data processing
    by algorithms and decision support are key features that are not introduced as
    compared to our proposed work. Table 4. Articles on HCDs and comparison with proposed
    work. Hameed et al. [32] studied an intelligent IoT-based healthcare system developed
    using a fuzzy neural network. This study presents a cloud-based framework utilizing
    sensor and UCI repository data. The nearest neighbor (NN) classifier is preferred
    in it for disease identification. The architecture is also different from ours,
    and, in comparison to these authors’ work, we used ML algorithms for correct predictions
    [21,37]. 3. Proposed Architecture and Methodology 3.1. Layered Architecture In
    our smart healthcare wearable system, we propose a seven-layer architecture including
    a perception layer, a network layer, a gateway layer, an ML layer, an AI-assistance
    decision support layer, and a cloud layer, as represented in Figure 1. Perception
    Layer: This layer represents the interface between the physical world and the
    digital system. It comprises sensors, wearables, and other data acquisition devices.
    This layer collects data from various sensors (health monitors) and preprocesses
    raw sensor data to extract meaningful information. Data filtering filters out
    noise and irrelevant data to improve data quality. Network Layer: This layer focuses
    on data communication and management. It ensures seamless data transmission between
    the perception and gateway layers. This layer transmits preprocessed data from
    the perception layer to the gateway layer. It also utilizes network protocols
    for efficient data transmission. The challenge with network layer is to ensure
    medical device safety against cyber-attacks or external interferences. Designing
    a communication architecture in a server like Thing Speak to ensure medical device
    safety against cyber-attacks or external interference is crucial for healthcare
    applications. For our proposed system, we used Thing Speak to store IoT data.
    Thing Speak follows specific design aspects to enhance medical device safety.
    Gateway Layer: This layer acts as an intermediary between the edge devices and
    the cloud server. This server has strict access controls and user authentication
    mechanisms. Only authorized users have access to IoT device data. The HTTPS secure
    protocol, which resists any interception or intrusion of data during transmission
    from IoT devices, is used. API keys are used to secure data and to control access
    [38]. This ensures device authentication and thus authorizes and secures data
    effectively. The system on which we are accessing data is firewalled, and intrusion
    detection that does not allow any intrusion is used. Data stored on Thing Speak
    can be protected. Other protection measures can be applied, but we are not using
    them currently for our data protection. Gateway layer processes and filters the
    incoming data before forwarding it to the cloud. It aggregates and organizes data
    received from multiple devices for efficient processing. This layer conducts preliminary
    analytics and data preprocessing to reduce the data load on the cloud. Here, we
    have applied a smart algorithm to prioritize the emergency data of those patients
    whose sensor readings are abnormal such that they require urgent healthcare service.
    This layer converts data to a format compatible with cloud-based processing. ML
    Layer+ (AI) Layer: In this layer, collected data are loaded and, after this, data
    preprocessing and anomaly handling is performed. As there may be inadequate values,
    for instance, temperature values, which cannot be 0, 3, or 7, anomalies are removed
    in this layer. After preprocessing, understanding and feature extraction of the
    data is performed, and classes of data in different ranges are made. These classes
    are used as an input to the AI layer and fuzzy logic decision support for making
    rules and crisp decisions is applied. After decision support from the fuzzy logic,
    the layer trains ML models on real-time data to learn patterns and identifies
    unusual patterns or outliers in the data that may indicate potential health issues.
    It also predicts the likelihood of certain diseases or health conditions based
    on input data. Our reasons for choosing fuzzy logic to help in classifying data
    and making decisions are as follows: Fuzzy logic is well-suited for situations
    where data are uncertain and vague. It allows for a clearer understanding of data
    and can handle cases where traditional binary logic might fail. Fuzzy logic enables
    a finer level of granularity in decision making. Instead of “yes” or “no” decisions,
    it allows for more options along a spectrum. This is particularly useful in healthcare,
    where patients’ health parameters can have varying degrees of severity. Fuzzy
    logic uses linguistic terms and rules that are more intuitive and human-centric.
    This makes it easier for healthcare professionals and patients to understand and
    trust the decision-making process. Fuzzy logic-based systems can adapt and learn
    from data over time. This is important in healthcare, as patient conditions and
    responses to treatments can change. Prediction Layer: This layer is responsible
    for making predictions and generating actionable insights based on the results
    obtained from the ML layer. It also provides predictions regarding a patient’s
    health condition, potential risks, and unhealthy conditions. This layer offers
    treatment suggestions and personalized information on a patient’s current condition
    which a doctor can use to take further measures and recommendations based on the
    ML model outputs. It also generates alerts for healthcare professionals or patients
    based on critical health indicators or predicted events. Cloud Layer: The cloud
    layer is the centralized computing and storage infrastructure where data are stored,
    processed, and analyzed. This layer stores vast amounts of historical and real-time
    data securely. The continuous monitoring of diabetic patients requires continuous
    uploading of data, for which a storage and access layer is required. Planning
    for rollback or reverting to a previous state is helpful in managing updates and
    the security of data. User education regarding updates and security patches means
    that users can be informed regarding any changes and updates [39]. Regular backups
    can be performed by downloading data and uploading them to a cloud for their recovery
    in case of any vulnerability or security issue. The basic building blocks of the
    IoT layered architecture consist of four primitive layers Figure 2: a sensor layer,
    a network layer, a middleware layer for data storage and processing services,
    and, fourthly, an application layer, according to the domain and sensors used.
    Figure 1 and Figure 2 provide a comparison of the layers of the proposed work
    and the key IoT building blocks. In the proposed work, the ML and AI layers are
    added with a cloud support layer for continuously updating our patients’ data.
    Figure 2. IoT basic building blocks [30]. 3.2. Proposed Architecture of the Smart
    Decision Support System Before the detailed description of the working methodology
    and component-based architectural details and after discussing the layers involved
    in our proposed work, these layers are repeated for data collected from standard
    apparatus for data validation purposes. Figure 3 represents the workflow followed
    for the proposed methodology validation. The work methodology for sensor data
    is synchronized according to the layered architecture, but the workflow for data
    collected from the standard apparatus first involves the organization of data
    on all vital signs for preprocessing and removal of anomalies. Then, data are
    loaded for the ML process, where preprocessing is again performed automatically
    by checking for missing and zero values. A similar feature extraction step to
    that used for sensed data is performed. Ranges of data sets are used as an input
    for the fuzzy logic decision support system. Fuzzy logic converts these fuzzy
    sets into linguistic variables, and membership functions and inference engines
    then give crisp values for health conditions which are compared according to the
    proposed methodology steps through different evaluation measures like accuracy,
    F1, and precision scores. Figure 3. Flowchart of proposed work with system benchmarking.
    The smart healthcare system comprises 5 sensors for taking health measures of
    diabetic patients. The sensors involved are temperature, blood pressure, oxygen
    level, heart rate, and sugar level sensors, as shown in Figure 4. These human-centered
    IoT devices are wearable on the hand and thus transfer data signals to the Arduino
    Nano microcontroller, in which we have applied a smart adaptive algorithm that
    analyzes the sensed data provided to it by limited normal health ranges through
    an array data structure and by analyzing personalized reading data packets sent
    on priority bases. Thus, emergency data indicating critical and very critical
    conditions are prioritized and give alerts to diabetic patients with beeps. In
    remote monitoring for long-term diseases, there is a need to give alerts and send
    data efficiently so that a patient can utilize intended services like a physical
    presence in the hospital. Figure 4. Architecture of smart decision-making support
    system. The smart decision-making system, the following steps need to be performed:
    Data collection from sensors attached to the diabetic patient’s human body. Temporal
    changes in health condition can be overlooked by continuous monitoring of data
    and data variation patterns. The doctor can view patterns and graphs on the server
    that indicate gradual changes in health and previous health statuses predicted
    by the system. This can minimize the effect of temporal changes and support decisions
    regarding medication and dosage changes. The Arduino Nano is used as a microcontroller
    that receives the sensed data. A smart priority algorithm is applied to sensed
    data to give priority to emergency data of a patient so that emergency and critical
    patients can receive doctor’s recommendations effectively. Data are uploaded to
    the IoT server, as the data for continuous monitoring exist in large amounts.
    Data preprocessing and removal of inconsistent and missing data from stored data
    are performed to mitigate issues. For diabetic patient health condition predictions,
    we applied 5 ML algorithms for current health condition prediction. In designing
    a correct rule base and prepositions, we applied AI using fuzzy logic. The patient’s
    condition is predicted, and the prediction is sent to the relevant practitioner
    for further suggestions. 3.3. Fuzzy Logic-Based Decision-Support Smart Healthcare
    System Fuzzy logic, a mathematical framework and computing paradigm, addresses
    uncertainty and imprecision in decision making and system control. It was introduced
    as an extension of classical (or “crisp”) logic to model and handle uncertainty,
    undefined concepts, and ambiguous or incomplete information. In classical logic,
    propositions are either true or false (binary), and there is no room for intermediate
    or partial truth values. Fuzzy logic, on the other hand, allows for a gradual
    transition between true and false, assigning a degree of membership between 0
    and 1 to a proposition, representing the “fuzziness” or uncertainty associated
    with it. 3.3.1. Fuzzification Fuzzy sets are a generalization of classical sets,
    where an element can belong to a set to a certain degree, represented by a membership
    function. Membership values range from 0 (not a member) to 1 (fully a member).
    Considering the problem and understanding data classes and defined ranges of data
    variables like blood pressure, heart rate, glucose measure, oxygen level, and
    temperature, we use fuzzy logic for removing uncertainties and to obtain a defined
    rule base to determine a crisp state. Thus, in the ML process, model training
    is performed based on smart inference, and the evaluation base is defined by fuzzy
    logic. For fuzzification, the inputs of different data ranges and linguistic variables
    assigned to these data ranges. Linguistic variables for blood pressure: (low,
    normal, elevated, high) Linguistic variables for temperature: (low, normal, high)
    Linguistic variables for glucose level: (low, normal, elevated, high) Linguistic
    variables for heart rate: (low, normal, high) Linguistic variables for oxygen
    saturation (critical, worrisome, normal) Blood pressure For defining the membership
    functions for blood pressure categories (low, normal, elevated, and high), we
    use trapezoidal membership functions to represent the gradual transition between
    categories. Trapezoidal membership functions are defined by four parameters: ‘a’,
    ‘b’, ‘c’, and ‘d’, where ‘a’ and ‘d’ represent the start and end points of the
    plateau, while ‘b’ and ‘c’ denote the points where the membership function initiates
    its ascent and descent, respectively. In the following, trapezoidal membership
    functions are defined for the specified blood pressure categories considering
    the data ranges used after data analysis of blood pressure: 0–90, low; 91–119,
    normal; 120–129, elevated; and 130, high. These ranges are defined based on feature
    extraction from data, expert opinions, and research analysis of feature ranges
    for adults in the age group 22 to 60, as these factor ranges differ for the results
    and old-age people. Low blood pressure: function parameters: (a = 0, b = 0, c
    = 60, d = 90) Normal blood pressure: function parameters: (a = 80, b = 90, c =
    100, d = 120) Elevated blood pressure: function parameters: (a = 110, b = 120,
    c = 130, d = 140) High blood pressure: function parameters: (a = 130, b = 140,
    c = 200, d = 200) In this case, the membership functions will be trapezoidal,
    which allows for a plateau in the middle of each category, representing a gradual
    transition in blood pressure levels. In Figure 5, the blue line represents the
    membership values for low blood pressure, the purple line represents the membership
    values for high blood pressure, the yellow line represents the membership values
    for elevated blood pressure, and the red line represents the membership values
    for normal blood pressure. Figure 5. Membership functions for blood pressure.
    b. Temperature To define membership functions for temperature categories (low,
    normal, and high), triangular membership functions are employed given their suitability
    for this categorization. A triangular membership function is defined by three
    parameters: a (start), b (center), and c (end). The degree of membership rises
    linearly from ‘a’ to ‘b’ and then falls linearly from ‘b’ to ‘c’. The triangular
    membership functions defined for the specified temperature categories considering
    the data ranges were used after data analysis: 0–34, low; 35–38, normal; and 39,
    high. Low temperature: function parameters: a = 0, b = 0, c = 17 Normal temperature:
    function parameters: a = 15, b = 20, c = 25 High temperature: function parameters:
    a = 23, b = 30, c = 40 In Figure 6, the blue line represents the membership values
    for low temperature, the blue line represents the membership values for high temperature,
    and the red line represents the membership values for medium temperature. Figure
    6. Membership functions for temperature. c. Glucose level For defining the membership
    functions for glucose level categories (low, normal, elevated, and high), we use
    trapezoidal membership functions to represent the gradual transition between categories.
    The trapezoidal membership functions have four parameters: ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, and
    ‘d’, where ‘a’ and ‘d’ are the start and end points of the plateau and ‘b’ and
    ‘c’ are the points where the membership function starts to rise and fall, respectively.
    The trapezoidal membership functions for the specified glucose level categories
    of diabetic patients considering the data ranges mentioned below were used after
    data analysis: 0–69, low; 70–100, normal; 101–124, elevated; and 125, high. Low
    glucose level: function parameters: a = 0, b = 0, c = 40, d = 70 Normal glucose
    level: function parameters: a = 50, b = 70, c = 90, d = 100 Elevated glucose level:
    function parameters: a = 90, b = 100, c = 120, d = 125 High glucose level: function
    parameters: a = 120, b = 125, c = 200, d = 200 In Figure 7, the blue line represents
    the membership values for low blood glucose, the orange line represents the membership
    values for normal blood glucose, the yellow line represents the membership values
    for elevated blood glucose, and the purple line represents the membership values
    for high blood glucose. Figure 7. Membership functions for glucose level. d. Heart
    rate For defining the membership functions for the heart rate categories (low,
    normal, and high), we used trapezoidal membership functions to represent the gradual
    transition between categories. The trapezoidal membership functions have four
    parameters: ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, and ‘d’, where ‘a’ and ‘d’ are the start and end points
    of the plateau and ‘b’ and ‘c’ are the points where the membership function starts
    to rise and fall, respectively. The trapezoidal membership functions for the specified
    heart rate categories considering the data ranges were used after data analysis:
    0–109, low; 110–155, normal; and 156, high. Low heart rate: trapezoidal membership
    function parameters: a = 0, b = 0, c = 90, d = 109 Normal heart rate: trapezoidal
    membership function parameters: a = 100, b = 110, c = 145, d = 155 High heart
    rate: trapezoidal membership function parameters: a = 150, b = 156, c = 200, d
    = 200 In Figure 8, the blue line represents the membership values for low heart
    rate, the red line represents the membership values for normal heart rate, and
    the yellow line represents the membership values for high heart rate. Figure 8.
    Membership functions for heart rate. e. Oxygen saturation Let us define the trapezoidal
    membership functions for the specified oxygen saturation categories considering
    the data ranges that were used after data analysis: 0–89, critical; 90–93, worrisome;
    and 94, normal. Critical oxygen saturation: function parameters: a = 0, b = 0,
    c = 80, d = 89 Worrisome oxygen saturation: function parameters: a = 85, b = 90,
    c = 95, d = 93 Normal oxygen saturation: function parameters: a = 92, b = 94,
    c = 100, d = 100 In Figure 9, the yellow line represents the membership values
    for low oxygen level, the green line represents the membership values for normal
    oxygen level, and the red line represents the membership value for high oxygen
    level. Figure 9. Membership functions for oxygen level. 3.3.2. Fuzzy Rule Base
    A set of rules were defined that connect the input fuzzy sets to the output fuzzy
    sets. The following rules typically use operators like AND, OR, and NOT to connect
    antecedents and consequents. IF (Temp == Normal) AND (HR == Normal) AND (SpO2
    == Critical) AND (BP == Elevated) AND (GL == Normal) THEN (Condition == Critical)
    (1) IF (Temp == Low) AND (HR == Low) AND (SpO2 == Worrisome) AND (BP == Normal)
    AND (GL == Elevated) THEN (Condition == Unhealthy) (2) IF (Temp == Normal) AND
    (HR == Low) AND (SpO2 == Normal) AND (BP == Low) AND (GL == Low) THEN (Condition
    == Very Critical) (3) IF (Temp == Low) AND (HR == Low) AND (SpO2 == Normal) AND
    (BP == Low) AND (GL == High) THEN (Condition == Very Critical) (4) IF (Temp ==
    Low) AND (HR == Low) AND (SpO2 == Worrisome) AND (BP == Low) AND (GL == Normal)
    THEN (Condition == Very Unhealthy) (5) IF (Temp == High) AND (HR == Normal) AND
    (SpO2 == Worrisome) AND (BP == Normal) AND (GL == Normal) THEN (Condition == Moderate
    Unhealthy) (6) IF (Temp == Low) AND (HR == Normal) AND (SpO2 == Normal) AND (BP
    == Normal) AND (GL == Normal) THEN (Condition == Unhealthy) (7) 3.3.3. Inference
    Engine The fuzzy rules were defined based on doctors’ knowledge and data analysis.
    These rules are used to infer new fuzzy sets based on the fuzzy values obtained
    during fuzzification. Membership functions in fuzzy logic define how each data
    point from the universe of discourse (the range of possible values) is associated
    with a degree of membership to a particular fuzzy set. According to this context
    of sensor data, membership functions help in fuzzifying the crisp sensor readings
    into fuzzy values. 3.3.4. Rule Evaluation The degree of membership for each rule
    based on the sensor data’s fuzzified values is evaluated. There are many other
    rules based on combinations of factors affecting health with different membership
    values. 3.3.5. Defuzzification The fuzzy output set is converted into a crisp
    output, as shown in Table 5. Table 5. Conversion of fuzzy output to crisp output.
    3.3.6. Output According to all the inputs and after considering them aggregately,
    the predicted crisp value of the condition is obtained, as shown in Table 5. According
    to the condition status, the doctor can take further clinical action, make recommendations
    and dosage changes, especially for diabetic patients whose medication is dependent
    on current blood sugar values, and modify existing medication. 3.4. Implementation
    Details The circuit diagram below includes the initial sensing unit, where the
    received analog signal undergoes filtering. This signal is received from a photodetector
    containing approximately seven lights. The electric current from the photodetector
    is converted to voltage, in which process the resistances of different loads are
    used. The low-pass filter allows low-frequency components to pass through while
    attenuating high-frequency noise. The cut-off frequency of the LPF determines
    the point at which the filter starts dealing with higher-frequency components.
    The cut-off frequencies for the LPF in NIR glucose sensing range from 2 Hz to
    5 Hz, but the exact value depends on patient temporal changes and learning of
    patient patterns over time. The high-pass filter, on the other hand, permits high-frequency
    components to pass while attenuating low-frequency noise. The HPF cut-off frequencies
    range from 0.01 Hz to 0.1 Hz, or are even lower, depending on the characteristics
    of the noise sources, according to which the desired frequency range is adjusted
    for glucose measurement. Impact on signal quality: The LPF effectively reduces
    noise and unwanted low-frequency components that may arise from various sources,
    such as motion or baseline drift. It ensures that the signal primarily contains
    the relevant spectral information associated with glucose. Baseline drift can
    be caused by variations in instrument conditions, temperature, or skin tissue
    properties. The LPF helps remove this drift, allowing for more accurate glucose
    measurements. The HPF helps attenuate high-frequency noise, such as electrical
    interference or measurement artifacts. By eliminating high-frequency noise, the
    HPF contributes to improved signal quality. The frequency from the high-pass and
    low-pass filters is adjusted so that the minimum voltage is gained and the correct
    value is calculated. After this, an amplifier is attached with the Arduino Nano
    that converts the analogue values to digital values, which are then translated
    into textual actual values of the sensor. The experimental setup and protocols:
    Certainly, providing details on the experimental setup and protocols used for
    the validation of the proposed healthcare system with standard apparatus data
    is crucial for understanding the evaluation process. Below is a dedicated subsection
    that outlines the experimental setup and protocols and includes a comparison of
    tables for clarity Table 6. Table 6. User data set and demographics. For validation
    of the proposed smart sensing healthcare system, standard apparatus data were
    collected using reputed medical equipment. The measuring parameters involved were
    blood glucose level, oxygen level, blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate.
    Standard clinically validated apparatus were used for the standard data collection
    [40], as shown in Figure 10. In Figure 10, 1 represents the blood pressure measuring
    apparatus, 2 represents the glucometer, and 3 represents the digital thermometer.
    Sample population data were collected from a coherent group considered to be representative
    of the target population. The parameters for determining a similar sample population
    were age, gender, and health condition (diabetes). Figure 10. Standard clinical
    apparatus. Figure 11, a connected IoT circuit diagram, illustrates the communication
    of all the sensors and the controller to the LED in the proposed architecture.
    The subsequent block diagram in the same figure depicts the entire flow of data
    and procedures within the architecture. Figure 11. Connected IoT circuit diagram.
    Glucose Measuring Sensor for Diabetic Patients The non-invasive method for glucose
    measurement minimizes costs related to voltage, frequency (in Hz), and resistance.
    It achieves this while effectively managing noise and utilizing an amplifier to
    enhance the output signal. The NIR sensor is a non-invasive sensor that measures
    the interaction of near-infrared light with the glucose molecules in the body.
    The device emits light onto the skin and a detector measures the amount of light
    absorbed by glucose using an NIR light source with a 940 nm wavelength. Glucose
    levels are calculated by measuring the light signal intensity after penetration
    of the finger. The Beer–Lambert law serves as the foundational principle for calculating
    the anticipated measurement of glucose levels in the blood. The light that penetrates
    finger tissue obviously scatters after penetration and passes through blood. By
    measuring the absorbance of light and the concentration of blood fluid and the
    length of the path travelled by light, the blood glucose level is determined.
    We also validated the values of glucose in blood with standard invasive glucometer
    measurements [41,42]. Hardware: NIR glucometers consist of a light source, a detector
    (a photodetector), and the necessary optics to direct light onto the skin and
    collect the reflected or transmitted light. Factors that affect NIR sensors are
    wavelength, light penetration, effects on biological tissues, skin thickness,
    and light intensity. In the current work, all these factors are considered ideally.
    To address these challenges, several specific measures and techniques can be employed,
    like calibration; data processing; spectral retreatment; model selection and optimization;
    continuous glucose monitoring; hydration compensation; multi-spectral approaches;
    controlling environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and ambient light
    during measurements to reduce interference from external sources; user education;
    and clinical validation. Applying a calibration method to blood glucose data using
    an ML model involves the use of supervised learning techniques. In this case,
    supervised learning aims to build a predictive model that needs to be mapped with
    numerical measurements (features) to actual blood glucose values (targets). A
    data set is gathered that includes two key components: numerical measurements
    (features) and actual blood glucose values (targets). The features come from a
    device like an NIR sensor, and the targets are obtained through traditional blood
    glucose testing methods. The data are preprocessed to ensure that they are suitable
    for ML. This may involve handling missing values, scaling the features, and addressing
    outliers. The data set is then divided into training and validation sets. The
    training set is used to train the ML model; the validation procedure is used for
    benchmarking of the proposed system to evaluate the final model’s performance.
    ML algorithms are applied and trained using the training data set and validated
    with the standard data obtained via the standard clinical procedure. To reduce
    the impact of these factors, we performed 3 steps to overcome the challenges.
    - Adjusted the wavelength to the optimal range: 700 nm to 2500 nm; - Compared
    the data with standard and actual readings for validation; - User education. Challenges
    that need to be addressed in designing and implementing the proposed system are:
    Managing patient acceptance and collaboration in the practical implementation
    of a non-invasive glucose measurement system using NIR light in clinical settings
    is necessary for the system’s success, as is patient education regarding how the
    system works, as well as its positives and negatives, and ensuring the proper
    placement of sensors. For patient convenience, a non-invasive and painless method
    is used. Privacy and confidentiality concerns need to be addressed. Feedback should
    be sought if patients face any issues or discomfort. System readings are visible
    to the patient on screen to motivate the patient to perform the correct cooperative
    behavior. All readings on screen appear in a few milliseconds, creating curiosity
    and interest in using the system. 3.5. Dataset Details Data from diabetic patients
    are collected using the proposed system by patients placing their hands on each
    sensor. Within seconds, data from all the sensors are gathered, displayed on the
    LED, and uploaded to the server. The data uploaded to the server are also viewable
    by practitioners, who can suggest taking medicine accordingly. Data were also
    collected via standard apparatus, like blood pressure apparatus, thermometers,
    oximeters, ECG machines, and blood sampling for diabetic sugar-level reports that
    may be received after a few hours or on another day. The ranges and labels of
    data are shown in Table 7. There are challenges in long-term continuous monitoring
    and patient self-maintenance. Table 7. Ranges and labels for classification. The
    proposed system design is user-friendly and comfortable to use. Patients just
    need to wear the sensor on the finger or thumb, wherever is comfortable, for blood
    glucose measurement. For other measures, patients just need to put their fingers
    on the sensors. For correct sensor placement, the patient can attach the sensors
    with the hand or can wear gloves. In case the patient wants to wash their hands
    or cannot wear the sensor on the hand, they can also wear it on one of their toes.
    Patients can view all readings on the screen attached to the system, which can
    help patients to take proper doses and be aware of their condition and control
    their diet accordingly. User education and training also help to mitigate the
    issues that arise in long-term use. The guidelines for using the sensor system
    are: try not to bring the sensors into contact with water while wearing them and
    keep the batteries adequately charged or have a power supply nearby to ensure
    continuous monitoring. The data collected (see Table 5) through the designed system
    were first classified and annotated with different labels that would be helpful
    for data training, and some ML techniques were implemented that predict the diabetic
    patient’s condition as critical, unhealthy, very critical, very unhealthy, or
    moderate(Table 7). Data training, manipulation for missing values, classification
    of data, and implementation of some ML algorithms were performed in Jupiter notebook.
    Creating a full-fledged priority queue implementation in the Arduino Nano can
    be complex due to memory constraints and the lack of direct support for advanced
    data structures. However, we can simulate a simplified version of a priority queue
    to handle the given scenario. After collecting data, the second step is to apply
    the smart priority algorithm to this sensed data, as shown in Algorithm 1 This
    smart algorithm is also a novel feature of our work designed to process and effectively
    utilize a large amount of data. The algorithm used is described in Priority Algorithm
    1 on sensed data. Algorithm 1 To filter and prioritize sensor data over the network
    1   Input: 1. Initialize constants and data structures:     Set Normal_Sensor1_Min
    = Vmin     Set Normal_ Sensor1_Max = Vmax     Set Normal_Sensor2_Min = Vmin     Set
    Normal_ Sensor2_Max = Vmax (for all sensors) 2   Input 2: Initialize sensor data
    array: Initialize an array sensor queue of size 5 to hold sensor data objects
    for each sensor 3   Loop:     Read data from each sensor and update sensor queue    For
    each sensor:     Read sensor data       Update sensor queue with the new data
    (sensor ID, value, priority) 4   Check for out-of-range sensor data:     If sensor
    data are out of range:       Set higher priority for the data packet        Update
    sensor queue priority for the respective sensor 5   Process the priority queue:     For
    each sensor in sensor queue:       If priority is high:         Trigger alert
    and send data packet        Alerting mechanism (sound)        Send the data packet
    with higher priority 6   Repeat the loop (periodically to continuously monitor
    the sensors and handle alerts)    End algorithm Priority Algorithm 1 arrays are
    used to represent sensor data along with a basic mechanism to prioritize alerts
    for out-of-range sensor readings.These readings are then calibrated by fuzzy logic
    that impacts the health condition outcome.as shown in Table 8. Table 8. Calibration
    of sensor data with fuzzy logic system. 4. Results The results section corresponds
    to the account of the methodology given in Section 3. According to the methodology
    section organization, firstly, the system validation process is presented in Figure
    3. So, the first section on results comprises the system validation with standard
    system analysis and evaluation measures. Secondly, for the smart decision support
    system, the hybrid AI and ML approach is discussed along with the layered architecture
    and fuzzy logic-based decision support. Thus, in the second section on results,
    fuzzy logic-based linguistic variables and class comparison results are presented
    which also give an in-depth comparison between the standard system and the proposed
    system (see Table 8). Thirdly, in Section 3.4, the system’s implementation details
    are discussed regarding all sensors and the microcontroller connectivity. The
    results for the blood glucose sensor and priority algorithm are also discussed
    in this section. Fourthly, data set details are discussed, and the data set analysis
    and histograms are also presented. At the end, an overall impact analysis along
    with a few results are discussed that give insightful knowledge to experts and
    practitioners regarding health condition decision making. 4.1. System Validation
    Sample population data were collected from a coherent group of considered to be
    representative of the target population. The parameters for the sample population
    were age, gender, and health condition (diabetes). Considering the same parameters
    for both measurements, both system measurements were compared with respect to
    evaluation criteria, including precision, accuracy, F1 score, and recall. Further
    comparative analysis is also given in the following table on the basis of a statistical
    analysis. In the comparison (Table 9), the means and standard deviations of measurements
    obtained from both the standard apparatus and the proposed healthcare system are
    presented for each health parameter. The mean absolute error (MAE) is provided
    as a measure of the absolute difference between the two sets of measurements.
    Smaller MAE values indicate better agreement between the proposed system and standard
    apparatus. Table 9. Data set validation. System validation or benchmarking was
    performed by comparing the data collected with the proposed system with those
    collected with the standard apparatus and by applying the proposed methodology
    to both sets of data, as shown in Figure 3. In Table 10, the accuracy, precision,
    F1, and recall scores calculated for the proposed portable IoT system for diabetic
    patients are presented. The support vector algorithm achieved scores of 70% for
    accuracy, 30% for F1 score, 27% for precision, and 36% for recall. Gaussian Naïve
    Bayes achieved 55% for accuracy, 38% for F1 score, 37% for precision, and 48%
    for recall. The decision tree classifier achieved 80% for accuracy, 53% for F1
    score, 50% for precision, and 60% for recall. Table 10. Evaluation measures for
    the proposed IoT system. Correspondingly, the random forest classifier achieved
    85% accuracy, which is the highest level in comparison with the other ML algorithms.
    The Bernoulli Naïve Bayes algorithm achieved 55% for accuracy, 20% for F1 score,
    31% for precision, and 80% for recall, like the results presented in [8,29]. Figure
    12 presents a comparison of the support vector algorithm, Gaussian NB, the decision
    tree classifier, the random forest classifier, and Bernoulli NB in terms of accuracy,
    F1, precision, and recall scores for the proposed system. Figure 12. Comparison
    of ML algorithms for IoT proposed system. In Table 11, accuracy, precision, F1,
    and recall scores calculated for the proposed portable IoT system are presented.
    The support vector algorithm achieved 70% for accuracy, 30% for F1 score, 27%
    for precision, and 36% for recall Gaussian Naïve Bayes achieved 40% for accuracy,
    36% for F1 score, 37% for precesion, and 48% for recall. The decision tree classifier
    achieved 80% for accuracy, 53% for F1 score, 50% for precision, and 60% for recall.
    Correspondingly, the random forest classifier achieved 90% for accuracy, which
    was the highest level in comparison with the other ML algorithms. The Bernoulli
    Naïve Bayes algorithm achieved 55% for accuracy, 20% for F1 score, 21% for precision,
    and 24% for recall. The data shown in Table 11 are also illustrated in Figure
    13. Figure 13. Heatmap comparison of ML algorithms for standard data. Table 11.

    of the support vector algorithm, Gaussian NB, the decision tree classifier, the
    random forest classifier, and Bernoulli NB in terms of accuracy, F1, recall, and
    precision scores for both sets of data collected with the proposed system and
    the standard apparatus for diabetic patients. Figure 14 represents a comparison
    of the ML algorithm results for both the standard and proposed system approaches
    in terms of accuracy, precision, F1, and recall scores. Figure 14. Comparison
    of ML algorithms. In Table 12 and Figure 15, the accuracy scores for the proposed
    system achieved by all five ML algorithms are compared with the standard apparatus
    measurements. According to the table, the support vector algorithm, the decision
    tree classifier, and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes gave similar results, which demonstrates
    the validity of the proposed system. Figure 15. Comparison of accuracy scores
    of the proposed and standard systems with respect to ML data. Table 12. Accuracy
    comparison of proposed system with benchmark system. 4.2. Results Analysis for
    the ML and AI Layers According to the methodology, the results obtained from the
    AI layer and the ML layer are discussed in this section. The output crisp values
    obtained from the AI layer serve as inputs to the ML layer of the layered architecture,
    which predicts the health condition considering all the vital signs data received
    from the AI layer, as shown in Figure 16. In Figure 16, the star symbols represent
    the data obtained with the standard apparatus and the red squares represent the
    data obtained with the proposed system. Figure 16. ML classification comparison
    between standard and proposed systems. In Figure 17, a staircase line plot and
    a scatter plot give separate visualizations of the different data sets and also
    the relationship between the two data sets (i-e) for the standard and proposed
    systems. The red scatter points give the correlations between the linguistic variables
    and the ML classes of the standard blood pressure data, and the blue stairs show
    the correlations between the linguistic variables of the data labels and the ML
    classes of the proposed experimental blood pressure data. Figure 17. ML classification
    comparison between standard and proposed systems. Figure 18 shows a staircase
    line plot and a scatter plot giving separate visualizations of the different data
    sets and also the relationship between the two data sets (i-e) collected with
    the standard and proposed systems. The red scatter points give correlations between
    the linguistic variables and the ML classes of the standard blood glucose data,
    and the blue stairs show the correlations between the linguistic variables of
    the data labels and the ML classes of the experimental blood glucose data obtained
    with the proposed system. Figure 18. ML classification comparison between standard
    and proposed systems. If one standard data set represents continuous variables
    and the other represents categorical variables, their combination can highlight
    variations in both sets of data simultaneously. Figure 19 shows a staircase line
    plot and scatter plot giving separate visualizations of the different data sets
    and also the relationship between the two data sets (i-e) collected with the standard
    and proposed systems. The red scatter points give correlations between the linguistic
    variables and ML classes of the standard heart rate data, and the blue stairs
    show correlations between the linguistic variables of the data labels and ML classes
    of the experimental heart rate data obtained with the proposed system. Figure

    20 shows a staircase line plot and a scatter plot giving separate visualizations
    of the different data sets and also the relationship between the two data sets
    (i-e) collected with the standard and proposed systems. The red scatter points
    give correlations between linguistic variables and ML classes of the oxygen level
    data obtained with the standard apparatus, and the blue stairs show correlations
    between the linguistic variables of the data labels and ML classes of the experimental
    oxygen level data obtained with the proposed system. Figure 20. ML classification
    comparison between standard and proposed systems. 4.3. Results for the Implementation
    Details and Data Analysis According to the description of the methodology on page
    17, the implementation details of the hardware system and the experimental setup
    are described in this section. A blood glucose non-invasive NIR sensor was designed
    with low voltage and an adjusted wavelength. The output results of this sensor
    and its impact on overall decision making and health prediction are shown in Figure
    21. Figure 21. Impact of blood glucose level on health condition. According to
    our layered methodology, we collected data through our designed hardware system,
    then developed a software layer to organize the data and process them through
    ML and AI for smart decision making. Thus, histograms were plotted for the proposed
    model data, which were validated through the standard apparatus to make them clearer
    and more insightful. Histograms for these health parameters can be valuable tools
    for healthcare professionals to understand the distribution of values within a
    population or track changes in individual patients over time. They can aid in
    identifying potential health issues, assessing treatment effectiveness, and making
    informed decisions about patient care. In Figure 22, a data distribution is presented,
    by means of which we can conclude that the data on temperature for diabetic patients
    in the experimental setup are clustered between 20F and 43F. There are a few readings
    of outliers and exceptional cases which we handle in the data preprocessing phase
    for machine learning. Figure 22. Data analysis of temperature. Similarly, in Figure
    23, the data disparity and distribution are shown, and the distribution is for
    realistic data; thus, most of the data are clustered in the 40 mmHg to 160 mmHg
    value range, and according to the graph there are some emergency cases regarding
    blood pressure that need to be handled, but on average a normal blood pressure
    range between 80 mmHg and 120 mmHg existed in the sample experimental population.
    Figure 23. Data analysis of blood pressure. In Figure 24, the data distribution
    of blood glucose levels in diabetic patients is presented. This distribution graph
    gives a clear picture of recent records considering patients for practitioners,
    who can suggest further diagnosis and medications accordingly. Figure 24. Data
    analysis of blood glucose levels. In Figure 25, the data disparity and distribution
    are shown, and this distribution is for realistic data; thus, most of the data
    are clustered in the 60% to 100% mmHg value range. Figure 25. Data analysis of
    oxygen levels. In Figure 26, the heart rate value distribution is presented. According
    to the figure, the data are normally distributed between 50 BPM and 220 BPM. Figure
    26. Data analysis of heart rates. Now, some results are shown below for an impact
    analysis of the data at different layers. In Figure 27, the overall impacts of
    blood glucose vital signals on predicted health conditions for the standard apparatus
    data and for the proposed-system-generated blood glucose data are compared. To
    validate the specially designed NIR sensor, comparative results are shown in Figure
    27, in which the blood glucose measurements are compared. The blood glucose measurements
    obtained by the NIR sensor are in mmol/L unit, and the clinical apparatus takes
    measures in mg/dL. Thus, we needed to convert our values into mg/dL for further
    processing. The X-axis represents the number of patients involved. This graph
    presents 25 readings for comparison. A few ID values vary in comparison with the
    other IDs. It is true that the readings obtained via the standard and invasive
    method are more accurate, but we designed the NIR-based sensor to avoid the inconvenience
    of needle penetration for blood sampling for the measurement of blood glucose
    levels. The Y-axis represents the blood glucose readings. The green lines represent
    the readings of the proposed sensor, and the orange lines represent the readings
    obtained via the standard method. Figure 27. Impact analysis of vital signals
    on predicted health condition for a large data set. Figure 28 gives an in-depth
    pictorial impact analysis of all vital-sign annotated data ranges on annotated
    health prediction through the ML algorithms collectively. The stacked layered
    area plot shows each signs’ contribution and impact through the area covered in
    width and in length along the X-axis. In Figure 28, the dark blue color represents
    temperature annotated data ranges from 0 to 2, the orange color represents heart
    rate, the grey color represents oxygen level, the yellow color represents blood
    pressure, the light blue color represents blood glucose level, and the grassy
    green color represents predicted health condition through the ML algorithms. Figure
    28. Impact analysis of vital signals on health decision. In Figure 29, the annotated
    range classes of vital health signs that have the greatest effect on the diabetic
    patient’s health condition are taken for analysis for each ML algorithm. One set
    of the random forest algorithm’s prediction results are plotted against the considered
    vital signs. Such results and graphs can only be available to the practitioner
    and the patient on request and according to the prescribed condition. The blue
    color represents the random forest prediction algorithm output, the orange color
    represents blood glucose level, and the purple color represents the oxygen level
    in the blood. Figure 29. Impact of glucose and oxygen levels on ML prediction.
    Figure 30 shows the impact analysis of the smart priority algorithm evaluated
    on sensed data. The analysis was performed on the first 100 ID records of diabetic
    patients. The initial 100 records may represent a pilot or preliminary study to
    evaluate the algorithm’s performance. This allows for an initial assessment of
    the algorithm’s effectiveness and impact. Initiating with a smaller data set could
    be a prudent approach to fine-tune the algorithm and identify potential issues
    or challenges before scaling up to a larger data set. Each corner of the radar
    represents the health conditions predicted, and each iterated cirrcle represents
    the no. of records of diabetic patients. The blue line sections represent data
    received before applying the priority algorithm, and the orange line sections
    represent the impacts after applying the priority algorithm. After applying the
    algorithm, the critical and very critical increasing from unhealthy to critical
    states of predicted health conditions are compared to the numbers without applying
    the smart algorithm. Thus, the results show that the in-emergency situation values
    get priority as compared to the normal health measurements. The novel and significant
    proposal that has been presented here has not been applied up till now in healthcare
    systems. The first 100 ID records were taken to analyze the clear impact of the
    priority algorithm and to obtain presentable results. It can be applied to all
    data, but it is only to be applied according to doctor’s preferences for diabetic
    patients. Figure 30. Impact analysis of smart priority algorithm. 5. Conclusions
    We conclude our paper by saying that a smart healthcare monitoring system is an
    essential need, and with the passage of time the number of patients suffering
    from diseases like diabetes and COVID-19 is increasing. To control their condition
    and for safety measures, diabetic patients must have a portable system that can
    be reviewed by doctors repeatedly. The proposed system covers five essential factors
    of diseases, namely, blood glucose level, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level
    in the blood, and temperature. The blood glucose sensor for diabetic patients
    is non-invasive, frequent measurements using an invasive method not being possible.
    We validated our system with standard procedure apparatus/machine data and applied
    ML algorithms for the prediction of the health condition of patients. Comparisons
    in terms of accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision were performed, which showed
    that the proposed system gave 98 percent similarity to the results obtained via
    standard apparatus and machines. Thus, the proposed system predicts diabetic patients’
    health conditions as critical, very critical, unhealthy, very unhealthy, or moderately
    unhealthy. In future work, telehealth enhancement factors can be introduced. ML
    and AI are being used already. Deep learning and another prediction algorithm,
    OIESGP, exist in healthcare, but not for diabetic patients. We will try to achieve
    implementation by adapting new and innovative algorithms. New innovative sensors
    can also be introduced with evolving technologies which are helpful in performing
    visible camera monitoring for chronic and emergency patients, making telehealth
    more accurate and effective. Author Contributions Conceptualization, S.M. (Sana

    In the 21st century, the global population has become predominantly urban, with
    more than half residing in cities, marking the era of urbanization (Kabisch and
    Haase, 2011, Zhao et al., 2020, Guo et al., 2022). This trend has been fueled
    by the rapid advancements in information technology, which have accelerated urban
    growth, commonly referred to as the third wave of urbanization (Cohen, 2006).
    According to projections, urban areas are expected to accommodate more than 70
    % of the global population by the year 2050, solidifying their role as primary
    hubs for economic growth and inventive activity (Ferrão & Fernández, 2013). Presently,
    the 600 largest cities worldwide generate approximately 80 % of the global GDP
    (Cadena et al., 2012). However, urbanization has brought with it challenges such
    as air pollution, climate change, high energy consumption, and increased pressure
    on urban infrastructure, especially in developing countries (Singh et al., 2020).
    To tackle these issues, there is an urgent need for systematic integration of
    all dimensions of urbanization with smart technology while preserving urban natural
    resources. Traditional urban planning and governance approaches must be revamped
    to cater to the development of 21st-century cities with a holistic view of all
    dimensions of urbanization (Hall & Pfeiffer, 2000). The notion of smart cities
    has surfaced as a potential remedy for urban challenges in contemporary times,
    particularly in the domain of urban planning and development (Neirotti et al.,
    2014). This approach to urban planning involves incorporating the capabilities
    of both the physical and digital worlds to address urban issues. The utilization
    of sophisticated information and communication technologies, together with the
    enormous amount of data generated in urban areas, offers unparalleled prospects
    for addressing significant urban challenges. One of the key components of a smart
    city is the ability to access real-time information on citizens'' actions and
    preferences. This access enables the identification and recognition of behavioral
    and normative patterns to understand what is happening at both city-wide and individual
    levels. Currently, many countries worldwide explore virtual world approaches and
    solutions to resolve urban problems. However, due to different perspectives in
    various scientific fields, the concept of a smart city lacks an official definition
    (Lai et al., 2020; Silva et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2015). The sustainable management
    of natural resources and urban green spaces poses a significant challenge as cities
    continue to expand. Urban green spaces, including parks, gardens, and trees, play
    a vital role in providing ecosystem services such as air purification, regulation
    of microclimates, noise reduction, and opportunities for recreation and social
    interaction. However, the rapid growth of urban areas exerts pressure on these
    valuable spaces. To ensure the development of smart cities, it is essential to
    implement effective planning and management strategies for urban resources, urban
    air pollution, urban climate and green infrastructure (Shang & Luo, 2021; Guo
    et al., 2022; Ban et al., 2023; Yin, Liu, Liu, Zheng, & Yin, 2023). Economic downturns
    have been a driving force behind the trend of cities transitioning toward smartness.
    To attract skilled labor and compete on the global stage, cities began seeking
    smart and innovative solutions to overcome economic challenges. Moreover, cities
    require resources to generate wealth and become centers of global competition.
    In the present era, service-based economies dominate the global market, and cities
    play a vital role in this competitive landscape. Consequently, cities must create
    a favorable and high-quality environment to entice the creative classes and stimulate
    further wealth generation and economic competitiveness. Furthermore, cities seek
    to attract young, educated, and skilled labor, address urban challenges, and create
    high-quality living standards to appeal to the creative class. Smart cities offer
    greater resilience against economic crises. By utilizing smart technologies, cities
    can improve their economy, generate greater income, and enhance their resilience
    against economic crises. Additionally, smart systems can optimize resource management,
    improve the environment, and reduce administrative and operational costs, which
    all contribute to building resilience against economic downturns (Camero & Alba,
    2019; Chamoso et al., 2018; Meijer & Bolívar, 2016). Cognitive collective changes
    are a significant driving force behind the trend of cities transitioning towards
    becoming smart, and aim to put an end to the destruction of urban capabilities.
    This trend aims to put an end to the destruction of urban capabilities and enhance
    the quality of life for residents through technological, political, and economic
    forces. One of the main reasons for this shift is the expected global population
    growth of elderly individuals, which is anticipated to double in the next decade.
    As a result, urban infrastructure must adapt and become compatible with these
    changes, and significant transformations are expected in the healthcare and elderly
    care sectors. Smart cities play an essential role in this regard, and one of their
    key functions is to assist the elderly and people with disabilities in performing
    daily tasks (Anthopoulos, 2015; Farmanbar et al., 2019; Ramírez-Moreno et al.,
    2021). By reducing the need for in-person visits to medical centers and performing
    administrative tasks, smart cities can significantly enhance the quality of life
    for these individuals. Various technologies can be utilized to achieve this goal,
    such as smart homes, transportation services, healthcare services, and social
    engagement platforms. Smart homes are equipped with sensors and smart devices
    that can monitor the health and wellbeing of elderly or disabled residents. For
    example, sensors can detect if a person has fallen or is having difficulty moving
    around the house and alert caregivers or emergency services if necessary. Smart
    cities can also provide transportation services that are accessible and convenient
    for the elderly and disabled, including on-demand ride-sharing services, specialized
    transportation services for people with disabilities, and public transportation
    systems that are designed to be accessible to all. Moreover, smart cities can
    use telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies to provide healthcare services
    to the elderly and disabled. This can include virtual consultations with doctors,
    remote monitoring of vital signs, and medication management systems. Lastly, smart
    cities can use technology to help the elderly and disabled stay connected with
    their communities and social networks, including virtual social events, online
    support groups, and other digital platforms that facilitate social interaction
    (Kasznar et al., 2021; Mohammed et al., 2014; Razmjoo et al., 2022). In recent
    times, there has been a notable transformation in the urban paradigm due to the
    utilization of technological progress. The emergence of information and communication
    technology has brought about a revolutionary shift in the development of cities,
    enabling seamless interconnectivity among citizens, businesses, and institutions,
    reminiscent of a complex neural network. Therefore, connectivity is a crucial
    aspect of urban life that can be achieved through technological advancements.
    Various technologies can facilitate urban communication, such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT), 5 G networks, smart traffic systems, electronic payment systems,
    social networks, and smart citizen support systems. By utilizing sensors, smart
    devices, and communication technology, IoT allows cities to collect information
    about the external environment, energy consumption, and traffic, enabling better
    and more sustainable urban management (Calvillo et al., 2016; Lara et al., 2016).
    Moreover, 5 G networks provide high-speed wireless communication with less delay,
    allowing cities to use faster internet for public networks and machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communications. Smart traffic systems gather and analyze traffic information
    using sensors and smart devices, enabling cities to better manage traffic. Electronic
    payment systems allow citizens to make online payments easily and use electronic
    money transfers, while social networks enable citizens to communicate with each
    other and share information about events, locations, and urban services. Additionally,
    smart citizen support systems allow citizens to easily communicate with different
    urban departments and receive services such as reporting urban problems, viewing
    traffic status, and requesting urban services. These technologies and many others
    can enable cities to improve urban communication and provide the necessary infrastructure
    for a smart city. Through the use of advanced technologies, cities can enhance
    their economic competitiveness and create higher living standards for their citizens
    (Ammara et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2021; Zhuhadar et al., 2017). The rapid expansion
    of urban areas in modern societies, encompassing both developed and developing
    regions, has emphasized the pressing necessity for effective urban management
    (Y. Li et al., 2023; Luo, Wang, & Li, 2023; Yin et al., 2023). Scholars have conducted
    numerous research studies aimed at identifying various parameters associated with
    the process of urbanization (Chen et al., 2022; X. Li et al., 2023; Shang & Luo,
    2021; Xiao et al., 2023). In this context, the exploration of different technological
    advancements and a comprehensive review of prior research findings can significantly
    contribute to the analysis and understanding of diverse urban challenges (Cheng
    et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2022; Wang & Tao,
    2023). The extensive body of literature on the investigation of various technologies
    in recent years highlights the crucial importance of embracing contemporary technological
    advancements to effectively address the complexities of present-day urban issues
    (Ding et al., 2023; B. Guo et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2021; J. Luo et al., 2023;
    Tong et al., 2023). Consequently, harnessing a wide range of information sources
    and conducting further investigations can play a pivotal role in addressing critical
    concerns such as the expansion of information networks, the promotion of sustainability,
    and the advancement of smart city initiatives (Y.-K. Fang et al., 2023; Liu et
    al., 2023; J. Luo et al., 2023). As a result, a considerable number of studies
    have been undertaken in recent years within the fields of technology, smart cities,
    and the dissemination of information to advance our knowledge in these areas (Lv
    et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Kafiliveyjuyeh & İlhan, 2017). Despite the widespread
    focus on leveraging technology for sustainable urban development, limited scholarly
    attention has been given to the integration of urban green spaces and smart technologies
    as a means of fostering sustainability. This study aims to bridge this research
    gap by examining the potential of smart cities to enhance environmental, social,
    and economic sustainability through the synergistic utilization of green spaces
    and advanced technologies (Gharaibeh et al., 2017; López-Quiles & Rodríguez Bolívar,
    2018; Xiong et al., 2012). In Europe, smart cities prioritize energy and sustainability
    concerns, which are critical for ensuring a superior standard of living in urban
    areas. The rapid pace of urban expansion calls for intelligent approaches to tackle
    forthcoming challenges. Smart cities harbor an ecological outlook, with a fundamental
    aim of utilizing technology to bolster sustainability and facilitate superior
    management of natural resources. Smart cities encounter various challenges when
    it comes to managing natural resources. One of the primary obstacles is the large
    amount of data needed to manage natural resources, efficiently (Mohamed et al.,
    2020; van Twist et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2021). Although smart cities are dependent
    on data, the management, analysis, and application of this information can be
    challenging, necessitating substantial investments in technology and infrastructure.
    Another challenge is the allocation of resources effectively and efficiently to
    achieve sustainable outcomes while balancing short-term goals with long-term sustainable
    development plans, despite the emphasis on sustainability. Developing sustainable
    infrastructure is another challenge for smart cities. Sustainable management of
    natural resources, such as renewable energy systems, requires significant investments
    and long-term planning, which can be challenging for smart cities. Citizen engagement
    in the management of natural resources is essential for the success of smart city
    initiatives. Nevertheless, achieving citizen participation can be challenging,
    necessitating effective communication strategies and the provision of relevant
    information to citizens. Furthermore, smart cities require supportive policy and
    regulatory frameworks to implement sustainable initiatives successfully. However,
    these frameworks may be intricate and require coordination across multiple government
    levels and stakeholders (Djahel et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2018; Rodríguez Bolívar,
    2016). Smart cities are emerging as a potential solution to address various urban
    challenges, including improving efficiency, sustainability, safety, citizen engagement,
    and quality of life. By utilizing data and technology, smart cities can optimize
    the use of resources such as energy, transportation, and water, resulting in increased
    efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, promoting sustainable practices,
    such as reducing waste, utilizing renewable energy sources, and promoting green
    spaces, can help limit the adverse environmental effects of urbanization. Moreover,
    smart cities can enhance safety by utilizing sensors, cameras, and other technologies
    to monitor and detect potential hazards such as traffic accidents, crime, and
    natural disasters, facilitating faster and more efficient responses (H. Kim et
    al., 2021; Ruhlandt, 2018; Talari et al., 2017). Citizen engagement also improves
    in smart cities by using technology and data to involve them in decision-making
    processes, providing them with better information to make informed decisions on
    the development of their communities. Lastly, the concept of smart cities has
    the potential to enhance the well-being of urban inhabitants by offering improved
    access to crucial services such as healthcare, education, and public transportation,
    while concurrently establishing more habitable and inclusive urban environments.
    This renders smart cities an auspicious approach to tackling urban challenges
    by optimizing resource allocation, promoting sustainability, enhancing safety,
    engaging citizens, and elevating their quality of life through the application
    of data and technology. However, there are potential challenges to address, such
    as the high cost of implementation, data privacy and security issues, equitable
    distribution of benefits, citizen participation, and coordination between stakeholders
    to ensure the sustainability of these solutions (Hancke et al., 2012; Kummitha
    & Crutzen, 2017; Sánchez-Corcuera et al., 2019). The implementation of smart cities
    poses a range of challenges that must be tackled to effectively harness their
    potential advantages. A prominent obstacle is the considerable expense associated
    with deploying smart infrastructure and technologies, which could impede the progress
    of many cities, particularly those in developing nations. Furthermore, apprehensions
    exist concerning data privacy and security, since the functioning of smart cities
    hinges heavily on the acquisition and analysis of vast amounts of data, thereby
    raising queries regarding data accessibility and its application. Another challenge
    is ensuring that the benefits of smart city technologies are equitably distributed
    across the population, rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. If smart
    technologies are implemented primarily in affluent areas, it could widen the gap
    between rich and poor neighborhoods. Moreover, there may be apprehensions about
    the potential loss of employment as automation and artificial intelligence become
    more common in smart cities. Citizen participation is another challenge in the
    development and implementation of smart city solutions. Without adequate engagement
    and participation from citizens, there is a risk that these solutions may not
    address the needs and priorities of the communities they are intended to serve
    sufficiently. Also, there may be challenges in coordinating among various sectors
    and stakeholders involved in implementing smart city solutions, such as government
    agencies, private companies, and community groups. Effective coordination and
    collaboration will be crucial for successfully executing these solutions and ensuring
    their long-term sustainability (Ismagilova et al., 2019; Toh et al., 2020; Yigitcanlar,
    2015). While smart cities aim to utilize technology and data for sustainable development,
    there is a lack of research on the integration of urban green spaces and smart
    technologies as a pathway to promote sustainability. This is an important area
    of study given the increasing urbanization worldwide and the need for livable
    and environmentally-friendly cities. The objective of this descriptive-analytical
    study is to investigate how smart cities can utilize green spaces and technologies
    to advance environmental, social and economic sustainability. Through a systematic
    literature review of academic and policy documents, this study identifies key
    approaches, benefits, and challenges related to smart and sustainable city development.
    Given the escalating global urbanization and the imperative for creating livable
    and ecologically sustainable cities, this research area assumes significant importance.
    The outcomes of this study have the potential to offer valuable insights to policymakers,
    urban planners, and researchers regarding the effective management of natural
    resources and the advancement of sustainability within the context of smart cities.
    2. Definitions and theoretical foundations of the research 2.1. Perspectives on
    smart cities: academic, industrial, and governmental views The creation of a smart
    city begins with developing a comprehensive understanding of the concept. The
    notion of a smart city has evolved in various domains, including academia, industry,
    and government. In academic literature, a smart city is deemed as a self-configuring,
    self-healing, self-protecting, and self-optimizing system. Conversely, in industrial
    literature, the term smart pertains to intelligent products and services, artificial
    intelligence, and smart devices. In government documents, the concept of smart
    cities is closely linked with the theory of urban planning that emerged in the
    early 1990s to counteract urban sprawl. This concept primarily emphasizes the
    utilization of technology and social innovation. A suitable definition of a smart
    city, according to academic literature, is an intelligent city characterized by
    smart people, smart mobility, smart governance, smart living, smart economy, and
    smart environment, resulting from a combination of assets and independent activities.
    On the other hand, industrial literature defines a smart city as a system of systems
    that employs technology to transform and optimize its primary systems while fully
    utilizing limited resources (Caragliu et al., 2011; H.M. Kim et al., 2021; Mutambik,
    2023). A smart city is a city that integrates smart facilities and independent
    activities, such as smart people, smart transportation, smart governance, smart
    living, smart economy, and smart environment. In this context, industrial literature
    characterizes a smart city as a system of systems that optimizes the city''s primary
    systems and employs technology to utilize limited resources. Governmental literature,
    meanwhile, aims to enhance the quality of life, foster economic growth, promote
    sustainable environments, and improve energy, sustainability, safety, health,
    and mobility. In summary, a smart city is defined as a sustainable and efficient
    city that enhances mobility, optimizes resource utilization, improves health and
    safety, fosters social development, supports economic growth, and provides participatory
    governance through information and communication technologies, cooperation, and
    investment in social capital (Wang & Tao, 2023; Lim et al., 2021; Vujković et
    al., 2022; Hu et al., 2023; Luo, Zhuo, & Xu, 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While different
    perspectives exist on smart cities, they agree that information and communication
    technology is the central feature of a city''s future performance. Although some
    researchers argue that information and communication technology is the main characteristic
    of a smart city, this does not mean ignoring social issues since people play a
    crucial role in shaping a smart city through continuous interaction. Each writer
    emphasizes different aspects of a city, making it complicated to measure the intelligence
    of a city due to its unique administrative, economic, social, and geographic conditions
    and priorities. Hence, defining a universal system for all cities based on the
    diverse characteristics of cities across the world is difficult. Moreover, the
    definitions of smart cities put forward by individual cities are not necessarily
    universal, making it advisable to use the fundamental structures of the smart
    city model as the basis for conceptualization. Each city''s intelligence must
    be redefined based on its perspectives, priorities, and content. The definition
    of a smart city places significant emphasis on concepts such as the utilization
    of information and communication technology in urban services and infrastructure,
    integration of different systems in planning and implementation, a collaboration
    of various stakeholders in all stages of urban development, investment in social
    capital, independence in decision-making, participatory governance, connectivity,
    creativity, learning, and management of various local resources (Albino et al.,
    2015; Goodspeed, 2015; Grossi et al., 2020). 2.2. Smart sustainable cities and
    environmental benefits A sustainable smart city leverages advanced technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data analytics, and geographic
    information systems to enable urban planning, construction, management, and the
    provision of intelligent urban services. This concept has been embraced as a means
    of promoting industrial, informational, and sustainable development advantages
    for cities. In contemporary times, sustainable smart cities have emerged as a
    hybrid model for addressing urban challenges and transforming cities into livable
    environments (Abusaada & Elshater, 2021; X. Fang et al., 2023; Heidari et al.,
    2022; Li et al., 2022). The development of sustainable smart cities involves various
    groups, including those who focus on developing technology infrastructure and
    sustainable development policies, those who advocate for the implementation of
    e-government services in sustainable smart cities, and those who do not find existing
    urban development models suitable. The sustainable smart city is an innovative
    urban center that harnesses information and communication technologies and other
    related tools to improve the standard of living, efficiency of activities and
    urban services, and competitiveness, while simultaneously catering to the requirements
    of both present and upcoming generations. The sustainable smart city comprises
    complex social and technical systems and has a novel framework for urban development
    (Balova et al., 2021; Catalano et al., 2021; Jedliński, 2014). Copenhagen, Denmark
    provides an exemplary instance of a smart sustainable city, where a variety of
    technologies have been implemented to promote sustainability and efficiency. The
    city has introduced several smart sustainable city projects, including a smart
    traffic system, sustainable waste management systems, and sustainable energy production.
    The smart traffic system utilizes data from traffic systems to enhance driving,
    reduce traffic congestion, and improve road safety. Sustainable waste management
    systems incorporate advanced technologies such as smart sensors and IoT systems
    to collect and recycle waste, air, and water pollution. Additionally, Copenhagen
    has invested in sustainable energy production projects, such as wind and solar
    energy, and improved energy efficiency in buildings and homes, making the city
    a leader in smart sustainable cities through the use of innovative technologies
    (Bibri, 2018; Hara et al., 2016; Kramers et al., 2014). Smart sustainable cities
    possess the potential to yield several environmental advantages. They can help
    mitigate carbon emissions by advocating for eco-friendly transportation modes
    like public transportation, electric vehicles, and bicycles, in addition to utilizing
    smart grids, energy-efficient constructions, and renewable energy sources. Additionally,
    smart sustainable cities can improve waste management practices, enhance urban
    green spaces, and implement water conservation measures to reduce water consumption
    and preserve natural resources. In conclusion, smart sustainable cities can promote
    sustainable development, improve the quality of life for citizens, and minimize
    the negative impact of urbanization on the environment by incorporating innovative
    technologies and sustainable practices (Höjer & Wangel, 2015; Huovila et al.,
    2019; Martin et al., 2018). 2.3. Comparing sustainable smart cities and technology-driven
    cities The growth of information and communication technology-centered cities
    has prompted the emergence of several terms, including \"e-city,\" \"digital city,\"
    \"virtual city,\" \"virtual community,\" \"smart city,\" and \"ubiquitous city.\"
    While each of these cities possesses distinctive characteristics, the most significant
    variation and disagreement exist between sustainable smart cities and smart cities.
    It is erroneous to use the term smart cities to refer to sustainable smart cities
    (Bibri, 2021; Jiang et al., 2023). Höjer et al. points out that smart cities often
    lack sustainability due to two reasons (Höjer & Wangel, 2015). Primarily, sustainability
    is not universally incorporated in all smart city concepts and has been assumed
    rather than explicitly considered in smart cities. Additionally, there is a lack
    of a precise definition of sustainability in smart cities, and none of the smart
    city definitions assign hierarchical importance or prioritize their dimensions.
    Establishing a clear definition of sustainability is an imperative aspect of sustainable
    smart cities. Li et al. identify significant challenges related to privacy, government
    surveillance, digital rights, connecting urban sustainability challenges, social
    cohesion issues, technology discourse, and policymaker approach to smart city
    initiatives as weaknesses of smart cities (Li & Woolrych, 2021). Similarly, Yigitcanlar
    et al. criticize smart cities for adopting a technocratic and neoliberal approach
    to urban development, and it is unclear how a smart city plan will lead to sustainability
    (Yigitcanlar et al., 2019). Monfaredzadeh et al. believe that smart cities do
    not emphasize sustainability concepts (Monfaredzadeh & Krueger, 2015). Datta et
    al. note that most cities introduce themselves as smart cities to escape economic
    crises and produce more wealth (Datta & Odendaal, 2019). This results in the creation
    of new markets through the digitization of urban infrastructures, such as smart
    energy and mobility systems, and the formation of new consumers through smart
    technology consumption. These factors lead to a contradictory formation between
    the goals, expectations, and claims that smart cities have regarding urban sustainability
    (Radtke, 2022; Roblek & Meško, 2020). Therefore, Sustainable smart cities and
    technology-driven cities are two different concepts. Although both concepts focus
    on the use of technology in urban development, they differ in their approach to
    sustainability. Sustainable smart cities prioritize sustainability in their urban
    development plans and use technology as a tool to achieve their sustainability
    goals. They consider social, economic, and environmental factors in their planning
    and aim to create livable and resilient cities for present and future generations.
    Technology-driven cities, on the other hand, focus primarily on the use of technology
    in urban development without necessarily prioritizing sustainability (Al Sharif
    & Pokharel, 2022; ur Rehman et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2022; Xia et al., 2023).
    They may use technology to improve efficiency, connectivity, and convenience,
    but may not consider the broader impact on social, economic, and environmental
    factors. Therefore, the main difference between sustainable smart cities and technology-driven
    cities is their approach to sustainability. Sustainable smart cities prioritize
    sustainability as a core component of their planning, while technology-driven
    cities may prioritize technology without necessarily considering sustainability
    (Dameri, 2014; Verrest & Pfeffer, 2019; Zheng et al., 2020). 2.4. Natural resource
    conservation and the role of smart cities The degradation of natural resources
    in recent decades has necessitated the urgent protection of these resources. Although
    human interventions such as industrial and green revolutions have contributed
    to these changes, the role of human factors in both the destruction and conservation
    of natural resources has been overlooked. Instead, the destruction of resources
    has often been attributed to natural processes and physical, biological, and chemical
    developments, leading to a flawed approach to natural resource management. Traditional
    approaches to resource protection have focused on technical and technological
    knowledge, emphasizing humans'' dominance over nature and the adaptation of ecosystems
    to human desires. However, this approach has resulted in intensified damage and
    destruction of resources. Furthermore, ignoring the needs of local communities
    and stakeholders has led to dissatisfaction and a change in the prevailing ideology
    of resource conservation. This shift emphasizes the preservation of the functional
    integrity of ecosystems and the flexible, proportional use of environmental capacities.
    Additionally, contemporary thinking emphasizes the relationship between the social
    system and the ecosystem, making concepts such as social complexity and ecosystem
    more prominent (Chu et al., 2021; Portney, 2005). Therefore, while current conservation
    programs focus on ecosystem functions, they need improvement and reform. This
    includes giving more importance to the role of local communities and residents
    in natural resource management, providing them with access to new technologies
    and optimized resource management, and involving them in decision-making processes.
    Policy-makers and planners should also value the environmental and economic values
    of natural resources and prioritize the environmental and ecosystem needs in their
    conservation programs. Education and training processes on natural resource conservation
    should be included in school curricula (Bifulco et al., 2016; Khalimon et al.,
    2020; Phadtare & IndajeetJadhav, 2017). The implementation of smart cities is
    a crucial way to protect the environment globally. Smart city transformation involves
    the use of innovative technologies to enhance citizens'' quality of life, optimize
    energy consumption, improve urban management, and protect the environment. Therefore,
    smart city transformation can play a vital role in natural resource conservation.
    Smart technologies can be used to improve the quality of city air, reduce pollution,
    optimize energy consumption, manage water and wastewater, manage waste, conserve
    water resources, prevent food waste, and enhance civic interactions. For instance,
    smart city systems such as smart lighting management systems, smart HVAC systems,
    and smart water and energy management systems can be implemented to reduce energy
    consumption in buildings. Similarly, smart waste collection, separation, and recycling
    systems can improve municipal waste management and preserve natural resources.
    Smart city transformation can improve citizens'' quality of life and conserve
    natural resources, contributing significantly to ecosystem sustainability and
    sustainable development (Guo et al., 2022; Kumar & Dahiya, 2017; Sukhwani et al.,
    2020). This study is centered on the examination of urban green spaces as significant
    natural assets within cities. These green spaces, encompassing parks, gardens,
    trees, and vegetation, play a pivotal role in the urban environment. Given the
    ongoing expansion and increased population density of cities, the effective management
    of these green spaces becomes imperative for achieving sustainability. Hence,
    the primary objective of this study is to explore the integration of smart city
    technologies with urban green spaces to enhance environmental sustainability.
    Through this research, a range of solutions and approaches will be examined, including
    green space planning, data analysis, community involvement, and policy formulation,
    all aimed at fostering livable and environmentally-friendly cities. 3. Research
    methodology The present study employs a descriptive-analytical research methodology
    to explore the concept of smart cities and their features. A comprehensive review
    and analysis of academic literature, practical tools intended to aid cities, and
    official international documents published between 1990 and 2023 were undertaken
    to identify the crucial components, dimensions, beliefs, and perspectives associated
    with the concept of smart cities. The literature search was performed using a
    range of keywords and phrases related to the concept of smart cities, such as
    smart community, digital city, intelligent city, ubiquitous city, virtual city,
    information city, creative city, learning city, knowledge city, urban natural
    resources, the relationship between urban natural resources and smart cities,
    sustainable smart city, energy and water consumption control. The literature was
    obtained via two primary sources, academic literature databases and Google Scholar.
    The search was limited to scholarly articles, scientific journals, and conference
    proceedings in the interdisciplinary fields of urban studies, public management,
    information science, natural resource-related sciences, energy, consumption management,
    and computer science. The initial search yielded a total of 672 documents, which
    were subsequently screened for their relevance to the research topic. The screening
    process involved reviewing titles, abstracts, and full texts of the identified
    documents. Following the screening, 194 documents were deemed suitable for inclusion
    in the final literature review, based on their direct relevance to the integration
    of urban natural resources and smart technologies. The selected documents underwent
    a rigorous evaluation by the research team to assess their quality and credibility.
    Only peer-reviewed scholarly articles, conference papers, and book chapters were
    included in the final literature sample, ensuring a high standard of scholarly
    work. To analyze the collected literature, a descriptive-analytical approach was
    adopted, employing thematic analysis. Key themes, concepts, and findings were
    identified from the literature, and codes were developed to categorize the data
    and identify common patterns. By employing this systematic screening process,
    evaluating the quality of the selected literature, and utilizing thematic analysis,
    this study aims to provide an unbiased synthesis of the current knowledge on the
    integration of urban natural resources and smart technologies for sustainable
    development. However, it is worth noting that this study has certain limitations,
    such as the likelihood of overlooking relevant literature due to the search criteria
    and the likelihood of partiality in the selection and analysis of the articles.
    Therefore, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion,
    this study employed a rigorous methodology to explore the concept of smart cities
    and the integration of urban natural resources and smart city technologies for
    sustainable development. The study''s findings offer valuable insights for policymakers,
    urban planners, and researchers interested in promoting sustainable development
    in smart cities. 4. Finding and discussion Smart cities are a novel concept in
    urban management that aims to enhance the quality of life for citizens, optimize
    energy consumption, protect the environment, and improve urban management. The
    use of innovative technologies enables smart cities to collect, analyze, and share
    urban data and information from diverse perspectives, contributing to their sustainable
    development objectives. Consequently, there is a direct relationship between the
    concept of smart cities and natural resources, as smart technologies can help
    conserve natural resources by reducing energy consumption, optimizing water and
    energy usage, reducing air and water pollution, promoting the use of public transport
    and pedestrian activities, and improving environmental quality (Adali et al.,
    2022; Oberascher et al., 2022; Qayyum et al., 2021; Weil et al., 2023). Implementing
    smart city systems such as smart lighting management, heating, ventilation, and
    air conditioning, and water and energy management systems can facilitate energy
    reduction in buildings. Furthermore, utilizing smart waste collection, separation,
    and recycling systems can help improve municipal waste management and preserve
    natural resources. Smart cities can also function as a monitoring and control
    system for natural resources, such as water and air pollution. By utilizing smart
    water resource management systems, data on runoff, water quality, and water consumption
    can be collected and utilized for optimal planning. Similarly, monitoring air
    pollution through smart systems can help improve air quality and reduce pollutants,
    contributing to a cleaner environment. The utilization of smart energy management
    systems can aid in minimizing energy consumption and encouraging the usage of
    sustainable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy. Additionally, smart
    transportation systems can optimize traffic, reduce air pollution, and encourage
    the use of public transport and pedestrian activities. The integration of these
    technologies into smart cities can facilitate sustainable development and preserve
    natural resources. To conclude, smart cities are an innovative solution for enhancing
    urban management and promoting environmental protection and sustainable development.
    The integration of smart technologies can help conserve natural resources and
    improve the quality of life for citizens (Alshuwaikhat et al., 2022; Mortaheb
    & Jankowski, 2023; Shang & Lv, 2023; Wang & Zhou, 2023). This study will further
    discuss the relationship between smart cities and natural resources in detail
    in the following sections. 4.1. Green spaces in smart city development Utilizing
    natural resources within urban environments, particularly through the integration
    of green spaces, presents a promising avenue to bolster the sustainability of
    smart city development. This study delves into a range of strategies aimed at
    harnessing the potential of green spaces in smart cities. One such approach involves
    the implementation of smart green spaces, which leverage advanced technologies
    like sensors to effectively manage irrigation and artificial lighting, optimizing
    resource usage in these areas. This can effectively reduce water and energy consumption,
    improve air quality, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Another solution
    is the conversion of green spaces into energy sources, such as installing solar
    panels on green roofs to generate energy and meet a building''s energy needs.
    Green spaces can also serve as filters for air purification and reducing air pollutants,
    reducing the effects of climate change, and mitigating the heat effects in the
    city. Green spaces can also be designed as venues for social development in smart
    cities, providing recreational and sports activities, a peaceful and friendly
    environment, and social gathering spaces to enhance citizens'' quality of life
    and promote social development. Additionally, green spaces can act as filters
    to reduce noise pollution in smart cities, particularly for sound levels caused
    by traffic or industrial and commercial activities (Anguluri & Narayanan, 2017;
    Artmann et al., 2019; Nitoslawski et al., 2019; Obringer & Nateghi, 2021; Salman
    & Hasar, 2023). This study focuses on a thorough analysis of the role of urban
    green spaces in cities, encompassing parks, gardens, trees, and vegetation. These
    green spaces are valuable natural assets that contribute significantly to the
    urban environment. They offer various ecosystem services, such as the purification
    of air, regulation of microclimates, reduction of noise, and opportunities for
    recreational activities and social interactions. Given the global expansion and
    increased density of cities, it is crucial to effectively manage these urban green
    spaces. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to explore the integration
    of smart technologies with these green spaces to enhance their sustainability.
    Additionally, this research examines other essential natural resources in urban
    settings, including water, energy, and waste materials. It investigates how smart
    technologies can be utilized to manage these resources efficiently, promote conservation
    efforts, and achieve sustainability. By clearly defining these natural resources,
    this study aims to provide specific insights into harnessing smart city technologies
    to improve natural resource management and enhance urban sustainability. The creation
    of a green space network in cities has been proposed as an effective solution
    for smart city development. This approach involves integrating and connecting
    various green spaces such as parks, gardens, squares, and natural spaces in the
    city to create a network. This green space network can be used as a hub for communication
    between people and the city, promoting sustainable urban development. Also, analyzing
    green space data can facilitate smart city development by using sensors and smart
    systems in green spaces to collect and analyze information on factors such as
    air quality, pollution levels, temperature, and irrigation levels, improving green
    space management, and promoting sustainable urban development. The design of green
    spaces in smart cities can play a crucial role in promoting social development
    (Aly & Dimitrijevic, 2022; Branny et al., 2022; S. Zhang et al., 2022; Japir Bataineh
    et al., 2023). One way to achieve this is by creating recreational and sports
    spaces within green areas to encourage physical activity and social interaction,
    which can enhance the physical and mental health of residents and foster a sense
    of community. Additionally, creating a serene and welcoming environment within
    green spaces can provide a space for residents to relax and unwind, which can
    also encourage social interaction and community building. Another effective approach
    to promoting social development through green spaces is to design these areas
    to include social meeting spaces, such as picnic areas, cafes, and community gardens.
    By providing residents with spaces to gather, socialize, and exchange ideas, green
    spaces can help build a sense of community and promote social development. Moreover,
    involving the community in the design and maintenance of green spaces can promote
    social development by instilling a sense of ownership and pride in their neighborhood,
    which can lead to partnerships and collaborations between residents, local government,
    and other stakeholders. Lastly, designing green spaces to be easily accessible
    and connected to other parts of the city can encourage residents to use these
    spaces and promote social interaction. This can be achieved by creating bike lanes,
    pedestrian walkways, and public transportation routes that connect green spaces
    to other parts of the city. By doing so, green spaces can become a hub for social
    activities and gatherings, promoting social development and enhancing the overall
    quality of life in smart cities (Irvine et al., 2022; Li, 2022; Zain et al., 2022).
    Fig. 1 illustrates the strategies for utilizing green spaces in smart city development.
    The figure is divided into two main categories, including smart green spaces and
    green spaces for social development. The smart green space category includes the
    use of smart systems, such as sensors, to manage irrigation and artificial lighting,
    and the conversion of green spaces into energy sources. The green spaces for social
    development category includes the creation of recreational and sports spaces,
    design for social meeting spaces, and involving the community in the design and
    maintenance of green spaces. This figure highlights the potential of green spaces
    in smart city development to enhance sustainability and promote social development.
    The utilization of smart green space strategies plays a pivotal role in improving
    resource efficiency, leveraging technology to optimize operations, and mitigating
    environmental impacts. Concurrently, social development approaches contribute
    to the promotion of community well-being through inclusive and recreational green
    spaces, as substantiated by prior research. Download : Download high-res image

    spaces in smart city development: enhancing sustainability and promoting social
    development. 4.2. Challenges and benefits of green space data analysis The utilization
    of technological advancements to analyze data pertaining to green spaces offers
    significant potential in mitigating air pollution levels within urban areas. Through
    the integration of sensors, CCTV cameras, 3D mapping, and other intelligent systems,
    valuable information regarding green spaces can be collected and subjected to
    analysis using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. This analytical
    approach enables the prediction of optimal irrigation requirements and facilitates
    the regulation of water consumption, thus promoting enhanced water conservation
    practices within green spaces. Moreover, this data-driven methodology enables
    the acquisition of accurate insights into changes in vegetation and air quality
    across cities, thereby facilitating the identification and implementation of effective
    solutions for sustainable urban development (Ding et al., 2022; Jia et al., 2023;
    Ma, 2020; Sharifi et al., 2021). Green space data analysis can be an effective
    solution for reducing air pollution in cities (Douglas et al., 2017; Kabisch et
    al., 2017; Niemelä et al., 2010). One way to achieve this is by using the data
    to increase the area of green spaces in cities, which can help in reducing air
    pollution. By identifying areas that require the creation of green spaces, city
    officials and managers can make informed decisions for sustainable urban development.
    Another way to reduce air pollution is by increasing the number of trees in cities
    with the use of green space data analysis. By analyzing the amount of greenery
    and distribution of trees in different areas of the city, decisions can be made
    about planting trees and vegetation in areas with a shortage of green spaces.
    This can help increase the amount of oxygen produced, leading to improved air
    quality and reduced air pollution. Finally, analyzing green space data can provide
    an accurate picture of changes in the level of greenery and air quality in cities,
    leading to effective solutions for improving air quality. By identifying areas
    that need to increase the number of trees and creating green spaces, cities can
    improve air quality and promote sustainable urban development (Baycan-Levent &
    Nijkamp, 2009; Lee & Maheswaran, 2011; Wolch et al., 2014). Green space data analysis
    holds the potential to provide a host of benefits to urban residents. For instance,
    it can improve air quality by identifying areas that require more greenery and
    trees to reduce air pollution. This, in turn, can positively affect the health
    and well-being of urban residents. Additionally, by analyzing data, cities can
    identify areas that require green spaces and create new ones, which can increase
    access to outdoor recreation, physical activity, and social interaction, thereby
    improving the quality of life of urban residents. Green space data analysis can
    also contribute to improved water conservation by predicting the amount of water
    required for irrigation and controlling water consumption in green spaces. This
    can help ensure that urban residents have access to clean and safe water, which
    is critical for their health and well-being. Moreover, green space data analysis
    can offer valuable insights into how cities can improve their urban planning and
    design. By identifying areas that require more green spaces and trees, cities
    can develop plans that prioritize sustainable urban development, ultimately creating
    more livable communities. Green spaces can also have a positive impact on public
    health by reducing stress levels, promoting physical activity, and improving mental
    well-being. With the help of green space data analysis, cities can create more
    green spaces that are accessible to urban residents, thereby providing them with
    opportunities to improve their health and well-being. Also, green space data analysis
    can involve residents in the planning and maintenance of green spaces, promoting
    community engagement and collaboration. This can help build stronger communities
    and foster a sense of ownership and pride in their neighborhoods (Kabisch et al.,
    2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Ibeanu et al., 2023). The implementation of green space
    data analysis, while beneficial for sustainable urban development, can present
    several challenges for cities. The first challenge is data collection, which can
    be particularly difficult for older cities with limited digital infrastructure.
    Weather conditions, equipment failure, and vandalism are among the factors that
    can affect the quality of data collected on green spaces. The second challenge
    is data management, which can be complex due to the large amounts of data generated
    by green space data analysis. To address this, cities may need to invest in appropriate
    data management systems to ensure that the data collected is well-organized, easily
    accessible, and secure. Another challenge is the need for technical expertise
    in fields such as data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
    This requires cities to either hire experts or partner with organizations that
    specialize in these fields to analyze the data collected effectively. Moreover,
    the implementation of green space data analysis can be costly, particularly for
    cities with limited budgets. As such, cities may need to seek funding from external
    sources or prioritize their spending to allocate resources to this area. Privacy
    concerns are also a challenge, particularly if the data collected includes images
    or videos of people. Cities may need to implement appropriate privacy policies
    and regulations to ensure that they comply with relevant laws and protect citizens''
    privacy rights. Finally, engaging stakeholders, including residents, community
    groups, and local businesses, is essential for the success of green space data
    analysis initiatives. Cities may need to invest in public outreach and engagement
    efforts to ensure that stakeholders are well-informed, involved, and supportive
    of these initiatives (Kabisch & Haase, 2011; Kabisch, 2015; Kabisch et al., 2015).
    Green space data analysis has been implemented in various cities worldwide to
    evaluate the distribution and density of green spaces and improve the quality
    of life for citizens. For instance, in Singapore and Shanghai, 3D mapping technology
    and green space data analysis have been utilized to assess the distribution and
    density of green spaces. Similarly, in European cities such as Copenhagen and
    London, green space data analysis has been employed for planning and developing
    green spaces. This includes analyzing the amount of greenery and tree distribution
    in different areas of the city, determining the amount of green space available
    in the city, identifying areas that require green space development, and assessing
    the distribution of green space in public places such as parks and squares. This
    data analysis helps cities prioritize sustainable urban development and create
    more livable communities by providing more opportunities for outdoor recreation,
    physical activity, and social interaction. Green space data analysis can aid city
    officials and urban managers in decision-making related to the creation of green
    spaces. This data analysis can precisely identify areas that require green space
    development and evaluate the amount of green space available in different areas
    of the city. By analyzing green space data, officials can gain insight into the
    amount of greenery and tree distribution in different areas of the city, enabling
    them to make informed decisions regarding planting trees and vegetation in areas
    with a shortage of green spaces. Furthermore, green space data analysis can be
    used to identify areas that require green space development and implement green
    space development plans in these areas. This can help city officials prioritize
    sustainable urban development and create livable communities by providing urban
    residents with more opportunities for outdoor recreation, physical activity, and
    social interaction. By using green space data analysis, city officials can make
    evidence-based decisions and ensure that green spaces are developed in areas where
    they are most needed (Haaland & van Den Bosch, 2015; Madureira et al., 2015; Wood
    et al., 2018). Fig. 2 presents the benefits and challenges of green space data
    analysis in urban development. The figure is divided into two main categories:
    benefits and challenges. The benefits category includes improving air quality,
    water conservation, urban planning and design, public health, and community engagement
    through the creation and maintenance of green spaces. The challenges category
    includes data collection and management, technical expertise, cost, privacy concerns,
    and stakeholder engagement. This figure highlights the potential of green space
    data analysis in sustainable urban development and the challenges that need to
    be addressed for its successful implementation. The existing body of research
    substantiates the favorable environmental, social, economic, and health outcomes
    associated with the benefits mentioned earlier. To ensure the successful implementation
    of green space data analysis, it is imperative to tackle the identified challenges
    through diverse approaches, such as active community involvement, collaborations
    between public and private entities, and enhanced provision of financial resources.

    This comparative analysis helps to identify the common themes and patterns related
    to the integration of urban natural resources and smart city technologies for
    sustainable development. Table 1. Comparison of green space data analysis implementation
    in smart cities of the west and east for sustainable urban development. 4.3. The
    impact of smart cities on urban environmental sustainability Smart cities possess
    the capacity to tackle environmental issues by leveraging cutting-edge technologies
    and intelligent communication systems. This has the potential to yield enhancements
    in air quality, reduction in noise pollution, efficient waste management, and
    optimized resource utilization. To realize these advantages, the implementation
    of smart and automated waste collection systems, adoption of electric vehicles,
    and integration of intelligent irrigation systems are among the key tools that
    can be deployed within smart cities. Moreover, smart cities can effectively curb
    traffic congestion and urban density, resulting in decreased air pollution levels
    and enhanced resource efficiency. By harnessing smart technologies, public transportation
    can be enhanced, car usage can be optimized, and pedestrian and bicycle traffic
    can be promoted (Q. Guo et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023). Various technologies,
    such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI), smart
    driving systems, smart energy networks, smart waste management systems, and smart
    home appliances, are utilized in smart cities to enhance the environment. IoT
    sensors can collect data on weather and pollution levels, providing accurate information
    about the environment. AI can optimize environmental processes and improve air
    quality, waste management, and resource efficiency. To achieve a sustainable and
    environmentally friendly smart city, it is essential to implement these technologies
    in a consistent and unified manner (Khawand et al., 2022; Niyi Anifowose et al.,
    2022). By doing so, it is possible to improve the urban environment, reduce the
    negative impact on the environment, and enhance the quality of life for citizens.
    Therefore, the integration of these technologies is crucial to ensure that smart
    cities have a positive impact on the environment while providing the necessary
    services and amenities to citizens (Mauree et al., 2019; Ortega-Fernández et al.,
    2020; Shruti et al., 2020). The impact of implementing smart cities on various
    environmental parameters is discussed in detail in the following sections. 4.3.1.
    The impact of smart city technologies and policies on reducing air pollution Air
    pollution presents a substantial environmental challenge within urban settings,
    and the integration of smart city technologies holds great potential for mitigating
    its impact. Addressing the imperative to enhance air quality is essential, considering
    the detrimental health implications associated with air pollution. One of the
    key approaches by which smart cities can effectively combat air pollution is through
    the optimization of transportation systems. By implementing smart traffic management
    systems, cities can reduce traffic congestion, resulting in vehicles running more
    efficiently and decreasing emissions from cars and trucks. Additionally, smart
    public transportation systems can promote the use of buses, trains, and other
    forms of public transit, which can reduce the number of cars on the road and associated
    emissions. Another approach to addressing air pollution in smart cities is by
    using smart buildings and energy systems. By optimizing energy consumption and
    reducing waste, buildings can become more energy-efficient and generate fewer
    pollutants. Smart grids and renewable energy sources can also help lower emissions
    from power plants and other electricity sources. Smart waste management systems
    can also contribute to reducing air pollution. By minimizing the amount of waste
    sent to landfills and incinerators, smart waste management can lessen the quantity
    of methane and other pollutants released into the air. Furthermore, smart city
    technologies such as air quality sensors can enable cities to monitor air pollution
    levels in real-time and implement measures to reduce emissions when pollution
    levels exceed safe levels. Such measures can include implementing low-emission
    zones or promoting the use of electric vehicles and other low-emission transportation
    options (Shen et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Xu & Yang, 2022; Moshayedi et al.,
    2023). Air quality sensors play a critical role in smart cities, offering several
    advantages such as real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, improved
    public health, environmental monitoring, and citizen engagement. Air quality sensors
    allow cities to monitor air quality in real-time, enabling them to quickly identify
    pollution hotspots and respond promptly to prevent health issues and mitigate
    environmental damage. Moreover, air quality sensors generate vast amounts of data
    that can inform evidence-based environmental policies. This data can help in determining
    the placement of green spaces, prioritizing transportation modes, and regulating
    industrial activities. Air quality sensors also significantly contribute to improving
    public health. By identifying areas with high pollution levels, cities can implement
    public health interventions that reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, improving
    the health of residents and reducing the healthcare costs associated with pollution-induced
    illnesses. Additionally, air quality sensors enable environmental monitoring of
    other factors such as humidity, temperature, and noise levels. This data can be
    used to better understand the relationship between environmental factors and air
    quality and improve overall environmental health. Furthermore, air quality sensors
    can increase public awareness of environmental issues and promote citizen engagement
    in environmental initiatives. Citizen involvement in data collection and analysis
    can foster stronger relationships between cities and their communities, promote
    sustainable behavior, and encourage greater participation in environmental monitoring
    efforts (Angelidou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Liu & Zhang, 2021). Although
    the implementation of air quality sensors in cities offers several benefits, it
    also poses several challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges include
    cost, data reliability, data integration, data privacy, equity, and regulatory
    challenges. One of the primary challenges for cities is the cost of purchasing
    and installing air quality sensors, which can be particularly problematic for
    cities with limited budgets. Additionally, there are ongoing expenses associated
    with maintaining, calibrating, and storing data generated by these sensors. Data
    reliability is another challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure that the
    data generated by air quality sensors is accurate and reliable. Measures need
    to be in place to ensure that the data collected is of sufficient quality to support
    effective decision-making processes. Cities also need to have the necessary infrastructure
    and expertise to manage and integrate the large amount of data generated by air
    quality sensors. Furthermore, privacy concerns may arise as air quality sensors
    collect data on individuals'' movements and activities. Therefore, it is vital
    to be transparent about how data is collected and used and to protect individuals''
    privacy. Equity is another challenge, as air quality sensors need to be placed
    in locations that accurately reflect the air quality experienced by different
    communities. This necessitates the placement of sensors in low-income and minority
    communities, which are frequently impacted disproportionately by air pollution.
    Additionally, regulatory challenges may arise as air quality sensors may not meet
    regulatory standards for air quality monitoring. Hence, cities must work with
    regulatory agencies to ensure that the data collected by sensors is usable for
    regulatory purposes (Neirotti et al., 2014; Benevolo et al., 2016; Su et al.,
    2023). To address environmental justice and reduce health disparities, it is crucial
    to ensure that air quality sensors are equitably distributed in low-income and
    minority communities. Cities can adopt various strategies to ensure the fair placement
    of sensors. One strategy is to engage with community organizations and residents
    to identify locations where air quality sensors should be placed. By involving
    the community in the decision-making process, cities can ensure that sensors are
    positioned in areas that accurately reflect the air quality experienced by residents.
    Another approach is to use existing data on air quality, traffic patterns, and
    other relevant factors to identify areas where air quality is likely to be poor.
    This data can help guide the placement of sensors in areas where they are most
    needed. Collaborative partnerships between cities, community organizations, universities,
    and other stakeholders can also facilitate the deployment of air quality sensors.
    These partnerships can ensure that sensors are placed in locations that are relevant
    to the community and that the data collected is used to address community concerns.
    Cities can also adopt policies that require air quality sensors to be placed in
    specific locations, such as near schools or in neighborhoods with high asthma
    rates. Such policies can ensure that sensors are placed in areas where they are
    most needed. Furthermore, prioritizing funding for air quality sensor deployment
    in low-income and minority communities is another strategy that cities can use
    to address environmental health disparities. By doing so, cities can ensure that
    these communities have access to the resources they need to improve their air
    quality (Chatti & Majeed, 2022; Cui & Cao, 2022; Kaginalkar et al., 2021). Apart
    from deploying air quality sensors, cities have implemented various policies to
    reduce air pollution in low-income communities. Green infrastructure projects,
    such as planting trees and building green roofs, can absorb pollutants and improve
    air quality while also reducing the urban heat island effect. Transit-oriented
    development is another policy implemented by cities to reduce air pollution in
    low-income communities. This policy involves building affordable housing near
    public transit and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking
    and biking, which reduces the number of cars on the road. Cities have also implemented
    low-emission zones that restrict the most polluting vehicles from entering certain
    areas of the city, often placed in low-income communities. Moreover, clean energy
    incentives such as rebates for solar panels and electric vehicles can help low-income
    residents access clean energy technologies and reduce their reliance on fossil
    fuels. Cities have also implemented regulations on industrial activity to reduce
    emissions and improve air quality in nearby communities, including emissions standards,
    pollution fees, and zoning restrictions. Education and outreach campaigns that
    raise awareness of air quality issues and promote sustainable behavior have also
    been implemented by cities, including campaigns that target low-income communities
    and provide resources and support to help residents reduce their exposure to air
    pollution. The effectiveness of policies implemented by cities to reduce air pollution
    in low-income communities can vary depending on the policy itself, implementation,
    and community engagement (Almalki et al., 2021; Michalec et al., 2019; Yao et
    al., 2020). Smart traffic management systems have the potential to make a significant
    contribution in reducing air pollution in urban environments. By reducing traffic
    congestion and associated emissions from cars and trucks, these systems can optimize
    traffic flow, reduce idling, and improve air quality (Djahel et al., 2014). Studies
    have shown that smart traffic management systems can have a positive impact on
    reducing air pollution in cities. For instance, a study revealed that the implementation
    of an intelligent transport system (ITS) resulted in a 15 % reduction in carbon
    dioxide emissions (El-Hansali et al., 2021). Smart traffic management systems
    can also promote the use of sustainable modes of transportation, such as public
    transit, biking, and walking, which can further reduce emissions and improve air
    quality (De Oliveira et al., 2020). Smart traffic management systems can promote
    sustainable transportation in several ways. Firstly, by providing real-time traffic
    information, these systems enable commuters to plan their routes and avoid congested
    areas, which can encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation such
    as public transit, biking, and walking. Secondly, smart traffic management systems
    can promote multimodal transportation planning by providing information on a range
    of transportation options. For example, some systems offer real-time information
    on public transit schedules and bike-sharing availability, making it easier for
    commuters to incorporate these options into their travel plans. Another approach
    to promoting sustainable transportation is the integration of smart parking systems
    into smart traffic management systems. By offering real-time information on parking
    availability and pricing, these systems can make it easier for people to find
    parking and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as
    public transit and biking. For example, drivers can be directed to park-and-ride
    facilities located near public transit stations, which can incentivize the use
    of public transit (Li et al., 2017; Sharif et al., 2017; Sumi & Ranga, 2018).
    Smart parking systems possess the potential to play a significant function in
    mitigating traffic congestion and the related air pollution in urban areas. One
    of the key benefits of these systems is that they can reduce the amount of time
    drivers spend looking for parking spots and circling around, which can lead to
    increased traffic congestion and associated emissions from idling vehicles. Smart
    parking systems can achieve this by providing real-time information on parking
    availability, allowing drivers to quickly find a parking spot without circling
    around, reducing the amount of time spent looking for parking and consequently
    reducing traffic congestion. In addition to providing real-time parking information,
    smart parking systems can also use dynamic pricing to incentivize drivers to park
    in less congested areas or at off-peak times. Smart parking systems can aid in
    balancing the supply and demand of parking and minimizing traffic congestion by
    charging higher rates in high-demand regions and lower rates in low-demand regions.
    This approach can encourage drivers to choose less congested parking areas, ultimately
    reducing the overall traffic congestion in the city. Another significant benefit
    of smart parking systems is their ability to reduce double-parking, which can
    block traffic and reduce road capacity. By providing real-time information on
    parking availability and reducing the need for drivers to park illegally, smart
    parking systems can help reduce double-parking and improve traffic flow. Lastly,
    smart parking systems can reduce the amount of time drivers spend cruising for
    parking by providing real-time information on parking availability and incentivizing
    drivers to park in less congested areas. For instance, offering discounts or rewards
    for parking in less congested areas can encourage drivers to choose these areas
    and reduce traffic congestion and associated emissions from idling vehicles. Therefore,
    smart parking systems have the potential to significantly reduce traffic congestion
    and air pollution in cities by reducing the amount of time drivers spend looking
    for parking spots, using dynamic pricing to balance parking supply and demand,
    reducing double-parking, and incentivizing drivers to park in less congested areas.
    These strategies can improve traffic flow, reduce emissions from idling vehicles,
    and ultimately contribute to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment
    (Englund et al., 2021; Liu & Ke, 2023; Zhu et al., 2016). To implement smart parking
    systems in cities, a comprehensive assessment of parking needs is necessary. This
    includes factors such as parking demand, availability, and current technologies.
    After assessing the needs, cities can select from several technology solutions,
    such as sensors, cameras, and mobile applications. The chosen technology solution
    should be suitable for the city''s needs and budget. In the case of a sensor-based
    solution, parking sensors will need to be installed in parking spaces or on the
    street. These sensors can detect whether a space is occupied or vacant and relay
    this information to a central database. Additionally, a parking management system
    should be developed by cities to gather and analyze data from the sensors or other
    technology solutions. This system should provide real-time information on parking
    availability and pricing, as well as enable payment and enforcement. To encourage
    the use of the smart parking system, cities should promote it to the public through
    marketing and outreach campaigns. This can help increase awareness and encourage
    commuters to choose more sustainable transportation options. Furthermore, continuous
    monitoring and evaluation of the smart parking system is crucial to ensure that
    it meets its objectives and identifies areas for improvement. This includes analyzing
    data on parking usage, revenues, and customer satisfaction. By following these
    steps, cities can successfully implement smart parking systems that meet their
    specific needs and contribute to more sustainable transportation choices. Regarding
    smart traffic management systems, their implementation feasibility and effectiveness
    can vary depending on the size, budget, and infrastructure of the city. Implementing
    smart traffic management systems involves significant investment in technology,
    data infrastructure, and personnel, which may not be feasible for smaller cities
    or those with limited budgets. Additionally, cities with older infrastructure
    may need to invest in upgrading their transportation systems to enable the integration
    of smart traffic management technologies. Moreover, the effectiveness of smart
    traffic management systems may depend on the existing transportation infrastructure
    of the city. For instance, cities with well-developed public transportation systems
    may have an easier time integrating smart traffic management systems that promote
    the use of alternative modes of transportation. Conversely, cities with high levels
    of car dependency may face more significant challenges in promoting sustainable
    transportation options through smart traffic management systems (Alsafery et al.,
    2018; Khanna & Anand, 2016; Vakula & Kolli, 2017). Fig. 3 provides an overview
    of the different categories under the core theme of smart city technologies for
    reducing air pollution. The figure illustrates the various strategies and challenges
    associated with the deployment of air quality sensors, optimizing transportation
    and energy systems, improving waste management, and implementing smart traffic
    and parking systems. The categories are organized to highlight the potential benefits
    of these strategies for improving public health, reducing environmental damage,
    and promoting citizen engagement. Additionally, the figure outlines the challenges
    associated with the equitable deployment of air quality sensors and the need for
    regulatory standards to ensure data reliability and privacy protection. A range
    of strategies, including transportation optimization, smart waste management implementation,
    air quality sensor deployment, and the establishment of smart parking and traffic
    systems, have been extensively studied and proven effective in reducing urban
    air pollution. By adopting a comprehensive approach that combines these solutions,
    substantial improvements in air quality and public health can be achieved, as
    supported by previous research. Download : Download high-res image (760KB) Download

    solutions for sustainable urban water management Cities worldwide are facing a
    critical imperative to address water consumption in light of global warming, population
    growth, and escalating per capita consumption. The pressing challenges posed by
    a growing global population and the finite nature of natural resources have elevated
    the urgency of implementing smart city initiatives as an essential endeavor for
    current and future generations (Holdren & Ehrlich, 1974; Jury & Vaux, 2007). Various
    regions around the world are experiencing serious water shortages, particularly
    countries with low rainfall such as Central Asia, India, the Middle East, North
    Africa and North America (Rijsberman, 2006). The quality of water is also a challenge,
    with approximately 1.1 billion people worldwide lacking access to water of desirable
    quality (Elimelech, 2006). One out of every four cities globally is experiencing
    a water shortage crisis, with population growth and urbanization exacerbating
    the situation (Zhang et al., 2020). By 2050, over six billion people are projected
    to live in cities. As a response, since 2012, more than 142 cities in North America,
    Europe, and East Asia have initiated smart city initiatives (Shafiullah et al.,
    2022). Smart building systems, which use artificial intelligence, can react to
    environmental conditions and perform some tasks automatically (Wong & Li, 2008).
    The Japanese company Hitachi, with more than a century of experience in water
    treatment across nearly 42 countries, is working towards creating smart cities
    that efficiently use water resources and establish effective water infrastructure
    (Alusi et al., 2011). In the city of Austin, Texas, approximately 5.8 billion
    barrels of drinking water were lost in 2015 due to leaks in pipes before reaching
    consumers, which accounted for approximately 12 % of the total drinking water
    consumed that year (Blatt, 2011). To address this issue, a water management system
    was introduced, which measures water pressure and pH levels to detect water leaks
    and ensure safe pH levels for human health. These systems use sensors to collect
    data, which is then processed by microcontrollers and communicated through computers
    and wireless networks (Nie et al., 2020; Saad & Gamatié, 2020). Moreover, ultrasonic
    sensors have been used by researchers to evaluate water quantity, quality, and
    leaks, and this data is announced on a website using an Arduino board (Yasin et
    al., 2021). Lopez et al. have developed a method for determining dynamic water
    tariffs and notifying users based on smart meters. Implementing this method in
    the city of Valencia in Spain with 430,000 subscribers resulted in an 11 % reduction
    in water consumption (Lopez-Nicolas et al., 2018). Additionally, Curry et al.
    have proposed five smart pilot projects to reduce water consumption in smart airports,
    smart homes, smart schools, smart buildings, and have reported the amount of water
    saved (Curry et al., 2018). The importance of addressing water consumption reduction
    in cities through smart city implementation and its technologies has been highlighted
    in previous research. By using smart water management systems, such as those that
    detect leaks and monitor water pressure and quality, cities can reduce water losses
    and ensure safe water for human consumption. Furthermore, implementing dynamic
    water tariffs and notifying users based on smart meters can encourage water conservation
    and reduce consumption. The use of smart pilot projects in various settings can
    also help reduce water consumption and promote sustainable water management practices
    (Ntuli & Abu-Mahfouz, 2016; Shahanas & Sivakumar, 2016; Singh & Ahmed, 2021).
    One of the most significant protocols for smart building automation is the KNX
    protocol, which is a global communication standard for home and building control.
    The Konnex Association created the KNX standard in 1999 by combining three older
    European home systems standards, namely EHS, BatiBUS, and EIB or Instabus. The
    KNX standard is widely used in residential and commercial buildings for controlling
    integrated systems, including HVAC, lighting, security, remote control, shading
    and curtain control, monitoring systems, and energy management. The KNX protocol
    has several advantages, such as millions of devices currently in service, all
    devices specifically designed for building automation, a unified software for
    all products regardless of the manufacturer, the ability to use tree, line, star,
    or any combination of topology, the ability to choose between different communication
    interfaces, and the ability to connect to other protocols through different communication
    gateways. The widespread adoption of the KNX protocol has resulted in a vast ecosystem
    of compatible devices, which provides customers with a wide range of options for
    building automation and control. With its versatility and compatibility, the KNX
    protocol is a popular choice for building automation and is widely used in smart
    buildings worldwide. Smart building projects that utilize the KNX protocol require
    the connection of various modules, sensors, and devices that are under the KNX
    protocol or through other communication interfaces to sensors or devices that
    need to be controlled by this system. These devices are connected in a network,
    and sensors receive information and transmit it to the smart modules through the
    network. The received information is then processed in the modules, and appropriate
    actions are taken based on the information (Domingues et al., 2016; Kastner et
    al., 2005; Lohia et al., 2019). The implementation of smart solutions to reduce
    water consumption using the KNX protocol is presented in the following sections,
    divided into three categories: irrigation, residential, and urban solutions. In
    this section, we focus on the irrigation and urban solutions, while the residential
    solutions will be explored in the next section. The irrigation solutions involve
    the use of smart irrigation controllers that monitor the weather and soil moisture
    to optimize irrigation and reduce water consumption. The urban solutions, on the
    other hand, include the use of smart water meters to monitor water consumption
    and detect leaks, as well as the implementation of dynamic water tariffs to encourage
    water conservation. These solutions provide significant opportunities for reducing
    water consumption in smart buildings and promoting sustainable water management
    practices (Christensen et al., 2020; Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2017; Vanus et al., 2016).
    Modern irrigation techniques involve two general forms: pressurized irrigation
    and drip and sprinkler irrigation. However, these methods often face challenges
    such as high implementation costs, technical maintenance of the system, and servicing
    of pumping system peripherals. Sprinkler irrigation may also face limitations
    in mixed planting schemes, as well as water loss due to incorrect system design
    or strong winds (Chaudhary et al., 2011). Rain irrigation systems have an efficiency
    rate of up to 70 %, while drip irrigation systems have an efficiency rate of up
    to 95 % (Payero et al., 2008). In contrast, surface irrigation of farms has an
    efficiency rate of no more than 50 % (Maisiri et al., 2005). In traditional situations,
    where most of the country''s lands are irrigated in this manner, the efficiency
    rate is even lower, at less than 35 % (Oweis & Hachum, 2006). The primary reasons
    for water loss in the agricultural sector are the use of fresh water for irrigation,
    over-irrigation of crops, creation of surface runoff, and irrigation at inappropriate
    times (Legesse & Ayenew, 2006). On the other hand, the development of green spaces
    is a crucial aspect of urban development. Trees are the lifelines of cities, and
    the construction of green spaces is essential for the mental and physical health
    of society. Maintaining these spaces is a fundamental principle of green space
    management, and irrigation is one of the primary needs for maintenance. Currently,
    urban green spaces are irrigated using various methods, such as mobile tanks,
    fixed tanks, human-powered irrigation through embedded taps, pressurized irrigation
    systems, or combined systems. The choice of irrigation method depends on factors
    such as climatic conditions, existing infrastructure, budget, and the type of
    plant tissue used (Choukai et al., 2022). In a smart agricultural field, moisture
    sensors are placed at regular intervals within the soil and next to the planted
    crops. These sensors are connected to a network through specialized wiring. The
    sensors send a message to the central control system as soon as the moisture within
    the soil decreases below the specified level for the plant. This message is displayed
    on a display screen, which is available to the farmer through the central controller
    display screens or control software that can be installed on a mobile phone. Upon
    receiving a message indicating decreased soil moisture from a predetermined number
    of sensors within each row of the planted crops, the system first examines weather
    changes using models provided on reputable weather websites, via a remote control
    module. If rainfall is expected in the coming days based on the weather maps,
    irrigation is delayed until the specified time (the number of days irrigation
    can be delayed is determined by the type of crop). Otherwise, the system sends
    an irrigation command to electric valve gates for the irrigation operation to
    be carried out within the soil. The irrigation continues until the soil moisture
    level is less than the predetermined moisture threshold for the embedded soil
    sensors. Once sufficient moisture is created, irrigation is immediately stopped
    to prevent water loss. Moreover, the system can be adjusted to perform irrigation
    based on temperature changes throughout the day. In hot seasons, irrigation is
    carried out at minimum temperature to prevent water evaporation, while in cold
    seasons, irrigation is carried out at maximum temperature to prevent crop freezing.
    The smart irrigation system reduces water consumption in agriculture and promotes
    sustainable water management practices. The equipment required for implementing
    an intelligent irrigation system for urban green spaces using the KNX protocol
    includes a switch operator, power sources, an internet connection module, a central
    control display for monitoring and entering primary information, electric valve
    gates, soil moisture sensors, environment temperature sensors, a sensor for determining
    light intensity, and a network platform. The number, type of programming, and
    method of communication between devices are determined based on several factors
    such as the location of water supply, accessible water quantity and quality, types
    of crops used in the planting scheme, soil parameters, and regional climate. The
    input level of the switch operator is determined based on the diversity of plant
    coverage in terms of irrigation type. The equipment is designed to ensure efficient
    irrigation and reduce water waste in urban green spaces. The sensors, combined
    with the central control display, provide real-time monitoring and control of
    the irrigation system, allowing for adjustments to be made based on changing conditions
    in the environment (Cruz-S''nchez et al., 2012; Khujamatov & Toshtemirov, 2020).
    Water loss in cities is a significant problem, often resulting from water leakage
    in urban infrastructure (Mutikanga et al., 2009). High-pressure pumps send a considerable
    amount of water into urban water distribution networks daily. The pressure within
    the pipes has the most significant and quickest hydraulic effect on the amount
    of leakage (Trifunovic, 2006). As time passes, some parts of the network become
    worn out and experience water leakage due to high water pressure within the pipes.
    If a broken pipe causes water to leak to the surface, the damage is easily identifiable.
    However, if the pipe is damaged deep underground, the water will never reach the
    surface, making detection and repair much more challenging (Puust et al., 2010).
    In a smart city, installing water leakage detection sensors and pressure-reducing
    pumps, and creating a network between them, can significantly reduce water loss.
    During certain hours of the day, water consumption by users decreases. If the
    water pressure inside the pipes is higher than the needs of the users during these
    hours, water leakage occurs in the worn-out urban infrastructure. Therefore, by
    reducing the water pressure during off-peak hours of water consumption by subscribers,
    water leakage can be prevented to a great extent. Smart water meters measure the
    peak and off-peak hours of water consumption by subscribers, and the information
    obtained from them is sent by the urban smart system network to the central controllers
    and displays. Consequently, if necessary, the water pressure can be reduced or
    increased by the installed pumps. Additionally, smart water meters are present
    in various nodes of the water distribution network structure, measuring the amount
    of water reaching that node. The total amount of water pumped in the nodes should
    match the amount of water output from the main pump. If the difference between
    the numbers exceeds the predetermined limit, a warning message is sent to the
    network supervisor on the central display to inform them of the existence of a
    leakage in the distribution network. Furthermore, a network of water leakage sensors
    is placed around the water distribution network infrastructure. These sensors
    measure the soil moisture around the pipes. If the soil moisture exceeds the standard
    limit determined according to the region''s climate, a warning message is sent
    to the network manager to take prompt action to repair the leak. The implementation
    of these measures in a smart city can significantly reduce water loss and promote
    sustainable water management practices (Fantozzi et al., 2014; Kulkarni & Farnham,
    2016; Laspidou, 2014). The smart water distribution system has several features,
    including the ability to report the amount of water consumed by subscribers in
    each area, detect water leaks, and schedule pre-determined water pressure reductions
    or increases (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2018). To implement the water
    leakage detection system using the KNX protocol, the following equipment is required:
    a switch operator (with the input level determined based on the diversity of vegetation
    coverage in terms of the type of irrigation), power supply, internet connection
    module, central control display for monitoring and entering initial information,
    electric valve, water leakage detection sensors, and network infrastructure. The
    water leakage detection sensors are crucial components of the system, as they
    detect any leaks and identify their exact location. The central control display
    receives information from the sensors and displays it to the network supervisor,
    who can take prompt action to repair the leak. The smart water distribution system
    reduces water loss and promotes sustainable water management practices in urban
    areas (Ciholas et al., 2019; Rinaldi et al., 2020). In addition to the solutions
    discussed earlier, smart cities can also employ other methods to control urban
    water resources. One such method is smart water pricing, which involves implementing
    pricing schemes that reflect the true cost of water production and distribution.
    This can incentivize water conservation and discourage wasteful usage. For instance,
    tiered pricing systems that charge higher rates for excessive water usage can
    encourage people to be more mindful of their water consumption. Another effective
    approach is public education and awareness campaigns. By educating the public
    about the importance of water conservation and providing practical tips for reducing
    water usage, cities can encourage residents to adopt more sustainable water usage
    habits. Such campaigns can be carried out through various channels, including
    social media, public service announcements, and community outreach programs. Therefore,
    implementing smart city solutions can significantly reduce urban water resource
    waste, which is of great importance in the face of increasing water scarcity in
    many countries around the world. By promoting sustainable water management practices,
    smart cities can ensure the availability of safe, clean water for future generations
    (Chandran et al., 2021; Karwot et al., 2016; Moy de Vitry et al., 2019). Fig.
    4 shows the main categories of smart city solutions for sustainable urban water
    management, including irrigation solutions and urban solutions. Irrigation solutions
    involve the use of smart irrigation controllers that optimize irrigation and reduce
    water consumption through moisture sensors and weather models. Urban solutions
    include the use of smart water meters to monitor water consumption and detect
    leaks, as well as the implementation of dynamic water tariffs. Additional methods
    include smart water pricing schemes and public education campaigns to promote
    sustainable water usage habits. The implementation of these solutions can significantly
    reduce water waste and promote sustainable water management practices in smart
    cities. Therefore, the existing literature provides substantial evidence regarding
    the water-saving and conservation advantages offered by smart irrigation systems
    and technologies that encompass leak detection and pressure management. Augmenting
    these measures with pricing incentives and educational campaigns is crucial for
    cultivating a culture of sustainable water usage in urban areas, as substantiated
    by previous research. Download : Download high-res image (555KB) Download : Download

    strategies and technologies for efficient water use and conservation in urban
    environments. 4.3.3. Technologies and strategies for electricity resource management
    in smart cities Smart city implementation holds immense potential for effective
    electricity resource management. To tackle this challenge, advanced technologies
    and strategic approaches are being employed within smart cities. These include
    smart grid systems, integration of renewable energy sources, energy-efficient
    building practices, demand response programs, infrastructure for electric vehicle
    charging, energy storage systems, microgrid frameworks, and data analytics. Smart
    grid systems use advanced sensors and communication technologies to monitor and
    control electricity distribution in real-time. Smart grids can aid in averting
    blackouts and enhancing the overall efficacy of the electricity system by optimizing
    electricity flows and curbing wasteful usage (Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2012; Xia et
    al., 2021). Additionally, smart cities are progressively adopting sustainable
    energy sources like solar and wind power to minimize dependence on fossil fuels
    and diminish greenhouse gas emissions. The integration of renewable energy sources
    into the grid can also enhance the resilience of the electricity system and reduce
    the probability of power outages. The promotion of energy-efficient building designs
    and technologies, such as LED lighting, smart thermostats, and automated shading
    systems, is advocated by smart cities to lower energy consumption in buildings.
    This can decrease electricity demand and help forestall power shortages. Furthermore,
    demand response programs urge consumers to decrease their electricity utilization
    during peak demand periods, thereby lowering the need for costly new power plants.
    Furthermore, smart cities are investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure
    to support the transition to sustainable transportation (Silva et al., 2018; Pellicer
    et al., 2013). By providing convenient and accessible charging stations, smart
    cities can encourage more people to switch to EVs and reduce the demand for gasoline-powered
    vehicles that contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy
    storage systems are also being explored to help balance electricity supply and
    demand, thereby preventing blackouts and improving the reliability of the electricity
    system. Several smart cities are adopting microgrids, which are small-scale electricity
    systems capable of functioning autonomously from the primary electricity grid.
    Microgrids can help improve the resilience and reliability of the electricity
    system by providing backup power during blackouts or other disruptions. Additionally,
    advanced data analytics tools are being used to better understand electricity
    usage patterns and identify opportunities for energy savings. Smart cities can
    analyze data from smart meters and other sensors to develop targeted programs
    to reduce electricity usage (Caragliu et al., 2011; Khalil et al., 2021). Smart
    grid systems are designed to incorporate advanced digital technologies to modernize
    traditional electricity grids. These systems use sensors and other devices to
    collect real-time data on electricity usage and grid conditions, and then use
    advanced analytics and control systems to optimize the flow of electricity and
    reduce wasteful usage (Phuangpornpitak & Tia, 2013). The implementation of smart
    grid systems can assist utilities in achieving a better balance between electricity
    supply and demand, which can enhance the overall dependability of the electricity
    system. Smart grids can automatically redirect electricity away from regions with
    high demand or store surplus electricity during periods of low demand and distribute
    it during peak demand. Moreover, smart grids can optimize the usage of sustainable
    energy sources like solar and wind power, which can aid in minimizing dependence
    on fossil fuels and diminishing greenhouse gas emissions. This can reduce the
    necessity for new power plants and enhance the utilization of existing generation
    capacity. Two-way communication is a key feature of smart grids, allowing utilities
    to collect data from sensors and other devices in real-time and send signals back
    to these devices to control their operation. This two-way communication enables
    smart grids to be more responsive to changing conditions and optimize the flow
    of electricity in real-time. By using advanced analytics and control systems,
    smart grids can optimize the use of these resources to reduce reliance on centralized
    power plants and increase the resilience of the electricity system. The cybersecurity
    of these systems is critical as smart grids rely on digital technologies and communication
    networks. Smart grid systems need to be designed with strong cybersecurity measures
    to prevent cyberattacks and protect the privacy and security of data. Smart grids
    rely on a variety of devices and systems that need to be interoperable and able
    to communicate with each other. Ensuring that these systems work together seamlessly
    can be challenging, especially when different vendors are involved (Colak et al.,
    2015; Lo & Ansari, 2011). The incorporation of sustainable energy sources like
    solar and wind power into the electricity grid is a crucial approach for smart
    cities to encourage sustainability and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. Solar
    power is increasingly being used by smart cities as solar panels can be installed
    on rooftops, carports, and other structures to generate electricity locally. By
    integrating solar power into the grid, smart cities can reduce reliance on centralized
    power plants that burn fossil fuels and contribute to air pollution and climate
    change. Wind power is another renewable energy source being embraced by smart
    cities. Wind turbines can be installed in windy areas to generate electricity
    that can be fed into the grid, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable
    energy mix. However, one of the biggest challenges with renewable energy sources
    is their intermittency. The production of solar and wind power can fluctuate,
    making it challenging to balance electricity supply and demand, particularly during
    periods of high demand or low renewable energy production (Anees, 2012; Bhandari
    et al., 2014; Yousif et al., 2019). Smart cities are utilizing energy storage
    systems like batteries to accumulate surplus electricity generated by renewable
    energy sources and dispense it when required, assisting in enhancing the dependability
    of the electricity system and reducing the likelihood of power outages. Additionally,
    smart cities are adopting microgrids as small-scale electricity systems that can
    operate autonomously from the primary electricity grid. Microgrids can be fueled
    by sustainable energy sources like solar and wind power, offering backup power
    during power outages or other disruptions. Integrating renewable energy sources
    into the grid may require upgrading the grid infrastructure to handle the variable
    and distributed nature of these sources, which can be costly (Khan et al., 2018).
    Regulations and policies can also present barriers to integration, such as regulations
    around energy pricing or grid interconnection that may need to be updated to support
    the integration of renewable energy sources or the deployment of energy storage
    systems. Additionally, some members of the public may have concerns about the
    visual and environmental impacts of renewable energy sources, requiring public
    education and addressing concerns to promote acceptance. Despite these challenges,
    many smart cities are making progress in integrating renewable energy sources
    into the grid. By addressing these challenges and working collaboratively with
    stakeholders, cities can build more sustainable and resilient energy systems that
    benefit their citizens and the environment (Hammons, 2008; Liserre et al., 2010;
    Zahedi, 2011). Smart cities need to manage the electricity resources required
    to power electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure effectively. Charging station
    locations must be carefully chosen to ensure that they are easily accessible to
    EV drivers, even if it means installing new electrical infrastructure. Smart cities
    must also consider the types of charging stations installed, ranging from slow
    chargers to fast chargers, which can impact the demand on the electricity grid.
    Load management strategies, such as scheduling charging during off-peak hours
    or incentivizing EV owners to charge their vehicles during times of low demand,
    can help avoid overloading the electricity grid. To ensure that EV charging stations
    are located in areas that are easily accessible to EV drivers, smart cities can
    conduct a needs assessment, engage with stakeholders, use mapping tools, partner
    with private companies, and consider zoning and permitting regulations. A needs
    assessment can analyze data on the number of EVs in the area, the locations of
    existing charging stations, and the availability of electrical infrastructure
    in different areas. Engaging with stakeholders, including EV owners, local businesses,
    and community groups, can help identify convenient locations that meet the needs
    of the local community. Mapping tools can help identify potential locations for
    charging stations based on proximity to major highways, public transportation,
    and popular destinations. Partnering with private companies can provide valuable
    expertise in identifying optimal locations for charging stations. Finally, zoning
    and permitting regulations can encourage the installation of charging stations
    in areas that are easily accessible to EV drivers. By taking a proactive and collaborative
    approach, smart cities can build a more sustainable and resilient transportation
    system by ensuring that EV charging stations are located in areas that are easily
    accessible to EV drivers, promoting the adoption of EVs, and reducing greenhouse
    gas emissions from transportation (Maglaras et al., 2014; Qureshi et al., 2021;
    Vaidya & Mouftah, 2020). Managing electricity resources for energy storage systems
    is crucial for sustainable urban environment. The sizing of energy storage systems
    is a critical component to ensure that they provide the required electricity when
    needed. Historical electricity demand data is analyzed to determine peak demand
    periods and size the energy storage system accordingly. Smart cities may also
    need to implement load management strategies to manage electricity demand, such
    as scheduling charging during off-peak hours or incentivizing electricity users
    to reduce consumption during high demand. Regular maintenance is required to operate
    energy storage systems efficiently and effectively. Smart cities should consider
    maintenance and replacement costs when evaluating the economic feasibility of
    energy storage systems. To maintain energy storage effectively, smart cities can
    establish a regular maintenance schedule, use remote monitoring, perform performance
    analysis, provide maintenance personnel training and education, and enter into
    contractual agreements with energy storage system manufacturers or service providers.
    A comprehensive maintenance strategy can ensure effective and efficient energy
    storage maintenance, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient electricity
    system (Almihat et al., 2022; O''Dwyer et al., 2019; Taveres-Cachat et al., 2019).
    Smart cities are increasingly using data analytics tools to effectively manage
    electricity resources. By analyzing historical data on electricity usage, these
    tools can help forecast future demand patterns, allowing utilities to plan for
    electricity supply and demand, ensuring that there is enough electricity supply
    to meet demand during peak periods. Additionally, data analytics tools can help
    smart cities identify areas where energy is being wasted or used inefficiently,
    allowing utilities to develop targeted programs to reduce electricity usage and
    improve energy efficiency. Load management strategies such as scheduling charging
    during off-peak hours or using demand response programs can also be implemented
    using data analytics to incentivize electricity users to reduce their electricity
    consumption during times of high demand. Furthermore, smart cities can use data
    analytics tools to predict maintenance needs for electricity infrastructure, such
    as transformers and switches, reducing downtime and lowering the costs associated
    with equipment repairs and replacements. By improving energy efficiency, implementing
    time-of-use pricing, managing electricity demand, and predicting maintenance needs,
    data analytics tools can help smart cities reduce electricity costs for residents
    and businesses (Chen et al., 2021; Hashem et al., 2016; Sarker, 2022). Implementing
    smart city technologies for managing electricity resources can be challenging,
    and there are several factors that can impact the success of these initiatives.
    Some of the key challenges that smart cities face include cost, interoperability,
    data privacy and security, public engagement, and regulatory barriers. One of
    the primary challenges is the cost of implementing smart city technologies, which
    can be expensive. Building a smart grid or installing energy-efficient technologies
    in buildings can require significant upfront investments that may take years to
    recoup through energy savings. In addition, smart city technologies rely on a
    variety of sensors, devices, and systems that need to be interoperable and able
    to communicate with each other. Ensuring that these systems work together seamlessly
    can be challenging, especially when different vendors are involved. Data privacy
    and security is another significant challenge. Smart city technologies rely on
    vast amounts of data that need to be collected, stored, and analyzed. Ensuring
    the privacy and security of this data can be a significant challenge, as it may
    be vulnerable to cyberattacks or other threats. Public engagement is also crucial
    for the success of smart city initiatives. Educating the public on the benefits
    of these technologies and engaging them in the planning and implementation process
    can be challenging, especially when there are concerns about data privacy or the
    cost of these initiatives. Furthermore, regulatory barriers such as energy pricing
    or grid interconnection may need to be updated to support the integration of renewable
    energy sources or the deployment of energy storage systems. Despite these challenges,
    many cities are making progress in implementing smart city technologies for managing
    electricity resources. By addressing these challenges and working collaboratively
    with stakeholders, cities can build more sustainable and resilient energy systems
    that benefit their citizens and the environment (Shafiullah et al., 2022; Bawany
    & Shamsi, 2015; Hassan et al., 2021). Fig. 5 illustrates the various strategies
    and technologies that smart cities are implementing for electricity resource management.
    The figure is divided into two main categories: advanced technologies and challenges/considerations.
    The advanced technologies category includes smart grid systems, renewable energy
    integration, energy-efficient buildings, demand response programs, electric vehicle
    charging infrastructure, energy storage systems, microgrids, and data analytics.
    The challenges/considerations category includes cybersecurity, interoperability,
    intermittency of renewable energy sources, upgrading grid infrastructure, regulations
    and policies, and public acceptance. The figure highlights the importance of addressing
    these challenges to achieve more sustainable and resilient energy systems in smart
    cities. The findings depicted in Fig. 5 highlight that the adoption of smart grid
    systems, integration of renewable energy sources, establishment of EV infrastructure,
    and utilization of other relevant technologies can lead to a substantial reduction
    in greenhouse gas emissions, as demonstrated by various assessments. Nevertheless,
    effectively addressing the identified challenges necessitates collaborative efforts
    among multiple stakeholders and innovative policy measures to achieve the desired
    sustainability objectives. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download :

    4.3.4. Environmental effects and challenges of waste management in smart cities
    The primary objective of smart cities is to enhance the well-being of urban inhabitants
    and mitigate environmental pollution through the utilization of advanced technologies
    and efficient resource utilization. In the context of smart city development,
    sustainable management of urban resources, particularly recyclable materials like
    plastics, papers, metals, and glass, assumes great significance. To facilitate
    effective recycling management in smart cities, technologies specific to this
    domain are employed for the collection, segregation, recycling, and optimized
    management of recyclable waste materials. Smart technologies enable the collection
    of data from different recycling containers, which enhances the accuracy of waste
    collection and recycling. This, in turn, leads to efficient and effective recycling
    of waste, resulting in a decrease in the amount of waste produced, enhanced resource
    availability, and reduced environmental pollution. Moreover, recycling various
    materials creates employment opportunities and reduces waste management costs.
    Smart cities utilize various technologies for efficient and effective collection
    and recycling of recyclable waste, such as smart collection systems, separation
    and recycling technologies, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and blockchain.
    Smart collection systems, such as smart recycling containers, smart recycling
    bins, and smart collection networks, employ sensors and smart devices to collect
    and optimize the waste collection process with precision. Separation and recycling
    technologies like automatic sorting systems, advanced recycling systems, and recycling
    machines such as recycling mills are used to recycle recyclable waste. Artificial
    intelligence and deep learning technologies can detect, separate, and recycle
    recyclable waste in a smart and accurate manner (Ullah et al., 2023; Yong et al.,
    2023). By identifying recyclable waste, these technologies can streamline the
    recycling process and increase efficiency. Furthermore, blockchain technology
    can be utilized to ensure that all stages of the collection and recycling process
    are transparent and traceable, minimizing the likelihood of fraud and illegal
    transactions (Aazam et al., 2016; Anagnostopoulos et al., 2017; Esmaeilian et
    al., 2018). Advanced technologies such as sensors, data analytics, and IoT devices
    are used by smart collection systems to improve the collection and management
    of recyclable waste. Sensors are deployed to collect data on the level of recyclable
    waste in recycling containers or bins. These sensors can detect when a container
    or bin is full or nearly full and send an alert to waste collectors to empty it.
    Subsequent to the collection of data by sensors, data analytics tools and algorithms
    are implemented to optimize waste collection routes. By devising more efficient
    routes, waste collectors can diminish the duration and expenses related to redundant
    collections. IoT devices, such as smart recycling containers and bins, communicate
    with one another and with waste management systems, delivering real-time data
    on the whereabouts and status of recyclable waste. This enables waste management
    systems to optimize the collection process and minimize waste. The system also
    utilizes smart routing to optimize waste collection routes. By scrutinizing data
    on the status and location of recycling containers or bins, waste collectors can
    plan the most effectual collection routes, reducing the duration and costs associated
    with unnecessary collections. Additionally, smart collection systems offer remote
    monitoring capabilities for recycling containers or bins, which enable waste management
    systems to keep track of the status of recycling containers or bins in real-time.
    This allows them to respond to issues or emergencies rapidly. In conclusion, smart
    collection systems leverage advanced technologies to enhance the collection and
    management of recyclable waste, resulting in waste reduction and improved efficiency
    for waste management systems (Ali et al., 2020; B. Fang et al., 2023; Shukla &
    Hait, 2022). The introduction of smart collection systems comes with several challenges
    that require attention. One of the prominent concerns is the cost, as the implementation
    of such systems can be expensive, and the associated costs may be passed onto
    residents and businesses. This may act as a barrier to the adoption of these systems,
    especially in areas where the costs of waste management are already high. Moreover,
    the installation of new infrastructure, such as sensors, data analytics systems,
    and communication networks, is essential for the operation of smart collection
    systems, which can be time-consuming and costly. This is particularly true for
    areas with existing waste management infrastructure that may require upgrading
    or replacement. Another challenge associated with smart collection systems pertains
    to data management. These systems generate a vast amount of data that needs to
    be collected, analyzed, and utilized to optimize the waste collection process.
    This requires specialized skills and resources that may not be readily available
    in all areas. Additionally, the success of smart collection systems depends on
    the participation of various stakeholders, including waste collectors, residents,
    and businesses. Engaging these stakeholders and getting them to participate in
    the waste collection process can be challenging, especially in areas where waste
    segregation and recycling are not widely practiced or where there is resistance
    to change. Furthermore, smart collection systems rely on advanced technologies
    that may be susceptible to technical issues or failures. Ensuring that these systems
    are reliable and function correctly at all times can pose a challenge. Despite
    these challenges, the benefits of smart collection systems, such as increased
    efficiency, higher recycling rates, and reduced waste management costs, make them
    an attractive approach to waste management in smart cities. Therefore, it is imperative
    to address the challenges associated with the implementation of smart collection
    systems to fully realize their potential in waste management (Ahmad et al., 2021;
    Ebekozien et al., 2022; Ijemaru et al., 2022). Blockchain technology can be applied
    in numerous ways to enhance waste management practices. One such application is
    the utilization of blockchain for supply chain tracking to track the movement
    of waste from its inception to its final destination, such as a recycling facility
    or landfill. By documenting each step of the waste management process on the blockchain,
    stakeholders can maintain a clear and tamper-proof record of the waste''s journey,
    which can aid in tracking and management of waste streams (Arabian et al., 2022;
    Barenji & Nejad, 2022). Additionally, blockchain can be used to establish digital
    identities for waste management facilities, regulators, and other stakeholders
    involved in the waste management process, ensuring the legitimacy of waste management
    activities and that waste is being handled appropriately and lawfully. Another
    application of blockchain in waste management is the use of smart contracts to
    automate processes such as waste collection and recycling. Smart contracts can
    be programmed to execute specific actions automatically, such as initiating waste
    collection when a recycling bin is full (Samuel et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2022).
    Furthermore, blockchain-based reward systems can be implemented to incentivize
    sustainable waste management practices, such as recycling or reducing waste generation.
    For example, a blockchain-based reward system could provide tokens or other incentives
    to individuals or businesses that engage in sustainable waste management practices
    (X. Zhang et al., 2023; X. Zhang et al., 2023; X. Zhang et al., 2022; Kolahan
    et al., 2021). Also, blockchain technology can be utilized to establish decentralized
    waste management systems where waste management activities are coordinated among
    several stakeholders in a peer-to-peer network. This approach can reduce the need
    for centralized waste management facilities, which can be costly and time-consuming
    to construct and maintain. In summary, blockchain technology can be utilized to
    enhance transparency, efficiency, and sustainability in waste management practices
    (Aithal, 2021; Aroba et al., 2023; Nižetić et al., 2019). Blockchain technology
    holds tremendous potential in augmenting waste management practices by providing
    several benefits, such as transparency, traceability, efficiency, fraud prevention,
    and incentivization. Blockchain technology can establish a transparent and tamper-proof
    record of waste management activities, starting from waste collection to recycling.
    This can increase trust among stakeholders, including waste management companies,
    regulators, and citizens. Also, with blockchain, waste management activities can
    be traced back to their source, allowing for improved tracking and management
    of waste streams. This can lead to better waste management practices, a reduction
    in waste, and an increase in recycling rates. Blockchain technology can facilitate
    the efficient and secure exchange of information and resources between stakeholders.
    This can result in a reduction in the time and cost associated with waste management
    activities. Additionally, blockchain technology can aid in preventing fraud and
    illegal activities in waste management, such as illegal dumping or improper handling
    of hazardous waste. With blockchain, waste management activities can be recorded
    and verified, making it challenging for malicious actors to manipulate the system.
    Moreover, blockchain technology can be utilized to incentivize positive waste
    management behaviors, such as recycling or reducing waste generation. For instance,
    blockchain-based reward systems can offer incentives to individuals or businesses
    that engage in sustainable waste management practices. Blockchain technology has
    the potential to revolutionize waste management practices, but its implementation
    also presents challenges. One of the significant challenges is the technical complexity
    of blockchain-based waste management systems. This involves a considerable investment
    of specialized expertise and resources, making it costly and time-consuming. Additionally,
    integrating blockchain-based waste management systems with existing waste management
    infrastructure can be challenging as it requires significant changes to existing
    processes and systems, which may not be feasible or cost-effective. Another challenge
    is the accuracy and completeness of data recorded on the blockchain. If data is
    inputted manually or by multiple stakeholders with varying levels of expertise,
    it can affect the reliability of waste management data and the effectiveness of
    blockchain-based waste management systems. Besides, the implementation of blockchain-based
    waste management systems may raise regulatory and legal challenges, such as data
    privacy and security concerns, and compliance with waste management regulations.
    Lastly, the success of blockchain-based waste management systems depends on the
    adoption and engagement of stakeholders, including waste management companies,
    regulators, and citizens. Ensuring that all stakeholders are willing and able
    to participate in blockchain-based waste management systems can be a challenge.
    Therefore, while blockchain technology offers numerous benefits to waste management
    practices, it is crucial to address these challenges for its effective implementation
    (Cheng et al., 2022; Fayomi et al., 2021; Ogutu et al., 2021). Artificial intelligence
    and deep learning have the potential to revolutionize waste management practices
    in a multitude of ways. One notable area of improvement is waste sorting. AI and
    deep learning algorithms can be utilized to automatically sort waste into different
    categories, such as recyclable and non-recyclable waste, which reduces the need
    for manual sorting and minimizes the risk of contamination. Predictive analytics
    is another area where AI and deep learning can be applied. The scrutiny of data
    on waste generation and collection patterns permits waste management systems to
    predict future waste generation and devise waste collection routes more competently.
    This can result in more accurate waste forecasting, reduced time and cost associated
    with waste collection, and increased recycling rates. Furthermore, the development
    of smart bins equipped with sensors and cameras that can detect and sort waste
    automatically is made possible by AI and deep learning. These smart bins can accurately
    and efficiently sort waste into different categories, reducing contamination and
    increasing recycling rates. In addition, AI and deep learning algorithms can optimize
    waste management processes such as waste collection, transportation, and recycling
    by analyzing data on waste generation, collection, and recycling. This identification
    of inefficiencies can lead to suggestions for improvements to waste management
    processes. Also, AI and deep learning can be used to detect fraud and illegal
    activities in waste management. By analyzing data on waste management activities,
    AI and deep learning algorithms can identify anomalies or suspicious patterns
    and trigger alerts to waste management authorities. Artificial Intelligence and
    deep learning have the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact
    of waste management practices. One of the notable ways in which these technologies
    can enhance waste management is through optimizing waste collection routes. By
    analyzing waste generation and collection patterns, AI and deep learning algorithms
    can identify the most efficient waste collection routes, reducing the distance
    traveled by waste collection vehicles and minimizing fuel consumption. This can
    lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Another way
    in which AI and deep learning can assist waste management is by predicting waste
    generation. By leveraging historical data and considering variables such as weather
    patterns and demographics, AI and deep learning algorithms can forecast future
    waste generation. Accurate predictions can help waste management authorities to
    plan for future waste management needs, reducing the likelihood of overcapacity
    or undercapacity in waste management facilities. Furthermore, AI and deep learning
    algorithms can be utilized to reduce contamination by identifying and sorting
    recyclable materials more accurately. This can help increase the quality of recycled
    materials while decreasing contamination, leading to a reduction in the environmental
    impact of waste management. Properly recycled materials can be reused instead
    of ending up in landfills, which can help mitigate the environmental impact of
    waste disposal. In addition, AI and deep learning can improve landfill management
    by monitoring and analyzing data on landfill conditions such as temperature, moisture,
    and gas emissions. This can enable waste management authorities to better manage
    landfills and reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal. Lastly, AI and
    deep learning technologies can be used to identify hazardous waste, such as chemicals
    and heavy metals, in waste streams. By doing so, these technologies can ensure
    that hazardous waste is appropriately handled and disposed of, reducing the risk
    of environmental contamination and harm to human health (Pirlone & Spadaro, 2014;
    Shah et al., 2018; Thakur et al., 2022). There exist several challenges in the
    implementation of AI in waste management. Data quality is a primary challenge.
    The accuracy and completeness of data used to train AI models can be inconsistent
    and incomplete, making it challenging to develop accurate and reliable AI models.
    Waste management data is collected from various sources, and standardizing it
    can be difficult, leading to inaccuracies and incomplete data sets. Technical
    complexity is another challenge. Implementing AI systems in waste management can
    be technically complex, requiring specialized expertise and resources. Developing
    and maintaining AI algorithms and systems can be costly and time-consuming, and
    the lack of technical expertise in waste management can further complicate the
    process. Integrating AI systems with existing waste management infrastructure
    is another challenge. This can require significant changes to existing processes
    and systems, which may not be feasible or cost-effective. Moreover, waste management
    infrastructure varies widely across different regions, making it challenging to
    develop a standardized approach for implementing AI systems. Regulatory and legal
    challenges also pose a significant hurdle for the implementation of AI systems
    in waste management. These challenges can include data privacy and security concerns,
    compliance with waste management regulations, and liability issues associated
    with the use of AI systems. The success of AI systems in waste management depends
    on the adoption and engagement of stakeholders, including waste management companies,
    regulators, and citizens. Ensuring that all stakeholders are willing and able
    to participate in AI-based waste management systems can be a challenge. Additionally,
    public perception of AI and concerns about job displacement may hinder the adoption
    of AI systems in waste management (Agarwal et al., 2020; Han et al., 2022; Rubab
    et al., 2022). As previously mentioned, smart city technologies can exert both
    favorable and unfavorable effects on urban natural resources and the environment.
    These technologies can mitigate energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions
    by fine-tuning energy usage in buildings, transportation systems, and other infrastructure.
    This can lead to improved air quality. Water conservation can also be improved
    by monitoring water use, detecting leaks, and optimizing water distribution systems,
    which can reduce water pollution and conserve scarce water resources. In addition,
    waste management practices can be enhanced through the implementation of smart
    city technologies. This can include waste collection, sorting, and recycling,
    which can lead to reduced waste generation, increased recycling rates, and a decrease
    in the environmental impact of waste disposal. Additionally, the use of smart
    city technologies to establish green infrastructure, like urban gardens, green
    roofs, and parks, can aid in augmenting urban biodiversity, lessening the urban
    heat island effect, and refining air quality. Smart city technologies also have
    the potential to optimize transportation systems, which can reduce congestion,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution while promoting physical activity
    through the use of sustainable transportation modes like public transport, cycling,
    and walking. However, the implementation of smart city technologies can also have
    negative impacts on the environment. For example, the production and disposal
    of electronic devices used in smart city technologies can generate electronic
    waste if not managed properly. Moreover, if powered by non-renewable sources,
    smart city technologies can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
    Additionally, the installation of smart city infrastructure, such as sensors,
    can require land and resources, which can have negative environmental impacts
    if not managed appropriately. To maximize the positive impacts of smart city technologies
    on the environment, it is crucial to prioritize sustainable and environmentally
    friendly solutions, such as renewable energy sources, green infrastructure, and
    sustainable transportation modes. The negative impacts of these technologies should
    also be carefully managed, such as the proper disposal of electronic devices and
    the appropriate use of land and resources during their installation. In conclusion,
    the impact of smart city technologies on urban natural resources and the environment
    depends on various factors, and implementing sustainable and environmentally friendly
    solutions is essential to ensure their positive impact on the environment (Chu
    et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2022). Therefore, smart city waste management technologies
    present both opportunities and challenges for promoting urban sustainability,
    as presented in Fig. 6. These technologies include smart collection systems, separation
    and recycling technologies, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and blockchain.
    Smart collection systems and separation recycling technologies can improve waste
    collection and sorting, increasing recycling rates and waste reduction. Artificial
    intelligence and deep learning enable predictive analytics and the optimization
    of waste management processes. Blockchain promotes transparency and security in
    waste management through supply chain tracking and can incentivize sustainable
    behaviors. However, the implementation of these technologies faces challenges
    related to costs, technical complexity, integration with existing infrastructure,
    data quality, regulations, and stakeholder participation. Consequently, the smart
    waste management solutions presented exhibit promising potential for diminishing
    waste volumes, enhancing recycling and circularity practices, reducing carbon
    emissions, and generating various sustainability benefits, as evidenced by previous
    implementations. However, effectively surmounting the identified challenges is
    crucial for the successful widespread adoption of these solutions at the city
    scale. Download : Download high-res image (930KB) Download : Download full-size

    technologies. 4.4. Smart cities and housing resource management The implementation
    of smart cities can yield both favorable and adverse environmental outcomes. On
    one hand, the incorporation of advanced technologies and optimized resource management
    practices can result in a reduction in environmental pollution and promote sustainable
    development in the housing sector. Notably, the utilization of energy-efficient
    appliances, monitoring systems for water consumption, and the integration of renewable
    energy sources within smart homes can contribute significantly to these objectives.
    However, it is important to acknowledge that the construction and maintenance
    of smart city infrastructure may also engender negative environmental consequences,
    such as heightened energy consumption and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
    Furthermore, the production and disposal of electronic devices and technological
    components used in smart cities may give rise to challenges related to electronic
    waste and other environmental concerns. The overall impact of smart city implementation
    on the environment and sustainable development in housing depends on various factors,
    such as the specific technologies and practices utilized, the level of public
    engagement and education, and the regulatory frameworks in place to ensure environmental
    sustainability (Jonek-Kowalska, 2022; Maalsen, 2019). In this section of the article,
    the impact of smart city implementation on enhancing sustainable development and
    managing natural resources in smart city houses is discussed. 4.4.1. Smart city
    technologies for optimizing home electricity consumption Smart city technologies
    provide various ways to manage electricity resources in houses. One of these ways
    is through home energy management systems that optimize energy consumption by
    controlling and automating electricity use. Such systems adjust lighting, heating,
    and cooling based on occupancy, time of day, and other factors. Smart appliances,
    including smart thermostats, lighting systems, and home appliances, can also be
    remotely controlled and adjusted based on energy demand and user preferences.
    Moreover, smart city technologies enable time-of-use pricing, which charges residents
    different rates for electricity use depending on the time of day. This approach
    incentivizes residents to reduce their electricity consumption during peak demand
    periods when electricity prices are high. Additionally, smart city technologies
    support energy-efficient building design through features such as insulation,
    efficient lighting and appliances, and energy-saving building materials. Time-of-use
    pricing provides several benefits to residents. Firstly, it encourages them to
    shift their electricity consumption to off-peak hours when electricity prices
    are lower, leading to reduced electricity bills. Furthermore, this approach reduces
    the overall demand for electricity during peak hours, thereby mitigating the risk
    of power outages and reducing the need for expensive new power plants. Secondly,
    time-of-use pricing promotes energy-efficient practices among residents, such
    as using appliances during off-peak hours or reducing overall energy consumption
    during peak hours. By adopting such practices, residents can reduce their carbon
    footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future. Finally, time-of-use pricing
    can lower overall electricity costs for the local community by decreasing the
    need for expensive peak capacity power plants. This can result in more stable
    and predictable electricity prices for residents in the long term. By utilizing
    time-of-use pricing, communities can benefit from lower electricity bills, reduced
    carbon emissions, and a more stable electricity supply. Smart city technologies
    also facilitate home energy audits, which can be conducted remotely using smart
    sensors. These audits provide personalized recommendations to residents for reducing
    energy consumption. By using these various approaches, smart city technologies
    optimize electricity use in houses, reducing energy consumption and greenhouse
    gas emissions while lowering electricity bills (H. Kim et al., 2021; Curiale,
    2014; Humayun et al., 2022). Smart appliances are increasingly being used in homes
    to manage energy consumption effectively and improve overall efficiency. These
    smart appliances include smart thermostats, smart lighting systems, smart home
    appliances, smart plugs, and smart water heaters. Smart thermostats are programmed
    to adjust heating and cooling settings automatically by taking into account factors
    such as occupancy, time of day, and weather conditions. By learning the residents''
    preferences and adjusting the settings accordingly, they help to reduce energy
    consumption and lower electricity bills. Smart lighting systems are equipped with
    sensors and automation technology that can adjust lighting levels based on occupancy
    and time of day. These systems can be conveniently controlled using a smartphone
    app from anywhere, enabling residents to turn lights on and off remotely and reduce
    energy consumption. Smart home appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines,
    and dishwashers, can be connected to home automation systems and controlled remotely.
    They can adjust their energy usage based on demand and provide feedback on energy
    consumption, enabling residents to manage their usage effectively. Smart plugs
    can control the power supply to appliances and devices that are not smart-enabled.
    They can be programmed to turn off automatically when not in use, reducing energy
    consumption. Smart water heaters utilize sensors and automation technology to
    adjust the temperature of the water based on demand. They can be controlled remotely
    and provide feedback on energy consumption and usage patterns, enabling residents
    to manage their usage effectively (Alzoubi, 2022; Asare-Bediako et al., 2012;
    Saad al-sumaiti et al., 2014). There are various methods available for integrating
    smart appliances into home automation systems, depending on the appliance and
    the automation system. These methods include Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity,
    Zigbee or Z-Wave protocols, IFTTT, and home automation hubs (Al-Qaseemi et al.,
    2016). Smart appliances that are equipped with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity can
    be connected to the home Wi-Fi network, enabling them to be controlled using smartphone
    apps or voice assistants (Jabbar et al., 2019). Some smart appliances use Bluetooth
    connectivity to communicate with other devices like smartphones or smart home
    hubs (ur Rehman & Gruhn, 2018). Zigbee or Z-Wave protocols are wireless communication
    protocols that are commonly used in smart home automation systems, and smart appliances
    that are compatible with these protocols can be connected to smart home hubs and
    controlled through the hub (Naidu & Kumar, 2019). IFTTT is a web-based service
    that allows users to create custom automation rules between different devices
    and services. Smart appliances that are compatible with IFTTT can be integrated
    into home automation systems and controlled based on specific triggers and actions
    (Coronado & Iglesias, 2015). Home automation hubs, such as Amazon Echo, Google
    Home, or Apple HomeKit, offer a centralized interface for controlling multiple
    smart appliances. Smart appliances that are compatible with these hubs can be
    connected to the hub and controlled using voice commands or smartphone apps (Kamdar
    et al., 2017). Smart appliances offer great convenience and flexibility as they
    can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. These apps enable users to
    manage and monitor their appliances from anywhere with an internet connection.
    For instance, a smart thermostat app allows users to adjust their home''s temperature
    remotely, ensuring a comfortable environment while saving energy. Similarly, a
    smart lighting app enables users to turn lights on and off from anywhere, even
    when not at home. Moreover, a smart dishwasher app allows users to start and stop
    their dishwasher remotely, allowing them to run it during off-peak electricity
    hours and save money on their energy bill. To control smart appliances using a
    smartphone app, users typically have to connect their appliances to a Wi-Fi network
    and download the manufacturer''s app. Once the app is installed, users can control
    their appliances using their smartphone, tablet, or any other mobile device. This
    feature provides ease of access and control to users, making their lives more
    convenient. While the ability to control smart appliances remotely using a smartphone
    app is a significant advantage, there are also some limitations to consider. One
    of these limitations is that the app''s functionality and the range of tasks it
    can perform may be restricted compared to the physical controls on the appliance
    itself. For instance, a smart oven may provide more temperature and cooking options
    on its physical control panel than on the app. Another limitation is that controlling
    smart appliances remotely requires a stable and dependable internet connection.
    If the internet connection is weak or lost, users may face difficulty controlling
    their appliances remotely. Moreover, if the app or the manufacturer''s server
    experiences technical issues, users may also encounter difficulties controlling
    their appliances. Furthermore, some users may have concerns about the security
    of their personal data and the privacy of their homes when using a smartphone
    app to control their smart appliances remotely. Hackers could potentially access
    the app and gain control of the appliances, leading to security concerns and privacy
    violations (Makhadmeh et al., 2019; Molla et al., 2019; Molla et al., 2018). 4.4.2.
    Reducing water consumption with smart home appliances and technologies Smart home
    appliances are useful not only for reducing energy consumption but also for reducing
    water consumption. By utilizing these appliances, homeowners can significantly
    reduce their water usage, contributing to a sustainable future. Among these, smart
    irrigation systems can reduce water usage in gardens and green spaces. These systems
    adopt soil moisture sensors to regulate watering schedules contingent on weather
    conditions and plant requirements. Similarly, smart toilets equipped with advanced
    technologies such as automatic washing and drying systems can minimize water usage
    by using only the necessary amount of water for cleaning. Smart washing machines
    are also equipped with water flow sensors that can precisely control the amount
    of water used, reducing water consumption as a result. Smart faucets can also
    help reduce water usage by using motion sensors to allow water flow only when
    needed and shutting off automatically when not in use. Smart showerheads equipped
    with sensors that detect shower occupancy and limit the amount of water used per
    shower also help to reduce water consumption. Additionally, smart leak detectors
    can prevent water waste by detecting leaks in pipes or appliances and alerting
    homeowners before the damage becomes severe. Smart irrigation controllers can
    detect leaks, and prevent water waste. Smart water meters can help homeowners
    track their water consumption and identify areas where water usage can be reduced.
    Smart pool systems also use sensors and automation to optimize pool water chemistry
    and detect leaks, minimizing water waste (Ishak et al., 2017; Nilsson et al.,
    2018; Passenberg et al., 2016; Veselinović et al., 2020; Waleed et al., 2018).
    In KNX protocol-enabled smart buildings, a smart water meter is installed after
    the main water pipe enters the subscriber''s premises. The smart water meter determines
    the required amount of water for each day and night based on water consumption
    patterns, considering the number of residents and other factors. If the building''s
    water consumption exceeds the predetermined amount, the smart water meter sends
    a message to the controllers to cut off the water flow and sends an alert message
    to the residents'' control panels or mobile phones. Following this alert, if the
    water flow is reconnected, the cost of water per liter progressively increases.
    To configure the KNX protocol, several equipment items are necessary, including
    a switch operator, two power supplies, an internet connection module, a central
    control display for monitoring and entering initial information, an electric valve,
    two energy meters, and eight network infrastructures. Improper reuse, dripping,
    or leaks caused by corrosion and wear on washers in water valves lead to significant
    drinking water wastage in residential buildings. These issues are often prevalent
    in areas of the building where people are not always present, such as bathrooms
    and toilets. In smart buildings designed with the KNX protocol, presence detection
    sensors are installed in these areas to turn the water on and off based on the
    person''s presence. To implement a smart system that controls the water temperature
    in residential homes using the KNX protocol, specific equipment is required, including
    a switch operator, two power supplies, an internet connection module, a central
    control display for monitoring and entering initial information, an electric valve,
    two human presence detection sensors, and eight network infrastructures. Around
    60 % of household drinking water is used for washing purposes, resulting in wastage
    of a portion of water to achieve the desired temperature in each wash (such as
    in bathrooms and kitchen sinks). Therefore, in a smart building, sensors can be
    installed at the outlet of water valves to determine the desired water temperature.
    The embedded system then adjusts the water temperature inside the pipes until
    it reaches the desired temperature and makes it available to the user. To implement
    a smart system that controls the water temperature in residential homes using
    the KNX protocol, specific equipment is required, including a switch operator,
    two power supplies, an internet connection module, a central control display for
    monitoring and entering initial information, an electric valve, two water temperature
    sensors, eight human presence detection sensors, and one network infrastructure
    (Bajer, 2018; Benavente-Peces, 2019; Koulamas et al., 2017). Fig. 7 shows the
    various smart home appliances and technologies that can optimize energy and water
    consumption in households. The figure is categorized into three sections: smart
    energy management systems, time-of-use pricing, and smart water management systems.
    The smart energy management systems category includes examples such as smart thermostats,
    lighting systems, and home appliances, which can be remotely controlled and adjusted
    based on energy demand and user preferences. Time-of-use pricing, demonstrated
    in the second category, incentivizes residents to reduce electricity consumption
    during peak demand periods when electricity prices are high, resulting in reduced
    electricity bills, stable electricity supply, and a smaller carbon footprint.
    The third category, smart water management systems, comprises smart toilets, washing
    machines, faucets, showerheads, leak detectors, irrigation controllers, water
    meters, and pool systems, which can significantly reduce water usage. In general,
    the utilization of smart home appliances and technologies empowers homeowners
    to effectively manage their energy and water usage, thereby making a valuable
    contribution towards a more sustainable future. Extensive research reveals that
    the implementation of smart home energy and water systems, as depicted, facilitates
    substantial resource savings and conservation while offering residents flexibility
    and convenience. When combined with sustainable building practices, these technologies
    assume a critical role in promoting sustainable housing and achieving cities''
    efficiency objectives. Download : Download high-res image (832KB) Download : Download

    research methodology to investigate the integration of urban natural resources
    and smart city technologies for sustainable development. Through a systematic
    review and analysis of literature, the study aimed to explore the concept of smart
    cities and identify key elements related to the integration of green spaces and
    smart technologies in cities. The findings of this study indicate that green spaces
    play a significant role in promoting sustainability in smart cities. The incorporation
    of green spaces, such as converting them into renewable energy sources, using
    them as natural filters to improve air and water quality, and designing them as
    public spaces, can facilitate environmental, social, and economic development
    in smart cities. However, effectively utilizing green spaces requires the implementation
    of smart technologies, such as sensors, to collect and analyze data on factors
    like air pollution, temperature, and irrigation levels. This data can provide
    insights to improve the planning and management of green spaces in a sustainable
    manner. While the implementation of green space data analysis offers several benefits,
    such as improved air quality, water conservation, urban planning, and public health,
    it also faces challenges related to cost, data reliability, privacy, and expertise.
    Strategies, such as public-private partnerships, community engagement, and allocating
    funding and resources, can help address these challenges. Comparative analysis
    further revealed that cities in the West and East employ green space data analysis,
    but they differ in their approaches and motivations. The focus in the West has
    been primarily on environmental and social benefits, whereas in the East, the
    emphasis has been more on urban planning and development. The study also demonstrates
    that smart cities can use various technologies and policies to address environmental
    challenges, such as air pollution in low-income and disadvantaged communities.
    Deploying air quality sensors, implementing green infrastructure, transit-oriented
    development, low-emission zones, clean energy incentives, and community outreach
    campaigns have been effective in improving air quality and public health in these
    communities. However, the effectiveness of these interventions depends on factors
    such as policy design, community engagement, available resources, and infrastructure.
    Smart cities are utilizing advanced technologies and strategies to effectively
    manage electricity resources and build more sustainable energy systems. Smart
    grid systems allow cities to optimize the flow of electricity in real-time, resulting
    in improved efficiency and reliability. Integrating renewable energy sources such
    as solar and wind power into the grid promotes sustainability by reducing reliance
    on fossil fuels and emissions. Energy-efficient building designs and demand response
    programs help to lower overall electricity demand and costs. Investing in electric
    vehicle charging infrastructure and energy storage systems provides more options
    for balancing supply and demand. Microgrids increase resilience by providing backup
    power. Furthermore, data analytics tools enable targeted programs aimed at reducing
    waste and predicting infrastructure needs. Despite the numerous benefits, challenges
    such as high costs, interoperability, and data privacy must be addressed to ensure
    the feasibility and success of these technologies. A comprehensive, collaborative
    approach that promotes public understanding and policy reform can further progress
    in this area. The future of urban living depends on adaptable, renewable energy
    systems and efficient resource use. With global populations centralized in cities,
    their infrastructure and policies will shape sustainability on a broad scale.
    Technological and social innovation must converge to develop pragmatic solutions
    for managing electricity in cities. Transitioning from outdated systems requires
    long-term vision and investments that yield returns through environmental and
    financial security. Though a complex undertaking, reimagining how we power our
    shared spaces paves the way for greater wellbeing, connectivity, and prosperity.
    With smart designs and stronger communities, cities can lead in fostering a cleaner,
    brighter future for generations to come. Several key conclusions can be drawn
    regarding smart city solutions for sustainable urban water management. Smart irrigation
    systems that utilize soil moisture sensors and weather data can optimize water
    usage for urban green spaces and reduce waste. By linking the sensors to a central
    control system, irrigation can be tailored to the specific needs of the plants
    and delayed during times when rain is forecast. This precision approach can improve
    irrigation efficiency and reduce excess water usage, which can range from 50 to
    70 % to up to 95 %. Smart water distribution systems equipped with meters, sensors,
    and variable pressure pumps can significantly curb water loss from leakage. Installing
    meters at network nodes and linking them to a control center allows for the continuous
    monitoring of water flow, enabling the rapid detection of anomalous losses. Reducing
    pressure during low-demand periods can also mitigate leakage from worn infrastructure.
    Such systems have been shown to achieve water savings of up to 11 % when implemented
    at a city scale. Demand management initiatives, such as tiered pricing and education
    programs, can encourage conservation among water users. Dynamic pricing that increases
    rates for higher levels of consumption has been demonstrated to motivate people
    to use less water. Education programs that provide information about water issues
    and offer tips for reducing usage can also help foster a culture of sustainability.
    Smart cities aim to utilize advanced technologies to enhance sustainability and
    improve the quality of life. However, it is important to consider the potential
    positive and negative impacts of these technologies on the environment. While
    smart technologies can optimize energy usage, enhance water conservation, improve
    waste management, and promote the use of green infrastructure and sustainable
    transportation, their production and disposal can also generate electronic waste
    that requires careful management to avoid environmental harm. Additionally, the
    installation of smart infrastructure requires land and resources, which must be
    used responsibly. Despite these challenges, the benefits of smart cities can far
    outweigh their costs when proper safeguards and policymaking are in place. This
    section highlights several key conclusions regarding the role of smart technologies
    in urban sustainability. Smart energy systems that utilize renewable sources and
    optimize usage can substantially decrease greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.
    Precision technologies for water distribution and irrigation can curb excess water
    usage and loss, mitigating scarcity even as populations grow. Advanced waste collection
    and sorting techniques enabled by sensors and AI can minimize waste generation,
    increase recycling, and reduce the impact of waste disposal on the environment.
    Blockchain technology, in particular, shows promise for transparent and efficient
    waste management. Smart transportation and infrastructure can reduce vehicle usage,
    promote walking and cycling, and foster the development of green spaces, with
    benefits for both the environment and public health. By prioritizing minimal environmental
    impact through sustainable solutions and policies, smart cities can leverage technology
    to conserve natural resources rather than exploit them. The integration of smart
    home technologies offers promising solutions for optimizing resource management
    and reducing environmental impacts in housing. Through the use of smart appliances,
    home automation systems, and sustainable building practices, residents can significantly
    reduce their energy and water consumption. Smart thermostats, lighting systems,
    leak detectors, and time-of-use pricing systems enable convenient and efficient
    monitoring of resource usage, incentivizing more sustainable behaviors. Despite
    limitations related to technology access and electronic waste, communities stand
    to benefit both environmentally and economically by transitioning to smart and
    eco-friendly homes. Smart city systems can leverage data on resource demands to
    develop targeted programs for residential efficiency and infrastructure improvements.
    Given the concentration of global populations in cities, sustainable housing is
    a crucial component of the broader movement toward secure and livable urban spaces.
    However, further research is needed to assess the long-term impacts, ensure equitable
    access, and streamline the complex processes of upgrading conventional homes or
    developing new smart communities. The main findings and contributions of this
    study encompass the positive role of green spaces in promoting sustainability
    through their utilization as renewable energy sources, natural filtration systems,
    and public gathering spaces. Additionally, the study underscores the importance
    of incorporating smart technologies, such as sensors, to effectively gather and
    analyze data for enhanced planning and management of green spaces. While the utilization
    of data analysis in green space management offers numerous advantages, it is crucial
    to address associated challenges through strategies like public-private partnerships
    and community involvement. By conducting a comparative analysis of Western and
    Eastern cities, the research uncovers distinct motivations behind green space
    data analysis, with a focus on environmental and social benefits in Western cities,
    and urban planning benefits in Eastern cities. Furthermore, the study highlights
    the potential of technologies and policies to address environmental justice concerns
    in disadvantaged communities. Notably, the research evaluates various technologies
    and strategies for optimizing electricity resources, conserving water, and managing
    waste with the goal of promoting urban sustainability. Therefore, the integration
    of smart technologies and sustainable practices in homes and cities demonstrates
    the potential for technology and social innovation to converge in pragmatic solutions
    that yield wellbeing through efficiency, cost savings, and reduced environmental
    harm. By embracing green designs and practices, communities can lead the way in
    building a cleaner and brighter future for generations to come. Declaration of

    The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized how we live and work by connecting
    everyday devices to the Internet. As the demand for IoT devices grows, a reliable
    and efficient communication infrastructure to support these devices has become
    crucial. Cellular IoT (CIoT) has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge,
    offering a low-cost, low-power, and scalable communication network for IoT devices.
    This paper presents a comprehensive overview of CIoT technology in response to
    the growing demand for IoT applications with low latency, high coverage, low power
    consumption, high device connection, and low cost. The four major CIoT technologies
    standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization are
    investigated, including extended coverage global system for mobile communications
    IoT (EC-GSM-IoT), long-term evolution for machine-type communications (LTE-M),
    narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), and recently, new radio reduced capability (NR-RedCap).
    These technologies are analyzed regarding their fundamental focuses, features,
    use cases, requirements, and future work. In addition, we provide a comparative
    study of these types of IoT technology to assist researchers in understanding
    the available options and their potential limitations. Finally, open challenges
    are discussed to direct future research in the field. Previous article in issue

    communicationsMobile networks 1. Introduction The cellular Internet of Things
    (CIoT) refers to using cellular networks, such as fourth and fifth-generation
    (4G and 5G) networks, to connect IoT devices to the Internet. These devices can
    range from simple to complex, from smart thermostats and surveillance cameras
    to agricultural monitoring systems. The concept of CIoT is derived from an interest
    in a wide coverage area, massive connectivity, security, trustworthiness, ultralow
    latency, throughput, and ultra-reliability. One of the main benefits of using
    cellular networks for the IoT is their wide coverage area and ability to connect
    to the Internet, even in remote or hard-to-reach locations. Compared to other
    types of wireless networks, cellular networks typically offer greater reliability
    and lower latency, making them ideal for applications that require real-time data
    transfers or remote control [1]. Moreover, because many IoT applications are mission
    critical and demand more than 99.99% reliability with less than 1 ms end-to-end
    latency, cellular connectivity is considered the most appropriate option because
    it has access to the licensed spectrum, ensuring the security and reliability
    of the communication service [2]. Due to their global and standardized nature,
    cellular technology is required for the connection of billions of devices in IoT
    applications. The cellular network offers a variety of attributes that makes it
    a good choice for various IoT applications, including good quality of service
    (QoS) and experience (QoE), the ability to support mobility and service-level
    agreements, fast data rates, and worldwide coverage [1]. To support massive connectivity,
    the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization has standardized
    three new types of technology: the extended coverage (EC) global system for mobile
    communications (GSM) IoT (EC-GSM-IoT), long-term evolution (LTE) for machine-type
    communications (LTE-M), and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), known as the CIoT, since
    Release (Rel.) 13. Additionally, Rel. 17 introduced the fourth category of CIoT
    technology, called reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR), which is specifically
    designed to offer cellular services to a vast number of IoT devices planned for
    use in the 5G licensed spectrum [3]. The improvements made by 3GPP from Rel. 13
    [4] to 15 [5] are on their baseline deployment; however, since Rel. 16, LTE-M
    and the NB-IoT can share the 5G NR channels with 5G devices. 3GPP is working on
    a technology that assures better coverage for a large number of inexpensive, low-throughput
    devices with low power consumption in applications that can tolerate delays. The
    CIoT is being applied as a new approach to global connectivity and remote device
    management. Moreover, given the enhanced data rate and capacity, 5G networks are
    expected to drive numerous IoT connections. Thus, cellular networks should be
    optimized to support low-power and low-data-rate use cases to satisfy IoT demands
    [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Machine-type communication (MTC) applications can be
    delay-tolerant (tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g., utility meters)
    or delay-sensitive (cannot tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g.,
    remote robotics surgery), certain applications, such as smart cities, fall in
    the middle of these two opposite ends. Considering these categories, as per Ericsson’s
    mobility report [11], by 2023, 3.5 billion CIoT connections are expected to be
    deployed, and by 2026 [12], the NB-IoT and LTE-M are expected to comprise 45%
    of all CIoT connections. Consequently, research has been conducted to provide
    a review of the CIoT with various scopes and themes, as detailed in the subsequent
    section (Section 2). However, the existing studies have covered only a subset
    of the CIoT technology or were limited to a specific focus area. Table 1. Definitions

    Fig. 1. Paper organization. 2. Related work Since the introduction of the CIoT,
    various research has been conducted from different perspectives to provide an
    overview of the related use cases, key enablers, and challenges. A comparative
    study [13] evaluated the NB-IoT against other technology regarding latency, QoS,
    battery lifetime, capacity, and cost, applying some application scenarios. In
    other studies [14], [15], authors have analyzed the indoor coverage, low power
    consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection support of NB-IoT-targeted
    technical features, such as resource allocation, energy-efficiency techniques,
    and latency-energy performance evaluations. In addition, some applications, such
    as smart agriculture and smart health, have been analyzed with future research
    directions. In [16], the authors detailed and analyzed possible security attacks
    on NB-IoT-enabled devices and proposed various approaches and techniques for smart
    home and smart healthcare applications. Standardization efforts employed on the
    security aspects of the NB-IoT and security requirements of IoT applications with
    an extensible combination of the NB-IoT to the 5G are addressed in [17]. In [18],
    basic factors, such as the modulation scheme selection and channel coding that
    affect the energy consumption of the NB-IoT from the perspective of resource management,
    were analyzed and synthesized, and future work suggestions were offered. In [19],
    the physical layer, specifically the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE)
    of the NB-IoT system, was presented in detail, exploring the radio resource control
    (RRC) and medium access control (MAC) layers in the physical design of channels
    as well. In [20], the power consumption and communication range of self-powered
    NB-IoT in remote monitoring applications were evaluated. However, these studies
    [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] considered only the NB-IoT technology
    in the CIoT. The authors of [21] focused on integrating low-power wide-area network
    (LPWA) technology to preserve an affordable low-battery device and a wide geographical
    area while enhancing power consumption and providing future research directions.
    In [22], channel control procedures and massive MTC (mMTC) standard guidelines
    with NB-IoT and LTE-M features, including wide coverage, low power consumption,
    and massive connectivity, were explored along with future challenges and innovative
    ideas. A comparative study on the performance of CIoT technology was conducted
    in [23], focusing primarily on the NB-IoT and LTE-M. Coverage (i.e., coverage
    enhancements (CEs)), power consumption, module cost, connection count (i.e., number
    of connections per cell), supported features (i.e., voice support), and service
    modes have been compared. In [24], the authors provided comprehensive guidance
    on the IoT localization methods of NB-IoT and LTE-M devices, which is vital for
    ultra-dense devices that result in IoT positioning problems. Power consumption
    is the primary concern in IoT applications. Hence, improving battery life and
    message latency is essential, especially in rare data transmission cases, because
    it has a large signaling overhead in LTE-M and the NB-IoT due to the process of
    establishing a connection. In [25], the authors clarified early data transmission
    (EDT) mechanisms introduced by 3GPP to transmit data during the random-access
    procedure (triggers the connection to a cell) to enhance the power efficiency
    of the device and minimize message delay, which is vital in a wide coverage scenario.
    The authors of [26] evaluated mMTC features and QoS provisioning issues with critical
    enablers for mMTC in cellular networks. A detailed overview is presented on the
    channel access mechanisms and radio access network (RAN) congestion problems in
    the NB-IoT and LTE-M with machine learning (Q-learning approach) solutions for
    congestion relief, including future research directions. However, these surveys
    [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] reviewed only the NB-IoT and LTE-M. In [7],
    the authors investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M as licensed LPWA technologies,
    focusing on their low power consumption, low data rate, and broad coverage area
    features. Their study had a limited scope and aimed to facilitate LPWAN-5G integration
    to support a more extensive range of industrial applications, including process
    control and high data-rate multimedia applications. The authors of [27] compared
    the cost of EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT in urban and rural deployments and key
    cost factors from the perspective of profitability in employing the CIoT in firms.
    A broad survey on energy-saving solutions in EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT was
    conducted, including analyzing critical factors that affect power usage, such
    as data reporting frequency, discontinuous reception cycles (DRX), and RRC timers,
    [28], directing future energy consumption reduction techniques. However, these
    studies [7], [27], [28] investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M within limited
    key enablers. Table 2. Summary of recent surveys on the CIoT. Reference Year CIoT

    In [29], the authors provided the primary features of the RedCap device standardized
    by 3GPP to support mid-range IoT applications with complexity reduction, coverage

    assessment of coverage for RedCap UE in various settings, including rural, urban,
    and indoor scenarios. In [30], a comprehensive overview of 3GPP Rel. 17 RedCap
    regarding cost reduction, and power-saving results were presented with design
    guidelines with future expected 3GPP RedCap release specifications. These surveys
    [9], [29], [30] focused on RedCap with some feature components based on the 3GPP
    standard specifications. In [31], the authors analyzed EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap and verified that they are proven as 5G IoT standards employed in various
    real-time applications when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI). However,
    the research focuses on AI and IoT integration in the CIoT with future research
    directions. Hence, considering the various surveys conducted, the surveys and
    studies address various aspects with limited focus. However, this survey provides
    comprehensive all-in-one information on coverage, power consumption, cost, device
    complexity, and device connection analysis. Furthermore, this review covers the
    general architecture, applications, release enhancement, development analysis,
    focus area explorations, and future challenges based on previous studies and on-hand
    survey results. Table 2 summarizes related studies to illustrate the difference
    from this survey. 3. General network architecture of the CIoT This section discusses
    the general network architecture of the CIoT. The cellular network standards organizations,
    such as 3GPP and its member companies: Ericsson, Huawei, Qualcomm, and Vodafone
    endorse the cellular-network-based architecture of CIoT. Cellular-network-based
    architectures connect IoT devices to the cellular network’s IoT infrastructure
    and allow them to access the Internet through middleware provided by the operators.
    Various requirements, such as bandwidth, energy efficiency, coverage, mobility,
    and reliability, are considered when network architecture is developed and deployed.
    The network architecture of the CIoT is designed to be scalable and flexible to
    support a wide range of devices and applications. Its ultimate goal is to transition
    from inflexible network structures, where all devices communicate directly with
    a network access point, to a more flexible architecture. This new approach allows
    devices and the network to dynamically form interconnected sub-networks, resembling
    a mesh, as and when needed [32]. It can support low-power, low-bandwidth, and
    high-power, high-bandwidth devices and can be easily integrated with existing
    networks and systems. Integration with existing networks and systems allows organizations
    to leverage the advantages offered by IoT without having to completely overhaul
    the existing infrastructure. Fig. 2 presents the general network architecture
    of CIoT, facilitating communication between IoT devices and the Internet. A CIoT
    network architecture focuses on increasing network robustness against dynamic
    resource availability and providing ubiquitous connectivity. For instance, to
    meet the requirements of CIoT, existing legacy network architectures need to undergo
    substantial changes, such as enabling non-orthogonal access to increase the number
    of connected devices, implementing grant-free UL communication for fast and reliable
    communication, and adopting a multihop mesh network to support low-power devices
    in challenging locations [33]. As CIoT operates within existing cellular infrastructure,
    it facilitates interoperability between devices and harvests communication and
    computing resources across the network [34]. As depicted in the figure, the architecture
    comprises four main components: the IoT devices, BS, network stack (user plane
    and control plane), and Internet (CIoT applications). The first layer, the IoT
    devices include sensors, actuators, and other connected devices that collect and
    transmit data. Using these nodes, sensor data will be collected and transmitted
    to the access point, or they will receive data from it, to perform the response
    associated with the actuators. These devices communicate with the next layer,
    the BS, using CIoT technology (EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap), which connects
    the IoT devices to the network. Download : Download high-res image (761KB) Download

    layer is the network stack, comprising the user and control planes responsible
    for the efficient and effective data delivery between IoT devices and applications
    which are the two optimizations for the CIoT. The user and control planes form
    two distinct layers of the network stack and serve distinct functions, with the
    user plane carrying the data and the control plane managing the network resources
    [35]. Specifically, the user plane manages the data transmission and chooses the
    best path for control data packets for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) [36], and
    the control plane manages the overall network. In addition, the user and control
    planes work together to ensure an efficient and reliable exchange of information
    among IoT devices and the Internet. Finally, CIoT applications are at the top
    layer, which includes the applications and services that use the data collected
    by IoT devices. These applications can include everything from smart home systems
    to industrial automation systems [37]. The CIoT network architecture allows for
    the seamless integration of IoT devices and applications, making it an essential
    part of the IoT and plays a significant role to enable massive CIoT applications.
    Some of the CIoT technology (e.g., LTE-M and the NB-IoT) operates over a shared
    spectrum of LTE architecture with certain optimization techniques [38]. Some features
    were removed to reduce the complexity, equipment cost, and battery consumption
    in the shared LTE architecture, including handover for fast connection, carrier
    aggregation, and channel quality measurements [39]. In the CIoT network, two dedicated
    machines are used for communication: the MTC device and the MTC gateway. An MTC
    device is an endpoint that can communicate directly with a BS or connect via two
    hops to MTC gateways, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In this way, MTC gateways help
    increase data transmission efficiency by relaying data to the BS [40]. In fact,
    gateway utilization is feasible in numerous instances, but certain regions and
    circumstances lack such infrastructure. Consequently, in such scenarios, it becomes
    imperative to establish direct communication. 4. CIoT application use-case classifications
    The development of CIoT results from collaboration and innovation from multiple
    companies and researchers [11], [41], [42]. It has emerged as a way to extend
    the capabilities of cellular networks to establish connectivity for a diverse
    range of devices to enable a broad range of new use cases and applications, such
    as smart cities, industrial automation, and remote monitoring, to mention a few,
    by offering low-cost, low-power, and reliable connectivity. Globally, the standards
    of the CIoT have been developed by 3GPP and Ericsson, among others, which have
    different methods of classifying CIoT application use cases, as presented in Fig.
    3. Accordingly, this section discusses the application use classification by 3GPP
    and Ericsson. 4.1. 3GPP classification 3GPP is a collaboration between telecommunications
    standard organizations to develop global standards for cellular communication
    technologies [43]. Specifically, 3GPP is working on the development of 5G technology
    and standardization of IoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices [44]. They also work on developing new features and functionalities
    for cellular networks, such as network slicing, improved security, and reduced
    latency, to support the growing demands of IoT and other emerging technologies.
    This section focuses on their classifications from the application perspectives
    that 3GPP defines three usage scenarios of 5G: mMTC, ultra-reliable and low-latency
    communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) [45], [46]. 4.1.1.
    mMTC Specifically, mMTC is designed to enable numerous low-power, low-cost IoT
    devices to connect to cellular networks where many devices infrequently transmit
    small volumes of data. It is designed to connect numerous low-cost devices (e.g.,
    about 1,000,0000 devices/km ) with sporadic, low-throughput data transmissions
    within a 10-s latency [47]. The focus is on low power consumption with up to 10
    years of battery life and high reliability to efficiently use the network resources.
    It is intended for use cases requiring high device density, such as smart cities,
    industrial automation, smart homes, smart metering, and asset tracking, where
    many devices must connect to the network simultaneously. In Rel. 13, 3GPP proposed
    LPWA cellular technology that specified long-range coverage of 164 dB, inexpensive
    and extremely energy-efficient devices that necessitate intermittent and periodic
    connectivity, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT [45]. 4.1.2. URLLC Higher
    reliability and lower latency are the most important design standards in wireless
    communications. From Rel. 14 to the present, reliability and latency have been
    the focus requirements, such as new data center interconnect formats, enhanced
    physical DL control channel (PDCCH) monitoring capability, hybrid automatic repeat
    request acknowledgment (HARQ ACK) feedback based on sub slots, enhanced inter-UE
    transmitter (Tx) multiplexing, physical UL shared channel (PUSCH) enhancements,
    and a variety of active configuration grants [48]. It is intended for IoT applications
    that are mission-critical, such as emergency services, which demand high availability
    and coverage with a low response time of fewer than 1 ms. It is intended for use
    cases, such as factory automation, autonomous driving, and remote surgery [46]
    for which NR-RedCap is a complement. 4.1.3. eMBB The eMBB is designed to provide
    high-bandwidth and low-latency media streaming applications [49], such as virtual
    and augmented reality, smart offices, and 4k and 8k video streaming with ultra-high
    speed Internet access. The eMBB is intended for use cases, such as smart cities
    and entertainment. Although eMBB and CIoT differ, they can work together to offer
    more comprehensive and reliable connectivity solutions. The purpose of organizations
    in the CIoT regarding eMBB is to work to integrate them to share the capabilities
    of the trending wireless development in 5G. These categories are not mutually
    exclusive and can overlap. For example, an IoT application may require both mMTC
    and URLLC capabilities (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart grids, industrial automation),
    or an IoT device may require mMTC and eMBB capabilities (smart cities, healthcare,
    and smart agriculture). 3GPP aims to establish a framework that can cater to the
    varied needs of IoT applications and devices and ensure seamless interoperability
    among devices and networks. 4.2. Ericsson classification Ericsson [50], a leading
    information communication technology network provider, working on developing solutions
    for connecting a large number of devices to the network, improving network coverage,
    and increasing the efficiency and security of IoT applications. Involved in the
    standardization and development of CIoT technology and refined the IoT applications
    incorporated into the CIoT into four divisions: massive IoT, broadband IoT, critical
    IoT, and industrial automation IoT [32], [51]. Download : Download high-res image
    (580KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. 3GPP and Ericsson’s CIoT use-case
    classifications. 4.2.1. Massive IoT Massive IoT is focused on low-cost devices,
    small data volumes, and extreme coverage. It is intended to enable increased network
    coverage, longer device lifespan, and high connection density, which is known
    as mMTC. Ericsson identified the massive IoT as LPWA technology, as classified
    by 3GPP, employed on licensed spectrum bands. Massive IoT is employed when low-complexity
    devices, long battery life, extensive coverage, and massive deployments are necessary.
    Massive IoT applications (i.e., smart building, retail, shopping, and manufacturing;
    smart home systems; personal IoT devices; etc.) tend to tolerate delays at various
    levels in operation [52], [53], [54]. Hence, LTE-M, EC-GSM-IoT, and NB-IoT were
    developed by 3GPP to support the massive IoT [55] in which according to Ericsson’s
    projection massive IoT will make up 51 percent of CIoT connections by 2027 [56].
    4.2.2. Broadband IoT The broadband IoT provides significantly faster data transfer
    speeds and reduced latency compared to the massive IoT, which was released based
    on mobile broadband [50]. The broadband IoT is evolving due to the requirements
    of accessing multimedia information with high throughput, low latency, and large
    data volumes for communication purposes. The broadband IoT is designed for high-bandwidth
    applications, such as video surveillance and remote health monitoring. Due to
    its capability of supporting high-speed data transfer, it enables devices to transmit
    numerous data quickly and efficiently, which is relevant in healthcare applications
    (e.g., where high-resolution images and data-intensive information is transmitted
    in real-time). 4.2.3. Critical IoT The critical IoT is necessary when the industrial
    IoT (IIoT) and mission-critical applications that require ultrahigh performance,
    very high availability (99.999%), ultra-reliability, and ultralow latency are
    in demand [57]. Unlike the massive IoT, applications of the critical IoT that
    require a minimal delay, such as smart healthcare (e.g., remote surgery), industrial
    automation in smart manufacturing [22], autonomous driving, asset tracking, traffic
    safety and control, and remote control of the sensitive components of a smart
    grid automation [58], are particularly sensitive to delays. Critical IoT applications
    are technically known as URLLC, comprising industrial control, robotic machines,
    and autonomous vehicles [32] that require real-time data transmission. Ultra-reliable,
    very low latency, and very high availability are the key performance indicators
    of the critical IoT [54]. 4.2.4. Industrial automation IoT The IIoT targets improving
    the operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability of industrial processes
    and systems that require unique network deployments. The IIoT is designed for
    applications in manufacturing and industrial process automation [46], achieving
    increased reliability, reduced latency, higher data transfer rates, greater flexibility,
    and secure communication. The IIoT is the focus and enabler of Industry 4.0 [32],
    [59], [60], enhancing the controlling capability with remote monitoring applications,
    such as smart factories, agricultural monitoring, and industrial assets [61].
    The IIoT is primarily applied in IoT applications that demand Ethernet protocol
    integration, time-sensitive networking, clock synchronization services, and other
    requirements. Furthermore, in these industrial real time applications proper implementation
    and effective design of deep learning algorithms are necessary aiming for high
    performance in terms of reliability, speed, and security. Deep learning provides
    a dynamic optimization of the warehouse facilities, enhances assembly line performance,
    improves the generative design, predicts future demands, and reduces errors [62].
    Moreover, low cost and complexity are the most important factors in the IIoT [63].
    5. CIoT technologies This section discusses CIoT technology from various perspectives.
    Initially, 3GPP collated cellular network technology for the IoT in Rel. 13 included
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and in Rel. 17 the NR-RedCap. As illustrated in Table
    3, we summarize the fundamental parameters of the first Rel. 13 for the three
    types of CIoT technology and the first NR-RedCap Rel. 17 technology. 3GPP worked
    on the EC-GSM-IoT (a complete backward-compatible solution for CIoT that builds
    upon the existing GSM or enhanced-GPRS (eGPRS) deployments) under the 850–900
    MHz and 1800–1900 MHz frequency bandwidth with the aim of achieving extended battery
    life and lower device costs compared to general packet radio service (GPRS) or
    GSM devices. It also has extended coverage of up to 164 dB maximum coupling loss
    (MCL) for 33 dBm UE and 154 dB MCL for 23 dBm UE, with variable rates using Gaussian
    minimum shift keying (GMSK) ranging from approximately 350 bps to 70 kbps, and
    eight-phase shift keying (8PSK) up to 240 kbps. The technology can handle a large
    number of devices, with around 50,000 per cell, and provides enhanced security
    compared to GSM orEDGE. It can be installed through a software update to the GSM
    infrastructure [66]. Table 3. First release parameter values of the CIoT (LTE-M,

    Moreover, as shown in the table, the first release of LTE-M, Cat-0, was out on
    Rel. 12 in March 2015 to be configured as a UE Cat-0 (Cat-0 MTC) IoT version.
    In Rel. 13 in March 2016, LTE enhanced MTC or Cat-M1 (Cat-1 MTC) IoT, and the
    NB-IoT was released to afford IoT applications. In the combined Cat-0 and Cat-M1,
    LTE-M was introduced to contribute a 1 Mbps data-rate capacity, supporting full
    mobility features with a battery life exceeding a duration of 10 years, which
    can be configured easily with a software update to the LTE infrastructure. In
    the multiple access techniques, both Cat-0 and Cat-M1 in the UL transmission scenario
    support the single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) methods,
    and in the downlink scenario, they both employ orthogonal frequency-division multiple
    access (OFDMA). However, Cat-0 and Cat-M1 have differences in terms of the UL
    and DL bandwidth coverage. The former has a 20 MHz bandwidth, and the latter has
    a 1.4 MHz bandwidth derived from the legacy LTE. The coverage or link budget of
    Cat-0 is around 141 and is 156 dB for Cat-M1 [43]. In contrast, the NB-IoT was
    developed from an LTE or GSM network with 200 kHz of physical resource blocks
    (PRBs) and a clean sheet format of 180 kHz that can be compatible with a software
    update to the existing legacy LTE or GSM systems under the 700, 800 and 900 MHz
    frequency bandwidth. Because the NB-IoT utilizes many of the same design aspects
    as LTE, including channel modulation, coding schemes, and higher-layer protocols,
    it provides deployment flexibility and is primarily designed to address ultralow-end
    IoT applications [65], [68]. The NB-IoT introduces two modes of operation types,
    different from the LTE, where the whole PRB is assigned to a single piece of UE
    in the UL and DL. In the single-tone mode, the NB-IoT utilizes one PRB that has
    a bandwidth of 180 kHz in both the DL and UL of the LTE spectrum. However, in
    the multitone mode, the resource units are allocated to multiple pieces of UE
    to attain the massive device deployment objective of the CIoT, specifically for
    the NB-IoT. The NB-IoT system assigns each tone a transmission bandwidth of either
    3.75 or 15 kHz for UL transmission using the SC-FDMA scheme. For DL transmission,
    15 kHz transmission bandwidth is used with the OFDMA scheme similar to LTE. Using
    15 kHz spacing, NB-IoT can allocate either one or multiple tones (three, six,
    or twelve) to different UE with durations of 4, 2, and 1 ms, respectively. However,
    with 3.75 kHz spacing, only a single-tone allocation is supported for various
    users, with 48 sub-carriers of 32 ms duration [69], which allows the NB-IoT for
    increased deployment flexibility and higher system capacity. From the Rel. 13
    specifications, the data rate in the single-tone allocation is 48 kbps for the
    UL, 64 kbps for the multitone mode, and 128 kbps in the single- and multitone
    modes in the DL, with a 20 dB link budget from the legacy LTE of 144 dB supporting
    more than 10 years of battery life but without mobility support [70]. In addition,
    3GPP introduced RedCap on 5G device specifications with reduced features in Rel.
    17, designed objectively to simplify the standard NR technology. In the 5G technology,
    it is insufficient to reuse traditional existing frequency bands for high-end
    5G requirements, so another new and varied frequency band is needed. For 5G NR,
    frequency band 1 (FR1) is below 6 GHz or 4.10 to 7.125 GHz, and frequency band
    2 (FR2) is above 6 GHz or 24.250 to 52.600 GHz [71]. Hence, RedCap is supposed
    to use 20 MHz for FR1 and 50 and 100 MHz for FR2 in the UL and DL bandwidths,
    respectively [67]. The multiple access method is FDMA or time division multiple
    access (TDMA), where frequency or time slot is employed. The peak data rate varies
    based on the use cases (e.g., 2 Mbps is expected for wireless industry sensors,
    25 Mbps for wearables, and 150 Mbps (DL and UL) for surveillance applications).
    Moreover, after Rel. 13, 3GPP added subsequent enhancements to the current releases.
    The subsequent sections discuss these CIoT technologies in detail, considering
    their focuses, features, and applications. Following is a detailed explanation
    of each CIoT technology, including their unique features, applications, focuses,
    and review state of the art. In this section, we will explore the different CIoT
    technologies available, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, and discuss
    how they are being used in various industries and sectors. Download : Download

    5.1. EC-GSM-IoT 3GPP standardized it to support IoT applications in Rel. 13 using
    the Technical Specifications Group GSM RAN using LTE-advanced pro [7], [75], [76].
    Its development can be considered a great success because it only requires design
    reuse and software upgrades to deploy EC-GSM-IoT in the existing 2G GSM or eGPRS
    network without needing new network infrastructure. It plays a pivotal service
    in M2M or IoT communications in the form of voice, data, and SMS. Moreover, most
    sub-Saharan African subscriptions are still GSM or EDGE, which is vital for MTC
    and global IoT deployment [77]. In particular, the EC-GSM-IoT technology is intended
    to facilitate the use of IoT devices in areas with difficult radio coverage and
    can operate in frequency deployments as narrow as 600 kHz. Operators and companies,
    such as Broadcom Corporation, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Gemalto NV, Intel Corporation,
    KDDI Corporation, LG Electronics, MediaTek, Nokia, Oberthur Technologies, Ooredoo,
    Orange, Samsung Electronics, Saudi Telecom Company, Sierra Wireless, Telit Communications,
    and VimpelCom, are also trying to use it with 3G and 4G mobile networks [78].
    As shown in Table 4, the maximum UL-DL instantaneous peak data rates from the
    Rel. 14 to Rel. 17, in the 8PSK modulation, is 489.6 kbps both in DL and UL, 153.6
    kbps in GMSK modulation in the UL [45], [72]. The channel bandwidth is 200 kHz,
    and the device capacity (i.e., devices/km ) is around 60,000. Additionally, the
    technology uses CE through message repetitions [31], [73]. Indeed, the GSM technology
    is well-established, and it still plays an important role in the deployment of
    IoT. With the upgrades implemented by 3GPP in Rel. 13, GSM offers advantages in
    terms of time, coverage footprint, and cost that are crucial for IoT development.
    In addition, spectrum availability is an essential controlling factor of the CIoT
    and its innovation capability, growth rate, and development paths. Backward compatibility
    has been applied to use the existing devices and network in the EC-GSM-IoT deployment.
    As illustrated in [79], only new synchronization, the broadcast control channel,
    and common control channels on time slot 1 of the broadcast control channel carrier
    are required for EC-GSM-IoT functioning. The extended Discontinuous Reception
    (eDRX) with radio control level enhancements provides several advantages, including
    extended battery life, lower device cost in comparison to GPRS or GSM devices,
    improved coverage, and variable rates. The technology can accommodate a large
    number of devices while offering improved security features. As shown in Fig.
    4, the 3GPP did efforts to enhance the EC-GSM-IoT service levels to cope with
    the requirements of IoT application requirements. Enhancements on EC-GSM-IoT have
    been done including achieving reduced complexity, low device power consumption,
    ensuring support of a massive number of CIoT devices and backward compatibility
    with GSM, securing low-device cost, improving end-user security, and so on. In
    the consequent release, Rel.14, fundamentally, they developed three enhancement
    requirement objectives including improving the positioning of devices, coverage
    for 23 dBm devices, and new time slots (TSs) mapping in extended coverage for
    improved resource handling [45]. In EC-GSM-IoT, there are four coverage classes,
    namely CC1, CC2, CC3, and CC4, that are assigned to different channels. Each coverage
    class determines the number of blind repetitions in the DL channel, which are
    1, 8, 16, and 32 respectively. Similarly, in the UL channel, the coverage classes
    determine the number of blind repetitions as 1, 4, 16, and 48 respectively that
    can help to attain the MCL [28]. In Rel.15, feature enhancements such as supporting
    multicast to operate in extended coverage in both UL and DL, incorporating coverage
    class CC5 and CC6 to attain 33 dBm, mobility support, and power consumption reduction
    techniques (e.g., eDRX, paging) were employed. In Rel.16, enhancements in localization,
    power consumption reduction (eDRX, WUS, paging, Preconfigured UL Resources (PUR)),
    and improved multicarrier operation. The PUR is employed to allocate radio resources
    to a UE in advance, enabling the transmission of UL data without requiring a connection
    setup process. In Rel.17, enhancements have been incorporated into EC-GSM-IoT
    to better meet the requirements of application scenarios. These enhancements focus
    on improving the battery lifecycle, device density, and link budget. Download

    countries, after Rel.15, since the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. They are shifting to
    5G and confirmed the LTE-M and NB-IoT are a candidate for CIoT technology in addition
    to RedCap. Instead of EC-GSM-IoT, they are focused on LTE improvements and 5G
    NR so that no further EC-GSM-IoT feature enhancement is applied. However, in the
    Middle East, South-East Asia, and Africa, 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile networks are still
    applicable, know that it can co-exist with 3G, and 4G mobile networks, EC-GSM-IoT
    is serving well even though demand for 5G is getting high. In spite of the relatively
    lesser attention the EC-GSM-IoT network receives than the LTE-M and NB-IoT networks,
    EC-GSM-IoT still offers some promising applications. In fact, it is a good solution
    for IoT deployment in developing countries, where cellular networks are primarily
    used for voice and other locations where GSM coverage exceeds LTE coverage. 5.2.
    LTE-M Under the 3GPP feasibility study titled “Study on Provision of Low-Cost
    MTC UEs Based on LTE”, LTE-M started in September 2011, earlier than the EC-GSM-IoT
    and NB-IoT [84]. The main objective was to enhance the LTE device capabilities
    in the low-end MTC domain, present an option for the GPRS and EGPRS devices, and
    roam GSM networks to LTE. At the time, eGPRS was incompatible with supporting
    more devices and was not cost-effective for MTC devices. They aimed to provide
    a solution with device complexity and cost to facilitate better requirement satisfaction
    regarding data rates, spectrum efficiency, and power consumption than the eGPRS.
    In 2012, in addition to the mentioned requirements, the group extended coverage
    improvement over the normal LTE coverage capacity by at least 20 dB to support
    deep indoor coverage, as summarized in as shown in Table 5. Furthermore, LTE devices
    were more expensive than GSM or eGPRS, so it was worth reducing the device cost
    to address the low-end mMTC use cases. The LTE-M release feature enhancements
    increased the number of supported devices per cell, from 361,000 to 1,000,000
    devices/km allowing for more IoT devices to connect to a single BS, enabling better
    use of the available spectrum and improved scalability. New CE techniques (i.e.,
    Mode A, a moderate number of retransmissions with 32 repetitions, and Mode B,
    a high number of repetitions with 2,048 repetitions, from Rel. 14 forward) are
    introduced to improve the QoS for IoT devices operating in remote or challenging
    environments [85]. Through shorter transmission time intervals, the latency is
    reduced from 50 to 100 ms in Rel. 12 to 10 to 15 ms in recent releases [82]. The
    LTE-M release enhancements increased the maximum number of HARQ processes from
    eight to 10 to improve the reliability of data transmissions, reducing the number
    of retransmissions needed to deliver data to IoT devices, improving overall system
    efficiency and reliability, and reducing latency. The HARQ allows for more flexibility
    in determining the type and amount of retransmitted data, as explained by [86].
    Compared with other CIoT components, LTE-M has important features (see Fig. 5).
    LTE-M is considered the most suitable LPWA technology for IoT applications that
    need high data rates, low latency, and full mobility, including voice, under standard
    coverage conditions. It is also an ideal choice for IoT applications that require
    deep coverage, where the demands for latency, mobility, and data speed are less
    rigorous. Indeed, LTE-M is a highly adaptable LPWA technology that can cater to
    both lower and higher data rates, with its system bandwidth being flexible and
    capable of accommodating 1.4 MHz or more. It can handle real-time traffic, full
    mobility, and voice features. In general, in the form of low-cost devices and
    coverage improvements, Rel. 14 and Rel. 15 further developed the standard, as
    shown in Table 5. In addition, MTC was further enhanced for LTE [82], commonly
    referred to as the “feMTC” work item in Rel. 14, which brought further enhanced
    improvements for supporting higher data speeds, improved voice over long-term
    evolution (VoLTE) support, improved positioning, multicast support, and the new
    LTE device, Cat-M2. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat-M2, unlike the normal LTE UE for
    IoT applications that require a higher data rate (e.g., wearables, such as smartwatches)
    but lower device cost. The UE Cat-M2 has a UE bandwidth of 5 MHz and can achieve
    peak rates of around 4 Mbps for the DL and 7 Mbps for the UL, assuming it supports
    FD-FDD operations [87]. For UE that supports HD-FDD, these peak rates are roughly
    half of the aforementioned figures, and for UE that supports time division duplex,
    the peak rates depend on the DL/UL subframe configuration, as stated in [82].
    The Cat-M2 UE supports larger maximum TBSs for unicast transmission than Cat-M1
    UE. Valuable enhancements have been provided in each release, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. Rel. 13 enhanced by employing coverage enhancement modes (CE mode A and
    B), improved device type having lower complexity and cost, enabled VoLTE in HD
    mode and introduced additional power saving features (eDRX) than Rel. 12 that
    was featured as lower complexity (a single receive antenna) and low-cost devices
    (Cat-0), HD operation, supports a lower data rate requirement (Max: 1 Mbps) and
    PSM enhancements for the UE. Rel. 14 further enhanced LTE-M, offering further
    developments than Rel. 13 regarding mobility, data rate, HARQ processing, new
    Cat-2 specifications, supporting positioning features, and additional power consumption
    management techniques [82]. The other power-saving mechanism developed in Rel.
    14, the Release Assistance Indication (RAI) feature is employed to conserve power
    by permitting the network to terminate a connection that is no longer required.
    By turning off the device radio and freeing network resources sooner, RAI can
    help to minimize battery consumption. A Rel. 15 work item that added use cases,
    increased spectrum efficiency, and additional benefits even further enhanced MTC
    (efeMTC) for LTE [88] while reducing latency and power consumption. Particularly,
    LTE-M is suited for industry operations with mobility features that must be tracked
    and monitored while moving. In Rel. 15, the central objective was to improve latency,
    spectral efficiency, and power consumption further. Potential enhancements to
    enhance latency include reducing the system acquisition time (e.g., improving
    the BS search or system information acquisition performance) and supporting EDT.
    To increase system capacity, spectral efficiency was improved in the DL by introducing
    higher-order modulation (64 QAM), and in the UL by enabling more precise resource
    allocation using sub-PRB granularity, as stated in [89]. To reduce power consumption,
    several possible enhancements could help including the implementation of EDT,
    sub-PRB resource allocation, WUSs, novel synchronization signals, improved HARQ
    feedback, and less stringent measurements for cell reselection [81], [88], [90].
    Rel. 15 offered even further enhancements of increased spectral efficiency, latency
    improvement, and lower power class. In Rel. 16, 5G integration has been realized
    to share 5G capabilities, CE for non-bandwidth reduced low complexity, standalone
    development, and mobility improvements. Rel. 17 [91], [92] introduced a maximum
    DL TBS of 1736 bits, 14 HARQ processes, and traffic management capabilities. In
    each release, enhancements in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient
    solutions have been integrated. Download : Download high-res image (465KB) Download

    [44] 5.3. NB-IoT The NB-IoT is a promising technology for the massive IoT specifically
    designed for low data-rate applications [14]. Improving the design of the UL/DL
    Rx to function effectively in situations where the signal-to-noise ratio is extremely
    low is pivotal [96]. The latency is enhanced between 1.6 and 10 s [97] with a
    maximum of one or two HARQ techniques. The maximum TBS in Rel. 14 was enhanced
    to 2536 b in the DL and UL by applying the HARQ process [65]. The NB-IoT has three
    deployment options and can be deployed inside an LTE carrier (in-band in 3, 5,
    10, 15, and 20 MHz LTE bandwidths), in its guard-band (in 10 MHz LTE carriers),
    or its own designated spectrum (standalone, 200 kHz in the GSM band) [65], [98],
    [99], [100]. When a guardband is applied, NB-IoT devices transmit data with great
    performance and efficiency while avoiding interfering with regular voice or data
    traffic on cellular networks. It can be considered a new radio access technology
    that is different from EC-GSM-IoT and LTE-M with no backward compatibility [101].
    In Rel. 14, it was intended to optimize the battery efficiency for up to 35 years
    with extended coverage of 164 dB [27] with transmission repetitions, power boosting,
    software modifications enhancing transport layer protocols [102], low complexity,
    support for a massive number of devices, improved power efficiency, and 10 s or
    less latency with positioning and multicast features [103]. The ITU and 3GPP’s
    mMTC performance criteria are further met by NB-IoT Rel. 15 (2018), which can
    fulfill 5G IoT requirements. It provides IoT connectivity with high data rates
    and reliable communication, boosting the 5G capacity while increasing IoT connectivity
    [104]. These requirements comprise high-performance and low-complexity features
    with an improved spectral efficiency and data rate [8]. Recently, 6G IoT has been
    studied extensively regarding the convergence of the 6G and IoT on five key domains:
    healthcare IoT, vehicular IoT and autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), satellite IoT, and IIoT [105] in which 3GPP must work on the CIoT to support
    these stringent requirements. CIoT is also envisioned to support monitoring real-time
    applications in UAVs under the circumstances of Age of Information (AoI) handling
    status. As shown in Table 6, the same way as LTE-M, in each release; enhancements
    in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient solutions are recorded.
    As shown in Fig. 6, enhancements made available in each release including low
    device power consumption, higher density, improved indoor coverage, reduced complexity,
    ultra-low device cost, optimized network architecture, cell reselection in the
    idle state, and Cat-NB1; power consumption and latency reduction (DL and UL for
    2 HARQ processes and larger maximum TBS), new power class of 14 dBm, Cat-NB2,
    multicast, higher data rate, location and positioning protocol OTDOA, non-anchor
    PRB enhancements, mobility, and service continuity enhancements; improved latency,
    improved power consumption(WUS, EDT), improved cell range, support TDD, higher
    spectral efficiency, improved load control, enhance cell acquisition, D2D communication;
    reduced control-signaling overhead, coexistence with NR, better UE energy efficiency,
    scheduling enhancement, better UL or DL transmission efficiency, improved multi-carrier
    operation, 2-step PRACH; enabling data transmission in RRC inactive mode, intra-UE
    multiplexing, positioning enhancement targeting factory automation, extend peak
    data rate, time synchronization enhancements, 2-HARQ process enhancement, CSI
    enhancements in the subsequent releases. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat. NB2 has developed
    with lower device cost and supports a massive number of IoT devices 8̃0,000 in
    an urban environment. In resolving energy-consumption problems, they employed
    solutions including PSM, I-eDRX, C-DRX, and cell reselection in addition to the
    eDRX. In Rel. 15 [95], 3GPP introduced the RRC-connected inactive state, which
    can benefit low data transmission optimization for devices operating for a short
    period. It is because of the substantial battery consumption, high demand for
    specialized resources, and high measurement reports and handovers, keeping the
    device in the RRC-connected state without active data transfer is not financially
    advantageous. The NB-IoT shortens the network monitoring duration for UE in idle
    mode, reduces the unnecessary startup of receiving cells, and reduces power consumption.
    Furthermore, Rel. 15 introduced the following energy efficiency solutions, as
    illustrated in Table 6. Wake-up signaling for IDLE mode (FDD) is served in an
    energy efficiency solution, reducing energy consumption. In communications, UE
    must frequently determine whether a paging message is from the core network when
    in DRX or eDRX. When paging is available, the UE mostly does not receive a message,
    and power is saved. With this capability, the BS can advise the UE to watch the
    narrowband physical DL control channel for paging by sending it an NB-IoT WUS
    (NWUS) introduced in Rel. 15 [106] to enhance the device energy efficiency, but
    otherwise, the UE is free to ignore the paging operations. NWUS enables the UE
    to potentially keep some of its hardware off for longer periods while saving the
    energy required to decode the narrowband physical DL control channel and shared
    channel for paging. The time the network allows the UE to “wake up” after receiving
    an NWUS determines whether the UE can maintain only one Rx switched on for WUS
    detection, leaving most of the UE conventional hardware in a very low-power state.
    The other viable solution is scheduling requests, included in the Rel. 13 and
    Rel. 14 NB-IoT as a higher-layer procedure that causes a random-access process
    to request enough UL resources to send a buffer status report. In addition, Rel.
    15 has provided new, more resource and power-effective methods to accomplish this
    goal that the BS can configure, the EDT. The EDT is an idle mode with a bitrate
    of 328 to 1000 bits. For example, UE can send data in msg 3 of the random-access
    procedure [107]. The random-access operation ends if a BS successfully receives
    a signal and the UE does not switch to connected mode. If the UE waiting data
    are less than the maximum permissible size established by the BS, the UE requests
    a grant for EDT by transmitting its preamble using a preconfigured set of narrowband
    physical random-access channel resources. To save energy on transmitting padding
    bits, the BS can authorize the UE to transmit fewer data than the maximum allowed
    size [106]. Due to minimizing the signaling overhead and message latency, the
    battery life is prolonged [19]. 5.4. RedCap The RedCap approach was created to
    address use cases (IIoT, video surveillance, and wearables) in IoT requirements
    that cannot be met using the EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, or LTE-M [44], [108] operating
    at a higher data rate and reliability with lower latency than LTE-M and the NB-IoT.
    It offers a lower cost, lower complexity, and longer battery life than NR eMBB
    and wider coverage than URLLC. Some requirements often necessitate higher reliability
    and quicker response time than those offered by LTE-M and the NB-IoT, while still
    maintaining lower complexity and expenses, as well as longer battery life compared
    to eMBB and URLLC services. The RedCap interface is designed to bridge the gap
    between the intricate and expensive 5G-NR interface that caters to eMBB and URLLC
    services and the lower data rates and increased latency of NB-IoT and LTE-M interfaces
    that support mMTC services. Under the study item “Low complexity NR devices” [67],
    in June 2019, 3GPP introduced RedCap NR devices in Rel. 17 with lower cost, lower
    complexity, and longer battery life compared to regular NR devices. In addition,
    RedCap was introduced to meet the low-cost, large-bandwidth, medium data rate,
    and no latency no delay tolerance IoT service requirements [31]. Hence, RedCap
    inherits the majority of the key advantages of NR. These include the ability to
    connect to the 5G core network, which is a cloud-based platform with a service-based
    architecture, support for a very broad range of frequency bands (FR1 and FR2 and
    millimeter-wave bands), network energy efficiency due to the ultra-flexible design,
    forward-compatible and beam-based air interfaces, and support for millimeter-wave
    bands [30]. As depicted in Fig. 7, enhancements have been incorporated in each
    release of RedCap. The applications use cases that are targeted include wearables,
    medical sensors, remote surgery, industrial sensors, surveillance cameras, and
    others. Rel. 17 of RedCap offers a multitude of enhancements that make it a cutting-edge
    solution for IoT applications. One of the most notable features is its ability
    to provide slicing capabilities, creating virtual networks within a single physical
    network, increasing network efficiency, and ensuring optimal resource utilization
    [67]. The positioning component of Rel. 17 has also been improved, providing more
    accurate location-based services and enabling new location-based applications.
    Furthermore, this release boasts a large capacity for storing and processing data,
    making it ideal for handling large volumes of IoT data. The UE energy-efficient
    operation component ensures that the end-user experience is optimized for energy
    efficiency, reducing the overall carbon footprint of IoT devices [30]. In addition,
    Rel. 17 is highly cost-effective and offers low latency, making it an attractive
    solution for a wide range of IoT applications and budgets [109]. In Fig. 7, one
    of the key advancements in Rel. 18 is supporting higher transmission rates, providing
    faster data transfer, and enabling new applications that require higher bandwidth.
    Another major improvement is the support for the unlicensed spectrum, which expands
    the available spectrum for IoT devices and enables new use cases. Advanced positioning
    technology has also been incorporated, further improving location-based services
    and enabling new location-based applications [29]. Integrating side-link near-field
    communications allows for direct communication between devices, providing a new
    level of convenience and enabling new use cases. In addition, it takes steps to
    reduce the complexity of RedCap UE further, making it even more user-friendly
    and accessible. Finally, the addition of device-to-device (D2D) communication
    expands the communication options for IoT devices, making it easier to connect
    and communicate with other devices in a local network. These enhancements and
    new features make Rel. 18 of RedCap CIoT necessary for anyone aiming to remain
    at the forefront of IoT technology. RedCap has unique features incorporated with
    5G NR services and was objectively designed to maintain lower complexity devices
    with 20 or 100 MHz maximum bandwidth in sub-7 or millimeter-wave with one or two
    Rx antennae. Additionally, 3GPP introduced this standard [61] due to RedCap’s
    ability to coexist with URLLC features, use higher frequency bands, and apply
    other 5G features, such as network slicing. For instance, RedCap is designed to
    provide significantly faster data rates than previous CIoT technology compared
    to the data rate specified in Rel. 17 using a higher frequency band, multiple-input
    multiple-output technology, advanced modulation techniques, advanced beamforming
    features, and network slicing. Use cases for RedCap are less battery-life-intensive
    than mMTC use cases, but they are more demanding for throughput and latency. However,
    a higher data rate of up to 100 Mbps is required to accommodate live video feed,
    visual production, and process automation [30]. This approach enables new use
    cases and applications that were previously impossible [9]. In addition to the
    transmission rate, in machine-to-machine collaboration and real-time remote control,
    ultra-low communication latency is expected at around 1 ms. Communication latency
    can be raised from the physical layer latency and scheduling latency problems
    [112]. However, for the time being, in the higher requirement scenario, it is
    possible to achieve a latency of 10 to 30 ms to support applications like remote
    drone operation, cooperative farm machinery, time-critical sensing and feedback,
    and remote vehicle operations. Higher communication reliability in mission and
    time-critical applications, for example, autonomous vehicles, remote surgery,
    and smart factories, is not an option to compromise but should be kept stable
    [9]. In IIoT, data transmission security is the top demand to make sensitive information
    extremely secure and highly available on demand. For Rel. 17 RedCap features [111],
    3GPP also added extra features in future Rel. 18 work, depicted in Fig. 7. Download

    [31], [109], [110], [111] Furthermore, localization or positioning increases network
    complexity, potential overhead, and accuracy degradation and can include power,
    time, and space domain localization [66]. Positioning or localization in the MTC
    has become difficult due to the complication of environments, sensor errors, and
    device motions, as Le et al. [24] investigated. Supporting location-based service
    applications is crucial for some IoT applications, such as tracking items. Although
    a smaller BS density has an advantage in the IoT scenario, a higher BS density
    is an important factor in localization with small BSs. In addition to environment
    complexity, other problems in positioning are end device-related errors, environment-related
    errors, BS-related errors, and data-related errors [24]. Hence, positioning accuracy
    can be supported by different mechanisms, including received signal strength (RSS),
    time difference of arrival [24], and channel-state information [113]. Regarding
    the D2D Protocol, communication between devices, such as wearables, that can directly
    communicate with nearby smartphones or connected vehicles is supported by RedCap
    [114]. It is enabled via sideline communication over a shared RF channel in which
    the cellular BS provides a synchronization signal that enables direct D2D communication,
    which can also improve communication efficiency, reduce latency, and extend network
    coverage and capacity. Most importantly, RedCap supports the Unlicensed Spectrum.
    In 3GPP’s EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, there is no support for sub-GHz license-free
    frequency bands (unlicensed spectrum). There have been efforts, such as MulteFire
    Alliance [115] that have been working on expanding IoT services with LPWAN support
    in the 800/900 MHz band (902 to 928 MHz band in the United States and 863 to 870
    MHz band in the European Union) with NB-IoT unlicensed and 2.4 GHz with extended
    MTC unlicensed. RedCap uses unlicensed spectrum bands under both licensed and
    unlicensed standards and regulatory requirements to address spectrum scarcity
    issues. Due to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming
    manifested in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require
    low latency, ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. RedCap
    contributes to services that require more capabilities than the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    and NB-IoT but are lower than URLLC and eMBB machines including process monitoring
    (pressure sensors, humidity sensors, and thermometers), self-diagnosis and maintenance
    (motion sensors, accelerometers, and actuators), and video-assisted applications
    (asset monitoring and augmented reality) [108]. According to TR 22.832, TS 22.104,
    and TR 22.804, [110] as summarized in Table 7, reference use cases and requirements
    are as follows. End-to-end latency is less than 100 ms, and communication services
    are 99.99% available. For all usage situations, the reference bit rate is less
    than 2 Mbps, and the device is immobile. This reference bit rate may be asymmetric,
    such as in high UL traffic [111]. At least a couple of years should pass between
    charges. Safety-related sensors, such as smart factories, require less delay (5
    to 10 ms). Generally, time-critical sensing and feedback, augmented reality, safety-related
    sensors, and remote drone operations are applications in industrial sensors. For
    instance, the goal of the smart grid is to create a more sustainable and efficient-energy
    infrastructure that can meet the needs of an increasingly connected and energy-intensive
    world. In IIoT, a specific application known as the power IoT focuses on smart
    grids to attain automatic optimized data collection and exchange of information,
    as well as smart energy management [116]. 6. Focuses of CIoT technologies One
    of the focuses of the CIoT is to provide extended coverage in areas where traditional
    cellular networks may not reach, including indoor and underground locations and
    remote or rural areas. This reach is achieved using a narrowband frequency for
    better signal penetration and greater range. Another key role of the CIoT is to
    offer efficient and cost-effective connectivity for a broad scope of IoT applications,
    from smart cities and homes to agriculture, transportation, and healthcare. With
    its low-power consumption and ability to facilitate numerous connected devices,
    the CIoT enables a broad range of use cases, including asset tracking, remote
    monitoring, and sensor networks [38]. For instance, international roaming can
    be considered one important focus of the EC-GSM-IoT, minimizing device complexity
    and cost. Because the EC-GSM-IoT has coexisted with 2G mobile networks, it has
    benefited significantly from all the security and privacy features provided by
    mobile networks including various measures to ensure user confidentiality and
    privacy, such as the protection of user identity, authentication protocols, data
    encryption to ensure confidentiality, measures to maintain data integrity, and
    identification of mobile equipment [73]. LTE-M, on the other hand, targets medium-sized
    IoT applications supporting voice and video services. Therefore, it is a better
    candidate technology for over-the-air firmware updates during the life span of
    IoT devices [26]. Unlike the NB-IoT, LTE-M is better suited for mobile devices
    to avoid connection and data loss and provides higher data rates that would enable
    more use cases, such as VoLTE vehicles, fleet management, tracking devices, and
    related use cases [117]. Moreover, LTE-M can be used in video surveillance systems
    because it supports higher data rates and can transmit real-time video data. In
    addition, the NB-IoT is primarily designed for ultralow-end and latency insensitive
    or delay tolerant IoT applications [68]. It focuses on fixed indoor coverage in
    areas where signal loss and multitiered layers have posed problems. NB1 UE, for
    example, operates only in the 200 kHz bandwidth with IoT devices imposing ultralow
    complexity for services without strict data rate, latency, or mobility requirements
    but that requires a massive deployment of low-cost devices [65]. Lastly, according
    to 3GPP and Ericsson [44], [51], RedCap has many use cases and is highly necessary
    to work in extremely harsh environments. RedCap was introduced with lower hardware
    complexity at more affordable prices. It aims for terrestrial coverage and targets
    exchanging data over the satellite with the aim of ubiquitous coverage area (referred
    to as NTN communication) [109]. It is possible to run a RedCap device on an NR
    carrier optimized for eMBB or time-critical communications. The objective of the
    study group on the NR-RedCap has been emphasizing reduced UE complexity, such
    as a reduced number of antennae, reduced UE bandwidth, HD-FDD, and other aspects.
    Compared to high-end eMBB and URLLC devices of Rel. 15/16, the primary driving
    force of the new device type is to reduce device cost and complexity, which is
    true for industrial sensors [109]. The standard must allow for a device design
    with a compact form factor to support most use cases, and all FR1/FR2 bands for
    FDD and time division duplex should be supported by the system [110]. As shown
    in Table 7, video cameras, for instance, lead to higher data-rate requirements
    than can be satisfied by the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT. Smart cities, smart
    farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly installed
    surveillance cameras. According to TR 22.804, a reference economic video bitrate
    would be 2 to 4 Mbps with a latency of 500 ms or less and a reliability of 99%
    to 99.9% [110]. High-quality video, for example, for farming, would require 7.5
    to 25 Mbps [30]. As explained in [3], reference bitrates for smart wearable applications
    can range from 5 to 50 Mbps in the DL and 2 to 5 Mbps in the UL. The device’s
    peak bit rates can reach 150 Mbps in the DL and 50 Mbps in the UL [30]. The battery
    should last one to two weeks for wearables, as reviewed in Fig. 7. Rel. 17 for
    RedCap devices introduced power-saving techniques to extend battery life and enable
    longer usage times. These are; eDRX for RRC idle and inactive states and RRM relaxation
    for stationary devices. In eDRX, when DRX cycles are utilized, it can achieve
    up to 10 485.76 s, almost 3 h when the RRC is idle, and up to 10.24 s when the
    RRC is inactive. In demanding RedCap use cases, such as industrial wireless sensors,
    eDRX proves to be a valuable solution in meeting the battery lifetime requirements.
    Regarding the RRM relaxation, in RRC idle and inactive states, the device is required
    to regularly conduct RRM measurements. These measurements are necessary to determine
    and select the best available cell for the device to establish a connection. In
    spite of this, the battery will be depleted even if there is no active data transmission.
    Thus, skip performing RRM measurements under certain thresholds of reference signal
    received power (RSRP) and reference signal received quality (RSRQ) values are
    employed [30]. In addition, the other optional power-saving features, standardized
    in Rel 15 and Rel. 16, are also made available for RedCap devices which offer
    power-saving capabilities to enhance the battery performance. Because of the fast-growing
    need for personal care devices and diagnostics, such as sports, healthcare, and
    fitness devices, wearables have garnered more attention. Devices that are too
    small in size, such as smartwatches, rings, e-health-related devices, and medical
    monitoring devices, are supported by RedCap, which can collect and relay health
    information. The CIoT plays an immense role in healthcare, and healthcare IoT
    (HIoT) is developed and supported by AI, big data, software-defined networks,
    and blockchains [118] with the driving technology; the Internet of Nano Things
    and tactile Internet. The HIoT is implemented in the form of wrist-worn smart
    wearables [119]. As with other IoT application requirements, HIoT prompts low
    latency that can be obtained through edge computing implementation using a large
    volume of data through cloud and edge computing. As most medical applications
    are private, the blockchain has been a solution to secure patient data from third-party
    access risks [120]. In healthcare-based medical operations, it is highly recommended
    to securely transmit sensitive healthcare data to the fog and cloud for processing.
    Ullah et al. [121] recommended fog and cloud-assisted computing as the appropriate
    candidate solutions for these issues. RedCap has an immense role in remote surgery
    applications by integrating wearables, medical sensors, industrial sensors incorporating
    surveillance cameras, and more. For more, we briefly present their detailed features
    in the following sections. 7. Features of CIoT technologies To guarantee that
    CIoT technologies can efficiently provide connectivity solutions for various use
    cases ranging from Massive IoT to Critical IoT, this section outlines essential
    requirements that must be met for the large-scale deployment of these services.
    These include extended coverage areas, low deployment costs, extended battery
    life, affordable device costs, support for a vast number of connected devices
    (scalability), and robust security and privacy measures, we discuss in detail
    as follows. Wide Coverage: Delivering a wider and more extended coverage area
    is one of the main aims of the CIoT. In a wide coverage area, the path range is
    an important parameter that varies inversely with frequency, offering tens of
    kilometers of coverage. Carrier frequency has a significant effect on CE. Although
    the path loss is directly dependent on the size of the carrier frequency, if the
    carrier frequency is high, the propagation loss becomes high. Maintaining a lower
    carrier frequency is important to maximize the coverage in the CIoT to lessen
    propagation loss. For instance, the EC-GSM-IoT is based on the GSM; thus, the
    frequency band of the GSM is highly globally deployed with the four known global
    frequency bands 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz, where coverage is ultimately enhanced
    [73]. Ericsson, Orange, and Intel have tried extending coverage on smart agriculture
    use cases using the EC-GSM-IoT, confirming that it is possible to enhance indoor
    coverage by deploying new software on the existing cellular networks [122]. Moreover,
    CE techniques should be implemented to achieve a wide or deep coverage area (it
    is primarily accomplished by sacrificing the data rate for coverage), which is
    required for two reasons. Implementing reduction techniques in device complexity
    (e.g., minimizing to a single-antenna Rx and lower maximum transmission power)
    may result in performance degradation that directly produces coverage loss. The
    loss of coverage can be maintained by scaling transport block size (TBS), HARQ
    re-transmissions for the physical DL shared channel (PDSCH), PUSCH, physical UL
    control channel (PUCCH), and PDCCH [9], [67]. Second, some CIoT devices could
    encounter extremely difficult coverage circumstances. Hence, transmission time
    interval bundling, sending a limited, predefined number of transmissions without
    feedback instead of sending a block of transmissions once, and narrowband retuning
    are key feature techniques to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. In widening
    the coverage, the objective is to attain a CE of 15 dB compared to GSM and LTE
    [123]. The 3GPP measures CE using the MCL standard, which is the discrepancy between
    the power levels transmitted and received before the signal is lost. Coverage
    can be measured as “kilometers of coverage” but according to the analysis presented
    in [124], it is not adequate since it heavily relies on the carrier frequency
    and environmental factors such as the type of location, whether it is indoors,
    outdoors, urban, suburban, or rural. In contrast, MCL is an appropriate measure
    because it is not influenced by the frequency and environmental aspects. At extreme
    coverage, it is expected to attain 20 dB from the normal LTE or GSM coverage,
    and it is very important to determine exactly how much coverage the CIoTs can
    provide. Apparently, for evaluation, Ericsson, AT and T, KT, SK Telecom by Korea,
    Nokia, Verizon, Altair, Docomo, Sony, SoftBank, TELKOMSEL by Telecom Indonesia,
    Virtuosys, Sequans Communications, KDDI, and Orange conducted a thorough link-level
    simulation inspection to assess the actual coverage performance of 3GPP’s LTE-M
    technology. Their findings discovered that LTE-M is capable of achieving a coverage
    gain of 21 dB compared to older LTE devices, which is higher than the 3GPP target
    of 18 dB. This increase of 21 dB corresponds to a data rate of 1400 bps in the
    DL and 250 bps in the UL. If IoT applications can tolerate slower data rates and
    longer acquisition times, it is possible to achieve a coverage gain beyond 21
    dB without using the BS power spectral density (PSD) boosting [124]. With a 21-dB
    gain with 23 dBm UE (the maximum coverage) and less conservative noise figures,
    LTE-M is a strong competitor for IoT applications that require extensive coverage,
    with a maximum MCL of 164 dB, and where the demands for low latency, high mobility,
    and fast data transfer are less stringent. Moreover, LTE-M has two specifications
    in its CE strategy: Modes A and B. The former mode is mandatory and supports only
    moderate CE, whereas the latter mode, B, supports deep and extended coverage that
    can be considered optional. Common coverage techniques are employed to provide
    CE for the LTE-M specification. The Tx power (e.g., Class 3 power amplifier 23
    dBm and Class 5 power amplifier 20 dBm) is increased by considering the increasing
    cost management, repetition by optimizing accurate channel estimations, and frequency
    tracking to manage the downside of repetition in linearly increasing the latency.
    In addition, PSD boosting improves the DL coverage and reduces the power by employing
    a maximum amount of PSD boosting to 4 dB. These methods are the most feasible
    in CE, as illustrated in [124]. In B5G CIoT [125], a programmable metasurface
    can significantly improve coverage with an intelligent reflecting surface. Through
    the IoT non terrestrial network (NTN) work item in Rel. 17 [91], 3GPP has already
    addressed NTN support for LTE-M and the NB-IoT [114]. Overall, LTE-M can support
    extensive IoT deployments, covering the maximum distance and beyond with the approved
    QoS and minimum maintenance provisions. From the 3GPP standard specification,
    the range of the NB-IoT covers urban and rural areas, outlined as 1 to 2 and 10
    to 15 km, respectively [126], enabling better signal propagation in basements
    (aiming for 20 dB improvement over legacy cellular systems) [127]. A transmission
    time interval bundling, repetition (retransmission, such as 128 and 2,048 times
    in the UL and DL, respectively [89]), and narrowband retuning are employed as
    key features to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. The number of repetitions
    of a transmission is determined by the desired CE level (CEL) for a given set
    of devices. The CEL is the signal strength at a particular location and can be
    influenced by the distance between the Tx and Rx, the transmit power, the Rx sensitivity,
    and interference. The number of tones and sub-carrier spacing, which are the number
    of different frequency components used to transmit data and the distance in frequency
    between adjacent sub-carriers, respectively, also affect the CEL and spectral
    efficiency of a wireless communication system [22]. The increased number of retransmissions
    lowers the spectral efficiency [128], which requires reducing the number of retransmissions.
    However, three CELs are supported by NB-IoT devices: CEL-0 for 0 dB with an MCL
    of 144 dB with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, CEL-1 for 10 dB with an MCL of
    154 dB with 15 kHz spacing, and CEL-2 for 20 dB with an MCL of 164 dB with 3.75
    kHz carrier spacing [79]. In the CE of the NB-IoT, the objective is to attain
    a coverage capacity of 164 dB [123], [129] and guarantee that it can enhance the
    164-dB coverage achieved through repetitions in time, with power amplification
    in in-band and guard-band operation modes [65]. In general, this is preserved
    by implementing repetition, boosting the PSD, reducing the system acquisition
    time, and random-access range enhancement. Based on the findings in [21], the
    coverage of NB-IoT [882 MHz] can be boosted by up to 398% with a mere 10% enhancement
    in Rx sensitivity. Enhancing the coverage by implementing machine learning methods
    using reinforcement learning-based dynamic spectrum access [130] is also feasible.
    The NB-IoT increases the link budget by over 20 dB, significantly enhancing penetration.
    Although reducing the device capabilities can lower the device cost and reduce
    the device size, it has an adverse influence on coverage. For instance, in RedCap,
    reducing the number of antennae and limiting the number of spectrum bands can
    affect device coverage. It is vital to secure the device cost and lower complexity
    simultaneously to enhance the coverage. In RedCap, it is expected to extend 10
    to 15 dB compared to URLLC. Low Power Consumption: Most IoT devices are powered
    by batteries. Therefore, conserving energy to extend their lifespan is vital.
    It is exceptionally demanding to reserve the main power supply by implementing
    longevity in the battery life of the device before recharging is mandated. Devices
    that support lower power consumption have a longer device battery life. In many
    use cases, the CIoTs are supposed to achieve a battery life of up to 10 years.
    The battery usage directly relates to how long the device spends sending and receiving
    data. As research [58] has noted, to maintain a battery life of 5 years, for example,
    a device with a 5000 mAh battery capacity should use no more than 2.74 mAh per
    day. This limit can be achieved by restricting daily battery consumption to below
    5000 mAh/5/365 [58]. Achieving long battery life and reducing maintenance costs
    are critical in applications and equipment with limited battery capacity, which
    makes low energy consumption essential. However, the battery life depends on coverage
    [131]. The objective of 3GPP standards for battery life in the CIoT is to achieve
    10 years of service life in most extreme coverage situations at 164 dB MCL [47]
    (11.9 years is achievable) and 35.7 years at normal coverage (144 dB MCL) [84].
    This feature can also save costs in areas where replacing batteries can be a challenging
    task, such as basements or subterranean tunnels. In minimizing power consumption,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT utilize techniques including the power-saving mode
    (PSM) [132], [133], [134], long periodic tracking area updates (TAU), and eDRX
    which are developed by the 3GPP standards to reduce energy consumption and enable
    an extended life for these devices [80]. The PSM allows modules to enter a sleep
    mode that consumes very little energy (only a few microamps) while sending TAU
    messages at long intervals to remain registered on the network. This approach
    eliminates the need for reregistration when the module wakes. The eDRX feature
    allows devices to enter a low-power paging mode for an extended period of time,
    during which they can receive data from the server but do not need to send data,
    saving power when the device does not need to transmit. In eDRX, an extension
    of 52 min is possible. The PSM can use paging in the DRX or jointly use paging
    and routing area updates (via incoming SMS, voice call, or data) to reach the
    CIoT devices on the network. For devices that prefer a lower periodicity of reachability,
    using eDRX is more advantageous; however, for devices that can tolerate longer
    intervals of inaccessibility, the PSM emerges as an appealing alternative. Furthermore,
    implementing GMSK modulation in the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, influences power
    and energy efficiency. The enhanced coverage common control channel (eCCCH)can
    also contribute to energy efficiency, providing long battery life. Other energy-saving
    techniques besides PSM and eDRX have been developed and employed, such as energy-efficient
    TAU, user and control plane optimizations, energy-efficient paging reception,
    wake-up signal (WUS) calls, and techniques for monitoring cells less frequently.
    Furthermore, RedCap power consumption is anticipated to be significantly (2 to
    4 times) lower than that of Rel. 16 eMBB, resulting in minimized power usage.
    The battery life is expected to span 1 to 3 years. In Rel. 17, 3GPP suggested
    improvements for UE power conservation in the idle or inactive mode while considering
    system performance factors to address the power consumption problem. They studied
    and specified improvements to power-saving methods for connected UE, with the
    least possible influence on system performance [3]. Based on power-saving techniques
    proposed in Rel. 17 for RedCap devices, in the idle and inactive state, eDRX cycles
    are almost 3 h and 10.24 s, respectively. This approach better extends the battery
    life [67] in the stringent use case of industrial wireless sensors, for example.
    In addition to eDRX, the relaxation of frequent radio resource management (RRM)
    to secure the exact camping in its idle and inactive state can avoid the drainage
    of batteries, primarily in stationary devices. In general, potential power consumption-saving
    techniques include reducing the duration the device spends checking the control
    channel for scheduling, lengthening the device sleep time by extending the DRX
    period, and allowing for less frequent measurements for stationary devices. In
    the long run, a very high energy-efficiency technology is expected, supporting
    battery-free IoT devices, such as self-driving cars, drones, and auto-robots [135].
    The most important area of research in the IoT is energy efficiency, especially
    in IIoT, to preserve moderate power consumption [136]. According to [28], energy-saving
    methods can be maintained in three ways: configurations (including traffic models,
    connectivity periods, and DRX cycles), software modification (comprising improved
    radio layer protocols, changes have been made to the scheduling request procedures
    for accessing radio channel resources, as well as the introduction of new software
    entities in the core network to improve communication in both the UL and DL directions),
    and hardware integration (embedding a low-power Rx by deactivating the main Rx).
    In [137], energy efficiency or low power consumption can be achieved by eliminating
    transmission between nodes using the star topology, maintaining a straightforward
    node design, and using narrowband channels for reduced noise and an extended transmission
    range. Based on [138], the joint optimization of user selection, power allocation,
    and antenna selection while fulfilling the QoS requirements has a prior role in
    maximizing energy efficiency under imperfect channel state information. In most
    IoT devices, the channel state information is imperfect due to the functional
    limitations and mobility, as stated in [139]. In addition, an advanced energy-harvesting
    technique called simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is another
    promising solution to achieve energy-efficient green communication. Chen et al.
    developed a two-layer iterative algorithm to manage inter- and intra-beam interferences
    by leveraging the Dinkelbach method [140] for energy maximizing by allocating
    power at the base station and splitting power at each IoT node. The other promising
    solution is HARQ feedback. Transmitting a positive HARQ-ACK over MPDCCH in a UL
    data center interconnect is now possible [141]. This approach enables early termination
    of the UL (PUSCH) transmission or early termination of the DL (MPDCCH) monitoring
    (for FD-FDD or time division duplex but not HD-FDD). It allows the BS to notify
    the UE that UL data have been successfully received using two HARQ processes and
    10 HARQ processes with a beneficial effect. In addition, cell reselection with
    relaxed monitoring is a good option. When enabled, the UE can reduce neighbor
    cell measurements to once every 24 h [25]. This approach can significantly lower
    power usage, especially for fixed UE in difficult coverage situations. Moreover,
    resynchronization signal (RSS) better improves energy economy when a device needs
    to regain synchronization with a cell’s time and frequency [5]. Researchers from
    academics and industry have been studying solutions and techniques to address
    power consumption issues, including energy harvesting [142], [143], [144], sporadic
    transmission, resource allocation, clustering, zonal thermal pattern analysis
    for smart agriculture, and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring system
    for smart health applications [14]. In [145], RF energy harvesting on the strength
    of RF signals was cheaper to implement and available in difficult-to-reach places
    where other popular sources, such as solar or wind, may not be accessible. Moreover,
    accurate computation and efficient communication are critical for numerous devices
    to reduce power usage. Developing communication systems that are energy-efficient,
    both in terms of system design and hardware is vital to mitigate power problems
    [146]. Over-the-air computation was proposed as a promising solution [147]. In
    [148], energy-harvesting strategies for operating low-power network devices using
    long-lasting IoT devices and sensors were studied, enabling them to be self-powered
    and providing devices with long standby intervals. Network parameter settings
    affect energy consumption and network performance, and [149] found that the paging
    interval set by the BS has the greatest effect on energy consumption when the
    device is connected. Low Cost: In the CIoT, installing or maintaining local networks
    or gateways is unnecessary. The sensor can connect directly to the desired system
    or network, which maintains the cost [27]. Maintaining low power consumption facilitates
    low device costs, which can be achieved by reducing Tx and Rx bandwidths. Current
    costs run between $10 and $15 per module, with a long-term goal of reaching $5.
    The GSM, for instance, is the main player in machine-to-machine communications
    because of its reduced cost compared to other technology. As a result of the expiration
    of the device module patents in GSM networks, compared to other 3GPP-defined technology,
    the cost of the EC-GSM-IoT module is the most economical in developing countries
    [27], [52], less than $10, where 2G, 3G are deployed. The EC-GSM-IoT module cost
    is $5.5 and $2.9 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151], respectively. It is because of
    the overall cost of deployment, network coverage (which can balance the economy
    of vendors, particularly in the Asian and African continents), maturity (the presence
    of a more mature ecosystem comprising a wide range of compatible devices, and
    applications), lower complexity, and lower frequency band specificity. The other
    player in achieving ultralow-cost devices is the implementation of a GMSK-only
    modulation. Moreover, for cost reduction, according to the analysis of [152],
    the trend reveals a 10-times reduction in 1G and 2G, respectively, and a 1000-times
    reduction from 3G to 6G. In contrast, the NB-IoT has many design trade-offs to
    achieve low-cost goals, resulting in a simplified, low-complexity system with
    a lower data rate. One of these trade-offs is the lack of carrier aggregation,
    a technique that combines multiple carriers (or frequency bands) to increase the
    available data rate. Carrier aggregation requires additional hardware and processing
    resources, increasing the cost and complexity of NB-IoT devices. Similarly, NB-IoT
    does not support voice services or multi-stream transmissions in the DL/UL direction.
    These features would also require additional hardware and processing resources,
    which would be incompatible with the low-power and low-cost requirements of the
    NB-IoT. Instead, the NB-IoT provides simple, low-data-rate communication for IoT
    applications that do not require high-bandwidth or real-time services [80]. However,
    the NB-IoT can operate alongside the existing GSM and LTE networks, which can
    help lower deployment costs. The device cost is related to the complexity of baseband
    processing, memory consumption, and RF requirements. Valuable cost reductions
    can be achieved from various modifications associated with narrowband operations,
    power reduction mechanisms, and the simplification of a physical layer [14]. The
    NB-IoT module cost is achieved $4 and $2-3 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151] per module,
    respectively which is more effective in urban environments where 5G requirements
    are in hand. Regarding LTE-M devices, they could achieve a similar cost to GSM
    devices by simplifying the design of the end devices. Due to its compatibility
    with existing LTE radio systems, LTE-M can be easily deployed through a simple
    software upgrade to meet the cost optimization needs of IoT applications, building
    upon the foundation of LTE technology. Taking into consideration the market scale,
    the module cost for LTE-M is less than $10, making it an affordable option [153]
    by incorporating various optimizations to enhance efficiency and reduce complexity.
    These optimizations include incorporating half-duplex operations (i.e., less complex
    and less costly), reduced transmission mode (TM) support, minimizing the number
    of blind decodings required for control channel reception, and eliminating simultaneous
    reception. As elaborated in [150], [151], the LTE-M module cost achieved $5 in
    2016 and $3.3 in 2020. On the other hand, compared to standard NR UE, RedCap UE
    is substantially simpler due to the half-duplex operation, which means that the
    UE is not required to transmit and receive simultaneously, a smaller number of
    radio RX antenna branches (reducing the antenna configuration, can reduce the
    device size), and a smaller radio Tx bandwidth. As a result of the projected decreased
    complexity, devices are expected to be more affordable, enabling the use of NR
    in novel applications, such as industrial sensor networks [44]. In conclusion,
    these requirements are achieved through careful configurations, properly adjusting
    the traffic profile (the frequency and number of data transmitted and received
    by the UE), coverage situation (under normal, robust, and extreme coverage scenarios),
    and network settings [154]. Low Complexity: Simplified network topology and deployment
    is one component of the CIoT that the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, highly fulfills.
    It only requires software upgrades in the existing GSM networks [122]. In addition,
    by simplifying the modulation scheme used for transmitting data over the air instead
    of using more complex modulation schemes, such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation
    (QAM) or 64 QAM used in traditional GSM networks, the low-complexity mode of EC-GSM-IoT
    employs a simpler modulation scheme called GMSK. This approach reduces the complexity
    of the transceiver hardware required to implement the technology. Keeping the
    device complexity ultralow to secure a low-cost device is expected to support
    the large-scale deployment of millions of devices. Indeed, the EC-GSM-IoT technology,
    for example, is an advanced version of the EGPRS technology, which already satisfies
    the necessary requirements without any need for further complexity reduction [73].
    The goal of LTE-M, for example, was to drastically reduce the complexity and cost
    compared to the preceding LTE device categories. In addition to reducing complexity,
    LTE-M aims to handle a broad range of mMTC use cases, including demanding high-throughput
    and low-latency applications. Under the 3GPP cost reduction analysis and techniques
    [155], employing the following methods can provide remarkable complexity reductions
    in LTE-M: reduction of the maximum bandwidth (from 20 to 1.4 MHz), a single-receive
    radio frequency (RF) chain (from 2 to 1), a reduction of the peak rate (from 10
    to 1 Mbps), a reduction of transmit power (from 23 to 20, or 14 dBm), half-duplex
    instead of a full-duplex operation, and a reduction of supported DL transmission
    modes. Furthermore, securing low device complexity is required to boost the QoE
    and QoS in IoT applications. The device complexity is related to the complexity
    of baseband processing, memory consumption, and transmit-and-receive antenna (RF
    requirements). In NB-IoT, for instance, low complexity can be secured by reducing
    the TBS, accommodating only single-stream transmissions, supporting only a single
    HARQ process for both the DL and UL, adapting only one redundancy version in the
    DL, applying a low sampling rate due to lower UE bandwidth NB-IoT support, and
    allowing only HD-FDD operation [68]. Additionally, synchronization in the modulation
    and demodulation process requires higher computation. However, the NB-IoT has
    been specifically designed to facilitate low-complexity Rx processing in such
    operations. The RedCap, in addition, is also developed to be lower in complexity
    compared to the standard NR via narrowing the bandwidth, reducing the number of
    DL MIMO layers, the transmit antennas, the receive antennas, and so on. Mass Device
    Connection and Global Deployment: Massive connectivity is the key component in
    IoT applications to provide and offer the intended services to society. Mass device
    connectivity pertains to the number of devices that meet a specific QoS within
    a given area, typically measured in terms of square kilometers. As a result of
    the CIoT’s low complexity features and high demands and expectations, deploying
    a massive number of IoT devices is demanded. As concluded in [147], the present
    CIoT technology is efficient, and developing 6G CIoT is essential. Massive numbers
    of device connections are vital when expanding coverage is needed. According to
    [101], low-orbit satellites have been identified as an efficient option for delivering
    long-range IoT services with good coverage and latency by supporting numerous
    connections. Furthermore, the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication
    Sector (ITU-R) [41] has established a firm requirement for International Mobile
    Telecommunications (IMT) 2020 systems that mandates a connection density of one
    million devices per square kilometer. For instance, the GSM has been deployed
    for over 30 years. A round 50% and 25% of subscriptions are made in developing
    countries in Africa and the Middle East, respectively, according to Ericsson’s
    November 2022 report [156]. The GSM networks are widely covered and deployed worldwide,
    making connecting devices feasible, which means that the EC-GSM-IoT can be deployed
    in most regions without significant additional infrastructure. Hence, the deployment
    of the EC-GSM-IoT is feasible worldwide. It can also accommodate massive device
    connections with at least 50,000 nodes per cell [66]. 3GPP has been developed
    enhancements to support more devices per cell. For instance, optimizing resource
    allocation in IoT communication systems is critical in supporting many IoT devices.
    In [157], the authors devised a two-step optimization technique for UL transmission
    using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on deep learning. This approach
    is capable of optimizing the assignment of sub-bands and controlling transmit
    power with outcomes of low complexity, and it can accommodate a large number of
    devices. Moreover, regarding enabling numerous IoT device connections, [158] introduced
    leveraging the unlicensed spectrum in addition to exploiting the licensed spectrum.
    From the Technical Specifications Group RAN work group of TR-45.820 [32], [43],
    [159], for only one PRB (12 × 15 kHz), the NB-IoT, for example, can hold more
    than 52,500 pieces of UE per cell, in some scenarios, it also supports 72,000
    devices [160]. NB-IoT enables the connection of up to 100,000 end devices at the
    expense of complexity and cost [28], [75], [134] within single-cell, and its capacity
    can be obtained by incorporating multiple NB-IoT carriers of 200 kHz. In this
    configuration, one anchor carrier is dedicated to carrying the always-on broadcast
    signaling, while additional carriers (non-anchor carriers) are utilized for offloading
    data traffic and enhancing capacity. Moreover, enhancement objectives include
    designing positioning support (horizontal) targeting at least 50-m accuracy; extending
    the single cell point to multi-point network to support the CIoT for multicast
    DL transmissions (namely firmware or software updates and group message delivery);
    specifying new UE power classes (e.g., 14 dBm) to enable lower maximum transmit
    power suitable for small form-factor batteries, mobility, and service continuity
    enhancements; UL enhancements to reduce device power consumption further; and
    enhancements to support voice [93]. Improved Security: Given the growing importance
    of IoT devices in various industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation,
    ensuring the security of things is critical to protecting sensitive data and ensuring
    the safe operation of these devices. Every CIoT technology option necessitates
    that both the network and the mobile station employ an enhanced and strong security
    framework. They have got a significant benefit from all the security and privacy
    mobile network features comprising user identity confidentiality, authentication,
    confidentiality, data integrity, and mobile equipment identification since it
    is operating in the licensed spectrum sharing all the advantages of standards-based
    technologies. For instance, EC-GSM-IoT has an LTE-grade security to improve end
    user security for the sake of removing any security concerns. The security measures
    currently in place for GSM technology have significantly contributed to enhancing
    security in EC-GSM-IoT. These procedures involve mutual authentication of both
    the device and the network during connection establishment, employment of 64-bit
    long encryption and 128-bit ciphering algorithms for better encryption, rejection
    of incompatible networks, and protection of control plane integrity [75]. Most
    importantly, the integration of existing CIoT technologies with 5G is done. This
    integration allows for enhanced security mechanisms across the network, addressing
    issues of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for a wide range
    of interconnected IoT devices. In general, in CIoT, extending coverage, reducing
    power consumption, lowering device complexity, reducing device cost, enhancing
    massive connectivity, and enhancing positioning are the foremost required features
    to maintain during CIoT communication by all mobile network operators, organizations,
    and companies. As shown in Fig. 8, coverage extension techniques can be incorporated,
    such as repetition and bundling, direct interface side-links or relays, and reducing
    the subcarrier spacing. For example, asset tracking, fleet management, and smart
    cities all rely on accurate positioning data to function effectively and maintain
    position enhancement. Hence, observed time-difference-of-arrival positioning,
    enhanced cell-ID positioning, UL time difference of arrival positioning, location
    positioning protocol, assisted global navigation satellite systems, and centimeter-level
    positioning techniques have been integrated. Solutions for reducing power consumption
    include lowering the transmit power by introducing new classes of UE, enhancing
    power-saving modes (PSM, eDRX, and WUS), and limiting mobility and handovers.
    Narrowing the bandwidth and reducing the number of DLs, multiple-input multiple-output
    layers, and Tx or Rx antennae minimize device complexity. Moreover, reducing signaling
    overhead, simplifying the core network architecture (network elements, interfaces,
    and protocols), and employing better resource management techniques can enhance
    network efficiency. Further, reducing device costs and Tx and Rx bandwidths, minimizing
    the device complexity, reusing the available spectrum and technology, and lowering
    order modulations can play a vital role in using the devices and removing marketing
    barriers. Download : Download high-res image (678KB) Download : Download full-size

    CIoT technologies CIoT technologies have a wide range of applications and can
    be used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of life in
    various industries and sectors. Table 8 presents applications better suited for
    the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap. The EC-GSM-IoT is fundamentally designed
    to offer coverage for machine-to-machine communications (direct communication
    with each other without the need for human involvement) in areas with challenging
    radio coverage conditions. However, the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. The EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap can be employed in areas of applications including; smart cities (waste
    and traffic management), smart environments (building automation; urban safety;
    and intelligent environment monitoring), smart metering (electricity, water, gas,
    and parking spot meters), asset tracking and smart logistics [154], localization,
    farming (monitoring livestock), forestry, industry pallets and pipelines [18],
    [161], and intelligent transportation (e.g., logistics services, and traveling
    time estimation) [23]. Moreover, the LTE and NB-IoT can work with the low and
    geostationary earth orbit satellites to support NTN, studied in Rel. 17 on the
    NB-IoT and LTE-M for NTN [31]. Under the IoT over NTN projects [91], for instance,
    UAVs [162] can use LTE-M to develop low-latency energy-efficient communication
    techniques and power-efficient computing modules [163] in military applications
    to track enemy locations. The feasibility of integrating the NB-IoT into the NTN
    [70] was investigated to extend the coverage in challenging environments like
    mountains, deserts, and oceans [164]. In the same objective, NR-RedCap is designed
    based on the 5G NR requirements, so its application is vital. The 5G is becoming
    prominent in the healthcare industry, automotive industry, smart cars, manufacturing
    sector, smart factories, smart grids, and smart cities [53], which substantially
    affects the IoT but has high costs and complexity issues compared to RedCap. Due
    to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming manifested
    in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require low latency,
    ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. Hence,
    these envisioned use cases have specific requirements regarding data rate, latency,
    battery life, reliability, and other factors. As of today, CIoTs are being applied
    in the following application areas. Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture is one
    of the key application scenarios in the IoT industry [165]. Via CIoTs connectivity,
    farmers and cities can capture data from environmental sensors for management.
    The reason is that they can access places that are hard to reach, such as remote
    areas where agriculture or infrastructure sensors are installed. Due to this,
    monitoring the soil temperature and humidity and tracking the existing land features,
    rain, and pollution are some of the activities farmers can perform using EC-GSM-IoT,
    LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap [24], [166]. In Africa, specifically, farmers are utilizing
    multiple interconnected sensors in their fields to identify the optimal planting
    and harvesting periods for specific crops by leveraging EC-GSM-IoT technology
    [76], [167]. LTE-M and NB-IoT have a role in smart agriculture. Moreover, RedCap
    is expected to be used in cooperative farm machinery in the near future. Minimizing
    water waste will be vital to advancing agricultural processes based on real-time
    monitoring and predictive data analytics via remote sensing [13]. Smart Grid and
    Meter: CIoT technologies play a significant role in application areas, such as
    smart metering, smart grid management with strong coverage requirements, and low
    power use scenarios (e.g., water and gas) since they can access places that are
    hard to reach, such as deep basements where smart meters are installed. They are
    well-suited for connecting many remote smart meters to a central data collection
    point, allowing utility companies to remotely monitor energy consumption and manage
    their networks more efficiently, leading to cost savings and improved customer
    service [168]. Through the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, in smart grid
    applications; electricity is efficiently transmitted and distributed, power is
    recovered rapidly after a fault occurs, maintenance costs are reduced, and security
    and protection. They can remotely control and monitor energy-consuming devices,
    such as air-conditioning and heating systems, to reduce energy consumption during
    peak demand periods [37], [169], [170], [171] with the support of numerous (more
    than 10,000 devices in a cell) smart grid devices. Indeed, a smart grid management
    system is the main operational demand for power control, enabling two-way communication
    between providers and consumers. For instance, according to the investigation
    in [171], demand–response techniques are pivotal to addressing power outage problems,
    reducing cost, and increasing reliability. Intelligent Transportation: Tracking
    and monitoring vehicles intelligently is crucial for transportation companies
    and vehicle owners. Hence, 3GPP identified the vehicle-to-everything communication
    types [33]: vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure, vehicle to pedestrian,
    and vehicle to network. In intelligent transportation, vehicle-to-vehicle communication,
    vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, autonomous/semi autonomous driving, and
    in-car infotainment systems emerged [57]. The CIoT technologies can also assist
    drivers in various ways, such as providing real-time traffic and weather information,
    route planning, and parking assistance; improving the driving experience; and
    reducing the risk of accidents. In intelligent transportation, fleet management
    applications are most in demand [172] including; monitoring fuel consumption and
    scheduling maintenance and repairs. Moreover, LTE-M is well-suited for applications
    requiring voice and data communications, such as telemetry and remote control
    systems. Hence, LTE-M is well-suited for fleet management applications because
    it supports voice and data communication and can track the location and status
    of vehicles in real-time. For transportation systems to be effective, they need
    to be quick, dependable, and adaptable. By implementing the CIoT-based Internet
    of Vehicles, drivers can receive real-time traffic updates, monitor speed limits,
    and subsequently reduce traffic congestion and accidents. In smart parking, for
    instance, data can be transmitted and received in real-time, enabling immediate
    updates to park availability and other information. The available CIoTs can improve
    efficiency, reduce parking costs, and improve the overall user experience [173].
    For some IoT use cases with stationary mobility in intelligent transportation,
    for instance, all CIoT technologies are applicable. NB-IoT, despite its limited
    mobility characteristics, can be considered applicable for smart transportation.
    The devices are often deployed in fixed locations, such as road sensors, infrastructure
    components, or stationary objects along roadways. These devices collect and transmit
    various transportation-related data including real-time tracking, traffic analysis
    (traffic conditions, environmental factors), parking space reservation (often
    involves parking in the basement), location navigation, vehicle management, and
    enable communication between vehicles [174]. Overall, using EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    NB-IoT, and RedCap for intelligent transportation systems helps reduce travel
    time, fuel consumption, and environmental effects and can improve the overall
    travel experience for passengers and drivers. Smart City: Smart cities have a
    high level of technology integration and are distinguished by the extensive use
    of information and communication methods [175]. Due to the current urbanization
    demands worldwide, the smart city concept has been extended from smart offices
    and smart homes to smart buildings. In the framework of smart cities, applications,
    such as environmental sensors, smart grids, predictive maintenance, utility meters,
    high-definition security cameras, smart parking, smart traffic management, smart
    city sensors system for irrigation, and smart street lighting are included, and
    supported by CIoT systems [153], [176], [177]. A smart city cuts costs, increases
    resource consumption efficiency, engages with inhabitants more actively during
    emergencies, and greatly reduces labor costs. Controlling street lights, assessing
    free parking spaces, monitoring environmental conditions, and inspecting road
    conditions are some of the daily administrative tasks performed by city bodies.
    Furthermore, in each layer of IoT applications (i.e., in smart cities), security
    and privacy are daily concerns for safety [178]. Noteworthy to know a smart city
    can be considered a package comprising applications, including intelligent environmental
    monitoring, intelligent transportation, smart street lighting, smart grid, smart
    metering, smart homes, and the like. These applications are demanding the use
    of deep learning-based techniques, for example, in smart lighting [24], [179]
    of smart garbage detection systems that can recognize garbage more accurately,
    reducing the necessary deployment costs and material resources. Smart Homes and
    Buildings: One of CIoT’s rapidly expanding markets is smart homes. The primary
    focus behind the smart home philosophy is preserving energy [79]. Recently, the
    CIoT has offered a powerful and flexible way to control and monitor various aspects
    of the home, providing convenience, energy reduction, and enhanced security [180].
    Various ECG-SM-IoT, LTE-m, NB-IoT, and RedCap devices can be deployed in the living
    room, kitchen, bathrooms, and other rooms. In addition, the devices can be used
    for video surveillance monitoring [177]. For example, homeowners can access remote
    lighting controls, monitor their children, and turn devices on and off while commuting
    to and from work. In emergencies, such as smoke and hazard incidents, installing
    CIoT devices in a smart home is beneficial. Examples of applications that can
    utilize these CIoT’s building penetration capability include monitoring utility
    usage (e.g., smart heat), enhancing security in residential properties, smoke
    detectors, and managing energy consumption in household appliances [24]. Smart
    Environmental Monitoring: Environmental monitoring is a wider concept comprising
    both natural and human environmental phenomena involving rural-agricultural and
    urban-city-oriented monitoring. It includes monitoring air, soil, water, traffic
    volumes, city infrastructure, and other aspects. The existing CIoT cellular network
    can provide intelligent services [181] by incorporating a wireless sensor network
    to automate data acquisition for easy data analysis. These intelligent services
    optimize resource usage, reduce waste, and increase energy efficiency by providing
    real-time data on environmental conditions [182], [183]. It can also be used for
    monitoring the location of wild animals, observing their habitats, and recognizing
    their behaviors. Furthermore, the role of the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    in intelligent environment monitoring involves public health and safety in identifying
    and mitigating possible environmental hazards and extreme weather conditions.
    Smart Tracking: Vertical industries, including transportation, logistics, and
    manufacturing, have a high demand for tracking and monitoring the location and
    movement of physical assets, such as vehicles, equipment, and inventory. Installing
    or attaching global positioning system trackers or RF identification tags onto
    assets and communicating their location and status to the central system optimizes
    operations (e.g., routes in logistics companies) by delivering real-time updates
    on the location, movement, and condition of the assets (e.g., temperature). Hence,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap are useful in tracking shipping, monitoring
    drivers and goods, and obtaining diagnostics and reports across moving operations
    in industry [153], [184], contributing to efficiency improvement, cost reduction,
    and customer service enhancement. Note that when continuous tracking is not required
    NB-IoT can be taken as a good method. In addition to enabling real-time tracking
    and monitoring, they can also provide other benefits in asset tracking systems,
    such as the ability to monitor the condition of the assets and alert maintenance
    personnel when repairs are needed, reducing downtime and improving the overall
    efficiency of the tracking system. Smart Hospitals: Healthcare is the most important
    concern in the era of smart life projects, with a high priority [177]. Wearable
    devices, such as fitness trackers or sports wearables, smartwatches, and smart
    clothing, can track and monitor location and movements and provide identification,
    authentication, data collection, and sensing, including patient vital signs, such
    as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Moreover, implantable devices,
    such as pacemakers and defibrillators, can monitor the heart, or sensors can monitor
    a segment of an organ (i.e., the lungs or kidneys). A periodic update of training
    data and message reception is possible with the NB-IoT and LTE-M in normal conditions
    [190]. Similar to LTE-M and NB-IoT, EC-GSM-IoT is also suitable for low data rate
    healthcare applications. To enhance patient outcomes and lower healthcare expenses
    through the implementation of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring systems,
    EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap are suggested for healthcare applications.
    These technologies offer swift data transfer, energy efficiency, broad communication
    coverage, dependable performance, the ability to handle large data volumes, and
    human tissue safety. Their accurate localization capabilities enable them to address
    clinical care in the hospital and remote patient care. Furthermore, they can be
    utilized to acquire medical reports at regular intervals and receive alerts triggered
    by specific events. Additionally, it enables real-time, two-way medical control
    and monitoring of health conditions through live video feeds. General applications
    in health care systems, including remote patient monitoring, medical asset tracking,
    wellness-tracking wearables, and secure data collection protecting patient data
    privacy [16], can be supported by the current CIoT technologies. Table 8. CIoT

    as well. Smart city [24], [76], [117], [167], [168], [175] ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ The EC-GSM-IoT,
    LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap can be utilized for broad smart city applications including

    play a pivotal role in tracking and monitoring assets and their states in industries
    (transportation, logistics, and manufacturing). Smart hospitals [61], [66], [167],
    [188] ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Because of their fast data transfer, optimized energy consumption,
    rapid data transfer, wide-ranging communication reach, high reliability, capacity
    to handle significant data loads, and safety for human tissue, the EC-GSM-IoT,
    NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap are recommended for healthcare applications to improve
    patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by implementing telemedicine and
    remote patient monitoring systems. Video surveillance cameras [110], [153] ✓ ✓
    LTE-M and RedCap are used for remote monitoring and surveillance applications
    in various industries, in cooperative farm machinery for example, to assist in
    monitoring crops, livestock, and so on. Industry IoT [8], [66], [111] ✓ ✓ ✓ NB-IoT,
    LTE-M, and RedCap are used in monitoring equipment status, controlling processes,
    and ensuring factory safety. Wearables [1], [189] ✓ ✓ ✓ LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    have the ability to provide assistance for wearable devices, such as smartwatches,
    which typically necessitate voice functionality, portability, and fast data transfer
    rates for connectivity to the Internet. Wearables: Devices equipped with NB-IoT
    technology enable real-time monitoring of energy consumption, enabling utilities
    to enhance energy management and improve the efficiency of health monitoring.
    Moreover, in the context of wearables, the ability to support mobility and high
    data rates is critical, as is the ability to support VoLTE. For this reason, LTE-M
    and RedCap are emerging as strong candidates for powering the next generation
    of wearable devices. In applications such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and
    medical wearables, crucial data can be extracted based on various metrics, including
    heart rate, sleep patterns, and activity levels. These real-time data are sent
    over LTE-M and RedCap networks to be analyzed by the responsible authorized individuals
    (e.g., doctors and caregivers) or organizations [118]. Importantly, LTE-M and
    RedCap support movement so that it is possible to monitor users anywhere in motion,
    such as runners, to track their well-being [189]. The utilization of wearable
    devices potentially simplifies self-care for elderly individuals, for instance.
    Hence, wearable devices equipped with NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap technology have
    the capability to track and record an individual’s physical activity, heart rate,
    body temperature, and other health-related data. Video Surveillance Cameras: Due
    to their support of high data rate and video capturing, LTE-M and RedCap are the
    candidate CIoT technologies in video surveillance camera services. Smart cities,
    smart farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly
    installed surveillance cameras. In LTE-M, for example, the Cat-M2 UE category
    supports multimedia IoT applications such as voice and video which have a maximum
    TBS of 4008 bits in the DL and 6968 bits in the UL good for video surveillance
    applications. Moreover, for high-quality video, RedCap plays a significant role.
    Industry IoT: The LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap sensors can be used in the prediction
    of machine failure in the factory. Note that the NB-IoT is not suitable for moving
    objects, so the device is assumed to be battery-powered in a fixed location in
    the factory, requiring two-way communication to upgrade the firmware and software
    [191]. It has a significant role in real-time applications and is more suitable
    for industrial systems that require real-time communication without mobility requirements.
    Even though the NB-IoT supports only up to QPSK modulation that limits its data
    rate, spectral efficient frequency division multiplexing has been proposed, which
    uses higher modulation formats; however, it has drawbacks in energy consumption.
    The authors of [192] developed a two-dimensional channel-aware adaptive modulation
    scheme that improves network performance while maintaining energy efficiency to
    solve this problem. On the other hand, LTE-M and RedCap are the prominent technologies
    for IIoTs since they support mobility and high data rates. Moreover, RedCap is
    objectively developed for such use cases including wearables and video surveillance
    cameras, which we discuss under the RedCap section in detail. 9. Future challenges
    The proposed solutions are explicitly explored as part of the CIoT use-case specifications
    by the 3GPP working group. Most requirements set by the study groups in various
    release versions have been met as promised and planned. Indeed, CIoT has gained
    attention globally due to its cost-effective, ubiquitous coverage with ease of
    deployment of massive MTC and URLLC and several feasible reasons. However, there
    are further challenges that need to be resolved. Congestion Problems: Overcrowding
    or congestion is a significant challenge in the CIoT with a very high concentration
    of devices, as there are limited resources available to handle the numerous sporadic
    access attempts made by a diverse range of MTC devices [26]. With a massive number
    of devices, an enormous number of simultaneous access requests occurs, causing
    congestion in the physical random-access channel, resulting in network access
    delays [193]. For instance, if multiple machine-type devices transmit the same
    preamble simultaneously, they cause the access requests to fail so that access
    efficiency decreases and the number of supported devices reduces. Hence, optimized
    node clustering and data aggregation have been employed as candidate solutions
    to address congestion [194]. Kim and Bang [195] proposed a random-access parallelization
    technique to support multiple preambles, enabling each IoT device to attempt multiple
    instances of random access in parallel to mitigate collisions. In addition, the
    preamble (re)transmission limit [196] is adopted in the UE MAC layer. In contrast,
    network slicing is another promising method to improve the efficiency of resource
    utilization [57], [197] by allocating resources dynamically between slices, providing
    QoS in congestion situations and end-to-end communication. Furthermore, a study
    [198] introduced a recursive access class barring technique to use the available
    resources optimally, obtaining an optimized service time and average access delay
    compared to the conventional access class barring schemes. Despite these solutions,
    as the massive number of devices expands, the reliability of access, data transmission,
    and energy consumption are inevitably questioned. Very High Signaling Overhead
    per Data Packet: In the CIoT, signaling overhead becomes a significant issue when
    considerable signaling is required for each data packet a device sends. Very high
    signaling overhead per data packet can occur when frequent updates or small amounts
    of data are sent from the device. Cellular networks are optimized for larger data
    packets, and when small data packets are sent frequently, the overhead required
    to establish and maintain the connection becomes a significant proportion of the
    overall communication. However, it is particularly problematic in scenarios where
    devices are battery-powered and have limited energy resources, such as IoT devices
    where a device sends small data packets infrequently. The signaling required to
    establish and maintain the connection can become a bottleneck. It can significantly
    increase network traffic, causing issues, such as network congestion, increased
    latency, and energy consumption [52] on the device and network sides, and reduced
    overall performance. Although data packets transmitted by IoT devices are typically
    small, the high signaling overhead required per packet can always become a significant
    issue for IoT devices [199]. Various signaling reduction techniques can address
    these issues, such as message queuing, efficient protocols, and optimized network
    coverage [200]. Studying more appropriate methods is crucial for scheduling transmissions
    and reducing signaling overhead in extremely dense environments using advanced
    techniques, such as machine learning to overcome these challenges in the ultra-dense
    CIoT to meet service requirements, such as latency, battery life, and accuracy.
    Scalability/Massive Connection: There has been a surge in demand for CIoT connectivity,
    especially in the healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing industries, according
    to the future market insight projections [201]. Hence, numerous connected devices,
    sensors, and machines must be handled simultaneously. The main challenge facing
    the CIoT is the need to support numerous devices with a broad range of capabilities
    and requirements to mitigate problems, such as network congestion, power consumption,
    security, and cost. This challenge requires significant investments in network
    infrastructure and management systems to ensure that the network can scale to
    meet the demands of the IoT. Providing connectivity for many devices can be a
    challenge for CIoT networks, where the system scalability [112] comprises the
    network capacity, processing power, data storage, and security. In [202], mobile
    edge computing (MEC) based CIoT (MECIoT) is taken as one of the promising solutions
    for scalability. Thus, techniques including developing low-power devices, designing
    and implementing smart system architecture involving leveraging distributed computing,
    cloud-based infrastructure, and other advanced technology, such as edge computing
    and AI might help and should be further investigated. Privacy and Security: Security
    cameras, biometric sensors, and authentication devices, electronic door locks
    and access control systems, fire alarm and detection systems, intrusion detection
    and prevention systems, industrial control systems used in critical infrastructure
    such as energy, water, and transportation systems, medical devices such as pacemakers
    and insulin pumps are security-sensitive devices that could harm owners if their
    security is threatened by intruders [118]. It is because, the limited resources
    of CIoT devices can make it challenging to implement robust security measures,
    leaving them vulnerable to attacks [203]. CIoT devices are often deployed in physically
    vulnerable locations, making them susceptible to tampering. In addition, the low
    power and low data rates of CIoT devices can make it difficult to implement strong
    security protocols, leaving them open to network-based attacks. Moreover, the
    lack of uniform standards for security in CIoT can lead to inconsistencies in
    security measures across different devices and networks, potentially exposing
    vulnerabilities. To address these risks, it is essential to implement strong security
    measures such as encryption, secure authentication, and access control, while
    also establishing industry standards for securing the devices [204]. Moreover,
    Ni et al. [205] proposed a security authentication system to protect device security
    during network slicing by isolating IoT applications. Savic et al. [206] proposed
    a deep learning-based anomaly detection, the anomaly detection module (ADM) for
    IoT devices (ADM-EDGE) and the ADM at the mobile core network (ADM-FOG), to enhance
    the CIoT security and the mobile core network, respectively, by demonstrating
    it on smart logistics use cases. However, the trial is on small-scale real-world
    use cases that should be examined on a large scale. In [161], quantum resistance
    access authentication is developed to achieve privacy protection and anti-quantum
    attacks. However, numerous IoT devices with high-speed mobility still have security
    issues relating to moving from one cell to another. Interoperability and Integration
    Issues: Enabling different IoT devices and applications to communicate with each
    other and with the CIoT networks seamlessly is another barrier facing the CIoT.
    Due to the requirements for the device, network, standardization, and security
    and the heterogeneity of the protocols, there are a variety of interoperability
    types, including infrastructure (device interoperability), architecture (network
    interoperability), design (syntactical and semantic interoperability), and platform
    interoperability [207], in which intelligent algorithms should be implemented.
    However, ensuring seamless and interoperable communication among numerous devices
    is challenging because of its various data formats, protocol interfaces and application,
    and the complexity increases if two or more devices communicate simultaneously
    [208]. It is necessary to create a multifaceted technology approach to handle
    the interoperability concerns. This approach requires the development of standards,
    protocols, software tools and interfaces, data formats, and more that can be used
    across networks and devices. Energy Efficiency/Power Consumption: One of the most
    critical constraints for CIoT devices is battery life. Most CIoT devices are battery-powered
    require constant sources of power and need low power consumption with many years
    of deployment lifecycle in remote locations where supplying power is spectacularly
    difficult. The reason why many years of deployment are employed is that activities
    include charging batteries regularly, devices that are hard-wired to maintain
    electricity, and a complete device replacement which causes human interaction
    too costly for the business case. For battery-powered IoT devices, energy efficiency
    is a highly critical factor [154]. Often, IoT devices are designed to be low-power
    and energy-efficient, but this is not easy to achieve with cellular networks,
    which requires new approaches to network design and management to ensure the network
    can support low-power devices while providing the necessary performance and coverage.
    However, there are still compromising power consumption issues in the CIoT. One
    method of saving energy in the age of AI is applying the recommended deep neural
    network techniques. However, due to frequent memory access, executing power-intensive
    deep neural networks on low-resource IoT devices increases power consumption.
    To address these problems, a study [209] suggested that reducing the number of
    MAC operations and data precision saves energy. In addition, the recursive access
    class barring technique provides resource-efficiency and energy-efficiency solutions
    [198]. However, a trade-off occurs between energy efficiency and other performance
    factors, such as high data transfer rates, poor network coverage, and complex
    data processing (to mention a few that could be balanced), and further investigation
    is required. Cost: As the deployment of numerous IoT devices increases exponentially,
    it can result in high costs for network providers and end users. Network providers
    and IoT device manufacturers explore partnerships and collaborations to reduce
    costs, share resources, and leverage each other’s expertise and capabilities.
    Among other solutions, significant factors of the CIoT to make IoT devices more
    accessible and affordable for a wider range of applications and use cases are
    using low-cost devices and employing technology that stabilizes the costs for
    the device, network, maintenance, data management, and others [27], [30], [155].
    Often, IoT devices are designed to be low cost, which requires new approaches
    to network design and management to ensure that the network can be deployed and
    maintained at a low cost. However, a low-cost design negatively affects CIoT performance,
    spectral efficiency, and energy consumption. In [210], the authors proposed a
    time allocation algorithm to avoid the problem. Nonetheless, the support for a
    massive number of devices can become limited. Spectrum Efficiency: As IoT devices
    use a small amount of bandwidth, the spectrum is a limited resource that must
    be shared among a massive number of connecting devices. Efficient spectrum allocation
    is vital for connecting many IoT devices and preventing network disruptions. The
    author [211] investigated power-domain nonorthogonal multiple access as the best
    multiple access technique for efficiently utilizing the existing spectrum resources
    in IoT networks from the multiple-user scenario by assigning different power levels.
    However, the number of frequency blocks in the IoT network in the framework is
    limited. Al-Dweik et al. [212] mentioned that power-domain nonorthogonal multiple
    access could be a prominent solution for spectral efficiency from the same user
    perspective in which nonidentical power values can be assigned. However, in large-scale
    IoT networks, spectral efficiency requires new robust approaches to spectrum management
    to ensure that the network can support numerous low-power devices. Quality of
    Service: The level of services and performance of a network provider guarantees
    its customers to make the IoT devices reliable is a highly important factor in
    the CIoT. The technical challenges in the CIoT regarding the bandwidth, power,
    delay, and error rate should be optimized to attain the various QoS requirements,
    including reliability, low latency, high throughput, low power consumption, security,
    scalability, cost-effectiveness, and more. Indeed, IoT devices require low-latency
    and high reliability communication, which is challenging to provide in cellular
    networks. Network optimization, traffic management, and service-level agreement
    strategies are good for preserving QoS [199]. Furthermore, deploying fixed and
    mobile small cells due to the reduced Tx-to-Rx distance is expected to improve
    the QoS with the ever-increasing data demands [213]. However, challenges still
    exist, such as interference and resource management. Hence, new and robust approaches
    to network design and management are required to ensure the network can support
    low-latency, high-reliability communication to achieve QoS. 10. Conclusion In
    recent years, the CIoT has emerged as a promising solution for providing a scalable,
    reliable, and secure infrastructure connecting a broad range of devices and applications.
    The CIoT enables billions of devices to connect and share information, creating
    new services and applications. With the ongoing full deployment and integration
    of 5G networks, CIoT is poised to gain further significance. The fact that 5G
    offers higher data rates, lower latency, and massive device connectivity, which
    unlock new possibilities for CIoT applications, 3GPP and Ericsson have been working
    on standardization of CIoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices. The LTE-M and NB-IoT have confirmed that they can efficiently
    be integrated into the 5G and share its ultimate benefits. The URLLC capabilities
    of 5G enable mission-critical CIoT use cases, such as autonomous vehicles, remote
    surgery, and industrial automation, that require real-time, reliable connectivity
    is now achieved. Moreover, the CIoT is valuable because it reduces the cost and
    complexity of deploying and maintaining IoT networks, provides a global and standardized
    solution for connecting IoT devices, and enables interoperability while ensuring
    the security and privacy of data transmitted over the CIoT network. To this end,
    in this paper, we have compared the existing literature on CIoT technologies and
    discussed their general network architecture. Moreover, we have elaborated on
    the existing CIoT technologies with a complete overview from the perspectives
    of their features and current state-of-the-art including release enhancements,
    focuses, and applications. Finally, we have identified the major challenges in
    CIoT technology that researchers, academics, and industry operators might find
    interesting for further studies and efforts. Declaration of competing interest

    Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that provides ubiquitous and massive connectivity.
    It promises an unlimited possibility in improving the quality of life (e.g., smart
    homes, intelligent diagnostics systems, autonomous driving vehicles, smart irrigation,
    smart cities, and many more) of end-user [1]. The IoT device is vast and encompasses
    numerous features at different layers, which can be challenging to understand
    the significance of different devices from different layers based on the type
    of problem it addresses. These problems are broadly classified as social, environmental,
    and economic development to transform an existing physical infrastructure into
    cyber–physical infrastructure. IoT has much potential to gather resources and
    assist individuals by offering efficient services with smart cyber–physical solutions.
    Smart healthcare, smart grid, smart water supply management, and smart city are
    IoT-based solutions that influence social factors. In connection to healthcare,
    lately, the Internet of Medical Things has emerged as a pioneering platform. [2].
    The authors of [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] investigated the smart healthcare
    framework to monitor the physical and mental health of the patients, and human
    activity recognition. This technology performs timely detection of an anomaly
    in an individual by collecting data using different types of sensors. To improve
    quality of life, we need to design an IoT network that facilitates access to essential
    services, transportation, and better environmental conditions. Thus a smart city
    application emerged by employing a network of smart devices. Examples of such
    applications include parking, waste management, sanitation, lighting, traffic,
    buildings, and the energy sector. Similarly, the smart energy industries solve
    the problem of generation, distribution, consumption, and demand analysis by integrating
    IoT devices. A few examples are smart wind turbines, smart hydro-power systems,
    smart grids, etc. In general, IoT also helps to enhance energy efficiency (EE)
    in electrical devices. Moreover, we use highways and roads to move consumable
    goods from one place to another. Therefore, the existing road infrastructure can
    be made smart by creating warning messages regarding weather conditions, road
    congestion, impending accidents, etc. Several emerging technologies empower smart
    applications like vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), vehicle-to-everything
    (V2X) data exchange service, device-to-device (D2D) connectivity [9]. These applications
    can be leveraged to solve the problem of fast and hassle-free parking and efficient
    traffic management through optimal routing mechanisms using different IoT sensors.
    Such sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.
    The literature in [10], [11], [12], [13] enables smart transportation in future
    cities by ensuring the safety of the driver and reducing traffic congestion. It
    is achieved by using the Mood-Fatigue Analyzer (MFA) and camera-based eye detection
    method that uses the viola-jones algorithm to ensure the safety of the driver
    and traveler in the car. In today’s era, the business prerequisites of the industry
    are automation, interconnection, and real-time data collection. Industrial IoT
    (IIoT) [14], [15] is the driving force of Industry 4.0. The enormous data generated
    by smart tracking systems [16], smart factories [17], and smart asset management
    [18] are exploited to achieve an optimized performance of the supply chain. These
    networks include embedded systems, microcontrollers, sensors and actuator networks
    (SANET), communication modules, etc. In [19], the authors have reviewed the motivation
    to apply IoT for big data analysis and the technological and social challenges
    associated with it. This type of application requires a continuous flow of information.
    Hence, the devices require more power compared to other applications. IoT-based
    cellular, non-terrestrial, and wide-area network connections are predicted to
    approach 5.9 billion by 2026 [20]. These wide-area network connections include
    sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and a communication interface that require
    batteries to run their sensing, processing, and transmission interfaces. These
    batteries have a finite capacity. Frequently recharging/changing these batteries
    results in change-over downtime and incurs huge operational costs. Moreover, at
    the current rate of carbon dioxide emissions, global temperatures have risen substantially
    from pre-industrial levels. Hence, there is a compelling need to plan future cities
    to be sustainable [21], [22]. Harvesting energy from natural sources is a promising
    self-sustainable solution that prolongs battery life, eliminates maintenance costs,
    and aids in long-term deployment. Particularly, photo-voltaic (PV) cells [23],
    [24] and radio frequency (RF) [25], [26] have been identified as cost-effective
    energy sources that enable on-site charging of rechargeable batteries for sustainable
    IoT applications. It is necessary to have a thorough understanding of IoT devices
    in terms of power, cost, and critical features (sensing interface, actuation interface,
    processing interface, data-storage interface, data-management interface, and communication
    interface) at different layers to assemble the self-sustainable IoT system design.
    However, no such architecture collaborates the function of three-layer, four-layer,
    five-layer, and seven-layer architecture design for sustainable IoT applications.
    So, there is a need to establish a clean and streamlined cross-layer architecture
    to bridge the gap between application requirements and IoT system design. The
    widely researched, self-sustainable IoT-enabled layered architecture design, compatible
    with various IoT applications, has been effectively illustrated in Fig. 1. In
    a self-sustainable layered architecture design, Fig. 1 represents every possible
    IoT service, device, and application congruously. The layered architectural design
    begins with the energy harvesting interface, which includes energy sources, transducers,
    trackers, and storage interface. Additionally, it demonstrates various optimization
    strategies to reap the maximum benefit of the harvested energy. Various IoT devices
    that require power to perform data sensing, transmission, processing, and accumulation
    at different layers, are presented. Next, the power consumption and cost of the
    device, associated with the functionality of a particular layer, are mentioned.
    Then, depending on the use of any device in the most suitable IoT application,
    the sensing, processing, transmission, and actuation interfaces of the layered
    architecture design are categorized in terms of power requirement, cost, and other
    critical factors. Finally, the business layer of the proposed framework is presented.

    Motivation and contribution Based on the state-of-art, we conclude that several
    studies have been conducted on EH-IoT networks (see Table 1), and a tutorial on
    EH-IoT networks based on the layered architecture design is missing. Moreover,
    no substantial survey has ever been performed to develop a self-sustainable IoT
    device based on application requirements by following a sequential set of IoT
    reference layer models as shown in Fig. 1. For energy harvesting, it is necessary
    to have a clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT
    devices. The framework involves generation process, storage mechanism, tracking
    energy consumption, and managing the supply of harvested energy. We have designed
    a framework for EH-IoT by dividing it into energy sources, energy transducers,
    energy trackers, energy management, and energy consumption interfaces. The proposed
    mapping of EH-IoT, along with the design framework, will help researchers and
    practitioners of this domain to reduce the time to collate knowledge and create
    a road map for their specific needs. The contributions of this survey are summarized
    as follows: • We have classified IoT modules based on their applications. Next,
    each class has been divided into IoT device based layered architecture to study
    layer-specific power requirements (or demand) versus the sources (or supply).
    • This is followed by a discussion on energy harvesting from several sources,
    which will act as an enabler of power source for EH-IoT. Also, the method to harvest
    and store that harvested energy is outlined by highlighting the currently available
    and emerging energy storage interfaces. • We proposed a balanced and well-researched
    layers architecture design of self-sustainable IoT device for various IoT applications.
    We developed a single overview of all layers’ architecture and their relations
    with energy harvesting interfaces. • The energy-saving and resource-optimization
    method for self-sustainable IoT design is discussed in terms of power and data
    optimization. Moreover, various methods to maintain balance among bandwidth, range,
    power consumption, and time constraints of IoT sensing, processing, and transmission
    interfaces are discussed by following a common framework of the EH interface.
    • Insights on IoT-based energy harvesting interfaces that contribute to interoperability
    and the interfacing units such as sensing, processing, communication, and energy
    harvesting are discussed in IoT layered design. • Finally, based on state-of-art
    literature, we highlight several open research issues and future possibilities
    for self-sustainable IoT device based on the layered architecture design. Table

    Table 1 indicates a complete summary of the existing survey papers based on different
    functionalities of devices. The functionalities of the device are shown based
    on different IoT interfaces from the cross-layer architecture design by considering
    their use in specific IoT applications. The different functionalities mainly incorporates
    the sensing & actuation, processing, EH, energy storage, data management and storage
    and wireless interfaces. 43% of the literature covers any four layers (mostly
    sensing and actuation, processing, EH, and wireless interface are covered under
    review). But most of the time these articles omit discussion on data management,
    and energy storage interfaces. We have covered all six interfaces. In contrast
    to the other surveys, our survey provides a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated
    overview of the proposed self-sustainable IoT device for diverse IoT applications.
    It is achieved by covering all the IoT interfaces from the cross-layer architecture
    design. Each interfacing region operates in the different layers of IoT device.
    The description of different interfaces is as follows: • The sensing and actuation
    interface is a part of the physical layer and deals with different sensing and
    actuating devices for IoT applications. Moreover, the processing interface is
    also a part of the physical layer, which focuses on the number of micro-controllers
    and microprocessors used in different IoT applications. • Once the data has been
    sensed and processed by sensing and processing interface of the physical layer
    architecture design, it needs to be sent among different devices for the exchange
    of information. This data transmission is carried out by a wireless interface
    unit which is a part of network layer in the IoT device based layer architecture
    design. • The data management and storage interface is part of the processing
    layer. It is responsible for handling and organizing large amounts of data. This
    interface also includes certain protocols used at the application layer, like
    MQTT, AMPQP, and XMPP, which are the methods used for managing the data at the
    remote server. • Finally, we need an energy-harvesting (EH) and energy storage
    interface to power the IoT devices. These interfacing units manage and store the
    power supply of IoT devices. For energy harvesting, it is necessary to have a
    clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT devices.
    The framework involves the generation process, storage mechanism, tracking energy
    consumption, and managing the supply of harvested energy. We have designed a framework
    for self-sustainable IoT device by dividing it into energy source units, energy
    transducers, energy tracker units, energy management units, and energy consumption
    units. The proposed mapping of self-sustainable IoT device, along with the design
    framework, will help researchers and practitioners of this domain to reduce the
    time to collate knowledge and create a road map for their specific needs. Some
    of the available research papers based on the above interfacing layers are discussed
    below. In [27], the authors describe the overview of IoT in terms of wireless,
    sensing, and actuation interfaces by considering the middleware layer. This layer
    enables interoperability across various IoT devices, applications, and platforms.
    They define the suitability of the sensors, actuators, and different communication
    protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, and WiFi for IoT applications in a variety
    of applications, including healthcare, transportation, and smart cities. The authors
    of [28] described the cloud-centric/Internet-centric architecture for the IoT
    networking, sensing, and processing interface. The intention is to offer an integrated
    platform for developing analytics tools, computer graphic designers, specialists
    in artificial intelligence, and sensing service units. Therefore, a single platform
    can combine storage, computation, and visualization paradigms to improve IoT performance
    for various applications. Apart from this, authors in [29] focused on providing
    a promising approach to build a smart industrial system by using the four-layered
    architecture design. Authors in [30] focused on handling the security and privacy
    issue of the IoT paradigm at the perception and processing layers. IoT sensors
    generate massive data to make it applicable at the application interface. But
    unauthorized users generate several attacks, such as brute force, phishing, man-in-the-middle
    attack, spoofing, and denial of service attacks in the lower layers of IoT system
    design to steal valuable data. To address this issue, authors paved forward various
    technologies such as blockchain and physical layer security to secure the data.
    Authors in [31] discussed the state-of-the-art protocols and applications in the
    emerging era of IoT networks. They consolidate most IoT applications, including
    smart wearables, brain-sensing headphones, and embedded skin patches, by concentrating
    on the taxonomy of three- and five-layered architectural designs. The architecture
    section of this paper also considers fog computing, which has never been considered
    earlier but lacks a discussion on data management and power interfaces. Despite
    the advancement in IoT technology, work on sensing, processing, and actuation
    interfaces are still underway in terms of power requirement. To overcome the power
    interface units, authors in [32], [33] covered a thorough review of energy harvesting
    sources, energy storage devices, and associated topologies of energy harvesting
    systems for energy-constrained IoT networks. It mainly focused on distribution
    approaches, conversion modules, storage devices, and control units to minimize
    circuit losses. Similarly, authors in [1] examine several strategies that facilitate
    the efficient use of energy harvesting as a proxy for different IoT devices in
    an efficient manner. It also investigates the effective checkpointing and timestamping
    methods to power IoT devices without depending on conventional power supplies.
    In addition to utilizing renewable energy sources to power IoT devices, new machine
    learning and wireless communication techniques for EH-IoTs are being researched.
    These include the backscatter communication technique, packet-less IoT communication,
    and reinforcement learning. The authors of [34] present energy harvesting solutions
    and energy efficient approaches for information and communication technology (ICT)
    by dividing the discussion of the paper into two parts: Green of ICT and Green
    by ICT. Green of ICTencompasses a wide range of topics, including green data center,
    network, and device approaches. Furthermore, Green by ICT provides energy harvesting
    strategies and resource-saving options for device-to-device communication. Further
    on, Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT) technology that increases battery life is also covered.
    A comprehensive analysis of the most recent energy harvesting technologies for
    IoT sensing devices is provided by the authors in [35], who also emphasize the
    IoT system’s potential for energy autonomy. In addition, the authors describe
    two case studies of IoT systems that utilize energy harvesting via solar and RF
    energy sources to provide energy autonomy for sensing devices. Both systems employ
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons as sensors, which broadcast the sensed parameters
    to BLE-capable terminals like mobile devices. The mobile devices then transmit
    this data to the cloud via internet services. The authors of [36] focus on the
    wireless interface of the current and future IoT applications, including 5G cellular
    networks, wide-area networks, and unlicensed band communication. It is accomplished
    by utilizing grant-free access, channel coding for short-packet communication,
    non-orthogonal multiple access, and on-device intelligence to make the wireless
    unit energy-efficient, highly reliable, low latency, and scalable. In [37], the
    authors emphasized the data management unit by proposing a proportional trade-off
    between high security and reduced energy usage of IoT devices. It employs a context-aware
    technique to safeguard IoT data while consuming minimal energy. The authors also
    considered the scope of artificial intelligence and Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) to deploy a secure, energy-efficient IoT network. Similarly, in [38], [39],
    the authors presented different approaches to predictive analysis and classification
    methods to secure the data at minimal power consumption. It shows that during
    data transmission, most of the power is consumed when data packet collisions occur,
    packet overheads are unaddressed, redundant data is present, and a longer distance
    exists between the transmitter and receiver. Additionally, they highlight a number
    of efficient ways to lower energy consumption in both single-hop and multi-hop
    communication networks. The existing studies involves shallow discussion on the
    interfacing units within the IoT context. However, it fails to provide detailed
    information about the specific types of sensing, processing, and communication
    devices involved, as well as their corresponding power consumption in the layer
    architecture design. From the state-of-art, it has been seen that there is no
    substantial survey has ever been performed to develop a self-sustainable IoT device
    based on application requirements by following a sequential set of IoT reference
    layer models. As a result, our proposed framework filling the gap by mapping the
    IoT applications to the devices and, subsequently, the devices to the energy harvesting
    (EH) interface. The first step in this process involves identifying the layer
    architecture design for self-sustainable IoT device. Each layer accommodates different
    devices for different IoT applications. These IoT devices require a ubiquitous
    supply of power for their operations. To fulfill the power requirement of different
    devices that fall into different layers of IoT applications, there is a need for
    energy harvesting sources, transducers and storage interfaces. So, this necessitate
    the development of the self-sustainable IoT device that establish a connection
    among IoT application, devices and energy-harvesting interface. Download : Download

    of the paper. 1.3. Organization This survey is further structured as shown in
    Fig. 2. After a brief introduction, Section 2 presents survey on standard system
    architecture for IoT applications. Next in Section 3, the energy (power) requirement
    at different layers have been outlined. In Section 4, the different EH sources,
    transducers, trackers, and storage approaches that can be used in various IoT
    applications are discussed. Next, in Section 5, the various optimization techniques
    for effective utilizing the harvested energy are presented. Then, in Section 6,
    a comprehensive surveys is highlighted for various IoT applications based on the
    devices of different IoT layers and energy harvesting interfaces to establish
    the mapping between the IoT devices and the energy harvesting interfaces. Additionally,
    Section 7 discusses open issues and future trends. Finally, the paper is concluded
    in Section 8. 2. Standard layered architecture for IoT-enabled applications While
    designing an IoT system, it is essential to have an understanding of the devices
    and their organization. It is important to visualize the organization of different
    devices acting as a connected system. This Section describes the first step towards
    the strategic mapping between applications to layers and layers to devices. The
    designer has to take care of not only the functionality but also the coverage
    area, power requirements, architecture, and cost factors associated with the communication
    system. The standard functionalities are sensing, actuation, processing, data
    storage, and management. The cost factors include developmental, fabrication,
    and maintenance costs. This complex system model can be organized into a layered
    architecture. The design approach helps the system designer in two ways, namely,
    to create functional interactions and subsequently design communication strategies
    based on those interactions. In the first phase, the required functionalities
    are organized into different layers (e.g., starting from sensing any event to
    a final consumable product/application). The interfaces are laid down in the second
    phase to exchange information (intra and inter-layer communication). We have presented
    an example in Fig. 3. There are several position papers and surveys that deal
    with layer architecture design of IoT device [40], [41], [42]. Despite the refinement
    in IoT system design, the state-of-the-art has yet to have a single framework
    on layer architecture of IoT device that is widely accepted. While one group of
    researchers focused on the protocol, another group concentrated on the cloud-based
    architecture. In 2014, Rockwell Automation, Cisco, and IBM presented a seven-layer
    architectural model for IoT. However, the one proposed by the IoT world forum
    aimed to fulfill the space between application requirements and system design
    [43], [44]. The seven-layer architecture is an updated version of the five-layer
    architecture that introduced edge computing, fog computing, and big data processing.
    Fig. 3 depicts all the necessary functions and collaborative overview of several
    three-layer, four-layer, five-layer, and seven-layer architectural reference models.
    The role and requirements of each layer in the self-sustainable IoT devices, applications,
    and services is discussed in the following sections. In this work, the seven-layer
    interface has been consolidated into a five-layer architecture which is discussed
    below. A typical IoT application requirement can be connected to a self-sustainable
    system design by identifying the mapping between interfacing sub-layers [31].
    We shall use this layered architecture to review the power requirement of IoT
    devices. Next, we present a brief discussion on different layers covering the
    functionality, whereas an in-depth discussion on the IoT devices can be found
    in Section 3. Download : Download high-res image (753KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Different layer architecture designs for IoT device. 2.1. Business
    layer The main aim of the business layer is to handle the entire IoT system. It
    communicates with the application layer and consumes the information available
    at that layer. It can alter business operations and benefit the overall operation
    of the IoT network. 2.2. Application layer The application layer provides application-oriented
    services to the end users. A huge number of IoT applications have been developed
    that cater to different services such as smart home, smart transportation, smart
    infrastructure management, and many more sustainable IoT applications have been
    broadly categorized into three classes, namely, social, business and environmental.
    2.3. Processing layer This layer is referred to as the middleware layer, and it
    is responsible for storing, processing, and analyzing a large amount of information
    from the connectivity layer. It incorporates database management, cloud computing,
    and analytics of big data-based technologies. The processing layer encompasses
    two most important sub-layer interfaces that recreate a crucial part of IoT system
    design, e.g., (a) data storage/accumulation interface (b) data management/abstraction
    interface. 2.4. Connectivity layer The connectivity layer mainly deals with the
    transmission of useful information in an efficient and timely manner. The layer
    includes all networking elements of IoT. This layer includes wireless communication
    protocols such as Z-Wave, LoRa, Zigbee, Thread, Wi-Fi, SigFox, Bluetooth, and
    cellular communication. 2.5. Physical layer (Perception layer) The physical layer
    is the initial layer of the IoT reference model that deals with the things/devices
    of IoT. The “things” in IoT refers to different end devices that transmit and
    receive data. The layer includes sensors, actuators, and controllers. The power
    supply is also managed through this layer. Multiple interfacing sub-layers exist
    between the physical and connection layer (as depicted in Fig. 3), namely, the
    sensing and actuation interface, power supply/monitoring interface, pre-processing
    interface, and temporary storage interface. Moreover, a detailed discussion on
    sensors and actuators, which are part of the layer, is discussed in Section 3.5.1
    The following Section goes through the power, cost, and critical features of IoT
    devices at different layers to assemble the self-sustainable IoT system design.
    3. Power and cost required for self-sustainable IoT devices in the layer architecture
    design This Section discusses the power or voltage and the associated cost of
    operating different IoT layers. IoT devices’ power consumption is crucial in identifying
    suitable energy harvesting interfaces to make them sustainable. Moreover, different
    IoT devices consume power at different layers based on their functioning. However,
    business layers need not be mentioned in this Section, as this layer do not involve
    physical IoT devices that consume power. So, this layer mainly do not contribute
    towards the sustainable IoT device. Moreover, this layers deal with application-oriented
    services involving different groups and business processes. Above this, we look
    at the cost requirement and critical features of different types of microcontrollers,
    sensors and actuators network (SANET), and communication modules to make the architecture
    of IoT device self-sustainable in different smart applications as discussed below:
    3.1. Application layer The application layer protocols play a significant role
    in sustaining the IoT devices for different applications as it establishes the
    communication among things, devices, or objects with different application interfaces.
    Cloud-based communication protocols often improve connectivity rates to ensure
    stability, durability, and productivity through better information access. The
    most commonly used application layer protocols are Websocket, Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Representational
    State Transfer (RESTful Services) and Data Distribution Services (DDS). These
    protocols can be employed in different IoT applications for sustainable operations
    to provide a strategic mapping between the application layer with other layers.
    Below we mention different communication protocols to link a connection between
    IoT devices and the cloud. • Advanced message queuing protocol (AMQP): It is an
    application layer protocol that facilitates client–server communications between
    cloud and IoT nodes. This open-access based protocol contains more message overheads
    and is not accepted widely [45]. • Message queue telemetry transport (MQTT): MQTT
    is a lightweight communication protocol based on publish–subscribe-based architecture
    [46], which allows the client device to subscribe to the broker for receiving
    data from the server (publisher) through the topic. In the existing literature,
    MQTT ensured the reliable reception of messages offering different quality of
    services (QoS) [47], [48], [49]. • Constrained application protocol (CoAP): It
    is a web communication protocol with constrained nodes and a restricted network.
    It also facilitates a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) for smooth network integration.
    It mostly provides communication among machine-to-machine networks and uses the
    HTTP and publish–subscribe architecture with various commands. In comparison to
    the MQTT, the centralized device in CoAP uses a universal resource identifier
    (URI) [50]. In comparison to available protocols, MQTT offers better QoS, throughput,
    data protection, low latency [51], low packet loss [52], low power consumption
    and restricted bandwidth usage [53], [54]. The widely available cloud service
    providers are xively, grove stream, carriots, things worx, things speak, plotty,
    amazon web services (AWS), microsoft azure and many more. 3.2. Processing layer
    In this subsection, we discuss the different computing platforms that is responsible
    for making the decision based on the data sensed from the sensor and communicated
    to the central server for analysis, computation, and storage. The power consumption
    of the processing layer services is very high, and the cost requirement is moderate
    and varies from different service providers such as Xively, Grove Stream, Carriots,
    Plotty, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services, and many more. Based on the intense
    survey, it is noticed that there is no criteria for selecting these data processing
    services for particular IoT applications based on the IoT device requirement.
    The processing layer mainly incorporated the hierarchical computing platforms
    for the data operation, as discussed below: • Cloud computing: In a wide variety
    of IoT applications, storing, processing, and analyzing unstructured data in a
    well-manageable form is a significant challenge. Cloud services are the most common
    platform for monitoring, analyzing, and storing huge IoT data. However, as the
    number of IoT devices increases, processing a huge amount of data on a single-layer
    platform leads to network congestion and an increase in the loss of data packets.
    So processing data on a single layer for a longer interval is not feasible due
    to the high latency and limited bandwidth per user. As a result, Cloud-computing
    is considered as a non-optimal approach for distributed processing of IoT data
    generated by different sensors and other devices at lower layers. So, fog and
    edge computing came into existence to address this challenge and maintain highly
    responsive IoT applications with low latency [55]. • Fog computing: To overcome
    the challenges in cloud computing, it is suggested to distribute data processing
    across the middle region of the processing layer rather than directly sending
    data to the cloud service (final region of processing layer). This process, known
    as Fog computing, involves handling data as close to the connectivity layer. It
    will reduce the latency and network congestion to a larger extent [56]. Fog computing
    is considered to be the best as it may link to the nearby edge device for analyzing
    and transformation that are later supported by the cloud services for storage
    and processing. • Edge computing: Although the concept of Fog computing solves
    all the limitations of Cloud computing, the concept of Edge computing came into
    origination to further minimize the latency. The main aim of Edge computing is
    to bring a IoT device closer to the data processing, computation and accumulation
    layer rather than relying on the cloud server. So that it can preprocess data
    and only forward the metadata by reducing the bandwidth requirement per device.
    Fog and edge computing can be employed in various IoT applications, such as smart
    traffic systems to enable the warning system by generating real-time warnings
    using the edge service [57]. The smart metering system also uses fog, edge, and
    cloud services to analyze the energy consumption of different households, industries,
    hospitals, schools and many more. Such analysis generates more data and uses a
    larger bandwidth. To address this, a hierarchical fog service is proposed [44],
    [58] as a solution by interconnecting them with a different edge service employed
    on each meter to reduce latency. On the other hand latency-tolerant data may be
    sent directly to the cloud services platforms for processing and storage. Apart
    from this, it is also used in various other IoT applications, such as smart hospitals,
    smart homes, smart industries, smart cities, and many more [59], [60], [61] to
    process data with low latency and high responsiveness. 3.3. Connectivity layer
    In this subsection, we discuss the various types of wireless communication protocols
    for enables communication from the device-to-device and the device-to-access point.
    Additionally, the characteristics of a protocol in terms of its bandwidth, data
    rate, lifespan, and cost are provided. 3.3.1. Device to device/device to access
    point wireless protocol Communication via IoT devices involves data transfer from
    D2D and the device to the access point gateway. The IoT ecosystem incorporates
    billions of smart devices, but they have significant limitations e.g. processing
    speed, power, lifetime, and range. Since IoT devices mainly operate at low power,
    commercially available communication devices for device-device communication are
    Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), WiMAX, cellular, Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1), Z-Wave, Zigbee,
    6LowPAN (IEEE 802.15.4), BLE 5.0 (IEEE 802.15.6), SigFox, LoRa, RFID, Near field
    communication (NFC), etc. Classification of these devices based on coverage area
    is shown in Fig. 4. A comparative study on the above-discussed communication protocols
    is presented in Table 2. In 2016, a new standard for energy harvesting was launched
    as ZigBee green power (GP) for wireless sensor networks [84]. The ZigBee GP specifications
    and the IEEE 802.15.4 networking protocol are used in energy-harvesting ZigBee-based
    communication protocol applications that operate on a low-power microcontroller
    framework [85]. IEEE 802.11ah is another framework that achieves a lower data
    rate but has a greater coverage area than traditional Wi-Fi operating above 1
    GHz. In this frequency range, absorption by buildings and other objects increases
    significantly. Hence, 802.11ah is an ideal candidate to be used for IoT networks.
    The analytical expression of throughput for IEEE 802.11ah has been obtained in
    [86]. Download : Download high-res image (180KB) Download : Download full-size

    deals with a temporary and permanent memory device to store data. It also involves
    the collection and processing of data on virtual storage systems, such as cloud,
    fog, and edge, and how the data can be structured. The microcontroller board (temporary
    storage interface) can have two types of memory, i.e., volatile (RAM) and non-volatile
    (e.g., flash, EEPROM) memories. Volatile memory requires continuous power, while
    non-volatile memory requires power on demand. 3.5. Physical layer In this subsection,
    we discuss several types of sensing and actuating devices that are utilized in
    various IoT-based smart applications. The power utilization and the associated
    cost to fabricate each sensor are described in Table 3. The cost of sensors has
    been taken from amazon.com. The search keyword was “IoT sensors” and visited on
    5th January, . Sensors with the capability of harvesting energy can be reused.
    Thus the overall power consumed by the sensing system reduces significantly and,
    in effect, extends the operation time of an IoT device as discussed in [15], [87],
    [88], [89], [90], [91], [92]. In this Section, we examine different types of sensors
    and actuators and list out possible areas of application in connection to IoT
    system design. Table 3. Comparison of sensors employed in sustainable IoT designs.

    a device that senses or measures physical changes in the surrounding environment,
    such as thermistors, light-dependent resistors, magnetic field-based sensors.
    A response is created whenever there is any change in the physical or chemical
    state of objects in the vicinity of the sensor. This response is measured and
    analyzed by the sensors [93]. We specifically discuss a few sensors used for a
    particular IoT application. We also list out the associated parameters required
    to achieve specific design objectives. Velocity This type of sensor measures consecutive
    positions at known intervals and computes the rate at which the movable object
    position varies at different times. Based on the working principle, velocity sensors
    can be of two types, e.g., linear and angular. A linear sensor measures the rectilinear
    motion, and an angular sensor measures the spin rate of an entity. Examples of
    velocity sensors include doppler-effect sensors, accelerometers [11], and gyroscopes.
    Such sensors mainly find applications in smart vehicles, traffic monitoring systems,
    smart cities [93]. Proximity The proximity sensor detects the location of a neighboring
    object without making any physical contact [94]. It emits infrared waves and senses
    the presence of any object by measuring the difference of signal indicating return
    status [95]. Its use can be inductive, capacitive, ultrasonic, photoelectric,
    and magnetic [96]. Moreover, it is employed in several places to count the number
    of cars and objects in applications like smart parking and smart homes. Position
    The position sensor uses a motion detection mechanism to determine whether humans
    or other objects are within a specific region. Examples of position sensors are
    rotary encoders and hall effect sensors. This type of sensor is used in typical
    hospital surveillance systems that track patients, nurses, and doctors [97]. In
    [98], Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is also utilized to monitor the real-time location
    of people working in an underground mine. Temperature Temperature sensor calculates
    the heat intensity of a person to assess ambient conditions using non-contact-based
    or contact-based mechanisms. The contact-based sensor works when it is in physical
    touch with the object. However, the non-contact-based sensor measures the temperature
    using the convection and radiation method [99]. Typical examples of temperature
    sensors include thermocouples and thermistors. Such sensors are used in smart
    irrigation, smart healthcare, and environment monitoring [100]. Chemical Chemical
    sensors measure the chemical composition of the overall environment. It operates
    by detecting chemical reactions or a set of chemicals. Some examples of chemical
    sensors are breath analyzers, olfactometers, and smoke detectors. These sensors
    are typically employed in different IoT applications like smart cities, smart
    buildings, smart irrigation, air quality monitoring [101], etc. Force The Force
    sensor detects the amount of stress and converts it into an output signal. Examples
    of such a sensor include the strain gauge and pressure switch. These sensors are
    applied to numerous IoT applications, e.g., smart buildings, intelligent construction,
    medical monitoring [102], etc. Light The light sensor is a passive device that
    receives energy from light and transforms this energy into an electrical signal
    [103]. Hence an external power source is not needed in this case. Infrared sensors,
    photodetectors, and flame detectors are some of their examples. Biomolecular Biomolecular
    sensor translates metabolic reactions into electrical signals. These sensors monitor
    several biological factors, e.g., tissue, antigen, antibodies, hemoglobin level,
    glucose, and nucleic acid. Examples of such sensors are pulse oximeters, electrocardiographs,
    and various others that measure the physical and chemical changes in the human
    body. Humidity The humidity sensor first picks up the amount of water vapor in
    the air and then converts it into an equivalent electrical signal. The humidity
    level can be calculated in different ways, e.g., absolute, relative, and mass
    ratio. Hygrometer, soil moisture indicator, temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11),
    and so on are some of its examples. 3.5.2. Actuation interface An actuator is
    an element of a device that drives the system by converting the available energy
    into physical movement. An actuator needs a control signal and an energy source
    to operate. For IoT applications, actuators are mainly two types, i.e., continuous
    and binary actuators. A relay is an example of a binary actuation interface with
    two stable states, either latched (ON) or unlatched (OFF). Binary actuators consume
    full power or no power in the ON and OFF state, respectively. A motor is an example
    of a continuous actuator, as it can rotate through an angle of 360°. The speed
    and direction of a motor are governed by a microcontroller with pulse width modulation
    (PWM) signal pins. Next, we discuss the operation of some commonly used actuators.
    Servo motor A servo motor includes a direct current (DC) motor with two wires,
    a gear line, a potentiometer, an integrated microcontroller IC and a shaft (output
    spine). The shaft is mounted at a particular angular position by sending a control
    signal to the servo via a microcontroller. However, it can rotate up to 180° only.
    The servo motor consumes power only in position control mode. Servo motor is used
    in different IoT devices such as dual-axis solar panels (self-sustainable IoT),
    smart positioning, e.g., in an elevator (smart infrastructure), movement of a
    smart robot, computer numerical control (CNC) machine, and automatic production
    in smart industries. Relay The relay is a programmable electrical switch to energize
    (ON) or de-energize (OFF) devices that consume high voltage, current, or both.
    Hence it is an intermediate device that connects high-voltage devices and microcontrollers.
    It comes with two sets of pins. One set is used for a microcontroller or low-voltage
    device, and the other is used for a high-voltage device. Relays are part of most
    IoT applications to control the devices based on the controlling signals from
    interfaced microcontrollers. One of the examples is smart irrigation to energize
    and de-energize the water pump based on the controlling signals. Stepper motor
    The DC voltage drives a stepper motor, and it rotates in discrete steps. Such
    a motor consists of several coils organized in a group known as ‘phase’. Only
    a single series phase is energized at a time, and the motor rotates one step.
    Its rotating position, speed, acceleration, and deceleration can be precisely
    controlled. Like the servo motor, the stepper motor is not limited in rotation.
    It requires additional hardware and power supply to complete a single rotation.
    A stepper motor consumes power to lock in and remain in position command. Its
    application domain is limited to automation, robotics, 3-D printer, and X-Y plotter.
    Hydraulic actuator A hydraulic actuator consists of a fluid engine that utilizes
    hydraulic power to enable mechanical operation. The mechanical movement is then
    transformed into linear, rotating, or oscillatory motion. Its application domain
    is restricted to single-axis movement of any heavy load, braking system, heavy
    load lifting/balancing system, and radial engines DC motor DC motor is the most
    commonly used actuator in electronics projects. It is available in different sizes
    to handle various activities. It consists of permanent magnets and loops of wire.
    When the device is switched ON, the loops induce a magnetic field, which interacts
    against the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. Pneumatic actuator The pneumatic
    actuator transforms the energy shaped by vacuum or compressed air in linear or
    rotational movement at high pressure. It converts pressure into force. Pneumatic
    actuators can generate a large amount of force from relatively minor variations
    in pressure. 3.5.3. Processing interface In processing and controlling interface,
    we list out different types of microcontrollers boards. The widely used microcontrollers
    in this layer are Arduino UNO [104], Raspberry Pi [105], and NodeMCU ESP8266 [106].
    The microcontrollers along with their processing speed, operating voltage, characteristics
    and the cost are tabulated in Table 4. Depending on the energy consumed by a sensor
    node, the following operational states have been defined, namely, active state
    (AS), sleep state (SS), ultra low power active state (ULPAS), low power active
    state (LPAS) and low power state (LPS). The most commonly used processor is MSP432.
    There are typically four low power modes (LPM) in MSP432 processor. LPM 3, LPM
    4 refer to deep sleep states, while LPM 3.5 and LPM 4.5 refer to stop or shut
    down state. The operational, ADC states of a MSP432 processor along with the current
    rating and cost are depicted in Table 5. Table 4. Comparison among different microcontroller

    4. EH techniques: Different components required for self-sustainable IoT devices
    In this Section, commonly used sources of energy harvesting are discussed. Subsequently,
    EH transducers, standards and energy trackers are outlined. Next, we list the
    amount of power generated through harvesting, the cost of those harvesters, and
    the applications that utilize the effective harvested power. Frequent battery
    replacement in devices is a time-consuming and costly process, as it requires
    human intervention. Further, access to IoT devices is limited in remote locations.
    Additionally, many IoT devices are deployed in several IoT applications, making
    it difficult to run on battery throughout their life. To tackle these issues,
    harvesting energy is seen as a critical enabler technology that reduces dependence
    on batteries [35]. A battery life may be extended indefinitely subject to the
    fact that the converted electrical energy is more than the minimum energy requirement
    [107]. EH modules integrated with WSNs are referred to as energy-harvesting wireless
    sensor networks. These integrated modules collect energy by utilizing external
    sources, i.e., RF, solar, wind, vibration, and thermal. Since the harvested energy
    is stochastic and unstable, the transmission parameters of the WSN need dynamic
    adjustment to maintain a sustainable operation. The design methodology of energy-efficient
    IoT devices is explored in [108]. For energy harvesting, it is necessary to have
    a clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT devices.
    The framework involves the generation process (source, transducer, and converter),
    storage mechanism, and managing the supply of harvested energy. The proposed mapping
    of EH-IoT and design framework are shown in Fig. 5. It will help the researchers
    and practitioners to build a system for a specific use case. Next, we discuss
    the different interfaces of Fig. 5 one by one. Download : Download high-res image

    interfaces, BW refers to bandwidth. 4.1. EH sources WSN is the fundamental building
    block of IoT. Moreover, considering the duty cycle, the battery life of WSN is
    lessened to just a few days as nodes remain active most of the time. Hence, battery
    life plays a significant role in overall energy consumption. Energy harvesting
    sources can be categorized into external and ambient. Further categorization and
    examples of these sources are shown in Fig. 6. The ambient sources are accessible
    within the surrounding region of energy harvesting objects. These sources can
    either be static or dynamic in nature [21]. A static source provides a predictable
    energy level, while a dynamic source generates energy randomly or periodically.
    The external sources emit energy to the nearby surroundings, such that the devices
    can harvest from this emission. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download

    Light The photovoltaic (PV) effect is the standard method of extracting electrical
    energy from light sources. Based on the composition, PV cells are of the following
    type [91]: • Mono-crystalline: It offers 15%–24% efficiency, however, it is quite
    costly. • Poly-crystalline: This cell offers 14%–20.4% efficiency, and it is less
    costly as compared to the mono-crystalline one. • Thin-film: It is the cheapest
    cell and can absorb low-intensity light. However, it is less efficient 8%–13.2%.
    PV cells are commonly known as solar cells. Light energy can be harvested in the
    following IoT applications: environment monitoring, smart homes, and commercial
    buildings. There has been considerable research effort to power IoT networks using
    light energy in remote locations. The author in [109] employed an eco-sensing
    method that offers a wide range of light energy harvesting technology. It also
    shows that nodes in an IoT network react more to light energy than other sources,
    thus making the system highly efficient. To power a beacon node, the design methodology
    of a light-harvesting device is introduced in [110]. Similarly, in [111], a light-harvesting
    circuit has been proposed to provide sufficient power to the Bluetooth low-energy
    node. Although the aforementioned IoT network has good scope in terms of application,
    it cannot support an achievable information rate with high efficiency. In [112],
    a power controller is developed for a current-deprived voltage control oscillator
    (VCO). This controller generates a power of W, for a solar irradiance of lx. Light
    energy is stochastic and intermittent, which is very difficult to predict. So
    maintaining a continuous power flow using light energy requires adopting specific
    mechanisms or principles. The feedback principle is commonly employed in [112]
    to ensure a continuous power flow. For example, in [113], the authors achieved
    a continuous power flow with controlled voltage or current. An analytical connectivity
    model, a zero-energy IoT system, is proposed in [114], where the networking elements
    are solar-powered. Typically, at 25 °C ambient temperature, the solar panel can
    harvest about power. A solar panel has 15% conversion efficiency and converts
    the harvested power into 15 mW/cm2 power [115]. Only 70% of the harvested power
    is consumed at the PWM circuit’s output. The remaining harvested power leaks into
    the atmosphere. A cluster-based algorithm is proposed in [107], which enhances
    the utilization of harvested energy. Moreover, the different light intensity in
    indoor and outside environments results in different amount of harvested energy.
    The efficiency of harvested light in the indoor environment is of the one produced
    in the outdoor environment. Several authors have presented analytical and experimental
    models considering light harvesting for indoor and outdoor environments. A novel
    framework that generates power using PV cells is presented for the indoor environment
    in [116]. For indoor settings, [117] reported W power using an artificial source
    of light energy at different intensities. An EH framework for smart building using
    PV is developed in [24] that generates V output voltage with mA pulse current
    in an indoor environment. Apart from this, the authors in [118] proposed an energy
    estimation algorithm to analyze the random behavior of light intensity in the
    indoor environment. It generates a high-efficient end node harvesting device that
    produces 0.8% error while predicting energy availability in one day. Authors in
    [119] compared wireless power transfer (WPT) and solar energy sources. Interestingly,
    the authors proposed a hybrid source that combines the merits of the aforementioned
    sources. 4.1.2. Thermal Unlike solar energy, thermal energy is available indoors
    and outdoors. Thermal energy can be collected by an electrical and mechanical
    source and converted into consumable electrical energy. The heat from various
    sources, including sunlight, engine exhaustion, indoor temperature, temperature
    difference, and even body heat, can be counted as a source. The generation method
    is cost-effective and efficient as it generates electricity from the abovementioned
    sources. However, the energy produced using thermal sources needs better energy
    conversion efficiency [90]. It can be made possible using different harvesters,
    such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), biochip, nanomaterial, and cloth-printed
    harvesters, which are commercially available. Thermoelectric (TE) and pyroelectric
    (PE) methods are the most widely used thermal harvesters. For a thermoelectric
    generator, an -type junction is used. This junction is connected to the heating
    material. Aluminum oxide and silicon wafers [120] are the most widely used heating
    materials because of their high conductivity and low coefficient of thermal expansion.
    The transmission of carriers across the junction produces the necessary potential
    difference and is sent to the voltage controller and converter. The voltage thus
    obtained can be increased using a large number of junctions between heating materials.
    Finally, the increased DC voltage can be transmitted wirelessly to one or more
    IoT sensors. On the other hand, the pyroelectric solution uses a special crystal
    material that generates considerable energy under temperature fluctuation in the
    environment. The design of the thermal transducer is not simply restricted to
    the approaches of TE and PE. However, as with many other thermal harvesters, other
    proposed transducers are described in Table 6. Table 6. Comparison of different
    thermal transducers. Harvesting technology Characteristics Average power/efficiency

    the increasing energy demand of IoT networks, energy harvesting through RF signals
    (RF-EH) evolved as an alternative technique that offers reduced operational cost
    and attains a sustainable framework. Instead of using conventional energy sources
    (power grid), RF signals are employed to recharge the batteries of IoT devices.
    Typically, ambient EM sources like cellular, microwave, and infrared (IR) radiation
    harvest the RF energy using high-gain antennas. The harvested energy is processed,
    rectified, and stored for future use. Rectenna, voltage multiplier, and storage-control
    interfaces are the building blocks of an RF-EH module. The rectenna block consists
    of a dipole or a patch antenna, along with a rectifier (Schottky diodes) that
    performs AC-DC conversion. A reconfigurable rectifier integrated with double-stage
    controlled maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is proposed in [127] to have a
    highly efficient energy harvesting node at dB. The peak power conversion efficiency
    can be written as (1) where is the DC power at output of rectifier and is the
    harvested rectifier’s power at the input. An optimal dual-stage RF-EH circuit
    is fabricated in [128]. The work in [129] discusses an ambient ultrahigh-frequency
    (UHF) enabled energy harvesting technique. The energy density of RF-EH is very
    low in comparison to other sources, as investigated in [128], [129]. Hence a voltage
    multiplier is utilized for further enhancing the voltage level [130]. The storage
    and control interface is responsible for the persistent power flow to the endpoint
    devices [131]. Several RF harvesters are classified according to their efficiencies
    and are studied in [132]. In [133], the authors reported energy harvesting strategies
    using single and multiple sources. There has been considerable research on low
    power transfer to IoT end users in the past few years, specifically where replenishment
    of batteries is difficult [134]. With a focus on WPT, some recent literature enhanced
    performance and optimized design parameters to increase the energy efficiency
    of the harvested node [135], [136]. However, the WPT mechanism requires a fixed
    charging point, and there is a limit on power density as well. Recently, the utilization
    of RF signals to deliver energy and convey information signals has received considerable
    research attention. This technique is referred to as simultaneous wireless power
    and information transfer (SWIPT). The authors in [137], [138], [139] discussed
    resource allocation and performance analysis of different SWIPT-aided systems.
    Moreover, the authors in [140] discussed the time division strategy for power
    and information transfer (see Table 7). Table 7. Comparison of different RF transducers.

    networks, IoT has incorporated several sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, communication
    devices, and so on. These devices mostly remain operational, resulting in limited
    battery life for a few days. Therefore, batteries play a significant part in ensuring
    sustainability in smart applications. However, most of the harvested energy is
    wasted due to the losses in the circuits or not managing it properly. As a result,
    not all the harvested energy is stored in the batteries. It can be prevented by
    keeping track of the energy from the harvesting stage to the storage stage. In
    this context, authors in [145] employed various methods to disseminate the significance
    of energy trackers in energy harvesting systems. Some researchers focused on detecting
    the sun’s motion to improve the efficiency of harvested energy. In contrast, the
    authors of [146] presented an animal tracking-based thermal harvesting system
    based on the temperature differential between the animal’s body and the immediate
    surroundings. This survey paper focused on tracking the harvesting energy after
    the transducers stage so that the energy flow to the storage interface is efficiently
    managed. Some of the existing available energy trackers are depicted in Table
    8. 4.2.1. Solar charger controller The overall output voltage of the solar panel
    is typically quite low. As a result, researchers have proposed different charge
    control mechanisms to achieve an efficient harvesting framework, such as Pulse
    width modulation (PWM) and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) [152]. PWM controller
    can handle the flow of current from the solar panel with reduced efficiency due
    to the discontinuity in the harvested energy. It is frequently used for low-powered
    devices [153]. As a result, it can contribute to the sustainability of IoT devices
    with lower efficiency. On the other hand, MPPT has been identified as a charge
    controller circuit that optimally manages the harvested energy from solar panels
    to storage interfaces efficiently. It tracks voltage and maximum power using the
    most commonly used perturbation and observation (P&O) algorithm. In [154], the
    harvested energy is provided to a boost converter (DC-DC) using MPPT to improve
    the conversion efficiency. The authors obtained an analytical model for a harvester
    in [155] using MPPT and achieved 96% efficiency. A novel wearable fitness monitoring
    device powered by solar cells is developed in [156]. The harvesting efficiency
    of the system ( ) is computed as (2) where , are the efficiency of the conversion
    interface and MPPT respectively. Table 8. Comparison of different energy tracker

    4.2.2. Rectifier/voltage multiplier topology It has been noticed that RF energy
    received from ambient sources needs a better power density to make the IoT device
    sustainable. As a result, power converters or amplifier circuits are required
    to drive the low-powered DC load. It can be made feasible by incorporating the
    rectifiers with capacitors and diodes to form the multi-stage voltage multipliers
    circuits. So that voltage gain can be increased at the output of the RF energy
    harvester. In [157], authors designed multi-stage circuits such as Dickson and
    Cockcroft–Walton voltage multipliers to obtain high-voltage at the output. These
    circuits mainly act as energy trackers or DC-DC converters to enhance the harvested
    voltage at the output. In this way, RF energy is properly managed from the transmitter
    end to the storage interface. 4.3. Storage interface This is a part of the power
    management system. After energy is harvested, it needs to be utilized at the end
    node application with the help of storage interface device. A number of storage
    interfaces are available, however, we list out only the most commonly used ones
    as follows. 4.3.1. Rechargeable batteries This type of battery contains a large
    number of capacitors and has high energy density. However, it is hardly used for
    storage as it has a low depth-of-discharge (DoD) rating. Moreover, there are numerous
    ways to select a battery for a self-sustainable IoT network, such as battery life
    expectancy, the necessity for rapid charging cycles, size, and weight, which are
    the most crucial factors influencing the decision [158]. Although rechargeable
    batteries/secondary batteries have less capacity and temperature stability than
    primary batteries, they do not require periodic maintenance and replacement at
    complete discharge. The most popular battery for EH-IoT is lithium-ion. Depending
    on the operating cycle, the total efficiency of battery storage ranges from 60%
    to 80%. These batteries do not operate well in low temperatures due to increased
    internal resistance, resulting in a self-discharge [159]. However, there are Alkaline
    MnO batteries available with a low self-discharge rate [160]. These batteries
    are used in the IoT applications, such as IoT monitoring applications that require
    data monitoring even for smaller intervals of time with high precision (smart
    healthcare, smart home, and smart industries) at a higher cost. Apart from this,
    Lead-Acid batteries are used in IoT applications that require data monitoring
    with larger sampling intervals and are mainly used in environmental monitoring
    applications. These batteries are inexpensive, highly reliable, and efficient,
    with limited cycle capacity and poor performance under adverse circumstances [161].
    4.3.2. Super-capacitors These are high-energy-density batteries with high DoD
    ratings. Supercapacitor discharges on its own, hence it cannot store energy for
    a longer duration [162]. Several studies revealed that the self-discharging nature
    of the supercapacitors is due to leakage and fast charging and can be compensated
    by charging it over a longer period of time [163]. The severity of the self-discharging
    problem is not only determined by the device capacity but also differs among manufacturers
    and even among specific production batches. This results from variations in the
    materials used, the manufacturing process, and production irregularities. As a
    result, selecting a reliable supercapacitor for appropriate IoT applications is
    still a significant issue [164]. It is mostly employed in applications requiring
    a power source with a shorter charging time and a wider operational temperature
    range and lacks involvement of toxic heavy metals, such as smart healthcare, smart
    irrigation, and smart agriculture. 4.3.3. Recent advancement in energy storage
    batteries The development of hybrid storage devices and novel materials enables
    a breakthrough in advancing energy storage interfaces. In [165], a hybrid storage
    system that increases operational duration is developed by integrating rechargeable
    batteries with supercapacitors. A unique ionic liquid combination is employed
    as an electrolyte for supercapacitor applications to enable IoT applications that
    demand a large working temperature range (60 to 80 ) and a low charging/discharging
    rate [166]. In addition, several IoT applications (smart factories, smart automobiles,
    etc.) need a high voltage than a large working temperature and life span. So,
    asymmetric capacitors were developed by fusing several conducting polymers (ECPs),
    amorphous manganese dioxide (a-MnO ), and activated carbon. These capacitors offer
    two times the power of conventional supercapacitors [167]. Additionally, the storage
    capacity of supercapacitors and sodium-ion batteries is increased by using graphene-based
    materials [168]. Furthermore, the energy density and safety of rechargeable batteries
    are improved by using Lithium-ion batteries with solid-state electrolytes at a
    higher cost. However, some IoT applications require high capacity, high voltage,
    and low cost. To achieve this, authors in [169] develop carbon monoxide-free layered
    cathode material. Apart from this, different types of inorganic materials such
    as lithium-polymer [170], lithium nitride [171], perovskite [172], and sulfide
    [173] have used in solid-state batteries to extend the lifetime of the storage
    interface. 5. The energy saving and resource constrained optimizers for sustainable
    IoT operations Trillions of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and communication
    interfaces will be deployed in the atmosphere during the emerging IoT era. Such
    interfaces will be using power from energy harvesting sources via storage interfaces
    and energy trackers. So, once the energy is harvested and stored efficiently with
    the help of energy trackers, it needs to be used properly at IoT device to keep
    it sustainable for ubiquitous operations. The energy stored for sustainable IoT
    devices can be utilized effectively by energy-saving or resource-optimizer protocols.
    Energy saving and resource optimization in EH-IoT is a primary concern because
    it incorporates a large number of resource-constrained devices that come with
    diverse QoS requirements. Moreover, different researchers have designed different
    decision-making topologies, algorithms, standards, and conceptual designs for
    the optimal use of harvested and stored energy [174]. Here, we will discuss the
    current research trends and challenges associated with decision-making tasks in
    this process flow. 5.1. Optimizing device power Devices play a crucial role in
    managing the power of IoT networks. Depending on the flow of data, a typical node
    in an IoT network is of two types i.e., the source and the sink. IoT combines
    different sources and sinks that can communicate without human intervention [175].
    For example, when the source and sink devices are connected via an RF chain, the
    transmit power of the RF network should be minimized [176], [177], [178]. In addition,
    if the connectivity between the source and sink fails, the data packets are lost.
    Retransmission of the same packet consumes a considerable amount of power. Cognitive
    radio (CR) can overcome these challenges [113], [177]. This technology monitors
    the wireless spectrum and identifies the holes (unoccupied channels). Design and
    optimization of a CR-assisted framework that ensures spectrum efficiency can be
    found in [113], [178]. Joint optimization of computational tasks and the energy
    transfer parameters employed with the design objective of increasing the network
    lifetime is discussed in [179]. To adjust the device’s duty cycle and dynamic
    transmission power, an opportunistic routing policy is proposed in [180]. 5.2.
    Data optimization Research articles show that SANET, along with optimized data
    processors, would drive the next-generation technology in the renewable energy
    sector to make the existing technologies sustainable [181]. Data optimization
    is the most crucial aspect of the energy-saving process since the consolidated
    data requires a smaller setup for management. To optimize data rate and data collection
    in cognitive radio and D2D communication, different modulation and coding schemes
    are studied in [182], [183], [184]. This ensures energy-efficient communication
    from the data aggregator to other nodes. Instead of transmitting the original
    data, only the compressed data is communicated. Hadoop is another data-management
    framework that allows decentralized storage and processing of data at the bit
    level. This framework consists of clusters of systems utilizing simpler algorithms.
    Moreover, several authors have explored the compressive sensing method to analyze
    performance metrics, e.g., EE, security, reliability, etc. [185], [186]. These
    works explain how the data at the receiving end is extracted from the compressed
    data. Clustering is another method to efficiently transmit consolidated data to
    the central server [187]. There are many research studies where authors have discussed
    the clustering method for various sensors [188]. In [189], the authors have shown
    how to capture remote data using a battery-driven wireless IoT. IoT systems clock
    and log data are coordinated using network time protocol (NTP) and data logger,
    respectively. The authors in [189] has provided a statistical model to predict
    the battery’s charging and discharging rate and analyze energy consumption at
    IoT nodes. The average current is obtained as follows (3) where , denote the instantaneous
    current and the number of data samples received through the entire time slot.
    Battery life, , can be subsequently calculated as (4) where denotes the battery
    capacity. 5.3. Time constrained power optimization In order to optimize power,
    time constraints play a vital role in the synchronization process, sleep mode,
    standby, and idle state of the sensing node. While the sensor is not in use, turning
    it off is better to save power. To manage energy, different time limits are set
    for different methods, namely, sleep timing, traffic monitoring [190], and appropriate
    duty cycle. In [191], [192], devices are put in sleep mode after completing their
    tasks, as sleep mode consumes negligible power. MAC duty cycling is another strategy
    that puts the device into idle mode until the next process cycle begins. This
    method is also energy efficient [193], [194]. 5.4. Trade-off among bandwidth,
    range and power consumption A typical IoT network must consider trade-offs on
    energy usage, bandwidth, and coverage area. The design objectives are to maximize
    the coverage area, minimize transmit power and improve the bandwidth [195]. A
    long-range (1.8 km), multi-hop, and self-powered IoT framework is proposed in
    [196] to be applied in agriculture. The network delivers an average power consumption
    of W at a -min interval for a sensor node [197]. In another work, Bluetooth is
    used to achieve long-range support, and the framework is built on BQ25570 IC.
    It has the following applications, e.g. battery charging and voltage conditioning
    [198]. 5.5. Standardization for EH-IoT This standardization is crucial for achieving
    interoperability and compatibility among self-sustainable IoT devices. It will
    help in optimizing the IoT resources by ensuring that they all follow the same
    set of rules and protocols by eradicating external peripheral interfaces. So,
    to incorporate all the EH-IoT under one platform, the International electrotechnical
    commission (IEC) has laid out standards for testing and evaluating different types
    of transducer and wireless protocols for green energy solutions. Some are discussed
    below for energy harvesting transducers and self-sustainable IoT communication
    protocols. 5.5.1. EH transducer Leading standardization development organizations
    (SDOs) have made the efforts to standardize EH transducers [199]. These standards
    are discussed in Table 9. Table 9. EH-IoT transducers standardization. Transducer

    5.5.2. Wireless protocol The international organization for standardization (ISO)
    introduced standards for wireless networking protocols to improve interoperability.
    Interoperable wireless protocols for low-power devices are studied in [200], [201].
    Table 10 mentions some of the standards released by ISO and IEC. These EH-IoT
    devices conform to short-packet systems using amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency
    modulation (FM) for IoT operations as shown in Table 10. Table 10. Wireless EH-IoT

    Upon identifying the various sections (Section 1 to Section 5), it becomes apparent
    that different energy harvesting sources can power the IoT devices for various
    IoT applications as shown in Table 11. The introduction section has offered a
    brief discussion on IoT applications for readers with the scope of establishing
    the relation among IoT applications, devices and energy harvesting interfaces.
    In this section, we investigate the comprehensive discussion of the IoT applications
    based on the devices of different IoT layers and energy harvesting interfaces
    that can be utilized. • Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture plays a significant
    role in enhancing crop cultivation by incorporating different sensing and actuation
    interfaces, including temperature, humidity, chemicals, and many more. These sensors
    detect the physical changes in the surrounding environment of the crops, soils,
    flowers, and plants. Additionally, various chemical sensors are used to determine
    the potential of hydrogen (PH) level and nutrient properties of the soils to optimize
    agriculture practices. Some researchers also employed proximity and position sensors
    to detect the animals’ movement in the fields [203]. The sensing data also requires
    actuation actions, which are usually carried out by solenoid valves, DC pumps,
    AC pumps, and relays. These actuation actions can be taken remotely with the help
    of communications protocols that can be operated up to a longer distance, i.e.,
    LoRa, Cellular, and SigFox [221], [222]. All these devices require significant
    power for their operations to run smoothly. Among all the sources, various researchers
    identified light energy as the most viable source to generate a considerable amount
    of electricity to be used in smart agriculture practices [202]. • Smart city:
    The smart city is conceptualized as a network that incorporates many sensors,
    actuators, and communication devices. The utilization of the devices in smart
    city can vary significantly based on day-to-day requirements. In some scenarios,
    the focus of smartness may be ensuring safety during natural calamities and emergencies
    such as earthquakes, floods, or fires [223]. In other situations, proper management
    of parking, lighting, waste management, the smart grid, smart sanitation, and
    many more. So smart cities incorporate almost all ranges of sensors and actuators
    [202], [203], [224], as shown in Table 11. It also employs a wide range of communication
    protocols in most scenarios to exchange real-time data up to a distance of several
    kilometers (Kms). These communication modules and actuators require power. As
    a result, they are powered by solar energy by controlling the peak of electrical
    energy consumption in the hottest and coldest months [225]. On the other hand,
    sensors used in the indoor area of smart cities are powered by RF sources [226].
    • Smart environment: Weather conditions significantly influence numerous applications,
    including agriculture, irrigation, and traffic monitoring. These applications
    mainly incorporate sensors that can measure physical and chemical changes in the
    environment. The light, temperature, humidity, biomolecules, and rain sensors
    are utilized to detect physical changes in the surroundings, such as rainfall,
    forest fires, solar irradiance, and air pollution levels. Additionally, sensors
    such as motion, gyroscopes, and accelerometers are used in the early detection
    of catastrophes in smart environments [227], [228], [229]. These sensed values
    typically trigger relays to manage external actions and DC motors using PWM signals
    to control the speed of devices like fire-avoidance robots to avoid catastrophe.
    The smart environment mainly employs communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX,
    Cellular, and LoRa to exchange information in metropolitan and wide-area networks.
    The energy from light and thermal sources provides adequate power to the sensors
    and communication devices employed in smart environments [206], [208]. Additionally,
    RF sources are usually used to power the sensors in highly populated locations
    using radio frequency generators for the device’s ubiquitous operations in a smart
    environment to prevent disaster [207]. • Smart heath care: Smart health care,
    or the Internet of medical things, is the systematic implementation mode that
    links healthcare services to the IoT via various sensors, actuators, and acceptable
    communication protocols. Smart health care predominantly requires sensors such
    as heartbeat, biomolecular, chemical, and gyroscopes to monitor the physical and
    chemical changes in the human body, like heartbeat, muscle movement, blood pressure,
    hemoglobin content, oxygen level, and many more. On the other hand, the wearable
    sensors may also be mounted to the human’s skin or tied to the clothes, which
    work by reading the values with RF signals. If sensor readings fall below safe
    limits or a person’s health enters a critical state, the nearby hospital authority
    is alerted using short-range communication protocols such as Bluetooth, BLE, and
    Zigbee [209], [210]. It is also notified at a longer distance using Cellular communication
    protocols [230]. Additional actuators, such as buzzers, also alert the individual
    to take precautions. This application mainly relies on short-range network communication
    protocols that operate by harvesting the energy from radio frequency [231], which
    usually has low bandwidth and does not harm the human body. • Smart Industry:
    The idea of IoT has rapidly developed in the industrial sector over recent years
    to revolutionize it with Industry 4.0. Its presence is in almost all business,
    private, and government sectors, like smart schools, hospitals, shopping complexes,
    grids, offices, and retail outlets [211]. Due to the vast amount of IoT applications
    in smart industries, there is no limit to incorporating the sensing, actuation,
    and communication modules as shown in Table 11. It involves various sensors and
    actuators that can help monitor and automate the decision-making process, leading
    to more efficient, faster, and cost-effective production. Moreover, it incorporates
    short-range (BLE 5.0, Zigbee, RFID, Z-wave WiFi, and Zigbee) and wide-range communication
    devices (LoRa, SigFox, and Cellular) to provide interoperability within and between
    the different sectors by enabling smooth operations [212]. In order to power this
    extensive set of devices, all feasible energy sources are utilized to provide
    uninterrupted power to various devices at different layers. Solar, thermal, and
    electromagnetic (EM) sources are the most commonly employed sources in the industry.
    Authors in [232], [233] designed self-powered sensors using a thermally conductive
    pyroelectric block for industrial applications. Additionally, authors in [234],
    [235] have employed EM and solar sources to power the IoT devices used in the
    industry. Finally, authors in [236] focused on providing low power to the IoT
    devices in various industrial sectors using a microstrip patch antenna to regulate
    the operations of different IoT devices using the energy emitted by the mobile
    base station and the WiFi transmitter. • Smart Security: In recent years, there
    has been a sudden exponential growth of security systems in our daily lives. These
    systems typically involve various sensors, such as an accelerometer, proximity,
    gyroscope, and infrared (IR) sensors, that can detect the presence of any unauthorized
    individual. It also employs other sensors that may detect chemical changes, such
    as harmful gas emissions, radiation levels increase, and leakages of deadly substances
    in the nearby region [237]. Based on these sensors, actuators such as a buzzer,
    pneumatic cylinders, and relays are most commonly employed to turn off the door
    and produce alarm sounds in case of a security breach. These applications necessitate
    using both short-range and long-range communications protocols for monitoring
    from remote locations and having connections among the devices with short-range
    communication devices. For seamless functionality in a smart security system,
    authors in [238] implemented a solar energy harvesting unit in a -storey building
    to detect the presence of any unauthorized individual. Apart from this, the authors
    in [239] implemented an RF energy harvesting source to establish the connection
    among the sensors using short-range communications protocols to detect the presence
    of any harmful gases in the surroundings. • Smart transport: In recent times,
    advancements in communication modules and several devices at different IoT layers
    have significantly enhanced transportation, which aims to improve driver safety,
    reduce traffic congestion, etc. These advancements incorporate motion sensors,
    gyroscopes, infrared sensors, GPS, and camera sensors to monitor the location
    and behaviors of drivers and passengers [215]. In addition, continuous monitoring
    is ensured through the use of temperature, pressure, and oxygen sensors within
    the vehicle to safeguard the driver. In order to enhance the comfortable experience
    of the driver, hydraulic actuators are utilized in various parts of the vehicles.
    Moreover, the pneumatic cylinder in vehicles using the devices may avoid injuries
    in accidents or mishaps. The increasing number of vehicles on the road poses a
    collision risk, which mandates the requirement of communication devices among
    vehicles. It incorporates all long-range communication protocols to identify the
    traffic pattern on the road within certain distances. Moreover, it also incorporates
    BLE, Bluetooth, and Zigbee to establish communication among the different devices
    inside the vehicle [216]. Power management in smart transportation is still a
    significant issue for many researchers due to continuous battery replacement and
    fuel consumption. To address this, authors in [217] integrate the piezoelectric
    device into the tires of the vehicles, through which driving-induced mechanical
    energy is converted to electric energy. Apart from this, several studies [240],
    [241], [242] also focused on incorporating power into smart vehicles using the
    highly efficient solar cell module to increase the power supply by up to 30%.
    7. Future scope Considering the self-sustainable IoT device based on the layers
    architecture design for smart applications, we have emphasized the layer-wise
    issues of implementing sustainability. It is employed in sensing, actuation, processing,
    and a transmission interface by utilizing energy sources, energy transducers,
    energy management, energy tracking, energy storage, and energy optimizers. Based
    on that, we have outlined the potential areas for further study in developing
    self-sustaining IoT systems. 7.1. Sustainable smart network With the rapid deployment
    of IoT nodes, the data generated by such nodes are also anticipated to grow manifold.
    These data operations necessitated external hardware assistance for storage, which
    will be an expense for power and outlay. This extraneous requirement will pose
    a threat to sustainable IoT operations due to the increase in power consumption.
    Moreover, traditional data collection and processing techniques might fail to
    handle, analyze and extract information at that scale for a long time with a fixed
    energy storage device. Additional energy harvesting devices and storage interfaces
    must be included in the existing EH-IoT system design to address this issue. Further,
    different IoT devices generate heterogeneous data, which is difficult to be processed
    using an existing processing interface. An intelligent IoT network works on the
    premise of learning from the pattern of past data and predicting data for future
    instances. Thus the system’s performance can be enhanced through better detection
    accuracy [243], [244]. Thus the cost of a storage interface and communication
    resources can be minimized by limiting the number of re-transmissions. However,
    machine algorithms to classify problems related to self-sustainable IoT devices
    are still in their infancy [245] to connect it to layered architecture design,
    and significant research scope exists in this area. In a large-scale self-sustainable
    IoT network, how to analyze collected data through deep learning techniques to
    obtain design insights is an emerging field. 7.2. Secure energy harvesting design
    A self-sustainable IoT device needs to collect energy from different available
    sources in close proximity for ubiquitous operations. However, this energy harvesting
    task can raise security concerns as attackers can produce unnecessary radiation
    as the malware energy in the processing system when extracting power from the
    RF source. So malware exposed to electricity generation data from unwanted radiation
    may cause significant privacy issues for users. It may sometimes damage the energy
    storage interface without proper protection. On the other hand, if an intruder
    knows the system’s harvesting pattern, it might launch different types of attacks
    at the user-end, namely, time synchronization, replay, dynamic data injections,
    brute force attack, man in middle attack or can generate unwanted signals. On
    the other hand, communication among IoT devices may also raise privacy concerns
    for users. Extensive sensitive data is stored, processed, and transmitted by sustainable
    IoT nodes powered by the energy storage interface. If this harvested energy is
    continuously used to transmit information vulnerable to replay and denial of service
    attacks, the stored energy will drain more quickly. Although technologies like
    Physical layer security (PLS) and Blockchain [246], [247] are integrated with
    SWIPT to form an IoT-based cooperative energy harvesting network, the issue of
    energy outages still needs to be addressed effectively. 7.3. Trade-off among energy
    consumption, bandwidth and coverage area Certain IoT communication modules like
    LoRa, WiFi, SigFox, and cellular devices can communicate with each other at a
    long distance. Managing power for such long-distance IoT communication devices
    is crucial in EH. However, the process of storing harvested energy for a longer
    time duration is a challenge in itself. Hence providing the required energy to
    the module to cover a wide area while maintaining low power consumption is difficult.
    A decrease in bandwidth leads to a decrease in the data rate. Efficient power
    management involving a the trade-off among energy consumption, bandwidth, and
    coverage area poses a design challenge. 7.4. Energy supply design for sporadic
    source and hazardous material During the daytime, the solar power supply works
    effectively. However, it is not the case at night. Solar supply uses PV cells
    to convert light into energy. Nonetheless, solar supply requires more space. Energy-intensive
    devices like laptops and smart electric cars consume more power to perform for
    a long duration. Nevertheless, small-scale PVs play a significant role in calculators,
    watches, and small devices. A typical example is the monitoring and identifying
    faults in the power distribution system using solar panels [248]. Furthermore,
    solar irradiance is stochastic in nature, with seasonal and temporal variations.
    As a result, depending only on solar energy harvesting for self-sustaining IoT
    system design may result in energy outages, where energy harvested by the solar
    panel will be less than the energy consumed by IoT devices. On the other hand,
    EH can be achieved using an RF field with a certain signal frequency. The potential
    safety threats must be considered in case more RF fields are used. So it is challenging
    to design efficient PV cells and maintain a safe level of exposure to RF intensities.
    7.5. Storage unit 7.5.1. Data storage While designing the system for a specific
    IoT application, the main challenge lies in cleaning, processing, and interpreting
    the massive data collected by the sensors. Storing bulky data is another challenge.
    Depending on the self-sustainable IoT application, an extensive data acquisition
    system might be needed, which calls for a storage unit with a large capacity.
    The storage data of the IoT sensor for smart weather monitoring, intelligent transportation
    system, and many other smart applications require data to be sensed at small sampling
    intervals. When data is sensed continuously for a longer period of time with smaller
    sample intervals, a more significant amount of energy and storage is required.
    Some researchers have used big data storage systems as an enabling architecture.
    However, the problem of storing and sensing data over a longer period of time
    with a small sampling interval still needs to be addressed. 7.5.2. Power storage
    Due to the rapid charge or discharge cycles, a rechargeable battery is insufficient
    for energy storage. Also, a rechargeable battery is made up of a large number
    of capacitors, which occupies space. For example, a nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery
    has got higher energy capacity but a fast discharge rate. On the other hand, lithium-ion
    and nickel metal hybrid batteries come with higher energy density and a lower
    discharge rate. However, due to their highly combustible nature, they do not provide
    a viable choice for IoT applications. Solid-state batteries come with a minimum
    rate of self-discharge and are eco-friendly. However, their use in IoT could be
    improved, as they come at a high price. Since super-capacitors have a large energy
    capacity, they may be considered as one of the alternative possibilities for EH-IoT.
    However, because of its auto-draining rate, it is not an ideal fit for EH-IoT
    applications. A low-cost battery with a high energy consumption volume and low
    discharge rate poses a design challenge. Different storage units are outlined
    in Section 4.3. 7.6. Hardware assistance Hardware design in self-sustainable IoT
    devices needs to cope with many issues. The power harvested from the surrounding
    is often intermittent. This leads to heavy fluctuation in current at IoT node.
    Hence, small-sized hardware that yields stable performance for a wide range of
    power is required at the energy harvesting stage. The harvesting stage includes
    transducers, MPPT, DC-DC converters, AC-DC converters, and supercapacitors. Arranging
    all such components with sensors, actuators, and communication devices will result
    in a highly dense circuit. How many bulky circuits can coexist with nanomaterials
    poses a relevant research question. 7.7. Network congestion in EH-IoT network
    Previously data sensed by IoT devices were used to store in the cloud. Several
    IoT devices or platforms use the same cloud platform for data storage. However,
    accessing the required data from vast aggregated data available on the cloud takes
    time and effort. In case different IoT devices wish to access data from the same
    cloud simultaneously, it will increase incoming traffic in the network. Recently
    in [249], edge computing is proposed to optimize energy efficiency for medical
    devices using their inactive mode. Edge computing networks are dense and highly
    congested. In this technique, firstly, data is transferred to a storage unit near
    IoT device. After sorting and analyzing data, the local storage unit transfers
    some of the data to the cloud. Thus reducing both latencies and network congestion
    in this process at the cost of increased power consumption due to the dense network.
    As a result, the tradeoff between dense storage network deployment and power consumption
    in a sustainable IoT system still needs to be addressed. 8. Conclusion IoT is
    an effective solution to our day-to-day problems that open up numerous new opportunities
    worldwide. This is an interesting phenomenon in networking devices, where the
    reach of device connectivity increases every year. IoT incorporates billions of
    sensors, actuators, and communication devices in various IoT applications. This
    paper addresses several IoT applications and clarifies the necessitates of IoT
    devices, in particular smart applications. It is accomplished by incorporating
    five different interfaces such as sensing interface, energy harvesting interface,
    storage interface, microcontroller interface, and wireless interface. It focuses
    on bridging the gap between IoT application and IoT system design centered on
    layered architecture design. Besides, the study of various types of sensors, actuators,
    and communication protocols, this paper also discusses the various types of energy
    harvesting techniques to make the self-sustainable IoT system design. The primary
    task of EH-IoT is to guarantee smooth functioning using an uncontrolled and unpredicted
    power supply. This paper also investigates the comparison among the different
    layers architecture design of self-sustainable IoT device. While reviewing the
    different research articles, we also examined the effect of the stochastic source
    on the memory interface. This work is concluded with the potential research problems
    that will enable researchers to build a new paradigm for self-sustainable IoT
    system design. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they
    have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) 1. Introduction Nowadays, several municipalities
    implement the smart city model [1] to improve the quality of life for their citizens
    and the efficient use of city resources. Intelligent services can decrease operational
    costs and resource expenditure in smart cities. They can enhance performance and
    operations in a wide variety of smart city applications (SCAs) including transportation,
    healthcare, energy, education, and many more. Smart services are provided by various
    cutting-edge technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples of these technologies
    include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data analytics,
    and robots. IoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful
    human life benefits [2]. IoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart
    things into urban environments where innovative services are offered to support
    every activity at any time and from any location [2]. Things are monitored by
    IoT applications that make direct decisions for their efficient management. Moreover,
    things state their conditions, such as battery status and fault reporting for
    prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state of the infrastructure
    and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices can also obtain physical
    environment information such as temperature. In a CPS, the computation, networking,
    and physical processes are put together to control and monitor the physical environment
    of a smart city [4]. In smart cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical connections
    between the virtual and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can be
    sustained by the ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform
    for computation and IoT data storage [5]. FogC offers reduced latency, greater
    mobility, location awareness, streaming, and real-time response for SCAs [6].
    Smart cities have dispersed vast numbers of sensors, and thus large-scale data
    processing requires a complex infrastructure. Robotics in the cloud can be an
    effective computing tool for IoT applications that require a lot of data processing
    [7]. To improve the services offered by smart cities, big data analytics is employed
    to generate intelligent and optimal temporary and lasting decisions [8]. The abovementioned
    technologies are used to implement numerous smart city services [9,10]. For instance,
    intelligent transportation services are applied to improve route planning and
    avoid jamming in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety and
    make possible self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart traffic
    light controls are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy
    management and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids
    and smart buildings. These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable
    energy. Additional smart services are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges,
    tunnels, water networks, train and subway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural
    health monitoring is also feasible using smart services [11]. Last but not least,
    there are smart services that focus on monitoring the environment, public safety,
    and security of citizens [12]. All these smart city services necessitate a reliable
    networking infrastructure to efficiently exchange messages between the modules
    of a smart city system implementing a particular smart service. In particular,
    smart city services need a variety of networking and communication technologies
    for their completion because they are proposed for dissimilar scales. For example,
    smart services for smart buildings must be implemented based on Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
    or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols. On the other hand, smart services
    for the smart grid must be mainly implemented using the WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) network
    protocol. From another viewpoint, smart city services can exploit dissimilar network
    and communication models and solutions. Until now, the networking and communication
    components of smart city systems have received little research attention. To the
    best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey of network architectures and protocols
    for IoT applications in smart cities does not exist and is the goal of this study.
    The communication and networking issues involved in smart city systems are examined
    in this study. This paper considers networking technologies, topologies, and communication
    requirements for such systems. It also examines if current network protocols are
    appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent developments
    in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active area, this paper
    is important to support new research in this field. The paper contributes as follows:
    It presents network requirements of the major SCAs including intelligent transportation,
    smart buildings, pipeline monitoring and control, smart water networks, smart
    grids, and manufacturing control and monitoring. It reviews networking architectures
    used for the above applications focusing mainly on the protocols’ suitability.
    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;
    Section 3 presents network requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;
    Section 4 and Section 5 analyze protocols and network architectures for smart
    grids, smart buildings, smart water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart
    transportation; Section 6 summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open
    research directions; lastly, Section 8 concludes the paper. Figure 1 provides
    the layout of the survey. Figure 1. The layout of the survey paper. Systematic
    Literature Review Article Selection Method: We provide a Systematic Literature
    Review (SLR) methodology [13] with particular notice to studies related to networking
    architectures or protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. The SLR was employed
    to systematically study networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications
    in smart cities. We proposed a research question to cope with the key issues of
    networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. Question
    Formalization: Key issues and challenges in the field were identified. Such issues
    were network architectures for IoT, network protocols for IoT, IoT applications
    for smart cities, and smart city applications. This study answers the next research
    question: RQ: What is the emphasis of networking architectures or protocols for
    IoT applications in smart cities? This question determines the number of studies
    focusing on network architectures and protocols for IoT applications for smart
    cities that have been published to date to emphasize its significance in smart
    cities. Article Selection Process: The article selection process is performed
    in three stages: Automated keyword-based search; Selection of the article based
    on the title, abstract, and quality of the publication; Elimination of inappropriate
    articles. In the first stage, the search process is automatically performed using
    searching on popular academic databases such as IEEE explorer, ACM, Wiley, Springer,
    Science Direct, SAGE, and Google Scholar. The following search string was defined
    by adding other spellings of the main elements to find relevant articles. The
    search string was as follows: (“IoT” OR “Internet of Things”) AND (“network architecture”
    OR “network protocol” AND “smart cities” OR “smart rural” OR “smart village” OR
    “smart traffic” OR “smart transportation” OR “smart street lights” OR “smart energy”
    OR “smart grid” OR “smart buildings” OR “smart home” OR “smart residence” OR “home
    automation” OR “smart water” or “smart waste management” OR “smart healthcare”
    OR “smart rural” AND “Cloud Computing” OR “edge computing” OR “software-defined
    networking” OR “Artificial Intelligence”). We found 264 articles from journals,
    conference proceedings, books, and patents. These articles were published between
    2013 and 2023. In the article selection based on the quality of the publisher
    stage, the search string was constrained by searching for conference papers and
    journal articles of IEEE, ACM, Sage, Wiley, Science Direct, and Springer, in order
    to guarantee that only high-quality publications and articles were selected for
    the review. Consequently, 240 articles were selected. In the third stage of eliminating
    the inappropriate articles, a Quality Assessment Checklist (QAC) based on [13]
    was developed, wherein those articles emerging from the initial search were refined.
    After reading the abstracts, we eliminated the unrelated articles. The entire
    body of the remaining papers was checked, and those which were not related to
    our concerned field were also crossed out. After eliminating inappropriate articles,
    only 226 studies were identified. 2. Smart City Applications This section discusses
    the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what type of assistance is
    needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs, their advantages and
    design problems were addressed. In the energy sector, SCAs are being used to increase
    the reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of electric energy generation
    and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart grid is a new power grid system
    that automatically collects and reacts to available information about supplier
    and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply self-monitoring and superior
    control mechanisms for power generation and consumer demand, improving grid reliability
    and efficiency. CPS systems are also used to manage the process of producing renewable
    energy from wind turbines [15]. Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings
    to monitor and manage energy consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the
    buildings, including the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems;
    appliances; and lighting systems. Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep
    track of the current state of the environment and energy consumption, are typically
    included in smart building systems. A centralized monitoring and control system
    receives observations and measurements from these sensors. Based on reported observations,
    current operational circumstances, and environmental factors, the control system
    employs intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems employed in the buildings
    to optimize energy consumption. Intelligent transportation is another SCA that
    has attracted a lot of interest in the transportation sector. Applications related
    to vehicle safety are among the most crucial types of such applications. Vehicles
    can be equipped with a variety of safety features, such as blind spot monitoring,
    emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane change warning signs.
    To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-automatic operations.
    Real-time and reliability support in detection and response are these applications’
    most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing vehicle safety must be
    dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects such as threat observations,
    decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software cannot handle
    high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices and guarantee real-time
    and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial
    SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring
    equipment to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed
    data and intelligent software that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.
    Intelligent traffic light controls, which incorporate device monitoring across
    numerous locations to precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application
    of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent
    traffic lights. Water networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase
    their intelligence, efficiency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems
    are integrated into water networks to add smart characteristics to the processes
    of water distribution [19]. Offering early warning systems to identify problems
    in water networks is one of these duties. For instance, it is simple to identify
    leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary fixes can be implemented to prevent water
    wastage and future network threats or damage [20]. WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses
    is another SCA. Such monitoring provides well-organized control for appropriate
    soil, climate, lighting, and water level in greenhouses [21]. Other smart city
    systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control, monitor, and improve
    manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare systems based on edge
    computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine the physical health of users
    [25]. Figure 2 shows some important applications including smart traffic surveillance
    and management, smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste
    management, smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart
    home. Figure 2. Facilitating networking and communication amongst SCAs. Analysis
    of Smart City Applications/Systems This subsection analyses the SCAs shown in
    Figure 2. Smart Traffic Surveillance Systems: These systems are based on centralized
    processes and may fail due to networking problems. Thus, to automate such an innovative
    system, centralized and distributed methods must be used to maintain local servers.
    Javaid et al. [26] suggested a smart traffic management system using a mixture
    of centralized and decentralized processes to optimize the flow of vehicles on
    roads and an algorithm to manage a variety of traffic conditions efficiently.
    In the context of smart cities, effective traffic management implies that a decision-making
    model identifies and quantifies traffic congestion as well as predicts traffic
    patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered a theoretical analysis that takes into account
    such effective traffic management. Notably, existing decision-making models are
    primarily devoted to urban and highway traffic management, not considering the
    closed campuses and collector roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] identified this
    weakness and proposed an IoT-based system model that collects, processes, and
    stores real-time traffic data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based traffic
    management system, various challenges emerge. These challenges include security
    issues, extremely sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required
    adjustments, and specific information fields in the protocol header and structure,
    as well as higher costs. Smart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of
    health parameters, these systems are progressively being associated with and connected
    via the Internet to numerous types of available smart wearable sensing and computing
    devices. These systems face several problems [29] that must be resolved. A security/privacy
    perspective, inter-realm authentication, interoperability issues, device-to-device
    informal communication, and collection and management of medical data are among
    the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30] addressed issues related to cyber-security
    while using IoT for such applications. They sought to examine secure techniques’
    deployment and implementation from the perspective of preventing and reducing
    cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys and reviews [31,32] on smart
    healthcare applications tackle the problem of integrating IoT systems with any
    healthcare application particularly. Weather and Air Quality Monitoring Systems:
    These systems use environmental monitoring stations, which are extremely pricey
    to acquire and maintain. For example, these stations require engineers with specialized
    skill sets and data analysts. Therefore, it is impractical to deploy such monitoring
    stations densely. Instead, they are often deployed sparsely, which creates the
    problem of limited spatial resolutions for useful measurements. Lately, cheap
    monitoring sensors have evolved in the market, significantly assisting in refining
    the granularity of monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors
    [33] emphasized the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with
    air quality monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle
    with the issue of cross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.
    Moreover, these sensors are extremely susceptible to unexpected variations in
    humidity, temperature, and wind direction, and as a result, their accuracy deteriorates
    with time. A recalibration routine might be a way to maintain and enhance such
    accuracy. However, because it would take a lot more time and work, this technique
    is highly improbable and would not work for large-scale deployments. In a weather
    monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex and involves three steps [34]:
    (1) Observing: It can be performed by monitoring satellite imagery, precipitation
    reports, surface data, and gathering data from other nearby forecasters. (2) Forecasting:
    It can be performed by forecasters as short-term and long-term forecasting. Short-term
    forecasting is carried out by evaluating the current weather conditions and projecting
    them over the next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics of the weather.
    Long-term forecasting, however, is possible through weather (numerical) modeling
    and the projection of such modeling using computer simulations. To produce these
    simulations for future forecasting, these modeling techniques use environmental
    data from satellite photography, weather balloons, and surface observations. Following
    completion of the forecasting, the forecasters translate the produced simulated
    expected output into a perceptible format for non-specialists so that they can
    respond appropriately. (3) Communicating: Finally, they communicate such output
    or forecasted information to appropriate authorities. Despite the fact that all
    of these computer models are used to forecast the weather, the success of each
    one is largely influenced by three different elements: (a) the quantity of precise
    data; (b) the length of time needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity
    of dynamic atmospheric weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data
    for a region is the placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed
    distant from rural areas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather
    enough information for desert, sea, or even rural areas to supply the computer
    models used to predict weather conditions accurately. Forecasters also use satellite
    data to combat this issue. However, because of cloud cover and significant changes
    in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, satellite data accuracy can occasionally
    be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and map information or surface/land
    features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence, it further impacts temperature
    and precipitation values significantly. This further makes things harder for a
    computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there is a need to re-evaluate and
    re-modify such models’ mathematical equations so that they can predict the changes
    more accurately. Smart Waste Management Systems: Automated smart waste management
    is crucial for the following reasons: (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure;
    (2) thin or delicate waste collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective
    waste logistics management; (4) insufficient use of cutting-edge trash treatment
    and recycling technologies; and (5) lack of workers and specialists with the necessary
    technical and non-technical skills to handle garbage disposal and the associated
    infrastructures. Smart waste management schemes include various steps such as
    (1) waste collection; (2) differentiation of waste as per their biological and
    physical properties; (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage disposal
    infrastructures/treatment plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova
    and Porras [35] identified issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing
    data from smart deployed sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some
    operational issues such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure
    and smartly managing waste vehicle routes. Smart Street Lighting Systems: This
    system is a network-oriented solution that uses streetlights fitted with specific
    actuators and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities and connectivity interfaces
    [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a mechanism that
    gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting with
    the use of smart wireless nodes (fitted out with numerous forms of sensors and
    actuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the streetlights,
    and they are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device. Zanella et
    al. [37] insist that their system could assist in gathering environmental parameters
    such as humidity, air temperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors stated
    that optimizing street lighting efficiency is a paramount concern that must be
    addressed. This monitoring system makes it possible to maximize efficiency since
    it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity in response to the time of
    day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this system is simple and
    built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns that require
    particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions and communication
    among heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right light lamp is critical
    for a power-efficient lighting mechanism. Their selection is based on how effective
    they are in terms of power usage and lifespan. The existing metropolitan system
    relies on Metal Halide (MH) or High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs,
    these bulbs are frequently seen as being inefficient in terms of power consumption
    and requiring significant maintenance, which adds significantly to the cost. In
    addition, the system should be designed following the advised design standards
    (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201) [36]. Currently, there are
    three kinds of control systems for smart lighting systems in use: centralized,
    decentralized, and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a variety
    of security assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem
    thus far. Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and
    security of its residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention,
    dealing with natural calamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data
    collection is first and foremost important for the designing portion of these
    applications. Depending on the gathered facts, the development of intelligence
    (which aids in making important decisions) and the ability to respond swiftly
    and quickly are the issues that require special attention. When it comes to gathering
    data, we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated traffic sensors. A developer
    can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will conduct predictive
    analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore, this
    kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather significant information
    that will help the relevant authorities (e.g., the fire safety department, the
    police department, and law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and
    preventive measures. The concept of widespread surveillance has important benefits
    for security and safety. However, keeping track of such vast amounts of data also
    prompts a lot of worries and issues for designers and developers, including storage;
    the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and, most importantly, the question
    of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track of each individual
    (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether this kind of
    widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such as China and
    India, where a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation. Further, Gharaibeh
    et al. [38] claimed that combining information transmission technologies with
    well-implemented data analytics models is necessary for quick and swift collaboration.
    To save as many lives as possible during natural disasters, it is imperative to
    gather, assess, and communicate vital information to the relevant authorities.
    As a result, there is currently a lot of work being done to enhance the performance
    of information exchange systems. Although this system is based on the IoT concept
    and is relatively simple, it faces important problems that need consideration,
    such as complex networking solutions and information sharing across heterogeneous
    devices on time (time-sensitive application). Smart Residence/Home Automation:
    A smart home has highly developed systems such as a control system for devices
    or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems, TVs, and other smart appliances),
    automated door openers, smart appliances that may send users remote status updates,
    smart refrigerators, and washing machines. A user can control the majority of
    smart home appliances remotely with two recently produced gadgets: Google Home
    and Amazon Echo. In a smart home, the end-user demands a high-speed internet connection,
    so they can access networking sites that control the home with HD live streaming
    services. In contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to
    computing servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence,
    data management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to
    concentrate on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than
    just recommending distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38].
    The concept of smart home automation raises serious concerns about security and
    privacy risks. A smart home includes security monitoring systems with motion sensors,
    wirelessly opening smart door locks, televisions, phones, and other smart appliances
    that are highly outfitted with cameras and microphones. Although these gadgets
    improve the system, little research has been done on their privacy and security
    features. If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we will discover
    that their manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.
    Indeed, Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully
    examining Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market.
    They argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already
    more privileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated applications.
    As a result, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this, according to a published
    document by WikiLeaks [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the
    tools to access, control, and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the
    world. Furthermore, criminal entities and hackers could seize control of smart
    personal devices, capture delicate private information, and exploit that information
    immorally typically through user tracking and profiling. Additionally, a hacker
    may break into one of these smart applications, grab vital information, and then
    use it to launch any kind of attack. For instance, based on motion sensors, security
    camera feeds, and power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where and when
    to break into the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized
    parties, they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware
    and software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard
    against all these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators, etc.,
    are impervious to such security and privacy attacks. Smart Grid Networks: The
    functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirectional (i.e., electricity
    is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers). Electricity
    has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks to the
    deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in an open-loop
    fashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures in the
    distribution sector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little or no real-time
    knowledge of the system’s operating conditions and dynamically changing load.
    There are also several technical, economic, and environmental problems with this
    conventional approach. Therefore, this conventional system must become dependable,
    manageable, and scalable, as well as flexible, secure, and interoperable [42].
    The smart grid is the next invention of the Electric Power System (EPS) that incorporates
    quicker, more secure, and reliable communication networks [43]. Smart grids supplement
    the conventional electricity grid by incorporating renewable energy sources such
    as biomass, solar energy, and wind energy. These energy sources are much cleaner
    and more ecologically friendly than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil
    fuels. However, it is important to identify the most suitable communication technology
    for the smart grid’s successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s
    overall communication style is unique compared with conventional network communication
    patterns. The communication network architecture of the smart grid must be able
    to handle information exchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,
    and numerous smart meters in such a particular environment with little to no human
    intervention. This type of communication, called Device-to-Device (D2D) communication,
    is autonomous and may be initiated in response to an event or at regular intervals.
    Notably, depending on how these smart grid applications were built, their QoS
    requirements and characteristics differ greatly in terms of delay, burst size,
    and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement of a smart meter
    event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent grid networks,
    the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the same network present
    the issues of flexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications based on the
    smart grid can be developed and implemented using the current wireless and wired
    networking infrastructure and technologies. For some devices, such as smart meters,
    designing and standardizing acceptable smart grid-based protocols is a critical
    matter [45]. Furthermore, these smart grid-based networks are too dependent on
    intelligent sensors, actuators, and other devices. This makes them extremely vulnerable
    to attacks by malicious users. These smart grids could be taken over by malevolent
    users or hackers, who could then obtain unauthorized access to many smart meters
    and alter crucial data. Moreover, as the existing electricity system is insufficient
    for establishing smart grid systems, high-level adjustments to current power infrastructure
    scenarios are required. Subsequently, these smart systems require high installation
    costs because the installation requires a large number of smart meters, sensors,
    and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efficient operation of
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free
    network channel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent
    applications. Many surveys [42,43,44,45,47] reviewed communication frameworks
    for smart grids, smart-grid-based networking technologies, traffic management,
    and the requirements of numerous smart grid applications. Further, Kansal and
    Bose [48] presented their insights on transmission grid applications regarding
    their latency and bandwidth requirements. 3. Network Requirements for SCAs This
    section considers several communication requirements including reliability, delay
    tolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security, network type, heterogeneous
    network support, and mobility support. It also studies the aptness of different
    network protocols for dissimilar SCAs. Smart city services and applications need
    robust and dependable communication support as well as an effective networking
    infrastructure, which will permit competent message-sharing procedures among the
    components of the smart city systems [49]. Every smart city system has an intricate
    networking architecture made up of various networking components. Therefore, smart
    city systems are innately required to have a variety of networking requirements.
    To access the far-off destination, which may be clouds, the network traffic from
    a broad variety of deployed diverse applications uses a common networking architecture
    and resources. These resources may consist of switches, routers, communication
    connections (links), and other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing
    faraway clouds or far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently
    brings up problems with high packet loss probability, significant delay, and constrained
    network bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered
    when developing, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart
    cities. Otherwise, users would be reluctant to approve the use of such applications
    in the absence of adequate security safeguards. Such intelligent applications
    need a high-speed networking environment where the quick reaction may be managed
    with the support of the ability of a fast-processing speed. Furthermore, a variety
    of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city, based on their usefulness
    and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have different networking
    requirements, particularly in terms of response and security [50]. For example,
    the networking requirements of smart emergency response systems are quite different
    compared to other applications such as smart healthcare systems. Emergency response
    smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick to react [50]. In contrast,
    smart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily need to be especially
    dynamic. − Network Protocols: Monitoring applications for smart cities often use
    a dense network of heterogeneous sensor nodes, including fixed sensor nodes, mobile
    sensor nodes, and crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for
    Machines (LTE-M), extended coverage GSM IoT, and fifth-generation (5G) technologies
    [52] are intriguing options to support such heterogeneous networks. First, the
    bulk of crowd-sensing nodes (smartphones) is already supported by LTE communications.
    Consequently, no further wireless communication devices are required. To save
    energy, LTE and 5G can be utilized on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads)
    to allow the data gathered by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring
    center via base stations (the backbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.
    − Zigbee [53], WiFi, and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary
    nodes to communicate within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing
    the sensor node clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network
    connectivity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes
    maintenance simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies
    also make possible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance
    of real-time monitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance, can
    accommodate video streams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.
    The fast data rates provided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous for
    the sink nodes or clusters. The use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)
    in structural health monitoring applications of bridges, tunnels, or towers is
    fairly common. The cluster heads will be able to send the vibration data in this
    situation in real time. In conclusion, practically all applications for smart
    city monitoring that demand a high data throughput and minimal delay may be satisfied
    by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there are some new sensor node standards, such as
    IEEE 802.11 ah [55], LoRaWAN [56], and Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband
    protocols offer numerous advantages: greater coverage, improved scalability, reduced
    energy usage, and increased device longevity. Researchers have tested these standards
    in more than a few applications, including street lighting, energy metering, and
    home automation, even though some are still being discussed and revised. The new
    narrowband communication standards enable the sensor nodes to run more sustainably,
    which is beneficial for applications that aim for long-term monitoring. In addition
    to these protocols and standards, the FogC architecture [58] aids in monitoring
    smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile users (the potential crowd-sensing
    providers) and the cloud are connected via fog servers. These fog servers are
    WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users are more inclined to
    participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing measurements
    to the fog server in just one hop, significantly decreasing the cost and energy
    usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the
    FogC architecture, such as the nearby traffic conditions. The service latency
    and response time are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates
    directly from the fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone
    network. Lastly, using the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is crucial
    to getting the best possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and cost. The
    networks may be hierarchical so that diverse roles and functions can be assigned
    at various layers to increase the networks’ dependability and cost-effectiveness.
    As a result, certain nodes may be able to transmit data utilizing various protocols.
    − Bandwidth requirements: Many video applications in smart cities require high
    bandwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors capture video from the physical
    environment. Moreover, video transmission is more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional
    scalar data traffic in IoT. Examples of these applications are intelligent multimedia
    surveillance systems for home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring
    systems, traffic monitoring systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based
    monitoring of an environmental system. − Delay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart
    transportation, only tolerate a small amount of end-to-end delay. For example,
    to prevent imminent danger to the vehicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data
    that are being relayed must arrive within microseconds. Therefore, the control
    systems must react in time. However, other applications have a higher tolerance
    for delays [49]. Such applications rely on data monitoring and information gathering
    for upcoming analysis. − Power Consumption: Another crucial need for applications
    is power consumption. Smart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy
    sources can tolerate protocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45]. Other
    applications have medium power needs and require energy sources with limited capacities.
    One example of such an application is intelligent transportation. Other applications
    demand protocols with low or very low energy consumption characteristics since
    they have limited energy resources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), smart water
    networks, and pipeline monitoring for gas and oil are a few examples of such uses.
    − Reliability: The majority of applications have medium reliability requirements.
    A typical example of such applications is smart water networks. Some other applications
    have high-reliability necessities such as intelligent transportation and smart
    grids [49]. − Security: The majority of applications need medium to high security.
    Applications such as production control and monitoring, for instance, need medium
    security, whilst others, such as smart grids, need high security because of the
    sensitivity of the data and the importance of the operations carried out [50].
    − Heterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city systems use networking
    protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent transportation and
    smart buildings are two examples of such systems. These protocols must coexist
    in such situations without conflicting with one another. To ensure seamless and
    effective operation, it is also necessary to correctly map the control information
    in the headers at the various networking stack tiers used by the many heterogeneous
    protocols and networks. − Wired/wireless connectivity: The majority of SCAs that
    include wireless connectivity are UAVs and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines.
    Others, including intelligent transportation and smart buildings, use wired and
    wireless connectivity [50]. In these situations, wired networking may be used
    for communication within a specific physical system (such as within a UAV), while
    wireless communication may be used to link the physical system to other such systems
    that are comparable to it or to the backbone and infrastructure networks. − Mobility:
    Some systems, such as the smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil, and
    smart water networks, have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such as
    UAVs and intelligent transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility
    smart city systems can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and
    adaptable to node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control
    messages and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.
    Table 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network
    with low, medium, or high traffic rates and supporting high or low mobility of
    devices. Each SCA is based on different protocols and requires different bandwidth
    and latency tolerance. In each SCA, the number of devices involved differs. Table
    1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements. 3.1. Additional
    Challenges − Interoperability: Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous
    networking protocols that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at
    the physical and data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated
    seamlessly, these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks,
    the IEEE 1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface
    between physical/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this
    function. Future research should focus on the creation of similar protocols to
    increase the support system for smart city systems. − Scalability: A smart city
    platform must manage many devices that are connected to the city’s infrastructure.
    Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously produced and consumed
    by devices and client applications, must be stored and processed. The platform
    must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests from users and services
    that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change depending on the features
    of the city as well as the installed applications and services. Recently, Del
    Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source smart
    city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale systems,
    apps, and services for smart cities. − Load Balancing: To maximize the usage of
    resources, load balancing assigns appropriate resources (i.e., network resources,
    storage capacity, computational resources, and energy resources) to user tasks.
    A large-scale IoT network performs better and avoids overload thanks to an effective
    load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time, cost, throughput, performance, and
    resource usage are all improved in terms of QoS parameters. − The Cloud/Edge/FogC
    Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation of smart city prototypes.
    These computing paradigms efficiently aid in the gathering, upkeep, and analysis
    of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that demand advanced processing
    and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems for smart cities
    have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time applications present
    the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently, FogC and Edge Computing
    have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing, implementing, deploying,
    and controlling such systems/applications. These paradigms bring computing resources
    closer to the IoT/device plane so that the primary computation can be done locally
    [65,66]. Each computing paradigm offers particular assistance based on the requirements
    of the application at hand. For example, to support a cloud-based SCA, ClCom offers
    centralized storage and processing capacity. For certain SCAs, ClCom can offer
    scalable processing power and data storage [5]. The features of ClCom (e.g., powerful
    processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge software services)
    can be used to provide various support services for a variety of SCAs. ClCom can
    be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The city’s ClCom services
    can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs to gather, process,
    store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes of data are gathered
    across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The sophisticated platforms
    required for storing and analyzing this massive amount of data to improve operations
    and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing. To effectively support SCAs,
    the communication between city sensors and actuators and ClCom may involve various
    communication requirements. The network architectures used in the smart city should
    meet these requirements. Smart applications require the integration of sensors,
    actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function well with a robust network
    that offers good communication services linking both sides. The fact that cloud
    services are either provided at a single central location or across numerous distributed
    platforms in various locations is another problem that occurs when adopting ClCom
    for a smart city. For many cloud applications, the distributed ClCom strategy
    can offer greater quality and dependability support [67]. However, it is frequently
    necessary to establish effective communication channels between the distributed
    ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability and
    efficiency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control
    of network resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot be
    avoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated the QoS
    requirements of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment to recognize
    QoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog) that is inspired
    by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture [69] for a
    FogC system. 3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks A smart city
    network has the following features [70]: Large Densities: A smart city network
    has a very large density as thousands of smart devices are distributed in the
    area of a city. Abnormal Traffic Patterns: Cascading or synchronization among
    smart devices produces extremely bursty or correlated traffic patterns. These
    traffic patterns differ from the regular social-generated traffic patterns on
    which most existing schemes and technology used in our society are based. Disorganized
    Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless connectivity features, smart
    city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology. The problem arises when
    smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless channels, where packet losses
    caused by wireless channel special properties are extremely common and eventually
    have an impact on the functioning of the smart city system. Therefore, it appears
    very improbable that a single high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.
    Heterogeneity: SCAs use a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,
    latency, throughput, and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates
    at a unique trade-off threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist
    on a single platform. Coexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication
    technologies used in smart cities are distributed over the same radio space. At
    the same time, independent radio infrastructures are connected through a variety
    of wireless channels. Under such circumstances, the SCA must handle interference
    issues with competence. Security and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to
    several risks from malevolent users. The majority of specialized smart sensors,
    actuators, and other intelligent devices are developed by designers without considering
    security measures. Such applications may be highly vulnerable due to hostile actors’
    ease of access to these cutting-edge technologies and potential threats to people’s
    security and privacy. The main challenges for smart city networks are as follows
    [70]: Lack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies
    for Personal Area Networks (PANs) and the IEEE 802.11 groups for wireless LANs
    adopt the concept of single-hop ad-hoc networking. These standards permit direct
    communication between two devices that are in the transmission range of each other.
    At the same time, the multi-hop ad-hoc networking paradigm enables the communication
    between any two devices which are not necessarily in their transmission range
    [71]. A problem that researchers must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous
    sets of devices (i.e., actuators, sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate
    uniformly without any standardization. Global distributors and manufacturers must
    propose and accept standardized network solutions that enable communication between
    diverse devices on homogeneous communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    is the dominant solution that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical
    Layer. This standard deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication
    range, and power consumption. Several revisions or amendments (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g
    and IEEE 802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released. The IEEE 802.15.4g
    amendment allows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing data rates and communication
    ranges compatible with neighborhood mesh (wide) networks. Then, it is followed
    by another cutting-edge modification, known as IEEE 802.15.4e, which modifies
    and enhances the method used by devices to access wireless channels while also
    using time-slotted channel hopping mode. This hopping mode further delivers low-power
    consumption and improved dependability. From another viewpoint, many researchers
    customized appropriate upper-layer protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They
    made the necessary modifications there to make smart applications compatible with
    conventional infrastructure. Since the network of low-power smart devices is confined,
    the researchers developed numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make
    them easily adaptable. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72]
    and 6LoWPAN [73], which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.
    Interference problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same
    radio space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless
    channels. Because of this, the smart application must handle interference problems
    in such situations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate
    and be compatible with one another. Vertical handover (soft): Multiple radios
    are used by the rapidly expanding number of smart devices being developed. These
    devices should be able to recognize and use the best interface that is currently
    available while balancing power usage and throughput. D2D Communications: In the
    IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication demands. Unfortunately, conventional
    network gateways cannot handle such generated messages from heterogeneous devices.
    Short Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support and recommend acceptable
    performance for longer data packet scenarios. However, smart devices communicate
    with one another using short messages (since most of them are tiny and operate
    over low-powered battery devices). To this end, short communicating messages will
    positively impact network congestion detection and avoidance policies and promote
    in-band aggregation. Local Network Traffic Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-specific
    devices frequently use the same network infrastructure. However, most cellular
    data networks are exclusively planned, implemented, deployed, and managed for
    smartphone usage. Fitting traffic from these heterogeneous devices onto a single
    platform is now the main challenge that cellular data network providers face.
    It is difficult to integrate the traffic from these two types of heterogeneous
    devices into the same network infrastructure due to several intrinsic factors
    and the specified features of this traditional network. Additionally, D2D devices
    use a more significant proportion of scarce resources than smartphones, unnecessarily
    creating a problem of unfairness in the system [74]. Therefore, we must first
    comprehend D2D traffic patterns and how they differ from traffic patterns generated
    by smartphones. Understanding traffic patterns can provide insights into managing
    and allocating shared network resources more effectively and guarantee the highest
    level of service quality for both types of devices. Security mechanisms: Denial
    of Service (DoS) attacks are a remarkable threat to the security of smart city
    networks and must be identified. Some statistical methods have been proposed to
    solve this problem. Such a statistical method is presented in [75] that is based
    on feature distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis process. Another
    security mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying users and devices
    in a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-manipulated devices.
    Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT systems such as the
    reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation attack, and the
    Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be encrypted.
    However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might be able
    to embed general-purpose microprocessors for this task. In addition, low resources
    and constrained devices can only embed application-specific integrated circuits.
    Therefore, conventional cryptographic primitives are not suitable for low-resource
    smart devices due to their low computation power, limited battery life, small
    size, small memory, and limited power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography
    may be an efficient encryption for these devices. Trust management is another
    security mechanism that detects and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure
    access control. Automated and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate
    the trust values of the participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of
    trust management schemes focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based
    access control methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large
    number of smart things storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,
    transparent, and easy access control management so that different nodes/users
    can be granted different levels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain
    technology can be used to create secure virtual zones where things can identify
    and trust each other [77]. Self-organization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can also
    be planned to set up the relationship between Blockchain and IoT, as suggested
    in [78]. Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that flow through
    the IoT system can vary to a great extent, in terms of either format, shape (in
    time and space), and semantics. Therefore, the process of separating normal from
    abnormal sensed data is extremely demanding. In the context of IoT applications,
    sensors are the real source of big data, which suggests that anomaly detection
    at the edge could be a powerful tool to address the inevitable data communication
    bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is concerned with identifying data patterns that
    deviate remarkably from the expected behavior. This is critical in the process
    of finding out important information about the IoT system’s functioning, detecting
    abnormalities that are often rare or difficult to model or, otherwise, to predict
    [79]. A timely identification of anomalies is vital to preventing IoT system failure.
    Advanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artificial intelligence (AI), machine
    learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) play a key role in the evolution
    of the smart city sectors [80]. These techniques are now being developed as solutions
    for completely automated IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal
    analysis of the big data is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing
    DRL/ML approaches can improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency;
    and increase precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality
    prediction, person detection, traffic management, etc. For example, an intelligent
    transportation system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize
    self-driving vehicles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques
    are also used to precisely monitor and estimate the real-time traffic flow data
    in an urban environment. In SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned
    techniques can enhance the safety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,
    management, and power grid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective
    use of smart meter big data for different applications such as load assessment
    and prediction, baseline estimation, demand response, load clustering, and malicious
    data deception attacks. In health intelligence, extensive use of AI, ML, and DRL
    techniques is implemented due to high-performance IoT devices, Cloud Computing,
    and an increase in data rates. These techniques can play a vital role in disease
    diagnosis, cure prediction, social media analytics for a particular disease, and
    medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role of AI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques
    is also outstanding. These techniques can be used from an advanced security perspective
    of IoT to confront security threats. Notably, the accuracy and precision of the
    aforementioned techniques can be further enhanced by increasing the amount of
    training data to strengthen their learning capabilities and hence the automated
    decision efficiencies [82]. 4. Protocols Used for SCAs Figure 3 shows a proposed
    taxonomy of networking protocols and architectures for SCAs. It also shows the
    challenges in IoT communications via TCP/IP. Figure 3. A taxonomy of technologies
    facilitating communication and networking for smart cities with IoT-enabled application
    protocols and suggested networking architectures and protocols. SCAs involve numerous
    smart things that operate on low-powered battery devices [83]. New connectivity
    solutions are being investigated in light of the following question: do the currently
    available methods, tools, and techniques—especially those for wireless networks—allow
    for the reliable handling of such a large number of smart devices? Yaqoob et al.
    [84] provided details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN technologies
    such as ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D communication.
    In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of connected devices,
    transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies (e.g.,
    WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve significant power consumption and are only partially
    applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies and communication
    strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication perspective.
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput performance
    for fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior context.
    Due to the limitations of its initial design, this standard does not support IoT
    applications. Hence, to enable IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the
    community (IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efficient protocol
    [55]. They aim to create a system that enables effective communication between
    several indoor and outdoor devices. Nevertheless, the real-time implementation
    of IEEE 802.11 ah may need to be improved by the absence of an appropriate interference
    mechanism. IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n,
    Cellular 3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of
    standards and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various
    SCAs. Smart home automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems
    require short-range communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g.,
    Bluetooth and Zigbee) from the WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by
    a lower bandwidth requirement, minimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication
    infrastructure environment. In contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used for
    SCAs that require longer-range communication. Such applications are smart transportation
    management systems. The protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular and WiMAX,
    can be adopted by applications that need wide-range communication, such as smart
    emergency response systems, weather and air quality monitoring systems, and smart
    grid systems. These features designed in terms of standards or protocols have
    enough capability that allows for both synchronous and asynchronous data connections.
    The best-effort traffic (which can effectively tolerate latency) allows the asynchronous
    data connections feature to be linked with smart city services or applications.
    Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connections is possible for those services
    or applications that generate traffic mandating strict QoS standards such as low
    latency and high accessible network capacity [49]. Since IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee)
    is a short-range (low bit rate) communication protocol that often suggests higher
    flexibility for small devices running on low power, such a protocol can significantly
    increase network lifetime. Moreover, such a protocol encourages and indicates
    support for applications and services with relatively relaxed latency and throughput
    conditions in WPANs. The authors of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4
    and proposed an intelligent system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted
    the benefits of using wireless emulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation
    and deployment, relatively easier in expanding a network, and flexibility in the
    system due to the use of wireless technology, which supports the usage of heterogeneous
    devices in the same implemented and deployed structure. Furthermore, they emphasized
    the advantages of employing the same intelligent infrastructure for a variety
    of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring, and cost-effectiveness.
    For example, by including specific smart metering devices such as water or gas
    meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established to
    target smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering applications.
    5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called BDMA and FBMC multiple
    access, which was first launched in 2015. In the case of BDMA multiple access,
    an orthogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that resources can be distributed
    in parallel to each mobile base station by dividing the antenna beam in accordance
    with the position of the mobile stations to enable multiple accesses to the base
    stations. Successively, this helps in improving the capacity of 5G networks [86].
    Specifically, the idea of moving towards 5G is based on current technology advancements
    and particularly on unique customer needs. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed
    that implemented 5G cellular networks should address noteworthy complications
    that are not successfully addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced network capacity and
    data rate, lower End-to-End (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and consistent user QoE
    provisioning. In addition, massive and rapid growth in the number of highly developed
    connected devices leads to a sharp increase in network traffic and a widening
    range of applications with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta and
    Jha [86] studied numerous facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive
    MIMO, traffic and power management policies, offloading (local), and self-configuring
    and organizing networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time
    managing and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days
    thanks to 5G. 5G ultimately targets some networking possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable
    and Low-Latency Communications (uRLLC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and
    massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC). In a smart city context, eMBB controls
    data transfer between a variety of networked user end devices, edge devices, or
    cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC aims to manage huge connected, complex devices,
    such as wearables, actuators, and sensors, through dense urban deployment. Finally,
    uRLLC takes responsibility for managing highly time-critical communication such
    as vehicular communication, base stations, and edge devices communication [87].
    Although 5G has completely brought about a new revolution in the field of networking,
    numerous unknown challenges still are possible in these cases of communication
    when 5G is deployed in the context of smart cities. One major problem is power-efficient
    communication, especially when communicating low-powered battery devices such
    as sensors and other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when two distinct
    technologies (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Specific device-level
    compatibility problems might always persist when communication infrastructures
    migrate to next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely,
    how to handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or
    difficult-to-reach places, as well as the potential high costs associated with
    building and maintaining 5G networks. Table 2 compares protocols used for smart
    cities, while Table 3 evaluates standards utilizing features and characteristics.
    Table 2. Comparison of protocols used for smart cities. Adapted and extended from
    [49,84,88]. Table 3. Evaluation of standards utilizing their features. 4.1. IEEE
    802.11 Standards Table 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features. Table
    4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features. 4.2. IEEE 802.15.1 The
    IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave time
    division duplex mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with
    a 1 Mbps data rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services
    designed to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include
    Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the
    IoT [98]. The deployment of services offered for tracking and localization devices
    is typically suggested by BLE-based devices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.
    These beacons produce a signal that other compatible devices can pick up between
    50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises greater indoor localization accuracy
    than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can be used for a wide range
    of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch of points of
    sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally, to provide
    specific services of interest, it is frequently required to combine the BLE technology
    with other technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the aim of BLE technology
    (Bluetooth Classic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous wireless connection,
    i.e., BlueTooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR). It became the perfect
    option for the IoT since it permits connectivity and audio-streaming applications
    using brief bursts of long-distance radio, which lowers the battery consumption
    of mobile devices (because they need not be connected all the time). Using the
    idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE specification, smartphones or regular
    phones can be linked to other heterogeneous devices (such as headphones) in BR/EDR
    mode. Otherwise, they can be connected to wearables in LE mode. A low-power radio
    called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends to broadcast data across 79 channels in the
    2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. Wireless audio streaming is primarily made
    possible through BCR, which has evolved into the industry-standard radio protocol
    for in-car entertainment systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims
    to transmit data over 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To
    facilitate the deployment of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks
    to provide support for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast;
    and, most notably, mesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create
    distribution and locating maps utilizing fingerprint templates for indoor device
    and user localization. Due to BLE’s greater susceptibility to abrupt fading and
    substantial changes in received signal strength, it has been proven that using
    BLE is more efficient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101]. However, Bluetooth
    technology has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly when its BR/EDR
    mode is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the master nodes
    to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered
    a variety of scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the
    BR/EDR mode reveals a lack of scalability that further restricts the performance
    of the system. 4.3. LoRA The LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications
    and operated as a low-data-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum
    that could go up to 10 km. LoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth: 125,
    250, and 500 KHz. Even while this technology can function at the largest bandwidth
    class, which further improves data rate, it still causes issues with high power
    consumption, a shorter communication range, and an increase in the likelihood
    of interference because it is free to operate in a wider frequency spectrum. This
    method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation and a CSSM variant
    with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission range will expand
    as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption will rise as
    well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby making it resilient
    to channel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not differentiate the noise
    in the channel such as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK modulation approach, which
    normally identifies signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise floor, the CSSM
    feature enables this technology to sense, perceive, and capture signals that are
    19.5 dB below the noise floor [103]. Its architecture uses a star network topology
    and includes gateways and end nodes. In this design, end nodes are referred to
    as slaves and run on battery-powered devices with limited power, but gateways
    are thought of as powerful machines that gather data from slave nodes. Furthermore,
    LoRaWAN is a communication layer that operates on top of LoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates
    the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability and suitability for
    low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over cellular technologies,
    which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice, LoRaWAN improved
    network features and functionalities by addressing the concept of a specialized
    server (network) and specifically defining numerous device types to meet the needs
    of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet filtering, and
    packet scheduling are all made possible using specialized network servers. LoRaWAN
    has also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission power and
    rate, which aids in optimizing network performance in terms of power consumption
    and throughput. This technology can be employed for a wide range of applications,
    such as smart health nursing [104], traffic monitoring [105], agriculture monitoring
    [106], localization [107], and smart grid applications [108]. In particular, this
    technology is useful for non-latency-sensitive applications and those that call
    for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al. [109] and Adelantado et al. [110]
    emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart metering, tracking, and localization-based
    applications. At the same time, it is not so feasible for real-time monitoring
    and video surveillance. 4.4. WiMAX WiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential
    peak data rate of 60 Mbps for an entire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps
    for an entirely uplink operation, based on the original IEEE 802.16 air interface
    standard (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amendment [112]. It can be done using
    two antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz. Additionally, it may provide
    support for multimedia services with different traffic characteristics and wide
    area mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety of QoS
    scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous traffic, such as Internet data
    traffic, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio traffic, and voice and video streams
    [113]. Table 5 shows the specified WiMAX standards and their operational parameters
    [114]. This standard provides a communication channel between geographically separated
    devices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges between 30
    km and 100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such as high installation
    costs and the possibility of complications and irregularities when dealing with
    high-definition multimedia traffic. Table 5. WiMAX standards and their operational
    parameters. Wireless network traffic has recently increased extraordinarily due
    to the rapid proliferation of smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators.
    These devices, along with smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based
    specialized devices, are the most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network
    environments. In such a dense network environment, interference is a critical
    issue that must be addressed if satisfactory performance and, thus, proficient
    spatial frequency reuse is required. Subsequently, the standards IEEE 802.11 were
    designed and implemented to support these requirements. Numerous international
    organizations, including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved their technologies
    in response to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance, the original
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior throughput
    performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as
    a result, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a result,
    to address the challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group
    (TG) was formed by the IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to redesign and
    extend the applicability of WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They focused on the
    critical issue of power-aware efficient schemes and protocols to extend the functionality
    and applicability of 802.11-based networks while dealing with a variety of small
    power-constrained smart outdoor and indoor devices [55,97]. 4.5. Challenges in
    IoT Communication Using the TCP/IP Protocol Suite In IoT, smart sensing motes,
    devices, and actuators share unique features such as constrained memory, power,
    and processing capabilities; the need for facilitating real-time requirements
    of smart applications; extremely vulnerable radio environments; and little to
    no human involvement after deployment [115]. By enabling communication amongst
    these devices utilizing low-power-cost technologies, a new infrastructure for
    deployed smart services has been formed. Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP
    protocol suite might provide a solution and be flexible enough for a variety of
    evolving IoT communication scenarios. Unfortunately, there were additional challenges
    that network administrators, designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers
    were searching for the best way to install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally
    use the system’s limited resources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of such
    power constraints, researchers highlighted the requirements of low-power Layer-2
    technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4) and low-power WiFi usage. In contrast
    with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies operate with smaller maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission speeds. IoT network protocol
    designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining the ideal MTU size. Another
    obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless networks and
    thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies. This vulnerability
    brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture: (1) The current IP addressing
    model cannot assist mesh communication (since it relies on a multi-link subnet
    prototype) at all. (2) In mesh communication, the multicasting and broadcasting
    communication methods are quite expensive, power-demanding, and prohibitive as
    the network nodes are extremely power constrained. Moreover, unicasting is the
    only remaining alternative method. (3) Unicasting is power intensive in and of
    itself because it may take many hops while forwarding and may wake up an excessive
    number of nodes that are asleep. Notably, idle nodes and hops can modify the radio
    state’s operation mode to save power. Additionally, a large amount of power is
    used and saved by a node during transmission, reception, overhearing, idle, and
    sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful delivery, we cannot just
    alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective coordination and intricate
    synchronization [117,118]. (4) There is a high requirement for scalable routing/forwarding
    schemes for IP communication to take place over mesh architectural systems. (5)
    For many IoT applications requiring data prioritizing and customized control,
    original TCP-suited features such as those operational on fixed MSS sizes (such
    as MTU sizes) that further lead to silly window syndrome or in-order byte-stream
    delivery to ensure dependability, are unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF
    started defining standard Internet protocols such as RPL [120] for such specialized
    environments to minimize protocol overheads that impair the computing ability
    and memory management of these specialized resource-constrained devices. WiFi-based
    infrastructure networks enable backhauling support, which helps establish and
    sustain seamless connectivity among smart IoT devices. In smart home wireless
    networks, this form of connectivity can be provided through TCP connections. The
    TCP/IP protocol suite supports dependable data delivery and congestion control
    strategies to maintain network throughput performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP
    is a protocol that has been regularly modified and improved over the years to
    effectively transport large amounts of byte-stream in-ordered data via resilient
    P2P connections with comparatively lower latency needs. IoT services deal with
    atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP protocol suite-based protocols,
    such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns adequately [119]. There are severe
    problems that TCP faces when it deals with an IoT application: (1) TCP connection
    establishment and termination (three-way handshaking) incur significant overhead
    in the system as most communication in an IoT application includes the transmission
    of brief segments and relatively little data. (2) TCP functionality needs resilient
    P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these connections in an IoT network
    environment because smart sensors and other connected devices switch their mode
    of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119]. (3) Some IoT applications
    might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns, and enabling such patterns
    via TCP will result in substantial network overhead in the entire IoT system and
    high-power consumption. (4) Some IoT services have very granular delay requirements,
    and any extra delay in the form of connection establishment or MSS creation (waiting
    for data to fill the entire MSS) is completely unacceptable for their performance.
    Thus, TCP is unable to provide much support for these IoT services. (5) IoT applications
    that rely on wireless communication scenarios must deal with critical wireless
    channel characteristics such as channel error, interference, and wireless interface
    properties that result in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer contention-induced,
    and collision-induced packet losses. When TCP operates in such a setting, its
    stringent in-order delivery requirements and retransmission policies (i.e., fast
    retransmission) may occasionally result in very serious system problems such as
    Head-of-Line (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in a
    reduction in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121,122,123,124].
    Furthermore, wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may further
    impair TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP Retransmission
    Time Out timer. Some standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement
    Layer-4 functionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed to
    utilize UDP as an underlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should depend
    on an application’s requirements, which may vary from application to application.
    However, TCP and its updated variants rely on the concept of data delivery deferment
    and try to perform retransmissions from an already created copy in the sender
    buffer. However, this is not the only approach to dealing with packet losses in
    the network. Another method is for AppL to accept packet delivery that is not
    completely flawless and proceed with its current operations. This feature will
    be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution. Additionally, retransmission
    is an additional option. However, AppL should handle this retransmission rather
    than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost
    data bits, doing so enables the source application to reconstruct them. Furthermore,
    in situations where real-time services are severely constrained, the transmitting
    application may transmit fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair”
    the effects of the initial loss [126]. Clark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these
    concepts and subsequently introduced the concept of Application Level Framing
    (ALF). Implementing Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself brings the idea of employing
    ALF into the system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF, a network can recognize
    individual Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently can offer support for
    flexible Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission procedures
    for diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using in-network
    caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails
    to provide support for the ALF scheme [119]. 4.6. Compound TCP for IoT Compound
    TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel utilization
    and fairness performances. It will play a significant role in home networks with
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128]. Pokhrel and Williamson [115]
    studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an IoT scenario involving sensors
    and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home appliances). They
    analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of connections made
    using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks in the presence
    of significant buffer-overflow-induced losses and severely degraded transmission
    channel circumstances. The authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements
    for all IoT devices as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional
    bandwidth-hungry Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated
    a thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted
    classical devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overflow-induced losses
    and significantly deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of
    [115,129] suggested models that aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion
    and flow control of several concurrently running competitive long-lived compound
    TCP connections. In evaluating and developing these models, they considered MAC-level
    retransmissions, link-layer contention, channel failures, and collision. The authors
    of [130] utilized a transient model suggesting a new queue management scheme to
    capture the interactions of short-lived TCP flows (the most workable flows in
    IoT scenarios) over conventional traffic patterns over WiFi networks. However,
    the performance of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using
    a single shared Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale
    well and provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially
    when wireless channels are often reused by several APs [131]. 4.7. Viewpoints
    of Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems The network architectures for IoT are
    heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular
    Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due to
    the large-scale production of intelligent sensing devices, survivability and self-organization
    of deployed functional networks are essential. A WSN is deployed for a variety
    of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and military applications. It
    is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which the sensor nodes communicate
    over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered, low-power sensors capable
    of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating, and regulating communication.
    Numerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2, TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have been
    suggested. Therefore, some standards were introduced to enable interaction and
    other compatibilities among these numerous heterogeneous platforms. For example,
    the IEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT.
    WSNs provide critical functionalities for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered
    battery-operated End Devices (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to
    the Internet. A WSN can be considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several
    equipped sensor nodes. Due to the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability
    must be obtained from the viewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability
    issue, various works suggested a standardized arrangement that could enable the
    usage of IP over LoWPAN. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability
    for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard outlines
    the physical and data link layers of the network and offers a low-cost framework
    for network operations. To link LPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may be used as
    an adaptation layer to enable sensors to implement an IP stack and become approachable
    by other conventional devices over the Internet. This adaptability layer also
    supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables a variety of applications and
    permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding algorithms at the Internet
    layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot be supported
    when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72] considers the
    LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained, and they
    are connected by some lossy links that only support low data rates. These links
    are thought to be extremely unstable and have poor performance in terms of packet
    delivery rates. In such specialized networks, the traffic patterns are often P2MP
    and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint (MP2MP) rather than just P2P [72]. These networks
    contain hundreds of smart devices. This makes the implementation of routing policies
    more difficult than ever. In addition, numerous existing traditional ad-hoc wireless
    network routing methods, such as DSR and AODV, cannot manage these unique situations
    and unforeseen circumstances. Designing and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking
    settings has been more difficult due to the mobility aspect and the resource limitations
    at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’ design principles emphasize QoS
    elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end latency [134,135]. The forwarding
    rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations take into account the
    increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the node energy [117,136].
    As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and maintain solely inside their
    operational infrastructure, this was very feasible. However, the interoperability
    of these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when such networks are integrated
    with IoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration with IoT needs novel routing
    policies that support scalability and assure QoS, fairness, and connectivity between
    two nodes (both in APs and ad-hoc networks) with the least amount of power consumption.
    The standard classical forwarding strategies were intended to ensure QoS between
    a pair of devices/nodes. In the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures
    should suggest enough fairness so that each node can sufficiently get enough chances
    to communicate with nearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing
    solutions are followed to decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation.
    Researchers have often raised concerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules,
    which lead to the consumption of excess energy in networks while taking into account
    mobile and static ad-hoc network scenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood
    of frequent network disconnections, route failures, and even network partitioning,
    all contributing to the system’s significant MAC-level and routing-level overhead
    problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the high-power consumption problem,
    many researchers presented numerous smart routing paradigms [118,134,135,137].
    Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the desired QoS. Cross-layer
    design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion control are
    well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless channel
    attributes. Therefore, significant work has been done in these areas. These designs
    provide support for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely variable channel
    parameters at lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing and Transport
    layers to further optimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations decisions
    [121,134,135,138,139,140]. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) indicates
    how well a device can hear a signal from an AP or router. A network layer forwarding
    policy can effectively utilize the RSSI (accessible through lower layers dynamically)
    to assess link quality. AODV and DSR are examples of the traditional ad-hoc routing
    protocols used in various smart forwarding systems designed for IoT scenarios.
    The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing mechanisms were suggested for the IoT
    scenarios and talked about node and link disjoint paths while discovering routes.
    However, the proposed schemes do not shed light and discuss anything related to
    performance issues when there is a significant level of interference in the network
    because of traffic running parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned techniques
    do not always perform well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay. Recently,
    the scheme [140] considered different critical factors such as interference level,
    link-layer contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related
    to wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution
    policies’ efficiency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,
    different possible disjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might
    be able to interfere with one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting
    behavior in wireless communication. Consequently, such separate disconnected pathways
    could be utilized to enhance the performance of the network as a whole [138,140].
    When employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend on WSN-based networking
    connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from smart things to sink nodes.
    These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes (IoT-GW). To balance energy
    usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous such static and mobile IoT-GWs
    can be deployed in the system. In the whole system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous
    types of critical data, are connected to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee
    specified three forms of devices: Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee
    End Device, and three forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh. Moreover,
    the Zigbee stack embraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the case of star
    network topology, the Reduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e., RFDs and FFDs)
    can communicate with the PAN central coordinator only. They are not capable of
    communicating with one another. Here, the PAN coordinator may be powered by mains,
    while the RFDs and FFDs run on low-powered limited battery devices. Moreover,
    in the case of the mesh network topology, any device can communicate to within-range
    devices at a point of time. Moreover, this topology contains a PAN coordinator,
    which can communicate with other RFDs and FFDs. Furthermore, this networking topology
    offers support for the usage of the integrated forwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree
    and AODV routing procedures. Lastly, the tree (cluster) network topology is a
    subset form of mesh networking topology, consisting of RFDs and FFDs (which may
    act as coordinators). However, the FFD count could be more than the RFD count
    in the network. RFDs may attach to tree (cluster) network topology as the end
    nodes in the system. The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization functionalities
    to other connected coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single PAN
    coordinator amongst these coordinators [144]. 4.8. IoT Application Protocols Each
    IoT application is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.
    These protocols can be the following: Representational State Transfer Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is the primary client/server protocol
    that adopts the request/response model. HTPP has been related to the REST architecture
    [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar entities over web-based services.
    The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices to make their status readily
    available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions
    [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE techniques
    of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build a REST model for dissimilar
    IoT devices [148]. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [149]: It is a lightweight
    RESTful protocol lately standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
    CoAP is used by IoT devices for IP-based, HTTP-like interactions. It uses UDP
    with acknowledgment messages to set up reliable communication based on a request/response
    interaction. It has reduced complexity, and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained
    IoT applications and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) [150] is established for IoT messaging. According to MQTT design
    principles, network bandwidth and device resource requirements should be kept
    to a minimum while also aiming to assure dependability and some level of delivery
    assurance. Since June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by ISO as a standard (ISO/IEC
    20922). The protocol continues to progress by formalizing popular capability options
    and adding new functionalities. The most recent version, MQTT v5.0, was released
    in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe paradigm. Clients connect
    to a centralized broker when using MQTT. Open Platform Communications Unified
    Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoperability standard is used for the secure
    and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation domain and other industries.
    It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow of information among
    IoT devices from multiple vendors. It supports two different communication methods:
    the Client/Server method as well as Publish/Subscribe (e.g., over UDP or MQTT)
    to mainly meet different industry requirements from the production systems to
    edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main IoT vendors including IBM, AWS, Google
    Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage secure, standardized information exchange
    in edge-to-cloud applications based on OPC UA. Extensible Messaging and Presence
    Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is based on text messages that
    use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which it can implement both request/response
    and publish/subscribe methods by using suitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant
    messages between clients, and this happens in real-time using a push mechanism
    to avoid increasing unnecessary network loads. XMPP also determines the state
    of an XMPP entity as online, offline, busy, etc. Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
    (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing business messages between applications
    or organizations using TCP. It connects systems, feeds business processes with
    the information they need, and reliably transmits onward the instructions that
    achieve their goals using the point/point and publish/subscribe interaction modes.
    AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of message orientation; queuing; routing;
    security; reliability; and interoperability. Data Distribution Service (DDS) [154]:
    DDS was developed by the Open Management Group (OMG). DDS is a real-time M2M protocol
    that enables dependable, high-performance, interoperable, scalable data exchanges
    using a publish–subscribe pattern. DDS provides low-latency data connectivity,
    high reliability, and scalability in publish–subscribe and request/response patterns
    over TCP and UDP. The needs of various IoT applications requiring real-time data
    exchange can be addressed using DDS. Such applications are air traffic control,
    transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart grid management. Lastly,
    Glaroudis et al. [155] provided a comparison among IoT application protocols in
    terms of well-accepted key performance indicators and discussed their suitability
    in the framework of smart farming. 5. Networking Architectures and Protocols 5.1.
    Generic Architectures Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an
    urban IoT’s enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated
    the implementation of an IoT island as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City
    of Padova. In the IoT, two methods provide data access to objects/things. The
    first involves deploying multi-hop mesh networks with short-range communication
    among network nodes using unlicensed frequency. The second involves using licensed
    frequency band long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM). Centenaro et al.
    [156] presented a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wireless connectivity)
    called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based on a star topology
    characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed
    sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide connectivity
    in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed the
    advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efficiency,
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled
    SCA that uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled
    street lighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental
    research facility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander supports
    testing proposed protocols, services, and configurations in a realistic setting
    at an appropriate scale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is a significant
    part of IoT. Vilajosana and Dohler [159] reviewed currently used smart city M2M
    technologies (i.e., sensors, data loggers, wireless modems, and gateway). They
    considered one of the most famous deployment use cases, i.e., smart parking. In
    any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount of M2M communication requests
    occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways cannot face this challenge.
    Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control model for M2M communications.
    Their model differentiates all M2M requests into delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant.
    Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant requests by routing them into one low-priority
    queue, aiming to reduce the number of requests from various devices to the access
    point in the IoT for smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up
    architecture after analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture
    has four layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each
    layer integrates security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer,
    located at the bottom of the architecture, collects data from physical devices.
    The transmission layer is located above the sensing layer. Several communication
    technologies are used to transmit data from the transmission layer to the (upper)
    data management layer. The data management layer performs data fusion, data analysis,
    data processing, and data storing. It stores valuable information that various
    applications use at the application layer to provide services. The majority of
    the above works mainly focus on a single characteristic, such as quality of service
    [162]. Marques et al. [163] proposed a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities
    infrastructure management architecture that allows the integration of physical
    objects, communication infrastructure, cloud platform, and IoT-based services
    in a pervasive way. This architecture (Figure 4) is generic and includes four
    layers: (1) Physical Objects, (2) Communication, (3) Cloud Platform, and (4) Services.
    Figure 4. Architecture design. Adapted from [163]. The Physical Objects Layer
    enables IoT sensors to collect data that will feed the smart city architecture
    with information used to offer services. After the sensors collect data, a Communication
    Device is used to collect sensor data. A communication device can implement different
    technologies (e.g., RFID, Bluetooth, and Zigbee). Sensor data are processed by
    a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing unit responsible for gathering
    information used by the application providing a service. The local processing
    unit brings elements of edge computing, as it pushes part of the computation to
    edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating all the computation in a centralized
    remote server. The Communication Layer: The architecture supports a variety of
    network access technologies. The communication layer supports the implementation
    of various wireless technologies. The local processing unit located at the Physical
    Objects Layer defines the technology to be used and relays data to the communication
    layer using the interface of a network access point. The Cloud Platform Layer
    provides three services: processing, database queries, and data storage. In the
    context of providing services for smart cities, each of these services can be
    dynamically allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably, only
    some applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation
    is optional. The Services Layer implements four groups, which are called classes
    of services: (I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III) Infrastructure,
    and (IV) Technology. In each class, different kinds of applications can be implemented
    to deal with the challenges of smart cities. This architecture is a generic solution,
    so the underlying layers are designed to offer support to the applications. Therefore,
    it can be adapted to the specific implementation of a given service. To this end,
    the authors adapted their architecture to a waste management scenario. Another
    multi-level smart city architecture [164] was built on semantic web technologies,
    and its design is mostly used in smart city wireless sensor network applications.
    Data collection, data processing, integration and reasoning, and device control
    and alerts make up its four layers. Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s
    edge, Gheisari et al. [165] suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in
    the smart city that protects privacy. Saadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer
    architecture for mobile object authentication in the context of IoT smart cities.
    Their architecture is based on the applicability of a proposed hierarchical elliptic
    curve identity-based signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167] presented
    a Fog-based smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network (FOCAN).
    To reduce latency and increase the efficiency of services among things with various
    capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through
    the smart city environment. One of FOCAN’s primary benefits is that the IoT device
    can deliver services effectively and with less energy consumption. 5.2. SDN-IoT
    Architectures Software-defined networking (SDN) [168] is an approach to enable
    flexible and efficient network configuration to enhance a network. SDN can provide
    many advantages for configuring city networks to support different applications.
    For example, SDN can improve the QoS of city networks against link failures [169]
    and meet smart city latency demands [170]. While some efforts are investigating
    this approach for supporting SCAs, there is room for developing more advanced
    management and networking mechanisms in SDN for efficient, reliable, and secure
    network configurations in smart cities. Jazaeri et al. [171] considered the advantages
    of integrating edge computing, SDN, and IoT technologies and reviewed different
    frameworks and platforms. Liu et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples
    urban sensing applications from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture,
    centralized controllers manage physical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition,
    transmission, and processing services to develop urban sensing applications. Bi
    et al. [173] proposed a scalable SDN-enabled architecture that integrates a variety
    of smart city components and provides reliable and timely scheduling for big data
    transfer to support smart city services. They also studied the time-constrained
    big data transfer scheduling (TBTS) problem under this architecture and proposed
    a heuristic with an intelligent scheme that can maximize the throughput and schedule
    the multi-flow transfer dynamically. IoT systems collect and process data vulnerable
    to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed
    a collaborative and intelligent-network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)
    architecture, namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT networks. SeArch is a security
    architecture in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS nodes, i.e., Edge-IDS,
    Fog-IDS, and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration among nodes.
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy
    in smart cities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network architecture
    for the smart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN and Blockchain technologies.
    To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, their architecture
    is divided into core and edge networks. By designing a hybrid architecture, their
    architecture inherits the strength of centralized and distributed network architectures.
    “PrivySharing” [177] is a Blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving
    and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. This framework protects
    data privacy by segmenting the blockchain network into different channels, consisting
    of a limited number of approved businesses and handling a certain category of
    data, such as health, smart auto, smart energy, or financial information. Additionally,
    smart contracts contain access control rules that regulate who has access to the
    users’ data within a channel. In addition, private data gathering and encryption
    are used to further isolate and safeguard the data within a channel. Islam et
    al. [178] designed a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT ecosystem
    that addresses the existing challenges through the use of the technologies Blockchain,
    SDN, and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architecture
    confronts the problems of scalability, flexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats. 5.3. Architectures
    for Smart Grid The automated and intelligent management of the next-generation
    electric power systems determines their effectiveness and efficiency. Smart Grid
    (SG) is the name given to the next generation of electricity systems, which are
    anticipated to offer various benefits over the current systems in terms of digitization,
    flexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustainability, and customization [179].
    Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies to improve power quality.
    Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric devices remotely in
    real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate their local devices.
    The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented by using the electrical
    and communication infrastructures that connect the transmission and customer domains.
    The distribution domain includes distribution feeders and transformers to supply
    electricity. It interacts with much different equipment, such as distributed energy
    resources (DERs), plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure
    (AMI), and sensors with communication capability. The distribution domain is responsible
    for delivering electricity to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability.
    To provide quality electricity, the stability of this domain is monitored and
    controlled. Typical applications [44] of the smart grid communications network
    are automatic meter reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and
    DERs/microgrid. DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked
    to the distribution system. Distributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS),
    or a combination of renewable and non-renewable sources are all possible sources
    for DER. Solar panels, wind turbines, combustion turbines, fuel cells, battery
    storage systems, etc., are a few examples of DER. An electric power system with
    one or more DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid. The communication
    infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities of the smart grid and
    complies with performance standards. This infrastructure connects a huge number
    of electric devices and manages complex device communications. As a result, it
    is built in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected individual sub-networks,
    and each sub-network is responsible for separate geographical regions. The extremely
    dispersed smaller area networks that support the power systems at various locations
    are connected by WANs, which act as the communication’s backbone. When the control
    centers are located a great distance from the substations or the end-users, the
    real-time measurements made at the electric devices are transported to the control
    centers through the WANs, and in the opposite direction, the WANs carry out the
    instruction communications from the control centers to the electric devices. The
    authors of [43] present a communication architecture in an SG. This architecture
    includes (1) an energy smart house with electric appliances connected to the smart
    grid, (2) a residential complex with AMI, (3) a residential subdivision installed
    with solar panels, (4) a PEV charging station, (5) a power substation, and (6)
    power transmission lines. In this architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as
    the backbone in connecting the distributed sub-networks. Demertzis et al. [180]
    presented and categorized the communication network standards that have been established
    for smart grids and should be considered in planning and implementing new infrastructures.
    Such standards are IEC 61850 for substation automation. This standard is based
    on open architecture and incorporates sampling and timing synchronization specifications
    based on IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181]. Notably, IEEE 1588 is the standard
    for a precision clock synchronization protocol for networked measurement and control
    systems [182]. Due to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)
    throughout the power grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution
    networks in smart grids would undergo significant changes to accommodate the nature
    of non-radial power flow. For the most part, the low-voltage distribution networks
    where RERs (such as solar cells) may be attached are not monitored by the majority
    of the present supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for power
    grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control, Abdrabou [183] presented
    a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse structure that may
    supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage distribution networks.
    A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also presented as a useful method
    for prioritizing data transfer across the newly introduced network architecture.
    HetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network design with a specific QoS routing method
    for power distribution grid applications. It delivers QoS assurances across the
    network while taking into account three factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability.
    The authors created two components to accomplish this: A multipath routing mechanism
    that compensates critical applications for their high-reliability requirements
    by using end-to-end physically disjoint paths, and Altruistic resource allocation
    with the QoS routing mechanism that targets communication with QoS guarantees
    for applications with strict QoS requirements. The findings in [184] show that
    the HetGrid overlay network architecture enables extremely effective, trustworthy,
    and QoS-aware communication in heterogeneous networks. The major characteristics
    that set SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are the ability to execute
    two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time pricing. The present
    SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to be protocol independent.
    Therefore, global communication network management and monitoring approaches have
    been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network administrators may more
    efficiently manage their networks by separating the control plane from the data
    plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication networks. SDN
    implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efficiency and resilience.
    SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and protocols by virtue
    of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity capabilities to
    cope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185] presented SDN-based
    SGC architectures, along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for
    SDN-based SGC and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied
    to SDN-based SGC. Alam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication
    networks in terms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,
    and applications. They proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication Network
    for Smart Grid. CR is a software-defined radio (SDR) platform that can quickly
    reconfigure its operating parameters, such as modulation/demodulation, compression
    algorithm, and error coding techniques, according to changing circumstances and
    requirements, through cognition. In such an SDR platform, radio transceivers can
    switch functions and operations on demand only. Molokomme et al. [187] reviewed
    architectures that aim to accomplish the various and strict QoS requirements in
    SG communication systems. Wireless communication networks have been motivated
    to harvest energy from ambient environments and run energy-efficiently for economic
    and ecological benefits through improvements in the smart power grid and the advocacy
    of “green communications”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments in energy
    harvesting, redistribution, trade, and planning for future wireless networks integrating
    with smart grids. The authors considered the optimization of various energy-harvesting
    wireless systems as well as traditional models of renewable energy-harvesting
    technologies. Moreover, they discussed how to distribute redundant (unused) energy
    generated by cellular networks, plan for energy under dynamic pricing when smart
    grids are in place, and engage in two-way energy trading using smart grids. From
    a different viewpoint, including IoT devices and providing connectivity, automation,
    and monitoring for such devices enables SG systems to sustain multiple network
    operations during the generation, distribution, transmission, and expenditure
    of energy. Numerous IoT-aided SG systems have been proposed in the literature.
    The survey [189] on IoT-aided SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures,
    uses, and prototypes. 5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings There are various
    building applications such as heating, cooling, load control, air quality, ventilation,
    lighting, water management, and cooking gas management. A smart building incorporates
    the major building systems on a common network and functionality to provide operational
    efficiency, fire safety, and security. A smart building architecture (SBA) manages
    several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation, air cleaning,
    HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation and monitoring);
    smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management); a smart fire
    detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart building [190]
    has security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality system, a fire alarm
    system, a water management system, and an energy management system. Moreover,
    it can detect intrusion and supports HVAC services. Diverse SBAs include complex
    operational systems, sensing, and communication technologies. Such architectures
    have converged into an IP-based architecture. This convergence is occurring rapidly
    with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices driven through IoT concerning
    conventional building management and smart buildings. Traditionally, numerous
    building systems utilized varied forms of networking protocols and cabling systems.
    This variety makes the whole system more complex and highly infeasible from both
    a deployment and a system administration standpoint [191]. SBAs entail making
    plans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational technologies that improve
    the application’s, service’s, or provision’s operational steps while also boosting
    the well-being of its users. Researchers, policymakers, and implementers should
    pay attention to several crucial issues, such as reliable communication/connection
    procedures, power-efficient measures, competent security measures, efficient sensors
    and actuators, and data analytics procedures. Amalgamating new systems and technologies
    with conventional (base) technologies to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes,
    but is not limited to, WSN deployment; advanced power-aware traffic engineering
    policies; cloud, edge, and fog computing paradigms; big data engineering and analytics;
    and human–computer interaction procedures [192]. The rapid development of ICT
    technologies has enhanced the connectedness of intelligent sensing, actuators,
    and communication devices to real-time physical entities. Recently, smart sensing
    mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology have boosted the area of
    SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies for a particular smart
    building domain poses significant difficulties, including heterogeneity of IoT
    devices and applications, workable networking protocols and architectures, power
    efficiency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One solution is the SDN paradigm,
    which manages the network more efficiently than a customary one. SDN also assists
    network services, including storage, routing, dynamic bandwidth management, and
    QoS. Hence, these simplifications offer a creative environment through the implementation
    of proper software tools for smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation
    for intelligent infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home
    automation and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing
    based on SDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that
    improves critical SB parameters such as bandwidth efficiency, energy efficiency,
    latency, security, and reliability. Silva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things
    (WoT) SBA that is integrated with the representational state transfer (RESTful)
    application programming interface (API). The RESTful API employs HTTP requests
    (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT data. Regarding network
    performance and smart building power management, the authors showed how their
    recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance. Smart sensing
    devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or modifying
    vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.
    These systems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms, power,
    and transceiver modules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based SBAs for
    assessing and regulating air quality, smart lighting systems, fire detection systems,
    power management, and other basic building operations. An indoor-air-quality-based
    SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for monitoring and regulating
    air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing system was initially
    suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature, and relative humidity.
    Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198]. Considering smart
    indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed in the literature.
    In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system to satisfy the users’
    needs. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption reduction via energy-efficient
    smart lighting systems. Today’s smart building employs low-power usage LED-based
    light sources that last longer than Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In
    reality, the development of control technologies, heterogeneous networks, and
    embedded systems has made it promising to create smart innovative lighting systems
    that can effectively address the problem of energy conservation. Researchers have
    recently begun testing by integrating different power-saving techniques in a single
    illumination system for improved energy efficiency while enhancing lighting performance
    without sacrificing user satisfaction. According to the authors of [201], using
    several cheap detectors, as opposed to a single expensive sensor, would result
    in improved performance and higher power savings. Considering the same motivation,
    various authors [202,203,204] have suggested similar types of smart lighting systems
    for several room types, such as classrooms and offices. In [205], the authors
    provide a deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing on
    power savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration
    of visible light communication technology [206]. Recently, researchers focused
    on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work performance and thermal comfort, to
    propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented Technologies (OOT) have
    been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal comfort while conserving
    energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the drawbacks of the
    automatic control used today. In practice, thermal comfort analysis is based on
    parallel objective and subjective evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises
    monitoring, assessing, and recording the status of environmental parameters through
    dedicated sensors and instruments following standardized guidelines. Subjective
    evaluation involves monitoring, assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal
    sensation, and thermal environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor
    results as the cumulative method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found
    in [193]. Green building refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that
    adjusts to predetermined circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation,
    the system makes full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather
    data and subsequently allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The
    ambient intelligence concept aims to conserve natural resources with limited and
    efficient use of them to offer comfort to the occupants. Through unconventional
    energy sources, it also meets some of the conventional energy requirements [207].
    Many aspects of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and power efficiency, are
    the subject of extensive study. However, one of the most important functions of
    an SB system is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by HVAC
    systems [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial buildings
    for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for this
    context. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of rated fan
    energy can be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect on a building’s
    indoor temperature. The method of computational control for passive and active
    sources was used in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized the problem that
    the ambient and active sources of lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling, and
    shading are not synchronized in buildings. Such a computational control scheme
    is also suitable for reducing daily power usage. Similarly, numerous methods [211,212,213]
    considering HVAC systems have been proposed with respect to frequency regulation,
    predictive control, and smart controller. An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks
    environmental situations. It also notifies when measurements exceed thresholds
    and provides data on energy usage and consumption. In addition, it can autonomously
    turn equipment intermittently at programmed times. As individuals spend more time
    indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed spaces) than outdoors, the air quality
    inside buildings should be improved along with that of the external surroundings.
    This is the task of indoor Air Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS). The basic parts
    of an AQMS (Figure 5) are a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal
    conditioning circuit, a small amount of external memory, and a communication module
    that is typically wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors
    that can detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2,
    CO, and O3, as well as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity
    and temperature. These sensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values
    of the real-time indoor air quality parameters and an external memory used to
    store real-time data [214]. When deploying such systems, various communication
    (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and LoRAWAN technologies, are considered.
    Figure 5. Air Quality Monitoring Sensor System. Adapted from [215,216]. Figure
    5 shows a typical sensor system for an indoor environment for air quality monitoring.
    Figure 6 shows an SBA architecture [217]. The system of this architecture collects
    vital information about the various air quality parameters, including CO2, CO,
    particles (Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5), and some other crucial parameters
    such as humidity and temperature. By using gas sensor boards and wasp motes, the
    authors created a method for collecting and monitoring the indoor atmosphere.
    For monitoring CO2 and CO parameters, they also used TGS 4161 and TGS 2442 gas
    sensors. These sensors usually work using the resistive heating principle. The
    TGS 2442 sensor has excellent sensitivity to fluctuations in CO gas concentration.
    This sensor’s internal resistance, or “IR”, is inversely proportionate to the
    amount of CO present. As the CO content rises, the IR falls. While TGS 4161 also
    offers low power consumption and suggests better performance in detecting changes
    in CO2 gas concentration, the TGS4161 is ideally suited for indoor air control
    applications as it can measure 350–10,000 ppm carbon dioxide. The authors used
    the DustTrak DRX, a specialized aerosol laser photometer that simultaneously measures
    mass and size fraction, for PM1 and PM2.5 monitoring purposes. To define and create
    an interface to the deployed sensor for wireless transmission of gathered aerosol
    data, this photometer is connected to a base station device via LAN. The authors
    also set up ZB (ENs) at each location that was taken into consideration, which
    sent updates on the air quality and aerosols at regular periods to BS (ZBC) that
    had already been set up. Figure 6. IAQMS architecture. Adapted from [217,218].
    This system assesses the indoor air quality to assess the current state of the
    indoor environment while simultaneously providing real-time inputs for HVAC system
    management. The authors also designed a toolkit that analyzes real-time air quality
    data and displays them through meaningful representations to service the SBAs.
    Likewise, Lozano et al. [216] proposed another IAQMS technique that considers
    a star topological architecture [217]. The ZB (ENs) in this technique is based
    on the XBee and XBee pro-version modules. Nevertheless, the suggested scheme [216]
    considers a single pollutant only, i.e., suggesting using a GAC sensor. Conversely,
    the authors of [215] further claimed that they considered seven pollutants in
    their proposed implementation. IoE for Smart Building: To achieve optimal functionality
    and energy-efficient performance, Kim et al. [218] offered an overview of the
    design and implementation of energy-related SB technologies, including energy
    management systems, renewable energy applications, and current advanced smart
    technologies. Undoubtedly, the electricity sector of smart cities is impacted
    by the Internet of Energy (IoE), which aims to increase energy efficiency, prevent
    energy waste, and enhance environmental conditions by integrating IoT technologies
    into distributed energy systems. Two examples of IoE technology are intelligent
    sensor use and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. As a result, the
    IoE is becoming a tool for legal science to support the goals of a smart city.
    Metallidou et al. [219] discussed the factors that prompted the European Union
    to create regulations to make it easier to transition current towns into smart
    cities, starting with existing structures. To achieve energy efficiency, the authors
    suggested a smart building template that uses IoT technology to manage the performance
    of all technical systems. In addition, they suggested an automated remote-control
    technique supported by a cloud interface to enhance the certification of existing
    buildings for energy performance. This technology reduces time-consuming processes
    and stores the energy performance of each building on a cloud platform to make
    decisions and put measures in place. A review of current tactics in the field
    of active building energy management systems (BEMS) was offered by Mariano-Hernández
    et al. [220]. The authors reviewed articles on several BEMS management techniques
    for residential and non-residential buildings, including Model Predictive Control
    (MPC), Demand Side Management (DSM), Optimization, and Fault Detection and Diagnostics
    (FDD). MPC predicts building response to control requests, while DSM is an agreement
    of actions to improve the energy system on the user side. FDD is an automatic
    procedure of detecting and separating flaws in BEMS to protect a system from additional
    harm. Moudgil et al. [221] examined cutting-edge academic and industrial research
    to discover significant technological solutions that improve the integration of
    IoT in building infrastructure (BI). Their review also identifies key technical
    and non-technical problems that must be resolved through extensive research for
    BI to fully incorporate IoT. The authors contend that IoT in BI is still not operationally
    capable. IoT and BI stakeholders must make a concerted effort to give modern BI
    access to a generic IoT framework with cognitive intelligence and context-aware
    computing capabilities. 5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring Retrofitting
    the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some benefits,
    including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert
    utilities to pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network, allowing
    them to remotely adjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224]. Automation
    can be used for both operational procedures and components that provide functionality.
    For instance, when a water problem occurs during operation or with the element
    itself, the smart components inform the system center and then take action to
    avert a crash. The water utility can also determine a sensor’s requirement for
    maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic self-verification mechanism
    [225]. In [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid architecture
    that includes technical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework. Moreover,
    this smart water system (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms, simulation
    procedures, diagnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control mechanisms.
    Although an SWS incorporates offline performance, real-time performance is defined
    by online procedures such as online data monitoring, online data assimilation,
    online modeling, online charting, and online results output. An SWS must have
    real-time functionality to implement the necessary smart features [227]. Researchers
    put a lot of effort [228] into developing water systems that operate intelligently.
    Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time controlling, etc., which seek
    to reduce the lag between system input and system output, should be added to the
    smart performance of SWS. It was discovered that using SCADA would considerably
    increase the data transfer efficiency [229]. A smart water architecture [230]
    often includes five layers: (1) the physical layer; (2) the sensing and control
    layer; (3) the communication layer; (4) the data management layer; and (5) the
    data fusion layer. Within the framework of the GST4Water project, the authors
    of [230] presented a system that allows for receiving consumption data sent by
    a generic smart meter installed in a user’s house and transferring them to a cloud
    platform. The consumption data are saved and processed to characterize leakage
    at the district meter area and the individual user level. Meanwhile, the processed
    data are returned to the Water Utility and can be used for billing. On the other
    hand, they provide regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness of
    their consumption behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework
    based on FIWARE that aims to realize a highly flexible standards-based open-source
    software solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting
    of various FIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis
    et al. [232] considered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding
    conventional water metering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted
    bi-directional (whenever required) data exchange between water flow devices, metering
    equipment, and end-users. The authors’ ultimate objective is to design, implement,
    and deploy more sophisticated infrastructure offering improved performance in
    bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit the amount of data that needs to be
    shared between the various system layers, their approach makes use of the FogC
    paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water grid model. The Information
    and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the Efficient Water Resources
    Management project was funded by the European Commission under the auspices of
    the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the Smart Water project is to
    examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively managing urban water systems,
    with a focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues
    such as leakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.
    Kulkarni and Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,
    proposed a framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost
    of ownership, and highlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’ Smart
    Water case studies. Pipelines are used to transport water, gases, and oil. Since
    they are frequently underground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes them, which
    may result in leaks. In addition, water in the pipelines may get contaminated
    by infectious agents or substances that are mistakenly or purposely introduced
    into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline networks is crucial for maintaining
    public health and protecting the environment. The sensor node deployment profoundly
    impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline network monitoring, including
    coverage area, coverage population, and detection time. The sensor nodes should
    typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s junctions [234]. Given the
    design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor node deployment challenges
    are therefore formulated as integer optimization problems, where the integer variables
    represent the maximum amount of sensor nodes that must be placed at each junction.
    The deployment difficulties for pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging
    to solve because of the integer decision variables. Pipeline network flows are
    not predictable. As a result, depending on the flow pattern, the sensing performance
    of a deployed sensor node may vary. As a result, the flow pattern is taken into
    account in [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to decide
    how to deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a
    branch and bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify the
    ideal answer, the time complexity is typically significant. This means that large
    pipeline networks cannot be used with the method. Similarly, the study in [236]
    considers the various demand patterns of water flows through pipes. The authors
    used a genetic-based method to find the best deployment locations to increase
    coverage under various monitoring station demand patterns. The global optimum
    of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach. The performance of
    the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices. Consequently,
    we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks. Singapore’s WaterWise@SG
    program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate burst incidents [237,238].
    PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to find pipeline leaks, where
    three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure. To reduce
    water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track water consumption
    for businesses. A Steamflood and Waterflood Tracking System [240] has been created
    to find irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks and bottlenecks. With
    the aid of all these technologies, the investigators had the opportunity to evaluate
    the efficiency of the monitoring algorithms. However, these technologies rely
    on fixed sensors, and we still need to put innovative testbed models and systems
    built around crowd sensing and mobile WSN into place. 5.6. Architectures for Smart
    Transportation The Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce
    traffic congestion and accidents. It also enables information exchange involving
    the vehicle and all entities that may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking
    and vehicle intelligence are the two technologies that underpin IoV implementation.
    The three components that compose vehicle networking are the onboard information
    service, VANET, and mobile network. VANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range
    communication. Providing remote location, remote diagnostics, navigation, and
    other information services is referred to as an onboard information service. Every
    car can be utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks to mobile networks. Vehicle
    intelligence is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence
    (AI), big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing (CogC),
    to facilitate information sharing among people and vehicles, as well as between
    vehicles and the environment, infrastructure, or other vehicles. Vehicular networks
    consist of data-gathering sensors and inter-vehicle communication systems. Such
    networks require an open and flexible layered architecture to handle characteristics
    such as interoperability, scalability, dependability, and modularity. Recently,
    the research community proposed efficient vehicle network architectures. For example,
    the Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture [241] includes seven layers. Offering services
    and choosing messaging protocols are tasks that fall within the application layer.
    Data preprocessing, big data processing, and intelligent transmission are all
    tasks that the multimedia and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems,
    the cloud service layer’s ClCom and cloud virtualization technologies offer hardware
    computing platforms, infrastructure, and software services. In the UIoV architecture,
    the communication layer and the intra–inter devices layer are merged to accomplish
    the connectivity of many heterogeneous objects and networks. Notably, there is
    no intra–inter devices layer in classical architecture. The UIoV system’s physical
    objects layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter devices layer
    for additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are
    identified using the Identification Layer. Liu et al. [242] suggested another
    IoV network architecture to increase the flexibility of application management
    while enhancing the scalability and dependability of information services. This
    architecture has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety of
    nodes with various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of
    IoV is frequently changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced
    and transmitted at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the
    underlying resources, the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes
    and the network, computation, communication, and storage resources in IoV. To
    execute applications such as road safety management and data sensing, the control
    layer’s SDN controller is responsible for scheduling the abstraction resources
    of the virtualization layer and interacting with the application layer. A difficult
    topic in network architecture design is dealing with diverse networks. Interoperability,
    scalability, dependability, and adaptability are some of its network features.
    The design seeks to increase layer separation and network architecture’s total
    number of layers. In addition to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture
    should facilitate the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other
    communication devices. By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving
    systems, the learning ability of autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved.
    Utilizing both physical and network data space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles
    (CIoV) paradigm [243] improves network security and transportation safety. CIoV
    enables IoV to bear more accurate perceptive ability through cognition in the
    intra-vehicle network (driver, passengers, smart devices, etc.), inter-vehicle
    network (adjacent intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network (road environment,
    cellular network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture includes
    a cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road
    condition investigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture of
    CIoV. The gathering and preprocessing of big data from several sources are done
    by the sensing layer. As opposed to the previous communication layer (of other
    architectures), the architecture’s communication layer uses a cloud/edge hybrid
    structure to accommodate various application schedules. The data cognition engine
    at the cognition layer processes and interprets heterogeneous data streams (machine
    learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety of cognitive analysis approaches.
    The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in charge of allocating and scheduling
    network resources with the aid of technologies such as NFV, SDN, network slicing,
    and self-organized networking (SON). There are primarily two categories in the
    application layer (i.e., usual application services and intelligent transportation
    applications). Efficient message authentication and integrity are required to
    guarantee vehicle privacy and safeguard vehicular communications. To protect V2V
    and V2I communications in the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber
    threats, Karim [244] provided a cryptography-based routing solution. This solution
    includes a data encryption and decryption mechanism based on attributes and identity
    that has the lowest computational overhead while keeping the optimum level of
    security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245] suggested a seven-layer network architecture.
    The user interface layer, which controls information exchange between the user
    and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units (RSUs) and onboard
    sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing and filtering
    layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data before sending
    the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission. Making
    choices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities of control
    and management. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing layer
    to create the pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop assaults,
    the security layer directly manages each of the layers above. A unique network
    architecture with enhanced throughput, reduced latency, higher security, and widespread
    connectivity was recently proposed by Ji et al. [246]. This architecture consists
    of four layers: Security authentication layer: The RSUs on the road may monitor
    traffic environment data in real-time after setting several sensors, surveillance
    footage, and radar. This layer determines the legality of the car and RSU that
    are requesting to join the network. Perhaps an illegal vehicle or an RSU that
    has been installed unlawfully will attempt to steal or alter the information of
    a real vehicle. Data acquisition layer: This layer collects and categorizes many
    types of data from various networks. To ensure that the data can be sent to the
    edge layer securely, it digitizes the data. Edge layer: Edge devices produce several
    data streams. As a result, processing and analyzing data in one go using ClCom
    will result in significant delays. As a result, we must process data more closely
    related to the data source. The edge node, a physical device situated closest
    to the data source, is used by the edge layer to carry out basic processing and
    analysis on the acquired local data. It releases data analysis findings for nearby
    traffic incidents and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a local
    decision-making plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud data
    center’s computing power. Cloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses
    the information it has collected about global traffic in this tier, develops a
    plan, and rationally distributes traffic resources. This layer, having the ability
    to implement connection management, data management, aided autonomous driving,
    intelligent navigation, path planning, and information security, is the “smart
    brain” of the IoV. A blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)
    for the smart city was presented in [247]. Building innovative distributed transport
    management systems is made possible by the robust and secure Block-VN architecture.
    The authors considered how the network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused
    on networking and vehicular information. To handle real-time transportation data,
    Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing transportation data using Spark
    and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four layers: data collection and
    acquisition, network, data processing, and application. Each layer is built to
    process and manage data in a structured manner. On the data processing layer,
    Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing the suggested event and
    decision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249], the data are made available
    to a smart community member. The suggested approach was examined using transportation
    datasets from some reliable sources. The outcomes demonstrate data processing
    and real-time distribution to citizens in the shortest amount of time. Spark with
    the Hadoop environment produces findings that are quite accurate. From another
    viewpoint, Social IoV (SIoV) are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks
    [250], where vehicular nodes share/exchange information with different entities
    and are thus forth comparable with traditional social networks. Kerrache et al.
    [251] proposed a trust-aware communication architecture for social IoV (TACASHI),
    which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication architecture
    for SIoVs. 5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart Villages The smart village
    paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities using IoT technologies.
    In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried out, including smart agriculture,
    waste management, irrigation management, livestock management, smart energy, smart
    healthcare, and smart education. A smart village or smart rural area can enable
    real-time data analytics and automate decision-making for local villagers regarding
    healthcare, agriculture, environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from
    a smart city as there are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and
    sustainability) between urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart
    village goal, The European Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in
    which it proposed to interfere ICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254]
    addressed the meaning of “smart” in rural contexts as well as its link with sustainability.
    The European Commission-funded Smart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the
    ultimate goal of encouraging and motivating communities to create and execute
    smart village methods and tactics throughout Europe as a tool for rural development,
    serving as the authors’ primary source. IEEE Smart Village [256] also supports
    the world’s energy-impoverished communities by providing a complete solution combining
    renewable energy, community-based education, and entrepreneurial opportunities.
    Malik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart villages with
    different technologies. They concluded that digitization is only possible if a
    reliable and robust network and communication infrastructure are installed in
    the village environment. Shrestha and Drozdenko [258] proposed a Smart Rural framework
    to mitigate the effects of climate change using IoT and the Cloud, building a
    prototype on the Louisiana Tech University campus. Their framework is an energy-efficient
    monitoring system for observing the environmental conditions that affect agricultural
    production and human health. It consists of the following subsystems: Wireless
    Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud Services, and a Web Dashboard. The dashboard converts
    raw sensor data into meaningful information from which public officials and residents
    can adapt to or frustrate the effects of climate change. Monzon Baeza and Alvarez
    Marban [259] proposed a flexible and scalable Smart Rural system for gathering
    and processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional communication
    coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in separate
    segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS). Their
    proposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs of the
    system in the collection of IoT data from these remote rural areas, its coverage
    by space vehicles, and its processing and storage through 5G terrestrial networks
    and cloud services. Their proposal includes the deployment of IoT sensors and
    the development of Amazon Web Services. Conversely, the part of the space segment,
    considered by HAPS, has been simulated for different space channels. This method
    provides a complete and automated smart rural system that allows access to these
    IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet. To provide secure services
    close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored the integration of a Distributed
    Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with IoT in improving security and privacy
    solutions for villagers and consumer electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,
    the authors designed and evaluated the performance of an Intrusion Detection System
    (IDS) in a DFC-based smart village environment. Moreover, they discussed open
    security issues and challenges regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages.
    Rohan et al. [261] proposed a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering
    the resource constraints in a smart village. The authors illustrated the concept
    of collaborative edge computing as applicable to reduce cost and better manage
    the existing infrastructural facilities. Collaboration occurs between the multiple
    IoT edge devices (e.g., the edge data centers or edge routers) for data processing
    and storage. For example, in times of high computational load demand, one village’s
    edge devices can collaborate with another village’s edge devices. 6. Summary Various
    SCAs have different network requirements such as bandwidth, delay tolerance, power
    consumption, reliability, wireless connectivity, mobility, security, and privacy.
    Therefore, they need different protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network architectures
    for IoT are heterogeneous and include various network technologies such as WiFi,
    WSNs, Mesh Wireless Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile Communication
    Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these architectures must
    allow interoperability, while cross-layer design-based recommendations for power
    consumption and congestion control are well-suited proposals. State-of-the-art
    generic network architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm and are
    based on FogC to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.
    Fog and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in
    the future to fulfill QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efficiency.
    The CR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this technology
    can quickly reconfigure the operating parameters of the SG communication system
    to the changing requirements through cognition. By extracting usable data from
    both the physical and network data space, it is possible to increase network security
    and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures will become cognitive.
    These architectures will include cognitive data engines that will conduct cognition
    of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis,
    emotion analysis, and road condition investigation. The networking performance
    of SDN is better than the customary networking of smart buildings (SB). However,
    as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been facing some challenges such as
    network management in terms of maintenance, east–west interface, southbound interface,
    traffic management, energy, ML-based SDN networking for SB, and the network resources
    issue of SB SDN-based networking. 7. Open Research Issues −Network slicing management
    is required: IoT services such as smart transportation and smart energy have diversified
    requirements. To accommodate diverse IoT services, the network slicing paradigm
    is suggested because it enables multiple independent logical networks running
    on the same physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented an architecture
    for intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT) focusing
    on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).
    The authors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing
    management in this field. −NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The
    ETSI Industry Specification Group proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions
    that were before performed by some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the flexible
    provisioning of software-based network functionalities on top of an appropriately
    shared physical infrastructure by separating the network functions from the underlying
    hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing inexpensive commodity servers, it solves
    the issue of operating costs associated with administering and controlling this
    closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is used in conjunction with NFV (the
    software-defined NFV architecture), it can overcome the difficulties associated
    with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic resource management [263].
    SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service environment through NFV. As a
    result, the need for specialized hardware and labor-intensive effort to fulfill
    a new service request is avoided. In conjunction with the use of SDN, NFV also
    allows real-time and dynamic function provisioning along with flexible traffic
    forwarding. The SDN-IoT network may be improved and secured with NVF. It enables
    the software-based deployment of network devices as virtualized components. Throughput
    is increased because of NFV integration in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances
    network performance. To this end, Sinh et al. [264] proposed a practical model
    for hosting IoT services and building SDN controller applications to show that
    SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services. Recently, Mukherjee et al. [265]
    proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV implementation for smart
    cities. −Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology can
    address the bandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can be enabled
    with cognitive functionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum accessing,
    circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs and services can be based
    on CR technology because it can do dynamic sensing and cognition of the surrounding
    environment. For example, in smart grid applications, cognitive IoT can achieve
    the objective of enabling users to know their energy consumption at any time and
    anywhere [267]. In smart home applications, cognitive-radio-equipped sensors can
    handle potential heterogeneous network interference [268]. At the same time, cognitive
    IoT can help with smoother real-time monitoring over longer distances in the healthcare
    industry without worrying about spectrum availability [269]. The complete utilization
    of cognitive radio technology in IoT demands extensive research in spectrum optimization,
    standardization, hardware design, privacy protection, heterogeneous network fusion,
    scalability and flexibility problems, etc. [270]. For this reason, many CIoT-based
    smart city network architectures must be proposed to solve such problems. In this
    regard, Park et al. [271] suggested a CIoT-based smart city network architecture
    that outlines how data collected from SCAs may be analyzed using the CogC paradigm
    and manage the scalability and flexibility challenges. −Challenges in IoT communication
    through TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access Points (APs) can utilize identical
    WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interference problems that can
    significantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many APs can provide
    support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with the DownLink
    multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY layer technology
    (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the capacity of WLANs
    by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations. As a result,
    it is possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to the number of antennas
    on APs. Thus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel and Singh [131] stressed
    the employment of CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods with many APs to improve
    the Compound TCP’s performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL
    method can accelerate the learning processes of the transport protocols such as
    Compound TCP. In FL, training data are dispersed across a large number of clients,
    each having unreliable and comparatively slow network connections, with the aim
    of developing a high-quality centralized model. The authors of [131] insisted
    on using these specialized strategies to coordinate numerous APs with regard to
    losses caused by unique wireless channel characteristics and WiFi downloading
    and uploading dynamics. Through the use of FL and CR approaches in dual AP settings,
    it is now possible to improve the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions. Another
    study [274] assumed TCP Cubic [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the
    FL approach for IoVs. The authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting
    the FL technique, which enhances the efficiency and privacy protection for the
    case of IoVs. −Digital Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources,
    personnel, procedures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital
    twin. Digital twin technology can be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including
    humans, IoT devices, aircraft engines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original
    vehicle is created, for instance, when an automobile business creates a virtual
    representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car model. If a manufacturer creates
    a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the replicated process
    is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a profile of the
    actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this virtual graphic,
    the dynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation are depicted.
    The digital twin can offer the location, state, and/or status of physical assets
    in real-time due to continual learning and advancements. This fusion of the real
    and digital worlds enables organizations to monitor systems, set strategies, and
    anticipate problems before they occur. Digital twins are created using digital
    twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure graphs, AI, software
    analytics, and the IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is demonstrated.
    This technology can efficiently administer the city, from urban planning to the
    optimization of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before
    putting them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.
    If a digital twin is in place, government organizations can only fully assess
    what might be achieved with the data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic
    opportunity, and establish a more cohesive community. Although the idea is currently
    novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few years [277]. −The 6G Network
    for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense and AI-centric
    city because massive device connectivity with vast data traffic is estimated in
    the future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted to the concept
    of Internet of Everything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart cities should have
    a huge bandwidth, low latency, and AI integration. Such networks should also provide
    ubiquity, high QoS, and on-demand content for thousands of interconnected devices.
    The 6G network [278] is the problem-solving network of futuristic cities, with
    huge bandwidth and low latency. It is under development for wireless communications
    technologies supporting cellular data networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks
    will probably be broadband cellular networks, in which the service area is divided
    into small geographical areas (cells). It is expected that 6G will be supported
    by existing 5G infrastructures such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing, together
    with new infrastructure. The network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:
    (1) ultra-fast data rates as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than
    1 ms; (3) increased mobility and coverage; (4) flexible and efficient connection
    of trillion level objects; (5) peak spectral efficiency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very
    high system reliability; and (7) improved network security [279]. However, the
    main problem of 6G is that transmitting at a higher frequency spectrum is prone
    to high path loss, making the distance for transmission limited [280]. The expected
    6G of the radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the capability
    of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability
    of carrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks, such
    as short-range and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can introduce
    complications and hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore, such complications
    of THz waves must be considered, and efficient AI-centric multilayer physical
    network architectures of 6G must be proposed for futuristic smart cities. Farooq
    et al. [280] considered the expectations from a network of futuristic smart cities
    and the problems of THz waves and proposed a conceptual terrestrial network (TN)
    architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a scalable multilayer architecture
    designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart cities. It provides an on-ground
    cloud network that helps smart devices to run AI applications partially on their
    own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore, the distributed and edge computing-oriented
    infrastructure of Bee Hive provides security and reduces traffic load on the upper
    layer of the network. Undoubtedly, pervasive AI is the main enabling technology
    in 6G, while some forms of AI are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples
    of using AI on wireless communications have been proposed, from physical layer
    designs (e.g., channel estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation
    (e.g., traffic control and cache storage management), to security and authentication,
    to dynamic cell and topology formation and management, to fault prediction and
    detection, etc. However, DL-based solutions require high computational complexity,
    which might not fit in current mobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity,
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based RL algorithms must be carefully designed
    to decrease the computational resources required on these devices [282]. Quantum
    communication [283] offers a promising approach to avoiding the challenge of limited
    computational resources and energy efficiency. Applying Artificial Neural Networks
    in IoT also comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy and computational/energy
    requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above issues and envisioned
    6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous systems. Apart
    from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important enabling technologies
    of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies are as follows: Reconfigurable
    Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reflect signals and help in places where
    maintaining Line of Sight (LoS) is difficult. RISs will be mainly deployed on
    doors, windows, and buildings. Cell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology
    is introduced in 5G with a more dense network of access points (APs), and this
    is further developed in 6G to include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287].
    Cell-Free Massive MIMO improves spectral efficiency in communication networks,
    but there are some health risks associated with such a dense network of APs. CubeSat
    communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class spacecraft)
    is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up to 6U, and
    U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units. UAVs/satellite communication. Terahertz communication
    and Optical Wireless Technology [289]. Blockchain technology [290] and quantum
    communication [283]. The development of futuristic smart cities keeps up with
    the development of energy-efficient 6G communication. Kamruzzaman [291] presented
    the key trends in the IoT for energy-efficient 6G wireless communication in smart
    cities. He argues that the application of IoT devices to 6G in smart cities will
    provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency rate, up to 1000 km/h mobility rate,
    100 bps/Hz spectral efficiency, and 1000 GHz frequency. This will resolve the
    issues of energy inefficiency and other concerns in conventional communication
    networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efficient 6G in smart cities via IoT devices
    probably will solve various problems that are encountered by existing smart city
    systems. In futuristic smart cities, residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer
    interface (BCI) technology [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on
    the signals and information that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable
    headsets and devices. It uses human consciousness more than external sources for
    better interaction. As humans have five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell,
    and taste), BCI comprises five datasets, comprising features of human senses that
    are used for human interaction with the machine [292]. 8. Conclusions Utilizing
    resources efficiently, reducing operating expenses, and enhancing city dwellers’
    quality of life are the objectives of the smart city paradigm. This goal is obtained
    by combining various technologies including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big data
    analytics, and robots. For this model, the effective networking and communication
    between the many components required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving
    its objectives. The ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic
    and manageable platforms for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings,
    smart home, smart water, and smart transportation systems. The networking needs
    of the key SCAs were examined in this research, and the appropriate protocols
    that can be applied at different system levels have been identified. Additionally,
    we provided examples of networking protocols and smart grid, intelligent building,
    smart residence, and smart transportation system architectures. We concentrated
    on key criteria for a variety of networking designs, such as energy savings, routing,
    security, dependability, mobility, and support for heterogeneous networks. In
    addition, we presented open research issues. This survey can assist researchers
    to recognize research gaps/problems working in the networking architectures for
    smart cities, and it provides an overview of available protocols and architectures
    for SCAs. Author Contributions Conceptualization, D.K.; methodology, D.K. and

  description: 'A common goal among fisheries science professionals, stakeholders,
    and rights holders is to ensure the persistence and resilience of vibrant fish
    populations and sustainable, equitable fisheries in diverse aquatic ecosystems,
    from small headwater streams to offshore pelagic waters. Achieving this goal requires
    a complex intersection of science and management, and a recognition of the interconnections
    among people, place, and fish that govern these tightly coupled socioecological
    and sociotechnical systems. The World Fisheries Congress (WFC) convenes every
    four years and provides a unique global forum to debate and discuss threats, issues,
    and opportunities facing fish populations and fisheries. The 2021 WFC meeting,
    hosted remotely in Adelaide, Australia, marked the 30th year since the first meeting
    was held in Athens, Greece, and provided an opportunity to reflect on progress
    made in the past 30 years and provide guidance for the future. We assembled a
    diverse team of individuals involved with the Adelaide WFC and reflected on the
    major challenges that faced fish and fisheries over the past 30 years, discussed
    progress toward overcoming those challenges, and then used themes that emerged
    during the Congress to identify issues and opportunities to improve sustainability
    in the world''s fisheries for the next 30 years. Key future needs and opportunities
    identified include: rethinking fisheries management systems and modelling approaches,
    modernizing and integrating assessment and information systems, being responsive
    and flexible in addressing persistent and emerging threats to fish and fisheries,
    mainstreaming the human dimension of fisheries, rethinking governance, policy
    and compliance, and achieving equity and inclusion in fisheries. We also identified
    a number of cross-cutting themes including better understanding the role of fish
    as nutrition in a hungry world, adapting to climate change, embracing transdisciplinarity,
    respecting Indigenous knowledge systems, thinking ahead with foresight science,
    and working together across scales. By reflecting on the past and thinking about
    the future, we aim to provide guidance for achieving our mutual goal of sustaining
    vibrant fish populations and sustainable fisheries that benefit all. We hope that
    this prospective thinking can serve as a guide to (i) assess progress towards
    achieving this lofty goal and (ii) refine our path with input from new and emerging
    voices and approaches in fisheries science, management, and stewardship.'

    Explore all metrics Abstract A common goal among fisheries science professionals,
    stakeholders, and rights holders is to ensure the persistence and resilience of
    vibrant fish populations and sustainable, equitable fisheries in diverse aquatic
    ecosystems, from small headwater streams to offshore pelagic waters. Achieving
    this goal requires a complex intersection of science and management, and a recognition
    of the interconnections among people, place, and fish that govern these tightly
    coupled socioecological and sociotechnical systems. The World Fisheries Congress
    (WFC) convenes every four years and provides a unique global forum to debate and
    discuss threats, issues, and opportunities facing fish populations and fisheries.
    The 2021 WFC meeting, hosted remotely in Adelaide, Australia, marked the 30th
    year since the first meeting was held in Athens, Greece, and provided an opportunity
    to reflect on progress made in the past 30 years and provide guidance for the
    future. We assembled a diverse team of individuals involved with the Adelaide
    WFC and reflected on the major challenges that faced fish and fisheries over the
    past 30 years, discussed progress toward overcoming those challenges, and then
    used themes that emerged during the Congress to identify issues and opportunities
    to improve sustainability in the world''s fisheries for the next 30 years. Key
    future needs and opportunities identified include: rethinking fisheries management
    systems and modelling approaches, modernizing and integrating assessment and information
    systems, being responsive and flexible in addressing persistent and emerging threats
    to fish and fisheries, mainstreaming the human dimension of fisheries, rethinking
    governance, policy and compliance, and achieving equity and inclusion in fisheries.
    We also identified a number of cross-cutting themes including better understanding
    the role of fish as nutrition in a hungry world, adapting to climate change, embracing
    transdisciplinarity, respecting Indigenous knowledge systems, thinking ahead with
    foresight science, and working together across scales. By reflecting on the past
    and thinking about the future, we aim to provide guidance for achieving our mutual
    goal of sustaining vibrant fish populations and sustainable fisheries that benefit
    all. We hope that this prospective thinking can serve as a guide to (i) assess
    progress towards achieving this lofty goal and (ii) refine our path with input
    from new and emerging voices and approaches in fisheries science, management,
    and stewardship. Similar content being viewed by others Stewardship and Sustainable

    2017 A space for ideas and dialogue The first World Fisheries Congress (WFC) was
    held in 1992 in Athens. Since then, the WFC has been held roughly on a quadrennial
    basis in Brisbane, Beijing, Vancouver, Yokohama, Edinburgh, Busan, and Adelaide.
    The WFC brings together knowledge generators, knowledge users, stakeholders, and
    rights holders from around the globe with interests and expertise in fish and
    fisheries. The stated goal of the first WFC was to “bring together fisheries scientists
    and managers in a nongovernment, nonpolitical, academic setting devoted to the
    sharing of research findings and the application of collective knowledge in enhancing
    the scientific management of fisheries resources for sustained human benefits”
    (Nielsen and Wespestad 1993). Aside from emphasizing that the conference is truly
    inclusive of all actors and expertise (including Indigenous ways of knowing as
    well as fisher and community knowledge) whilst creating a space for welcoming
    and training the next generation of fisheries professionals, not much has changed.
    By all accounts, the WFC has become THE event for the global fisheries science
    and management community to assemble and both share with and learn from each other.
    To say that the WFC has become a space for ideas and dialogue understates the
    true impact of the WFC on the fisheries science and management professions and
    global fisheries research and management. The WFC held in Adelaide in 2021 was
    no different, despite that a global pandemic led to a postponement (originally
    scheduled for September 2020) and eventually an online-only conference format
    where participants were limited to virtual interactions given public health restrictions
    on both domestic and international travel. This has been a challenging time for
    all, yet the organizing team used their creativity to craft a conference experience
    that further extended the reach and impact of the event. The theme of the WFC
    in Adelaide was “Sharing our oceans and rivers: a vision for the world’s fisheries.”
    The theme emerged given the challenges of fishing sustainably and maintaining
    prosperous fishing communities from marine and inland systems where functional
    integrity and conservation values are facing increasing pressure. Fisheries are
    just one user of oceans and rivers, and that these systems increasingly have many
    users who need to consider trade-offs and cumulative effects of everyone’s actions.
    Reflecting on the past and providing guidance for the future The 2021 WFC had
    a strong emphasis on documenting progress in the sustainable management of fisheries
    in the almost 30 years since the first WFC in Athens, while also projecting where
    we need and want to be in the next 30 years. A key outcome of the 2021 WFC was
    to identify actions needed over the next few decades to achieve the goal of ensuring
    that the world’s marine, estuarine and freshwater ecosystems and fishery resources
    are vibrant and managed sustainably for the benefit of current and future generations.
    In this paper, we reflect on the past and provide guidance for the future to achieve
    this lofty goal. To do so, we consider two key questions: (1) What were the major
    challenges facing fish/fisheries from the past 30 years and what progress has
    been made to address these challenges? (2) What needs to be done to achieve thriving
    fish populations and sustainable, equitable fisheries in the next 30 years? To
    discuss these key questions, we provide a global perspective, spanning realms
    (e.g., marine, freshwater, estuarine), sectors (e.g., Indigenous, commercial ranging
    from small-scale to industrial, recreational, aquaculture, conservation), and
    disciplinary domains (e.g., oceanography, ecology/biology, sociology, governance,
    policy, legal, economics) with attention given to fish, ecosystems, people, and
    place. Our team of authors was drawn from the International Program Committee
    and plenary speakers from the 2021 WFC, as well as several early-career scholars.
    In sum, the 24 authors reside in 12 countries that span all continents (except
    Antarctica), with roughly equal gender balance, and are drawn from academia, industry,
    government (at various levels from regional to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations—FAO), and the nongovernmental sector. We acknowledge that
    our authorship team does not represent all perspectives, and that some voices,
    in particular Indigenous cultural perspectives, are not represented here. We recognize
    this as a major deficiency to this opinion piece, but have taken this as an opportunity
    to improve our perspectives. This paper is timely and given the diverse perspectives
    of authors (informed by participation in the WFC) we feel that these ideas are
    worth sharing with the broader fisheries science and management community. Approach
    All authors were asked to identify at least three topics for both the backward-
    and forward-looking perspectives with specific examples (including key references)
    based on their expertise, knowledge, and lived experiences. Contributions were
    then sorted into themes. These ideas were further informed by knowledge-sharing
    and lessons from the WFC, during which we conducted this exercise. Our ideas are
    shared in sequence, first presenting our reflections and then providing guidance
    for the future. For both questions, most themes had some level of disciplinary
    organization (e.g., human dimensions, governance, stock assessment) but, for the
    future, we also identified a number of cross-cutting themes that were less specific
    to a given discipline (e.g., climate change, fish and food systems, foresight
    science, Indigenous ways of knowing). We recognize that outputs from such types
    of exercises reflect the interests and expertise of those who participate so it
    is possible (if not even likely) that there are other examples or issues that
    have been overlooked. This is particularly evident for our reflections on the
    past 30 years (Question 1), where some of the examples are narrowly scoped. It
    is impossible to comprehensively review three decades of fisheries science and
    advancement here so we have focused on the major challenges and advancements in
    the field within the last 30 years and intentionally focused the majority of our
    effort on the prospective Question 2. Q1 What were the major challenges facing
    fish and fisheries over the past 30 years and what progress has been made? Over
    the past 30 years, fisheries have faced numerous challenges, six of the major
    ones and the progress to address them are discussed here. Reconsidered how fisheries
    assessment and management are conducted Over the past few decades, fisheries science
    has put increasing focus into managing fisheries and their associated ecosystems.
    Thirty years ago, conflicting stock assessments, and data analysis methods, as
    well as limited data or incomplete data resulted in a lack of management action,
    biomass decline, and stock collapses in many fisheries (Hilborn et al. 2020).
    Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) (Butterworth 2007; Punt et al. 2016), regarded
    as FAO best practice, is gradually being adopted (admittedly, mostly in developed
    nations) as a method for testing management decision-making rules in generalized
    operating models that capture a wider range of uncertainty than the single ‘best
    assessment model’ paradigm (Parma 2002; Kaplan et al. 2021). MSE can evaluate
    performance trade-offs between competing objectives (e.g., conservation and optimal
    utilisation) of alternative management procedures. It is increasingly employed
    by fisheries managers stakeholders, and rights holders to select new management
    strategies or examine effectiveness of existing strategies. Market-based instruments,
    including the global certification and ratings systems (e.g. Marine Stewardship
    Council, Seafood Watch, the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, Global
    Seafood Ratings Alliance, and Friend of the Sea), have incentivised fisheries
    to improve their management and governance since commencing several decades ago.
    Now, nearly 30% of global wild production is certified, rated, or in a fisheries
    improvement project (Potts et al. 2017). Certification schemes have been seen
    as a particularly promising tool to address areas where traditional governance
    has been less impactful, such as global fisheries, by utilizing consumer power
    to affect market advantages and access. Certification has an impact on improving
    management processes through the requirement for implementation of management
    procedures that have been demonstrated to be robust and precautionary via MSE.
    At the time of the first WFC, there was some awareness of the need for an ecosystem
    perspective, but no clear framework or even a definition in the context of fisheries
    existed. Since then, discussions were dominated by debates regarding the definitions
    and concepts of ecosystem-based management (EBM; Larkin 1996; Long et al. 2015)
    and then to sharpening them into more tangible management concepts [whether EBM
    across all users and components, or the more fisheries-focused ecosystem-based
    fisheries management (EBFM; Pikitch et al. 2004) or the ecosystem approach to
    fisheries management (EAF; FAO 2003)]. Now, we have largely moved on from debates
    about the concept’s rationale, to actually implementing ecosystem-based approaches,
    which has included exploring the socio-political aspects beyond natural science
    considerations and learning from the longitudinal results of the earliest case
    studies where such more integrated management has been at least partially attempted
    (FAO 2009; Patrick and Link 2015a,b; Long et al. 2015). Similarly in freshwater
    systems, early studies of inland fisheries focused on simple population fluctuations
    through time as a function of either fishing effort or threats such as climate,
    alternative water uses, and diversions (Welcomme 2016). However, in recent years,
    there has been a substantial shift in thinking, and recognition of the major role
    environmental drivers (such as river flow, habitat and climate conditions) have
    in the production of freshwater fisheries biomass and sustaining the diversity
    of fish assemblages (Hoeinghaus et al. 2009; Arthington et al. 2016). Although
    overfishing can occur in inland waters (Allan et al. 2005), many of the declines
    to inland fisheries come from external factors (e.g., water extraction, pollution,
    habitat degradation), and the management of these threats are now featuring in
    the management of freshwater ecosystems and inland fisheries globally (Cooke et
    al. 2016; Tickner et al. 2020). At this point, many of these issues remain but
    at least the issue has been formally acknowledged including by FAO. In 2015, FAO
    convened the first ever inland fisheries conference resulting in the “Rome Declaration”
    which presents ten steps needed to achieve responsible and sustainable inland
    fisheries (Taylor and Bartley 2016). Fisheries management is now recognized as
    being conducted in a multiple-use environment, which must consider fisheries along
    with other issues and sectors—such as aquaculture, conservation, shipping, energy
    generation, and tourism, to name but a few. To fully capture the range of responses
    to dynamic systems (whether rivers or oceans), whose changes are intensified by
    climate change, a broader suite of environmental, social, and political conditions
    needs to be routinely considered and adapted (Szuwalski and Hollowed 2016). All
    of these considerations—along with recognized limited and ineffective management
    of fisheries in many locations historically—has continually motivated a shift
    to more integrated systems (Link et al. 2018), though much more remains to be
    done. Developed assessment and information systems Assessment approaches and information
    systems (i.e., data gathering and information sharing) have also evolved substantially
    over the past 30 years, although they are still mainly focused on the biophysical
    systems and much less so on social and economic information. In the 1990s, the
    internet was in its earliest stages and assessment materials were available in
    paper reports with limited distribution. Today, bodies such as the International
    Council for the Exploration of the Sea and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration follow transparency rules, attempting to share online not only
    the assessment processes but also the input data and outcomes (e.g., https://www.ices.dk/data/assessment-tools/Pages/transparent-assessment-framework.aspx).
    These statistics are often reported publicly using simplified metrics in a timely
    manner via the internet, enabling local managers, stakeholders, and rights holders
    to review and consider recent data for decision making. However, not all countries
    and regions have yet established such transparent systems, many remain capacity-limited,
    continue to have sparsely available data, or are challenged by the complexity
    of highly diverse multi-species, multi-fleet fisheries, the scale and dispersed
    nature of small-scale fisheries, or disputed maritime borders. The methods used
    have also evolved. Models of single-species based population dynamics still dominate
    in many jurisdictions, but their best practice use includes frameworks that explore
    uncertainties and connect to clear harvest control rules (http://www.capamresearch.org/)
    and MSE options (Punt et al. 2016). They have also been complemented with an expanding
    diversity of tools for data poor situations (Dowling et al. 2016; Carruthers and
    Hordyk 2018) and clear guidance on the use of such tools (Harford et al 2021),
    as well as for multispecies fisheries and ecosystems (Plagányi et al. 2013). Nonetheless,
    failures of fisheries management in data (and capacity) poor regions of the world
    remains a critical area for fisheries throughout much of the world. New methods
    for direct estimates of abundance (e.g., close kin; Bravington et al. 2016) will
    hopefully reduce the over-reliance on fishery dependent data. Information handling
    has also advanced. While data remain a limiting factor, particularly in terms
    of coverage of multiple ecosystem components, the volume of available data has
    grown extensively over the last few decades (Farley et al. 2018). While biological
    surveys and fisheries dependent data remain the two most common forms of data
    available for stock assessment, significant advances have been made towards including
    data from different sources such as genetics and genomics (Bravington et al. 2016),
    including environmental DNA (Rourke et al. 2021), remote sensing (of habitats
    and fishing fleets, e.g., global fishing watch; Nugent 2019), supply chain tracking,
    and acoustics. Handling these data presents a significant challenge for operators,
    researchers, and management bodies. Transparency and knowledge sharing also means
    that interactive and updating online information systems (such as FAO GlobeFish
    https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/globefish-home/en/), which are accessible
    by the public or at the very least stakeholders and rights holders, have become
    an increasingly expected norm, especially among developed nations. Developments
    in assessment methodology and information systems have put fisheries management
    on a path towards success although more work is needed to incorporate diverse
    data streams in a more timely manner. Documented threats for fish and fisheries
    Over the past 30 years, much effort has focused on documenting threats facing
    fisheries and aquatic ecosystems. From pollution to illegal, unreported and unregulated
    (IUU) fishing, to habitat alteration and loss, bycatch, climate change, and recently
    Covid-19, the negative impacts are common and extensive. There have also been
    many successes in the marine realm (e.g., bycatch reduction; Squires et al. 2018;
    Komoroske and Lewison 2015), though there is insufficient space to explore all
    of these topics in detail here. Notably, however, we are now beginning to realize
    that these (and other issues) are also problematic in inland waters (Reid et al.
    2019). Indeed, recognizing that freshwater fish populations are in decline because
    of a myriad of threats (Dudgeon et al. 2006; Reid et al. 2019) has been an important
    development, but we have yet to successfully reverse that trend (Harrison et al.
    2018; Tickner et al. 2020). The effects of dams on fish, for example, have now
    been well documented with much effort focused on identifying environmental flows
    (Poff and Zimmerman 2010) and development of effective fish passage (Schilt 2007;
    Silva et al. 2018) and even, in a few countries, some dam removal (Bednarek 2001;
    Magilligan et al. 2016). Yet dam construction has continued if not escalated throughout
    the world (Zarfl et al. 2015), with more dams being developed and planned, particularly
    in mega-diverse regions, where there can be dire consequences for biodiversity,
    local livelihoods, and nutritional security (Winemiller et al. 2016). Invasive
    species are also now well recognized for their threats to freshwaters (and increasingly
    in marine systems) yet introductions (intentional and accidental) continue (Havel
    et al. 2015). A threat that became apparent during the last few decades was the
    effect of natural disasters on fishing communities, which was exemplified by the
    2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami, devastating to coastal fishing communities
    (De Silva and Yamao 2007). Extreme flood and drought events in freshwater ecosystems
    have impacted the recreational fishing sector (e.g., reduced fishing opportunities,
    loss of income for fishing guides that depend on fishing for their livelihoods;
    Schneckenburger, and Aukerman 2002) and small-scale commercial and subsistence
    fishing communities (e.g., impacts on nutritional security and livelihoods; Adeoti
    et al. 2010; Lennox et al. 2019). The frequency of some of these kinds of shocks
    appears to be growing (Cottrell et al 2019) and is likely to continue to do so
    under climate change (Oliver et al 2019). The growing demand for food and nutritional
    security has driven a fresh perspective on fisheries, including the introduction
    of the concept of nutritional Maximum Sustainable Yield (Robinson et al. 2022).
    Changing market forces have also seen an accelerating interest in increasing aquaculture
    production (Naylor et al. 2009; Bostock et al. 2010), with parallel interest in
    doing so in ways that minimize harm to aquatic ecosystems (Pillay 2008) and improve
    fish welfare (Rasco et al. 2015). We recognize the important competitive and synergistic
    linkages between aquaculture and other fisheries sectors (e.g., drawing from a
    common pool of science and technology, market demand for fish and market competition,
    fishmeal demand, aquatic space competition, competition for policy maker attention
    and resources for innovation investment). Acknowledged the role of human dimensions
    in fisheries management Over the past 30 years, fisheries science has increasingly
    recognized the importance of understanding and incorporating the human dimensions
    into fisheries management and conservation measures, policy, and legal frameworks.
    An ecosystem approach to fisheries should not only be about ensuring the ecological
    integrity of fisheries, but also about creating an enabling regulatory framework
    and environment for fisheries sustainability by strengthening social, economic,
    and institutional aspects in fisheries (De Young et al. 2018; FAO 2009). The human
    dimensions in fisheries management can be perceived through, for instance, integrated
    ecosystem assessments (e.g., environmental, socio-cultural impact assessments),
    participatory arrangements (e.g., co-management, community-based management),
    through the specific lenses of certain groups such as women (Williams 2008; FAO
    2009), and by following a human rights-based approach to small-scale fisheries
    management and governance (FAO 2015). Early human dimension efforts had four primary
    foci: (1) fisheries economics, (2) aspects of social science focused on characterizing
    fisher behaviours and perspectives, (3) the importance of all nodes of the fish
    value chains, not just fishing, and (4) the importance of specific social groups.
    Early fisheries economics efforts tended to focus on important fishing management
    problems, emphasizing creation of a solid foundation for further development of
    models relevant to policy makers and managers (Bjørndal and Munro 2012). Yet,
    there have also been criticisms that fisheries economics has been too focused
    on theoretical debates rather than trying to solve pressing management problems
    (Wilen 2000). Fisheries economists are credited with the widespread development
    and use of bioeconomic models (often simulation-based) for investigating and implementing
    different management plans (Clark 1985). These bioeconomic approaches have also
    supported a shift to Maximum Economic Yield as the dictate of fisheries reference
    points (as opposed to Maximum Sustainable Yield based rules) in some jurisdictions
    (e.g., Australia). For social scientists, a fishery has long been regarded as
    a social system (or what we now refer to as a social-ecological system) which
    includes fish as well as resource users and the rest of the support infrastructure
    and industry (Ditton 1996). For the last 30 years, most human dimensions research
    on fishing in developed countries has used mail survey and telephone (or intercept)
    interview techniques but in the last decade there has been more focus on using
    electronic methods (e.g., email surveys, social media distribution). In inland
    systems, much work has focused on the recreational angling sector to understand
    motivations, behaviours, management preferences, and how these vary among different
    segments (e.g., specialized anglers vs generalist anglers; Arlinghaus et al. 2013).
    In the marine realm, there has been more focus on the commercial sector with particular
    emphasis on conflicts (Pomeroy et al. 2007), but there are growing efforts to
    categorize the scale and scope of recreational fisheries as well (MRIP 2017).
    There has also been a recognition that fisheries social science has much to offer
    in terms of social struggles and justice (Bavinck et al. 2018; see section on
    equity below). Some natural resource management agencies have developed internal
    capacity for human dimensions research to support management. Social groups that
    have been gradually recognized as critical but overlooked actors in fisheries
    include small-scale fishers (World Bank/FAO/WorldFish 2012; FAO 2015), women (Gopal
    et al. 2020), and Indigenous peoples (Jentoft et al. 2019). In the past decades,
    more efforts have been made, especially in developing countries, to better understand
    these groups, recognize and protect their rights, and enhance their agency and
    capacity to participate in fisheries management and decision-making process of
    their concern. The development, adoption and implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines
    for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF Guidelines; FAO 2015) is the
    most comprehensive case of a participatory process to secure the rights of the
    majority of fishers, based on the human rights-based approach (Nakamura 2022).
    Continued exploration and integration of the human dimensions of fisheries will
    be critical for informing sustainable management and supporting the people and
    communities who depend on fisheries. Enhanced understanding of weaknesses in fisheries
    governance, policy, and compliance During the past 30 years, there were several
    advances in understanding and even overcoming some of the weaknesses in fisheries
    governance, policy, and compliance. A great part of this progress in the marine
    realm stemmed from the 1992 United Nations (UN) Conference on Environment and
    Development (UNCED), which strongly endorsed the precautionary principle, biodiversity
    protection, climate change concerns, and the need to manage and conserve high
    seas fisheries (Boyle and Freestone 1999). Following the UNCED, its recommendations
    saw major advances in implementation, notably the adoption of key international
    legal instruments (e.g., FAO Compliance Agreement 1993, UN Fish Stocks Agreement
    1995, FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries 1995 (CCRF)), the establishment
    of new regional fisheries management organizations (e.g., Indian Ocean Tuna Commission
    in 1996, Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission in 2004), the formal
    adoption of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (Reykjavik Declaration
    2001), and the increased concern with conservation of deep-sea fisheries, habitats,
    and vulnerable marine ecosystems. Additionally, the international agenda expanded
    as part of the Millennium Development Goals of 2000 and later the Sustainable
    Development Goals of 2015, broadening efforts to integrate various goals to the
    fisheries context (Said and Chuenpagdee 2019). In freshwater systems, the Rome
    Declaration (see https://www.fao.org/inland-fisheries/topics/detail/en/c/1142047/)
    includes ten steps to responsible inland fisheries with explicit calls for improvements
    in governance (see Cooke et al. 2016). Yet, challenges remain with little evidence
    of widespread improvements (Lynch et al. 2020; Cooke et al. 2021), and certain
    of these key instruments being technically narrow in their approaches, especially
    with respect to the human dimensions. Despite the increased awareness about the
    need to shift from fisheries management to fisheries governance (Chuenpagdee and
    Jentoft 2018), the transition has not been easy. Fisheries problems are complex
    and require insights from interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research, and
    nuanced approaches like collaborative and interactive governance frameworks (see
    for instance Bavinck and Kooiman et al. 2005; Ostrom 2010). Fisheries research
    has certainly grown and expanded to incorporate a broad array of knowledge, including
    those of local and Indigenous fishers—though rarely women fishers (e.g., Short
    et al. 2020)—which has helped improve governance. Yet, more needs to be done considering
    the additional demands on the governance systems at all levels and scales, as
    the aquatic ecosystems continue to face pressures and stressors affecting their
    productivity and health. The last 30 years of legal and policy developments were
    largely focused on the environmental component of fisheries sustainability, resulting
    in a limited coverage of social dimensions, human rights, and protection of vulnerable
    groups (Papanicolopulu 2018; Nakamura 2022). Most of the existing international
    instruments addressing social aspects in fisheries are non-binding, including
    those adopted under the auspices of the FAO (Tenure Guidelines 2012, Small-Scale
    Fisheries Guidelines 2014) and the UN Human Rights Council (UN Declaration on
    Peasant’s Rights 2018). These instruments, nevertheless, enshrine the human rights-based
    approach to fisheries whilst fostering the protection and empowerment of small-scale
    fisheries holistically, covering issues of social development, gender, indigenous
    peoples, migrants, and other vulnerable groups. Efforts to elevate fisheries governance,
    policy and compliance are beginning to yield benefits, but more work is certainly
    needed. Acknowledged need for gender equity and inclusion While social equity
    is related to many factors, gender equity serves as a suitable case study because
    gender researchers have made significant conceptual contributions relevant to
    all human dimensions. A major theoretical contribution has been the intersectional
    nature of identity underlying social inequalities (Crenshaw 1989). Biological,
    social, and cultural categories, including gender, race, income, caste, and class
    interact, creating systemic inequalities. In fisheries, different groups of women
    experience resource access and the impacts of resource appropriation in different
    ways (e.g., Ferguson 2021a, b). Gender scholars have also developed the field
    of feminist political ecology that favours diagnosis of conditions at multiple
    scales, takes into account gendered rights and responsibilities, economic growth,
    and structural and political situations encountered (Resurreccion, 2017). It has
    been applied to complex fisheries management conflicts such as the social inequities
    across gender, race, and class relations of the Newfoundland and Labrador cod
    stocks of Canada (Bavington, et al. 2004) and the legal schemes applied in wetlands
    protection in Tonle Sap, Cambodia (Gillespie and Perry 2019). After a promising
    start arising out of the 1984 FAO Strategy for Fisheries Management and Development,
    and the inclusion of women in some early fisheries development programs such as
    the first two phases of the Bay of Bengal Programme, the inclusion of women dropped
    off the fisheries agendas in the early 1990s. The disconnect between international
    human rights and fisheries law evinced the need to make clear and explicit linkages
    between fisheries and gender in international fisheries instruments. Nevertheless,
    the adoption of the SSF Guidelines, which follows the principles of gender equality
    and equity, non-discrimination, and contains a chapter entirely dedicated to gender
    equality (FAO 2015) is coupled with some national and regional impetus to address
    the roles and needs of women and social inclusion in fisheries. Some progress
    has been made, although still in its early stages, to include gender in fisheries
    research and development programs, recognize the important role women play in
    fisheries, and ensure special attention to them in fisheries value chains (e.g.,
    Graham and D’Andrea 2021). From an assessment of the implementation of policy
    intentions in three Pacific countries, however, Lawless et al. (2021) caution
    that the commitments often are diluted or ignored in practice. Similar conclusions
    would be drawn if such studies were made in other regions and globally. A significant
    gap in knowledge to guide gender equity and inclusion policies is the great dearth
    of gender-disaggregated data. In 2012, the Hidden Harvests report (World Bank/FAO/WorldFish
    2012) provided a first rough estimate of the number of women in small scale fisheries
    value chains (estimated to be 47% of the workers), and this is being updated in
    the forthcoming Illuminating Hidden Harvests study (due 2022). The FAO State of
    Fisheries and Aquaculture 2016 biennial report was the first to produce a table
    of gender-disaggregated statistics of labor in the fishing/fish farming. Over
    the past 30 years, there have been early efforts that acknowledge the need for
    gender equity and inclusion within the sector. More work is urgently needed but
    there have been some recent developments that show great promise. Similar conclusions
    would be drawn for other social equity dimensions. Q2. What needs to be done to
    achieve sustainable and vibrant fish populations and fisheries in the next 30
    years? Over the next 30 years, we need to invest effort in addressing additional
    challenges to achieve thriving fish populations and sustainable, equitable fisheries.
    Here, we discuss each in turn and consider specific actions needed for each (See
    Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Achieving sustainable and vibrant fish populations and fisheries
    Full size image Rethinking fisheries resources and ecosystem management systems
    The inertia of history means it is exceptionally unlikely that the historical
    form of fisheries institutions and decision-making processes will radically change
    (Fulton 2021). Nevertheless, the growing appreciation is that even with the best
    of intentions historical fisheries management has not delivered sustainable ecosystem-level
    exploitation (e.g., Link 2021). New challenges of global change (Tittensor et
    al. 2021) and ecosystem-based management (EBM) perspectives demand both a more
    inclusive and agile approach. Inclusion extends to the scope of the system implications
    considered in management decision making processes and in the people whose interests
    must be considered. This does not mean there will be a wholesale abandonment of
    current core fisheries resource and ecosystem management concepts. Instead, concepts
    like Maximum Sustainable Yield will continue to evolve to encompass multispecies
    sustainability and entire system–level dynamics as they have begun to do (Mace
    2001; Thorpe 2019). Management decision making processes will incorporate ancillary
    information. This can be either informally, as is the case in Alaska (where ecosystem
    indicators are reported alongside formal stock assessments; Dorn and Zador 2020),
    or more formally in explicitly multispecies and ecosystem-oriented harvest strategies.
    This could begin by supplementing existing single-species management methods with
    additional checks and indicators derived from environmental data streams or ecosystem
    models (e.g., Howell et al. 2021). However, we anticipate widespread use of harvest
    strategies that intentionally manage large numbers of species together, as has
    been done in Western Australia for some time now using indicator species concepts
    and leveraging life history characteristics (Newman et al. 2018). Moreover, management
    systems are already looking beyond simple stock management to the broader human
    dimensions of fisheries and the many drivers of fisheries. More explicitly recognizing
    how trade-offs between economic, social, and environmental objectives constrain
    sustainable harvesting options (e.g., Briton et al. 2020) and considering climate
    change influence on reference points (e.g., Holsman et al. 2020) are early steps
    along that path. Significant challenges remain in finding tangible means of doing
    this in jurisdictions with low fisheries science and management capacity. In these
    systems, the social dimensions are most critical. Improvements in communication
    of the processes and advice will be key to change and adoption. There are opportunities
    to rethink fisheries resources and management systems such that they are placed
    within a broader context. Modernizing and integrating assessment and information
    systems The heterogeneity in data availability and assessment capacity globally
    remains a challenge and one that needs to be addressed urgently if the health
    of fish stocks and ecosystems are to be universally assessed. The need for social
    and economic data needs critical review. Development of highly informative monitoring
    and data collection programs is essential, and their cost-effectiveness can be
    measured via MSE in terms of reduced uncertainty and management procedure performance
    (Punt et al. 2016). However, the lack of inclusive social dimensions of current
    MSE approaches means they are unlikely to be suitable beyond their current fisheries
    resource and ecosystems focus. While many new assessment methods and data streams
    exist, understanding how to best utilize them takes time—as evidenced by the lively
    discussions surrounding the most appropriate use of integrated population models
    (Arnold et al. 2018), trait-based approaches (Barnett et al. 2019), ecosystem
    models (Fulton 2010; Perryman et al 2021), environmental DNA methods (Jeunen et
    al. 2019; Sigsgaard et al. 2020; Gilbey et al. 2021), data-limited assessment
    methods (Smith et al. 2009; Carruthers and Hordyk 2018) and the like. Experience
    will help this evolution, as the transfer of expertise is assisted by training
    programs and capacity building—supported by initiatives such as the Data-Limited
    Methods Toolkit (Carruthers and Hordyk 2018) and FishPath (https://www.fishpath.org/;
    Dowling et al 2016). More will be needed though, as well laid out by Punt et al.
    (2020). As a start, solid advances can be made by implementing software engineering
    practices, such as human-centred design and broader use of code versioning and
    repositories, which are shareable through platforms such as GitHub (https://github.com/).
    In addition, there is opportunity for strategic use of online (cloud) computing
    power and collaborating with experts in software engineering, visualisation platforms,
    and human information processing (such as specialists in gamification and serious
    gaming; Diniz dos Santos et al. 2019). Increasing familiarity with the tools and
    having broader system perspectives will also help fisheries address broader questions
    more easily—such as risk assessment tools, for example, Ecological Risk Assessment
    for the Effects of Fishing (Hobday et al. 2011) or Integrated Ecosystem Assessments
    (Harvey et al. 2021), ecosystem scale models that can be rapidly applied to fished
    systems (e.g., Mizer; Scott et al 2014), or multispecies models tailored to deliver
    information in formats that management processes are familiar with [e.g., the
    Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments applied by Angelini
    et al. (2016) and Thorson et al. (2019)]. The collation and transmission of information
    (both raw data and processed products tailored to decision maker needs) is also
    foreseen to be a growing need into the future, with the ambition to deliver updated
    information in near real time in a format and on platforms that are widely accessible
    (e.g., on mobile devices) but also fit for purpose. This can already be seen in
    near real time sharing of effort distributions and bycatch to assist with targeting
    (e.g., Hazen et al. 2018) and compliance (Kurekin et al. 2019; Nugent 2019) and
    the increasing use of operational and seasonal forecasts to improve fisheries
    efficiency or as a basis for dynamic oceans management (Maxwell et al. 2015).
    Transparent knowledge sharing, in its truest sense—a multi-way flow of information,
    that actively engages with stakeholder/manager/rightsholder interests and perspectives—will
    also require incorporation of specialist knowledge brokers into fisheries science
    teams (Cvitanovic et al. 2015). The field would also benefit from collaboration
    with communications specialists who understand how people receive and interpret
    information—this will be important as increasingly large audiences need to be
    engaged or in contentious circumstances (Condie and Condie 2021), such as when
    there is a clash between sectors, whether that is two commercial sectors or between
    conservation and fisheries or between cultural and economic objectives (Coulthard
    et al. 2011; Lester et al. 2017; Crona et al. 2021). Evidence syntheses such as
    systematic reviews also hold great promise for ensuring that decision makers are
    provided with rigorous and comprehensive assessments of the best available evidence
    on a given topic—something that has yet to be fully embraced in fisheries assessment
    and management (Cooke et al. 2017). Ensuring equitable access to information also
    means that solutions (whether technological or facilitated by communicators) need
    to come in a form that can be shared more broadly and are not only available to
    a subset of those interested in the fisheries. Avoiding the marginalisation of
    those groups which are also at the low ends of power imbalances is important (Crona
    et al. 2021; Tigchelaar et al. 2021; Farmery et al. 2022). Similarly, there will
    need to be an expansion of assessment and reporting of a wider range of indicators
    as the values aspects of blue foods expand (e.g., nutritional value, carbon footprint,
    ecosystem footprint, inclusivity, and respect for people in value chain; Parker
    et al. 2018; Golden et al. 2021). Modernization and access to technologies (e.g.,
    smartphones and applications) have enhanced the ability to integrate the society
    into fisheries assessments through the development of citizen science platforms.
    These platforms have the potential to supplement existing data sets whilst contributing
    to improved relations between scientists, the public and government agencies (Bonney
    et al. 2021). Yet, the integration and translation of the results of citizen science
    projects into effective fisheries management is still in its infancy (Fulton et
    al. 2019). This integrated assessment has great potential to be explored and developed
    for both marine and inland, as well as small-scale and recreational fisheries
    (Gundelund et al. 2021). Access to technology, even mobile phones, is not equal
    in most societies and this needs to be considered. Data science approaches such
    as data feminism are needed. These take account of the political and social activism
    needed to collect, analyse, and project to decision-makers and the public the
    importance of data outside formal data collections but critical to targeting action
    and making decisions (D''ignazio and Klein 2020). For example, this approach could
    help bridge the results of numerous small-scale projects in many countries documenting
    the extent of work that women undertake in fisheries while formal national fisheries
    data will report that no women are engaged in fisheries. Modernizing fisheries
    assessment and information systems is necessary and would help to enable science-based
    management of aquatic resources. Addressing persistent and emerging threats to
    fish and fisheries Some persistent and emerging threats are common to fish and
    fisheries regardless of system type. Increasing fish trade and climate change,
    for example, have global ramifications across aquatic systems. These global processes
    often have unexpected interactions and the resulting consequences for fish and
    fisheries are difficult to predict (Staudinger et al. 2021). For example, emerging
    aquatic diseases can be driven by multiple intersecting stressors that threaten
    fish and fisheries. Coordinated global aquatic disease surveillance programs can
    help identify conditions that lead to emergence or transmission and develop interventions
    that can be used to treat diseases in wild fish at a grand scale (Peeler and Ernst
    2019). Likewise, intensifying global climate change is propelling aquatic ecosystems
    toward irreversible transformations. While transformations have occurred in the
    past, the current rate of change and synergistic effects are unprecedented and
    unpredictable (Thompson et al. 2021). For example, extreme climate events, including
    fires, droughts, floods, are increasing in frequency with documented severe impacts
    to freshwater fish (Silva et al. 2020; Stocks et al. 2021). Freshwater ecosystems
    are notable systems at extreme risk, and action within the next decades will be
    critical to conserve them and conserve inland fisheries. Tickner et al. (2020)
    present an “Emergency Recovery Plan” to address the following priority actions:
    accelerating implementation of environmental flows; improving water quality; protecting
    and restoring critical habitats; managing the exploitation of freshwater ecosystem
    resources, especially species and riverine aggregates; preventing and controlling
    non-native species invasions; and safeguarding and restoring river connectivity.
    This plan is gaining traction within the global conservation community (Twardek
    et al. 2021) and its priority actions will be particularly critical for resolving
    transboundary river issues and conflicts between diverse freshwater users. As
    the frontier of hydropower and river damming moves towards large, tropical, transboundary
    rivers (e.g., Amazon, Mekong), integrated and coordinated international management
    will become fundamental to halt fisheries declines (Van Damme et al. 2019). Likewise,
    as demand on irrigated agriculture to feed the world increases, improved regulated
    flow management measures (Stuart et al. 2019) and devices to reduce fisheries
    losses to irrigation systems (Boys et al. 2021) will be essential to avoid scenarios
    where increasing food production in one sector decreases it in another (Lynch
    et al. 2019). Importantly, management tools that have helped improve sustainability
    of marine fisheries, such as protected areas and reserve systems, can help address
    species declines and long-term fisheries sustainability in inland systems (Hermoso
    et al. 2016; Koning et al. 2020). Estuarine and marine systems also face substantial
    threats. Development and damming of freshwater systems also impact the downstream
    estuarine systems by reducing freshwater input subsequently impacting the water
    quality and geomorphological processes within estuaries (Gillanders et al. 2022)
    and impacting fisheries where connectivity between aquatic realms is critical
    (Crook et al. In Press). Major cities are also often situated on estuaries adding
    additional threats associated with urbanization and coastal reconstruction. In
    marine systems, the increasing range of activities including fisheries and aquaculture,
    shipping, land reclamation, and renewable energy (e.g., wind and wave energy)
    means that these systems are now highly contested with potential for conflict
    among users. These intensive anthropogenic activities also lead to cumulative
    impacts on marine systems, reducing available ecosystem spaces, impacting the
    health of the systems and their dependent organisms. Increasingly spatial cumulative
    impact assessments are undertaken but rarely have they been validated with empirical
    data and the range of stressors are often viewed as having additive effects. Many
    threats, including emerging ones, continue to plague fisheries and aquatic systems.
    Efforts that attempt to understand and mitigate those threats are essential if
    we are to ensure the future viability of fish populations and fisheries. Integrating
    the conceptual frameworks of biological and social scientists Although the last
    thirty years have seen greater appreciation of the human dimension of fisheries,
    including through discussions emanating from previous WFCs (see Liguori et al.
    2005), collaborative effort is still needed to integrate the conceptual frameworks
    and understandings of natural and social scientists (Hall-Arber et al. 2009).
    Indeed, although there are persistent information needs on biological (and environmental)
    aspects of fisheries, it is often people and human behaviour that dictates the
    ultimate success of any fisheries management actions (Hilborn 2007). Efforts to
    understand the perceived barriers to integrating human dimensions knowledge and
    concepts into fisheries science and management have been informative (e.g., Fox
    et al. 2006; Hall-Arber et al. 2009). Fox et al. (2006) identified barriers including
    the lack of common vocabulary between biologists and social scientists, the lack
    of funding for collaborative work, and limited opportunities for interdisciplinary
    collaboration. Hall-Arber et al. (2009) addressed models and means for integrating
    quantitative and qualitative data. Fortunately, efforts to address these issues
    are expanding, and much can be learned from existing and emerging examples. For
    example, Bennett et al. (2017) outlined a roadmap for mainstreaming human dimensions
    more broadly in environmental management and conservation sectors. Importantly,
    recognition of the critical value of Indigenous knowledge in fisheries management
    and conservation is increasing—particularly in the context of bridging these knowledges
    to better inform existing science-based decision-making (Crook et al. 2016; Reid
    et al. 2021; McKinley et al. 2022). Notable to fisheries is the need to build
    personal and institutional capacity for human dimensions work and ensure that
    it is fully integrated into both knowledge generating and application processes.
    This involves reflexivity, that is, the researchers and their institutional approaches
    need to understand that their work and approaches are both cause and effect in
    the fisheries systems they seek to improve, and their social relations within
    it are important elements (e.g., their positioning in research institutes of governments
    managing the fisheries, or as experts working for the fishing industry or NGOs).
    What is apparent from our analysis is that the human dimension intersects with
    all of the topics and themes explored here such that this separate section on
    the human dimensions is somewhat redundant. That is telling and emphasizes how
    human dimensions are increasingly viewed as fundamental to contemporary fisheries
    research and management. We therefore conclude that the human dimensions will
    indeed be considered as an integral element of fisheries in the near future, providing
    insights and benefits for fisheries science more broadly (see McKinley et al.
    2022). Yet, it also needs to be treated as a unique cross-cutting issue in its
    own right that needs to be addressed. We submit that better integration of biological
    and social science theories and practices is needed to manage fisheries in an
    holistic manner. Rethinking governance, policy, and compliance Ensuring the protection
    of fishers and fish value chain workers (e.g., through safety at sea and on land,
    social security, social development, and secured human rights) has been and continues
    to be one of the greatest challenges for the fisheries governance and policy framework
    (Papanicolopulu 2018; Nakamura 2022). For at-sea work, only 20 States have ratified
    the International Labour Organization Work in Fishing Convention 2007, hindering
    a stronger support for the international protection of decent working conditions
    in fisheries. While there have been some important international legal developments,
    as outlined above, through the adoption of non-binding instruments embedded on
    an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and, more recently following the
    human rights-based approach, there remain challenges in ensuring implementation
    of these instruments at the national level. Fisheries, especially small-scale
    fisheries, are not a priority to most governments'' agenda. Fisheries is a marginalized
    sector (Purcell and Pomeroy 2015; Chuenpagdee and Jentoft 2011). As such, relying
    on political will and action to effectively implement policies and legislation
    should not be the only alternative. Rethinking governance can begin through a
    more proactive work of non-state actors and broader inclusion of value chain activities,
    taking due account of a broader interest in implementing fisheries and fisheries-related
    policy and laws for the benefit of the wider fisheries community. These initiatives
    can support tracking the progress on the implementation of international instruments
    (Lynch et al. 2020). Through transdisciplinary research, for instance, fisheries
    scientists and legal researchers can work together to identify key issues in international
    instruments relevant to fisheries in countries’ legislation and policies, highlight
    the gaps and needs for review and update (Nakamura et al. 2021). In certain countries,
    the recognition of customary fishing rights may not be spelled out in legislation
    or policy, but may be granted by national judicial courts, performing judicial
    activism (e.g., South Africa, Sowman and Sunde 2021; New Zealand, Cantzler 2022).
    It is also crucial to clarify opportunities for mutual supportive interpretation
    and application of human rights law and fisheries law to support the recognition
    and protection of rights of fishers working in rural and coastal areas (Morgera
    and Nakamura 2022). All these approaches, however, take for granted the centrality
    of the fishing node of the value chain, which is only part of the fisheries sector.
    Indeed, the post-harvest node employs more than twice as many people (World Bank/FAO/WorldFish
    2012), but their needs are not considered in governance (see Barclay et al. 2022
    for an example in tuna fisheries). New approaches must find ways to include value
    chain impacts and consequences in the governance systems. The impacts and influences
    are already acting, but in hidden and non-transparent ways, such as through market
    demand, private sector company policies, and social and political hierarchies.
    A recent important development for the global fisheries was the adoption of the
    Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies by the members of the World Trade Organization,
    after decades of negotiation, but, as commentators note, some unfinished business
    (e.g., prohibition of subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing,
    and the differentiated treatment and permanent exemptions for small-scale fishing)
    were left for future negotiations (Tipping and Irschlinger 2022; Switzer and Lennan
    2022). Innovative ways to govern fishing have been largely pushed forward through
    the adoption of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management or ecosystem-based
    fisheries management. This approach has also been developed in international instruments
    (e.g., Reykjavik Declaration 2001) and technical guidance provided by FAO to supplement
    the CCRF (FAO 2003) and on legislating for an ecosystem approach to fisheries
    management (FAO 2016, 2021). Several national bodies are adopting ecosystem-based
    fisheries management as a major policy shift in how fisheries are governed. The
    need for holistic ways of managing and governing fisheries stem from many reasons,
    but internationally from growing evidence of the ecological connectivity between
    transboundary fisheries resources and impact diverse ecosystems, biodiversity,
    and habitats, and which are impacted by multiple stressors, including climate
    change (Pinsky et al. 2018; Popova et al. 2019; Palacios-Abrantes et al. 2020).
    The emphasis on the ecosystem approach continues to broaden the scope of fisheries
    and other sectors included in national and international fisheries policies and
    sustainable development agendas. Transitioning to these modes of governance, which
    seek to sustainably develop, require participatory decision-making that takes
    special account of affected and marginalized groups (Cohen et al. 2019). In this
    process, local communities can also contribute to improve the knowledge-base informing
    fisheries management measures and monitoring (Dias et al. 2020). However, the
    implementation of national fisheries policies, aside from those that enable trade,
    continues to substantially lag behind the drafting and adoption process, yielding
    well-intentioned fisheries management plans that are not fully executed and leading
    to unsustainable fisheries policies (e.g., Pelicice et al. 2017). This expansion
    has also included greater consideration of the contributions and potential impacts
    of various measures on small-scale fisheries, recreational fisheries, coastal
    and inland communities, and tropical regions (particularly in developing countries),
    with variable success. The representation of non-state actor participation in
    global fisheries institutions, such as regional fisheries management organizations,
    also continues to be selective (Petersson 2019). Additionally, transboundary fisheries
    management continues to have ongoing and emerging challenges that will require
    enhancements to multi-national co-management and multi-sectoral coordination to
    promote sustainability and greater consideration of cumulative impacts in a changing
    climate (Popova et al. 2019). Efforts are required on multiple levels of national
    and international government cooperation to improve the legal frameworks and arrangements
    for strengthening monitoring, surveillance, and compliance (MCS) that address
    fishing in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction and enhance Biological Diversity
    Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction negotiations, reduce IUU fishing, and further
    tackle the governance challenges for highly migratory species (Le Gallic and Cox
    2006; Ardron et al. 2014; Petrossian 2015; Doumbouya et al. 2017; Popova et al.
    2019). Improvements may include (a) developing economically viable monitoring,
    surveillance, and compliance plans and monitoring systems that are fully incorporated
    into fisheries management planning, (b) improving monitoring compliance by supporting
    the capacity of authorized officers to perform their monitoring, surveillance,
    and compliance and enforcement functions, and establishing higher fines for non-compliance
    with applicable rules (Doumbouya et al. 2017), (c) adopting management measures
    with greater participatory monitoring and technological developments of more cost-effective
    systems that leverage AI and electronic monitoring systems, and (d) greater open
    access to fisheries data (e.g., Global Fishing Watch). Lastly, adaptive transboundary
    governance for a changing global ocean ecosystem is critical, particularly where
    shifts in target species distribution due to climate change are impacting fisheries,
    livelihoods, societies, and economies (Ojea et al. 2020). We submit that rethinking
    governance, policy, and compliance is necessary to achieve fisheries that benefit
    people while also protecting aquatic systems such that sustainable fisheries harvest
    is possible. Achieving inclusion in fisheries, using the example of gender equity
    A major thrust is needed to put equity and inclusion broadly on the fisheries
    agenda. In the preceding section, we used gender equity as an example of new approaches
    and issues but acknowledge that these issues extend to race, religion, caste,
    socio-economic status, Indigeneity, and beyond. Each one deserves more attention
    than we can provide here. The increasing commoditization of fisheries presents
    great challenges to sustainability and inclusion. Whereas sustainability has received
    some attention through action by environmental NGOs, and even the large private
    sector interests, social inclusion has received little attention to date, with
    the exception of action to prevent the worst maltreatment of male crew in certain
    fisheries (HRAS 2019; ILO 2007). Even the attention given to social issues for
    male crew typically does not address the additional impacts and needs of the women
    in the affected fisheries households (Barclay et al. 2022). Furthermore, extending
    social inclusion to women throughout fish value chains would reveal an even wider
    set of social equity issues. Women make up about half of the workforce in fish
    value chains (FAO 2022), but they are neglected in fisheries policy and action.
    Gender issues cannot be solved until issues in the political economy of fisheries
    are investigated and addressed (e.g., the extent of labour exploitation in processing
    and trading as well as fishing, the allocation of resource rights, investment
    and finances for women entrepreneurs, gendered trade impacts, and the political
    rights of different groups). Seen through a gender lens, these issues provide
    better understanding of the asymmetry of power occurring and the motivations and
    drivers of the value chain actors (Williams 2019). Furthermore, women are not
    a homogeneous group with a single set of characteristics, needs, and interests.
    Gender research needs to take intersectional approaches to comprehend the complexities.
    Ferguson (2021a, b), for example, used an intersectional approach in studying
    the beche de mer trade in Palau. Marital status and nationality (local and immigrant
    women and men) affected who benefited or was harmed. Men benefited most from international
    trade which affected the local stocks, from which local women and immigrant women
    benefited more than unmarried women and immigrant men. The basic building blocks
    of achieving greater gender equality in fisheries are gender research carried
    out across appropriate scales and key intersectional factors, well-informed policies
    that are built on supporting and including gender and fisheries representatives
    in policy development, and sound gender-disaggregated data. As noted in answer
    to Question 1, gender-disaggregated data are scarce in fisheries. This problem
    hides the numbers of women involved, and their contributions and rights (or lack
    of); contributes to women’s interests and knowledge being overlooked in fisheries
    management decision-making; and allows policy makers to ignore gendered differences
    in participation, needs and opportunities. Thus, as a basis for women’s rights,
    fisheries lacks adequate data collections, and has few time series showing trends.
    Correcting this data gap is a major need for supporting gender equity. Two gender
    issues in fisheries are often conflated, namely the professional presence of women
    in fisheries science, fisheries management and private sector positions, and the
    position of women workers in fish value chain nodes and research to illuminate
    it. Although the two are related in some respects, in others they share little
    in common. Compared to 30 years ago, women are more numerous in professional positions
    in fisheries, such as fisheries scientists and management agencies, thus giving
    an impression of progress in gender equality in fisheries. The rise of women in
    the fisheries professional ranks, however, results from the gains in women’s education
    and does not equate to progress more broadly in gender equality in fisheries value
    chains (Barclay et al. 2022). Professional women typically have to accept the
    workplace performance requirements and cultures that have prevailed from earlier
    times, although, in some situations, social media groups and professional associations
    are becoming active in overcoming gender discrimination in fisheries professional
    workplaces. The American Fisheries Society, for example, has a Diversity, Equity,
    and Inclusion Committee that focuses on professional concerns of recruiting and
    nurturing a diverse workforce more representative of the population with respect
    to women, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and abilities (Penaluna et al.
    2017). On the question of women’s positions in fish value chains, and research
    on these, complex and different issues arise. Gender and fisheries research has
    grown slowly over the last 30 years (see Williams (2019) for a timeline of the
    efforts by researchers in the Asian Fisheries Society). In the last few years,
    serious gender research papers have started to appear in the top fisheries research
    journals when once most gender and fisheries scholarship was found in social science
    journals. The field is still small, however, and research funds are meagre and
    scattered. Few fisheries research agencies employ gender researchers, and fisheries
    management agencies likewise rarely hire experts with specialist gender knowledge.
    A survey of 65 countries found that only 25% of fisheries ministries had gender
    focal points responsible for coordinating responses to policies and mandates (and
    not necessarily gender experts) (Environment and Gender Index 2015). Among environment
    ministries, only water ministries were less likely to have a gender focal point.
    Most gender research is undertaken in universities, and experts (researchers and
    technical experts) are contracted for specific tasks by mainstream fisheries agencies.
    Only the Asian Fisheries Society, among all the professional fisheries societies,
    has a formal gender section (the Gender in Aquaculture and Fisheries Section),
    focusing on research on women and gender equality in value chains (Williams 2019).
    A small but growing number of networks have been formed supporting collective
    action by women working in fish value chains (Alonso-Población and Siar 2018),
    and also some activist groups working to sensitize the seafood industry to gender
    equality issues. Researchers often collaborate or are also members of these organizations,
    but the overall number is still modest. A few of the large international environment
    NGOs are taking a strong stand for gender equality in fisheries and we expect
    this trend to continue (e.g., Finkbeiner et al. 2021). Equity applies in many
    ways to fisheries yet has rarely been considered. Using gender equality as an
    example to indicate the needs for progress reveals a large set of tasks. Revising
    governance, management, and data systems to explicitly acknowledge, embrace, and
    celebrate equity, diversity, inclusion, and justice is sorely needed. Understanding
    the role of fish as nutrition in a hungry world Fish are clearly a source of food,
    although this is not always reflected in national policies. For example, only
    one in two public health nutrition strategies examined by Koehn et al. (2022)
    identified the importance of fish and shellfish consumption as a key objective.
    This is partially because the contribution of fish is often reduced to their protein
    provision, when in fact their role in addressing micronutrient deficiencies makes
    fish products a crucial part of a healthy diet (UN Nutrition 2021). There are
    also diverse perceptions between marine and inland fisheries in relation to their
    contribution to food security. While much more is known about the role of marine
    fisheries products in supporting food security (Golden et al. 2016), similar data
    are lacking for freshwater systems (Funge-Smith and Bennett 2019), even though
    the latter is particularly important in many food-deficit regions. For a long
    time, the disaggregated nature of fisheries data and their contribution to human
    diets made it very difficult to understand and properly value the role of fish
    in addressing food security challenges. Recently, Golden et al. (2021) modelled
    the nutritional properties of terrestrial foods and nearly 3,000 taxa of aquatic
    foods, and concluded that the top 7 categories of nutrient-rich animal-source
    foods are all aquatic foods, based on the benefits in terms of reducing micronutrient
    deficiencies, provision of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and
    capacity to displace the consumption of less-healthy red and processed meats.
    The tide is turning, and in food security circles there is a growing interest
    in “aquatic foods,” as evidenced by the UN Blue Food Assessment (see theme section
    in the journal Nature https://www.nature.com/collections/fijabaiach/) and the
    outcomes of the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit. There are obvious reasons for this
    interest: aquatic foods are some of the more environmentally friendly food systems,
    and one that has significant potential for growth. After all, Africa produces
    only 2.5% of global aquaculture, and if protein and micronutrients must come from
    somewhere, fish will be a big part of the solution. However, present food systems
    still fail to recognize the diversity of aquatic foods, their potential to contribute
    to sustainable healthy diets, and their potential as a solution to address the
    “triple burden of malnutrition” (i.e., micronutrient deficiencies, undernutrition,
    and overweight and obesity) (FAO 2020). But promoting aquatic foods will require
    the engagement of many inside and outside the fisheries sectors, including interdisciplinary
    experts (e.g., supply chain, nutrition, processing, sustainability), realms (inland
    and marine), and diverse actors (from fishers to culturists to processors to consumers)
    from across the globe to realize their potential in a more sustainable, healthy,
    safe, and equitable manner, and in the face of external threats such as climate
    change (Nash et al. 2021a, b; Tigchelaar et al. 2021). With almost 10% of the
    world’s population suffering from undernourishment, there is no time to lose if
    we are to end hunger. Fish products benefit some of the most impoverished and
    food insecure peoples on the planet with much of that catch and consumption occurring
    within communities outside of any import/export systems. We are just now beginning
    to understand the many ways in which fisheries products from all realms contribute
    to nutritional security and thus benefit people around the globe. Adapting to
    climate change Climate change is modifying fish habitat and impacting fish populations
    and aquatic communities with effects observed from the cell to the ecosystem,
    this in turn is influencing human communities dependent on this ecosystem (Barange
    et al. 2018). Common stressors include changes in water temperature and ice conditions,
    changes in precipitation, alterations in river flows, sea-level rise, and ocean
    acidification. Among other things, climate change had led to shifts in species
    distributions, with species moving to cooler areas by increasing latitude, moving
    offshore or occupying deeper waters (Cheung et al. 2013; Hobday and Pecl 2014).
    Climate driven shifts are not just associated with temperature but may also be
    influenced by changes in salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH, especially in estuarine
    and upwelling areas (Lauchlan and Nagelkerken 2020). There is increasing need
    to consider these multi-stressor interactions which may impact physiological processes
    at the individual level subsequently impacting the population or species level
    through changes to recruitment, growth, size at maturity, and fecundity (Busch
    et al. 2016; Lauchlan and Nagelkerken 2020). Ecosystem effects through habitat
    change and food web dynamics also mean individual species cannot be considered
    in isolation. Understanding these broader potential impacts provides a means to
    select adaptation approaches, especially as the degree of environmental change
    and the formation of novel ecosystems (i.e., configurations not previously recorded)
    mean that historical observations are no longer always a reliable guide. Global
    ecosystem models are predicting a 5–15% drop in zooplankton and a 5–25% drop in
    global marine fish biomass even in the absence of fishing (Tittensor et al. 2021).
    Changed freshwater flows are likely to impact inland fisheries, too (van Vliet
    et al. 2013). Under those circumstances, fisheries production would be likely
    to drop. Indeed, fisheries production has already declined, albeit not just attributed
    to climate change. Estimates have suggested global catch could reduce 6% by 2050
    associated with ocean warming and changes in primary productivity (Cheung et al.
    2016a, b; Golden et al. 2016; Boyce et al. 2020). Further, such reductions are
    likely greater in tropical areas with predictions catches will decrease by 30%
    (Cheung et al. 2016a, b). To ensure climate effects on fisheries production are
    not realised, it would be helpful for fisheries management to incorporate climate-resilient
    policies. All of these environmental and production changes are associated with
    effects on the human communities using those resources (Colburn et al. 2016),
    but also challenge fisheries management processes. Traditional fisheries assessment
    and management approaches are based on an assumption of stationarity and climate
    change associated changes in productivity are creating issues around how to be
    suitably precautionary in years where extreme environmental conditions are influencing
    stock state (Dorn and Zador 2020) or where environmentally influenced tipping
    points exist (Möllmann et al. 2021), how to transparently handle regime shifts
    in productivity (Wayte 2013), how to deal with growing numbers of non-recovering
    stocks (Britten et al. 2017; Knuckey et al. 2018) and how to adjust reference
    points (Travers-Trolet et al. 2020). While some regions have sufficient data to
    undertake climate versus fisheries attribution exercises (Litzow et al 2021),
    this is not typical of many locations. Moreover, institutional inertia or past
    management decisions (such as the allocation of individual quota rights) can make
    agile switches in management approaches difficult, if not infeasible. Bryndum-Buchholz
    et al. (2021) review of fisheries management legislation and policy in 11 countries
    found that while most countries considered climate change in the decision-making
    process, no country had at that point incorporated climate change into stock assessments
    or mentioned it in policy/legislation. While fisheries management policies, legislation,
    and approaches do not generally consider climate change as of yet, they can be
    modified or enhanced to be adaptive to climate change (Bryndum-Buchholz et al.
    2021; Link et al. 2021). Ecosystem-based fisheries management, for example, can
    incorporate impacts associated with climate change through ecological risk assessments,
    ecosystem indicators (Link 2010; Hobday et al. 2011; Tam et al. 2017) and improved
    forecasting methods (Årthunet al. 2018). Stock assessment methods will require
    modification to account for and incorporate climate change (Plagányi et al. 2011;
    Punt et al. 2021) and governance systems should consider potential distributional
    shifts in fish stocks (Bryndum-Buchholz et al. 2021; Link et al. 2021). The governance
    and management parts of the entire fisheries system also need to and can insert
    this climate-related information (Link et al. 2021). It is also not simply a matter
    of stock-based effects on fisheries, physical changes—such as lost infrastructure
    and reduced safety at sea (Sainsbury et al. 2018)—can result from climate change
    and are only just beginning to be addressed more openly in fisheries planning
    (e.g., vessel design, new port construction etc.). Similar issues will arise around
    changed waterflow and environmental profiles for inland fisheries—e.g., extreme
    flooding can wash away any fixed infrastructure (Hoa et al. 2008) or directly
    affect fish stocks (Rytwinski et al. 2020). One factor not widely considered is
    how climate change may impact nutrient supplies to freshwater, coastal, and marine
    systems. If extreme weather events become more common leading to increased runoff,
    then nutrients may be exported from land to rivers, estuaries and the sea thereby
    increasing nutrients in food webs (Hicks et al. 2019). For example, two critical
    micronutrients, zinc and calcium, are exported from soils during heavy rainfall
    in tropical areas. Food and nutrient policies will need to consider how climate
    change may alter nutrients, along with fisheries yield, as fisheries clearly have
    a role to play in providing the recommended dietary allowances for coastal populations,
    particularly in countries where nutrient intakes are inadequate (Golden et al.
    2016; Hicks et al. 2019). Increasing political awareness for healthy waters is
    a start. Nature-based solutions are being incorporated into climate change programs
    to protect and/or restore ecosystems mostly in coastal systems (Cohen-Shacham
    et al. 2016). Fisheries emit atmospheric CO2 through landings, processing, and
    consumption (Mariani et al. 2020). Government subsidies also contribute to CO2
    production (among other issues; Sumaila et al. 2021) by allowing fisheries vessels
    to fish on the high seas. While a transition to renewable energy may occur in
    coming years and decades, it will take a considerable time to transition the global
    fleet. Moreover, it is important to consider the carbon stocks within fish themselves
    and the contributions they make to global cycles. Mariani et al. (2020) have recently
    investigated the ability of fish to sequester carbon after natural death demonstrating
    that fisheries have released 0.73 billion metric tons of CO2 since the 1950s (albeit
    a rather small number relative to other sinks and sources). Removing fishing from
    unprofitable areas would lower CO2 emissions as less fuel would be required. Rebuilding
    and maintaining productivity of fish stocks would increase biomass through increased
    numbers of fish including fish of larger size leading to increased carbon sequestration
    in both the short and long term (Mariani et al. 2020). Climate mitigation and
    adaptation would therefore be expected through elimination of overfishing and
    setting up of protected areas. The latter has long been promoted as part of a
    global effort to address biodiversity loss, in addition to help deal with climate
    change. While many aspects of marine protected areas are much debated (such as
    in terms of size, location, effectiveness), and there is no doubt the form will
    need to be modified to allow for changing species distributions and ecosystem
    structures, there is a general consensus that communities will also need to be
    part of such a response, as protected areas have a higher rate of success when
    they are supported, and better yet initiated, by communities. Climate change and
    our response to it will in many ways define the future of fisheries and the communities
    that depend upon fish and healthy aquatic systems. Embracing transdisciplinarity
    Fisheries are tightly coupled social-ecological systems (Ommer et al. 2012) with
    complex interactions among ecosystems, human communities, and target species.
    The challenges facing fisheries thus span several academic disciplines, research
    topics, and sectors, and finding viable solutions requires integration across
    diverse disciplines and knowledge systems, and incorporation of perspectives from
    all interested user groups (i.e., rights holders, stakeholders, practitioners,
    managers, and decision-makers) (Turgeon et al. 2018; Chuenpagdee and Jentoft 2019;
    Moewaka Barnes et al. 2021). As progress has been made toward centering the human
    dimensions in fisheries research, multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary methodologies
    have also evolved (see McKinley et al. 2022). Although these approaches all have
    merit, transdisciplinary frameworks extend beyond multi- and inter-disciplinary
    approaches to include and collaborate with non-academic actors, and thus require
    inclusive and cooperative practices that typically involve partnerships and knowledge
    exchange across science, policy, practitioner, stakeholder, and governance boundaries
    (Turgeon et al. 2018; Kelly et al. 2019; Moewaka Barnes et al. 2021). Transdisciplinary
    approaches can enable researchers and managers to understand a broader range of
    complex problems facing fisheries, as well as solutions to these challenges (Jentoft
    and Chuenpagdee 2009). For example, understanding compliance behaviours in relation
    to management (Fulton 2021) or preparing fishing societies to adapt to climate
    change and other anthropogenic perturbations (Bennett et al. 2016; Bryndum-Buchholz
    et al. 2021; Syddall, et al. 2021) would be fruitful. Moreover, there is scope
    for improving communication between disparate but interconnected groups including
    the users of new technologies, fisheries modelers, fisheries managers (Degnbol
    et al. 2006), and/or economists, ecologists, and social scientists (Bennett 2019).
    Transdisciplinarity often necessitates co-production, which can inform more integrated
    and human-centered approaches to unite ecological concerns with management, community
    perspectives and preferences, as well as human behaviours. Integrating diverse
    sectoral representation on a research team from beginning (i.e., question development)
    to end (i.e., communicating findings) can help ensure that the knowledge produced
    is inclusive, salient, credible, and practical (Cash et al. 2002). For example,
    co-producing policy-oriented research with community representatives increases
    the likelihood that communities will be willing to abide by fishery regulations
    (Karr et al. 2017). Input from fisheries managers or practitioners can help to
    create appropriate fisheries protections and implement climate adaptation programs
    (Bennett et al. 2016). Including government decision makers on the team improves
    knowledge transfer at the science policy interface and ensures that the knowledge
    produced will be useful in practice (Cvitanovic et al. 2015). Transdisciplinary
    work is challenging and time-consuming. For example, researchers must become more
    open to working across diverse disciplinary ‘languages’ (Andrews et al. 2020)
    and learn to communicate with diverse partners (Evans and Cvitanovic 2018; Kelly
    et al. 2019). Despite widespread acceptance of transdisciplinary approaches to
    fisheries research and management there are still barriers in personal and institutional
    capacity to carry out ‘good’ transdisciplinary research (Nyboer et al. this issue).
    The need for support in inter- and transdisciplinary science is especially critical
    at early-career levels (Kelly et al. 2019), where limited training opportunities
    in transdisciplinary skills, institutional inertia, as well as competitive funding
    pools, and limited access to partners all constitute barriers to engaging in transdisciplinary
    approaches (Kelly et al. 2019, Nyboer et al. this issue). Moreover, while expanding
    the capacity of individual researchers helps, engaging dedicated specialists (such
    as knowledge brokers) is also important because the skill sets required; doing
    the science, communicating well across audiences, and understanding the different
    cultural forms of communication can be beyond what an individual alone can achieve.
    Wise creation of cross-supporting teams is an effective means of gaining depth
    and breadth (Kelly et al. 2019). Efforts to achieve transdisciplinarity have the
    potential to transform how we understand and manage fisheries for the benefit
    of all, now and into the future. Respecting Indigenous knowledge systems For millennia,
    Indigenous peoples used and managed aquatic resources around the globe in a sustainable
    manner (e.g., Gadgil et al. 1993; Atlas et al. 2021). Underpinning these efforts
    were deep relationships between people, place, water, and animal life and a recognition
    of their interconnectedness (Reid et al. 2021). Over the past few centuries Indigenous
    Peoples and rights holders have been marginalized or even been subjected to genocide.
    The great wisdom and knowledge that was developed through spending time on the
    land and water and shared (i.e., passed along) by elders and other knowledge holders
    through teachings, stories, art, and cultural practices (e.g., ceremony, spirituality)
    was co-opted, ignored or destroyed by colonial governments (e.g., to enable exploitation).
    Only in the last decade or so has attention been paid to the immense value of
    Indigenous knowledge systems and recognition that such knowledge can be used in
    tandem with western knowledge systems (i.e., science). This does not require abandoning
    western science but rather adopting a two-eyed seeing approach. Two-eyed seeing
    is “learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and
    ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges
    and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all”
    (Bartlett et al. 2012; Reid et al. 2021). Rethinking relationships with Indigenous
    communities and developing co-management systems that empower Indigenous communities
    and governments and give them sovereignty over fisheries resources are sorely
    needed (Wong et al. 2020). Moreover, there is a need to train western scientists
    and managers on how to respectfully engage with Indigenous communities, respect
    their knowledge and bridge knowledge systems given current reliance on western
    science (Kadykalo et al. 2021). There are a growing number of examples of co-production
    and co-assessment that involve Indigenous community members in fisheries monitoring
    and management which is promising (Crook et al. 2016; Chapman and Schott 2020).
    Recognizing some of the ongoing failures of current fisheries management systems
    combined with the need for reconciliation, there is opportunity and need to bridge
    knowledge systems (Plagányi et al. 2013; Fache and Pauwels 2020; Alexander et
    al. 2021) and empower and enable Indigenous communities to resume their role as
    guardians of aquatic resources (Fischer et al. 2022). Embracing the UN Declaration
    on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html)
    and developing meaningful and respectful partnerships with Indigenous rights holders
    is not only a legal and ethical imperative, but one that will benefit aquatic
    resources. Time and effort must be given to develop meaningful partnerships and
    relationships with Indigenous knowledge holders and rights holders—and to support
    Indigenous groups to identify shared fisheries and aquatic ecosystem goals and
    to envision and achieve sustainable management systems that are just. Thinking
    ahead with foresight science Conceiving and achieving sustainable fisheries into
    the future demands the use of forward-looking thinking, tools, and approaches
    that can enable diverse stakeholders (including researchers and managers) to proactively
    prepare for and respond to dynamic fisheries futures (Nash et al. 2021a, b). Such
    approaches are sorely needed given the already crowded inshore and inland waters
    and the new and expanding uses of offshore aquatic ecosystems related to energy
    development, shipping, tourism, offshore port facilities, cables, pipelines, mining
    and so on that need to be balanced with fisheries activities. Foresighting—a process
    of creatively identifying possible, plausible, alternative futures in the medium
    to long term—is one approach that is potentially useful for fisheries management
    and planning (e.g., Martin 1995; Magness et al. 2021; Kelly et al. 2022) as well
    as broader management of aquatic systems. Most typically, foresighting exercises
    combine different methods and tools (e.g., horizon scanning, scenario development,
    model simulations) to create scenarios or visions that describe and/or compare
    possible futures (Popper 2008). As outlined above, transformative changes are
    needed to address key fisheries challenges now and into the future. Foresighting
    presents a means to envision multiple fisheries futures, which can be used to
    inform efforts and alternative pathways to sustainability (Kelly et al. 2022).
    For example, by engaging stakeholders in imagining potential alternative futures,
    and proactively thinking and acting in preparation for these futures (McDonald
    et al. 2019). Thus, foresighting can foster and enable innovation—that emerges
    through dialogue, collaboration, and interaction between different preferences,
    perspectives, and ways of thinking about the future. Critical to this, will be
    identifying and recognising a wider range of knowledge (e.g., Fischer et al. 2022)
    and extending opportunities to participate to enable diverse stakeholders to engage
    and contribute. Foresighting exercises that involve diverse teams of stakeholders
    encourage inclusivity, transparency, and the resulting legitimacy of the possible
    fisheries futures imagined and conceived (Amanatidou 2014; Tatar et al. 2020).
    It is time to embrace foresight science to envision and potentially shape fisheries
    futures, including reducing uncertainty and preparing for managing fisheries in
    a dynamic world and as part of integrated multi-sector management. Working together
    across scales The issues discussed above are relevant from the smallest scales
    of relevance to fisheries (e.g., the genome of individual fish) through to considerations
    at the levels of entire stocks, ecosystems, national fisheries, and interconnected
    systems that span jurisdictions either regionally (e.g., those under the auspices
    of a regional fisheries management organization) or even globally (in the context
    of climate change of global trade systems). Looking forward requires science and
    knowledge sharing that can connect across scales. This does not necessarily mean
    all fisheries science must intentionally span multiple scales. However, it does
    mean that fisheries scientists should expect to find collaborators or other interested
    parties may want to connect their science into larger knowledge networks. In addition,
    there will be the expectation of more transparent knowledge sharing and potentially
    the expectation of more rapid acquisition and dissemination of information. These
    linkages and expectations will require technological advancements not only to
    facilitate it in the first instance but also to make sure such advancements can
    draw on and benefit the lived experience of fisheries of all backgrounds (FAO
    2019). Technology and the ability to rapidly aggregate and integrate complex data
    and information sources to inform fisheries assessment and management has the
    potential to make fisheries management more responsive and dynamic (Cooke et al.
    2022). Attitudinal openness to collaborations and information sources not typically
    associated with formal fisheries management will also be necessary (Fulton 2021).
    Fisheries management is complex and demands assessment schemes and management
    strategies that extend across diverse scales. Conclusion Here, we provide a retrospective
    perspective on our successes and failures in fisheries from the past 30 years
    coinciding with the timeline since the first WFC was held (1992). We also provide
    a prospective perspective on what is needed to achieve and sustain vibrant fish
    populations and sustainable fisheries in the coming 30 years that benefit current
    and future generations (Fig. 1). The importance of the WFC in helping to shape
    research agendas and identify innovative management opportunities cannot be understated.
    Previous syntheses and proceedings have served as guideposts for our community
    as we work collaboratively to address challenges that connect people, places,
    and fish. For example, Chuenpagdee and Bundy (2005, 2006) provided a thought-provoking
    synthesis of ideas emerging from the fourth WFC held in Vancouver, Canada in 2004
    that highlighted the intersection of different knowledge domains. Much has changed
    since the first WFC in Athens in 1992. We have certainly made progress on key
    issues—including bycatch, ecosystem-based management, and governance (and less
    so on others like the social dimensions of fisheries and equity). Yet, our human
    population continues to expand along with increasing inequitable consumption of
    resources. The continued use of unsustainable practices and a growing number of
    additive/synergistic effects arising from various threats make the future of fish
    populations and fisheries uncertain. Moreover, we sit in a period of reconciliation
    where we attempt to ensure that fisheries are just, equitable, and inclusive with
    benefits shared amongst all. It is our hope that the ideas shared here, particularly
    those focused on what is needed for the next 30 years, will help to empower existing
    fisheries professionals and inspire the next generation of fisheries professionals
    (see Nyboer et al. 2022) and, frankly, anyone associated and interested in fisheries
    from fishers to managers to scientists to act. At future WFC meetings, we will
    be able to assess progress towards the goal of sustaining vibrant fish populations
    and sustainable fisheries that benefit all while refining our path based on input
    from those with interest and expertise in fisheries science, management, and stewardship.
    Doing so will not only ensure a future for fish but also for those who depend
    on them for nutrition, livelihoods, and culture. References About the Marine Recreational

    India 1. Introduction The practice of farming involves not only a number of options
    but also dealing with a number of unknowns. Managing the unknowns/uncertainties
    with farming is essential, but it can be difficult under the circumstances of
    shifting climates, seasonal variation of temperatures, varying costs of farming
    materials, unviable crops, soil degradation, crop damage caused by pests, crop
    suffocation caused by weeds, and so on. On the other hand, technological development
    has pushed various applications to the boundaries helping toward the goal of combining
    a natural brain with an artificial one. This has resulted in the emergence of
    a new field of application using “Artificial Intelligence (AI)”, which refers
    to an intelligent machine/computer that can be made to think the way human thinks.
    The use of AI is becoming more common in the agricultural sector with the intention
    of developing innovative strategies for the continuation and enhancement of agriculture.
    The application of AI in agricultural sector is although evolving, it will likely
    be a reality with the development of other related technologies such as “big data
    analytics, internet-of-things, sensors and cameras, robotics, and drone technology”,
    etc. AI assists in providing predictive insights for agricultural activities such
    as “plantation- and harvesting-information” by analyzing soil management data
    sources [1]. These data sources include temperature, weather, soil and moisture
    analysis, and crop performance histories. As a result, crop yields can be increased
    while simultaneously reducing the amount of water, fertilizer, and pesticides
    used. Because of the increased use of AI technologies in agriculture, there is
    a potential for significant reduction in the negative impacts on natural ecosystems
    and on the safety of agricultural workers. This will further contribute to the
    maintenance of decreased food prices and increased food production thereby meeting
    the growing global population need. There has been interest in the field of AI
    [1,2,3] for decades and has been envisioned as a smart-machine supremacy that
    would take control of the planet and carry out the mundane, everyday tasks [4].
    Because of its enormous benefits and improved performance, AI has emerged as a
    critical agenda of many companies’ business models [5]. This is due to the fact
    that AI has evolved into a strategic system that can be applied across all industries.
    In the recent past, there have been a number of conceptual and empirical studies,
    and in many cases, the application of AI by regional and international government
    bodies have been demonstrated from both the academic and practitioner perspectives
    [6]. In addition, a number of conceptual and empirical studies have been conducted.
    AI has opened up a wealth of opportunities in a variety of sectors, including
    healthcare, agriculture, industry, and the environment [7,8]. According to Mukherjee
    et al. [9], most developing countries are transitioning from subsistence agriculture
    to commercial agriculture. This has led to a lot of use of AI, IoT, and other
    technologies based on information and communication in the agriculture of these
    countries. Consequently, the similar trend is also observed in India. Indian agriculture
    faces challenges such as non-uniform climatic conditions, low productivity, insect
    and disease infestations, market price instability, weak infrastructure, and slow
    agricultural growth [9,10]. Though advancements in AI technology have shifted
    major farmer clusters into a new competitive landscape, marginal and small farmers
    continue to confront challenges in adopting such new technologies, thus necessitating
    studies on AI implementation related issues in Indian Agriculture and allied sectors.
    Further, AI is transitioning into the digital era and is gradually taking over
    the role of intellectual resources towards economic growth [10,11]. However, the
    outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019 has presented a significant risk primarily
    due to multiple lockdowns, curfews, social isolation, and other related restrictions.
    These measures were taken with the goal of slowing down the virus spread causing
    human deaths. Moreover, this pandemic outbreak caused problems for virtually every
    industry, particularly, the labor-intensive agricultural sector in India. Agricultural
    outputs have gone down which has a knock-on effect on national economy to a lower
    level. Because this has been identified as one of the most serious problems within
    the agricultural sector [12], finding solutions through technology applications
    (i.e., AI) is one of the effective ways to deal with such crisis. Although AI
    has not yet reached its full potential in the fight against pandemics, a noticeably
    higher role for AI exists during COVID-19, and it can be utilized appropriately
    as a tool to complement human intelligence in a variety of fields, including agriculture.
    Because the majority of AI systems are Internet-based, their applications in India’s
    more remote regions are limited and constrained. The implementation of AI is contingent
    on the processes currently in place in an organization as well as its capacity
    for strategic technological planning [13]. Because of the current pandemic situation,
    Indian agriculture has only gradually and partially incorporated AI [14]. Since
    other countries have progressed with AI more rapidly to their advantage, India’s
    slow adoption of AI has reflected on agricultural output and it’s trading negatively
    [15]. In addition, the majority of members of the farming community in India’s
    rural areas are less-qualified when it comes to the computers and Internet use.
    Therefore, the government should ideally provide assistance to farmers by designing
    web-services, charging lower tariffs for those working with AI systems, and providing
    sufficient hands-on training [14,15]. Although, there has been some remarkable
    improvement brought about for AI adoption in the agricultural sector, it still
    has a lesser impact on agricultural activities when compared to its impacts and
    potentials in other sectors. This is because the agricultural activities are more
    labor-intensive that allows more labor in India context and quite justified. Getting
    AI is not likely to replace the labor but it makes the agri-business more efficient
    thereby helping the farmers more productive. The Indian agriculture supply chain
    faces a number of problems, such as a lack of groundwater, famine, economic hardship,
    resource warfare, and post-harvest losses that break nutrient cycles [16,17].
    These problems have a negative effect on the availability and quality of food
    [18]. These post-harvest loss issues become more significant during COVID-19 because
    of the implementation of strict lockdowns by the state and central governments
    in India to restrict the spread of the virus. Studies suggest innovative technologies
    like AI have the potential to improve SC visibility and traceability while also
    addressing food quality and safety concerns [19,20,21]. Hence, it was realized
    there is a need to explore the factors those hinder AI adoption among various
    stake holders of agri-food supply chain in India. In addition, the use of AI can
    lead to significant benefits in the Indian agri-food supply chain not only during
    the COVID-19 outbreak period but also in the long-term, which needs to be addressed
    and initiated to improve the agricultural activities. An investigation is required
    to determine the reason why the rural areas of India have a low level of AI adoption
    and implementation, particularly in agri-food supply chain. What difficulties
    might be encountered when putting AI into practice? What challenges Indian policymakers
    and decision-makers encounter while resolving the issues? This research aims to
    identify the benefits and the challenges facing the adoption of AI in the Indian
    agri-food supply chain. Further, the challenges that India’s developing agricultural
    sector need to overcome to create AI-based intelligent systems are explored. The
    specific objectives are to: Identify the benefits of AI in agri-food supply chain,
    and raise awareness among Indian rural farmers for its applications in light of
    the current-and post-pandemic situation; Highlight the significant challenges
    associated with the implementation of AI in agri-food supply chain; Develop and
    analyze a suitable model based on the interrelationships among the challenging
    parameters with their ranking based on prioritization. Rest of the paper is organized
    as follows. The preceding literature is examined in Section 2. Section 3 includes
    a full description of the research methodology. Section 4 and Section 5 provide
    a summary of the “results” and “discussion” respectively. Implications of this
    research are highlighted in Section 6, followed by conclusion Section 7. 2. Literature
    Review 2.1. Agriculture and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agriculture is a sustainable
    foundation of the economy [15,16,22], and it plays a critical role in both long-term
    development of the economy and the structural transformation of societies [22,23,24,25,26,27].
    Historically, the majority of agricultural activities were restricted to the growing
    of crops and the preparation of food [28]. On the other hand, during the past
    twenty years, the agricultural sector has become increasingly involved in the
    production, processing, and marketing of crop and livestock products, in addition
    to their distribution. These activities are within the agri-food supply chain.
    At the moment, it functions as a primary source of income and, thereby, contributes
    increasingly to GDP [29]. This means that it not only functions as a source of
    national trade but also helps in reduction of unemployment, the provision of raw
    materials for other industrial activities, and the overall growth of the economy
    of the country [30,31,32]. In order to satisfy the increasing food demand, agricultural
    and food production will need to increase by 70% by the year 2050 [33], the year
    the global population is estimated to surpass 9 billion. However, it is difficult
    to meet this target in the face of a range of challenges like resource shortages,
    climate changes [34], the COVID-19 pandemic, and extremely pessimistic socioeconomic
    projections. As a consequence, maintaining the viability of the agricultural sector
    is essential for ensuring food security in addition to eliminating hunger for
    the world’s expanding population. In addition, a well-documented management solution
    has become a prerequisite for quality conformance in the food chain due to the
    emergence of food-safety issues, such as “spongiform- encephalopathy of bovines
    and dioxins” in poultry [35]. A systematic transition from the existing paradigm
    of increased production to sustainable practices in agricultural sectors is an
    immediate need. This can assist farmers and consumers in making more informed-choices
    by implementing sustainable practices to effective solutions, particularly when
    utilizing digital-technologies such as “Internet of Things (IoT)”; “Machine Learning
    (ML)”; AI; and so on. Soil management is an essential component of agriculture.
    An in-depth understanding of the myriad of soil types and conditions is essential
    for maximising crop production while simultaneously protecting the earth’s natural
    resources. The effects of soil-borne pathogens can be controlled through proper
    management of the soil [36]. For example, the AI-based soil-management technique
    is known as “management-oriented modelling”, which consists of a set of possible
    management options to assist in minimising nitrate-leaching. This was done to
    protect the environment. It included a simulator for the purpose of evaluating
    each alternative and an evaluator to determine the user-weighted multiple-criteria
    alternative [37]. Also a remote sensing device incorporated into a “higher-order
    neural-network” was appropriate for the characterization and assessment of the
    soil-moisture dynamics [38]. While the existing “coarse-resolution soil-maps”
    are combined with hydrographic parameters derived from a “digital elevation model”,
    a model known as “artificial neural network (ANN)” helps predict soil-textures
    based on their characteristics [39]. Crop management begins with sowing and growth
    monitoring, followed by harvesting, storage, and distribution of crops. An agricultural
    management system such as “precision crop management (PCM)” is designed to focus
    on crops and soil-inputs in accordance with field requirements for the optimization
    of profitability and protection of the environment. The lack of timely as well
    as distributed-information on crops and soil-conditions has been reported of hampering
    PCM [40]. Farmers need to combine various crop management strategies to be able
    to deal with water shortages brought in by soils or limited irrigation [41]. This
    is necessary for farmers to be successful in farming. For the evaluation of the
    operational behaviour of a farm system and the estimation of crop production,
    gross-revenues, and net profits for both individual fields and the whole farm,
    PROLOG has been found to be effective in utilising weather data, capacities of
    machinery, availability of labour, and information on prioritised and permissible
    implements, tractors, and operators [42]. Weed is responsible for a steady decline
    in the anticipated yields and profits made by farmers [43]. An uncontrolled weed
    infestation results in a 50% yield reduction for corn crops and dried beans [43],
    and about a 48% loss in wheat yield [44,45]. A “global positioning-system (GPS)”
    controlled patch-spraying based on an AI approach can be used for weed control
    in agriculture [46]. A drone travelling at a speed of 1.2 km-per-h has been successfully
    used in weed control [47]. In most cases, the crops are laid out in rows; consequently,
    the application of a crop row-detection algorithm helps in properly separating
    the weeds and crop pixels [48]. This is something that can be utilised by an “unmanned
    aerial-vehicle (UAVs)” for the purpose of performing efficient weed control. In
    addition to this, there is a demand for the implementation of AI strategies in
    disease management and control [49,50,51]. 2.2. AI Applications for Agriculture
    and Food Sectors Improvement AI is a creative tool that models how human intelligence
    and aptitude are processed by machines, primarily by computers, robots, and digital
    technology [52]. The application of machine language (ML), which fosters both
    inventiveness and productivity, is one of the primary focuses of AI. The development
    of AI has paved the way for applications of the technology in the agricultural
    and food industries. Farmers are turning to AI tools in the hopes of discovering
    more efficient methods to protect their crops from being destroyed by weeds. The
    application of innovative AI-based techniques to the agri-food supply chain has
    a number of benefits, including a reduction in the cost of training, a reduction
    in the amount of time needed to solve problems, a reduction in the number of errors
    made by humans, a reduction in the amount of human intervention that is required,
    and intelligent decisions that are affordable, accurate, and satisfactory [53].
    The application of ML algorithms to the various nodes that make up the agricultural
    supply chain is becoming increasingly important [54]. Numerous studies examine
    the significance of agricultural crop yields as a means of enhancing plant management.
    As a result, ML and AI algorithms can help consumers and farmers make optimal
    decisions for crop yield forecasting. This can lead to higher yields and greater
    profits for everyone involved. In recent years, various ML algorithms, such as
    ANN, regression, Bayesian networks, decision trees, deep learning, and others,
    have been utilized for the purpose of developing prediction models [55,56]. According
    to the findings of Arvind et al. [48], it is possible to effectively predict and
    manage drought by combining the use of an ML algorithm with the utilization of
    other sensors and systems, such as “Zigbee and Microcontroller”. Further, the
    ANN feed-forward and ANN feed-back propagation techniques were applied in a smart
    farm in order to make the most of the available water resources [57]. Few examples
    of technology that is based on AI include UAVs and robotics, block chains [58],
    geographic information systems [59], and satellite navigation. Agricultural drones
    can now provide farmers with water, fertilizer, and pesticides, as well as filming,
    photographing, and creating maps of plants and fields in real time [60]. This
    functionality of agricultural drones could better assist farmers in making management
    decisions. Adopting sustainable farming practices has been encouraged in order
    to safeguard natural resources and accomplish the “sustainable development goals
    (SDG)”. Utilizing digital technologies in agriculture, notably AI, machine learning,
    deep learning, and the technology behind block chains, could result in potential
    gains. The growth of technology has resulted in an increased demand for AI, which
    can perform difficult jobs more quickly and efficiently, as well as at a reduced
    cost [61,62,63,64,65,66]. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of cutting-edge
    technology based on AI may prove to be a superior answer [67]. Moreover, AI has
    been used widely in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic [68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80].
    In addition, the technologies of “Industry 4.0”, which take the real-time information
    provided by AI and IoT. Printing the necessary medical components is possible
    by combining cutting-edge design software with digital manufacturing technologies
    such as 3D printing [79,80]. According to Panpatte [81], AI enables the collection
    of a greater quantity of data from public websites as well as from the government,
    which it then analyzes and uses to give farmers solutions for a wide variety of
    perplexing problems [82]. In addition to this, AI has begun to play a large role
    in people’s day-to-day lives, with the intention of modifying the environment
    through the extension of people’s perceptions and capabilities [83,84,85,86].
    2.3. AI Implementation Challenges in Agri-Food Supply Chain during COVID-19 The
    challenges associated with the implementation of AI in agri-food supply chain
    in the global level as well as Indian context are discussed in the following sub-sections.
    2.3.1. AI in the Global Level More sustainable supply chains, particularly those
    connected to the food sectors, are required as a result of increased globalization
    amidst world’s population growth [87]. Moreover, an intelligent system’s major
    attribute is considered to beits’ ability in executing required tasks in a very
    short-time with accuracy. The majority of systems fail in achieving the required
    accuracy or response-time or both. However, the selection of task strategy for
    users gets affected by system-delay and the selection of strategy is usually a
    cost-function-based hypothesis that combines the factors such as: the required
    efforts in synchronizing the input-system’s availability and the afforded accuracy-levels.
    Normally, people looking for minimum efforts and maximum accuracy-levels tend
    to choose among three-strategies: “seamless-performance, quickness, and control”
    features [88]. The volume of input data influences the strength of an intelligent
    system. An immense volume of data is required to be monitored by a real-time AI
    system that needs to filter-out much of the incoming data. However, to significant
    or unexpected events, it should remain responsive [89]. In order to improve the
    speed and accuracy of systems, only very relevant-data should be used with an
    in-depth knowledge of the task of the system. For developing an agricultural intelligent
    system, combined efforts of agriculture specialists from various fields are required
    along with the cooperation of the farmers [90]. For agricultural management, the
    emerging expert or intelligent systems have been useful tools in providing integrated,
    area-specific, and interpreted guidance. However, as the development of these
    intelligent systems is fairly recent for agriculture, the use of these systems
    in commercial-agriculture is limited [90]. In a study, a discussion has been made
    on various application of thermal-imaging like “pre-harvest operations, field-nursery,
    yield-forecasting, irrigation-scheduling, termite-attack, green-house gases, and
    farm-machinery” [91]. Furthermore, a distributed wireless-network has been used
    for controlling irrigation-process from a remote-place [92]. 2.3.2. AI in the
    Indian Context The AI applications need to be more robust in agriculture for exploring
    its enormous benefits [93,94]. The outcome of cultivation largely depends on various
    cognitive-solutions’ reception. While, a large scale research is still in progress
    and the industry has been under-served, some applications are still available
    in the market [95]. An automated irrigation-system using GPRS-module as communicating-device
    was developed and it was found to result in 90% more water-savings than conventional
    irrigation-systems [96]. Katariya et al. [97] have suggested the use of robot
    in the agricultural fields for spraying of pesticides, dropping of seeds, water-supply
    and ploughing activities. The working of the robot was designed to follow white-linetrack
    of the needy tasks, while other surfaces were regarded as black/brown. Kodali
    and Sahu [98] have discussed the use of “Losant platform” in order to monitor
    the agricultural land and also, for intimating the farmers via SMS/e-mail for
    any variances in the system. Roopaei et al. [99] have discussed the use of cloud-based
    thermal-imaging system for the irrigation in agricultural sector. Since AI uses
    big data, thus the looking-up method and training need to be properly defined
    to achieve speed and accuracy [100]. Although, the AI-based systems are gradually
    embedded in variety of products and services, ensuring successful working of human
    and AI together remains a challenge. A flexible subsystems is required that will
    interface with an integrated environment for AI-based robotics’ technology [101],
    and have more capabilities in accommodating a large amount of user data. AI-based
    systems are unable to learn from their environment like human-being. However,
    the AI-based systems perform better with given parameters and rules. But the major
    limitations are with decision-making where context plays significant-role. The
    various cognitive solutions available for agriculture are very expensive, and
    thus the AI solutions need to be more viable to the farming-community [100]. A
    digital-agriculture refers to the use of “hi-tech computer-systems” for calculating
    a number of parameters like weed-detections, crop-predictions, yield-detections,
    and crop-quality by using the ML [102]. Bannerjee et al. [103] have offered a
    brief-overview of AI techniques by covering AI advancement in the agriculture
    domain from early 1980s to 2018. Jha et al. [104] have discussed different automation-practices
    like “wireless-communications, IoT, ML, AI, and deep-learning”. Further, they
    discussed about a proposed system’s implementation in botanical-farm for leaf
    and flower identification in addition to watering by using IoT. The growing demand
    towards the “AgTech industry” with the use of computer-vision and AI might be
    a path for sustainability in food-production for feeding the future [105]. Talaviya
    et al. [106] have discussed various methods used by drones in agriculture for
    spraying in addition to crop-monitoring. 3. Research Methodology 3.1. The Population
    and Sampling Farmers from rural parts of Odisha (India) were the population-targets
    in this study. Given the social-distancing and movement restrictions, 42 villages
    in Khorda district of Odisha were chosen. With the assistance and direction of
    the respective village chiefs, a total of 1450 farmers were randomly selected
    from those villages. The data were collected during the mid-period of the year
    2021 (i.e., during the months of March and June of 2021). 3.2. Questionnaire Design
    and Data Collecting The questionnaire was designed based on existing literature
    along with consultation with experts in the field (Appendix A). The purpose of
    the questionnaire was to gather comprehensive sociodemographic data and awareness
    of Indian rural farmers about the use and usefulness of AI during the pandemic
    COVID-19. The sociodemographic data included the age, sex, education, occupations;
    expertise in farming; and type of farming-lands ownership. The awareness questionnaire
    included the knowledge levels and the benefits of AI in agriculture and agri-food
    supply chain in addition to its context of COVID-19. However, only 543 responses
    were gathered, even though all 1450 of the chosen farmers received the questionnaire
    personally and via farmer-to-farmer interactions. This resulted in a response
    rate of 37.45%. 3.3. Model Generation and Ranking of the Challenging Parameters
    “Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM)” was used to establish inter-item relationship.
    The direct and indirect relationships among those items help in depicting the
    situation more correctly in comparison to individual-item [107]. However, a collective
    understanding was provided by ISM for these relationships, which has been applied
    by various authors for different fields of applications [108,109,110]. The ISM
    was utilized in this study to determine the relationships between the challenging
    implementation parameters for AI in India’s agricultural sectors during the COVID-19
    pandemic. With the help of thirty-two-experts having different areas of expertise
    (Table 1), the parameters associated with the implementation of AI in the agricultural
    sectors of India during COVID-19 pandemic were identified. The experts were chosen
    from agricultural, environmental and academic backgrounds with 25 males, 7 females,
    and a total 21 doctorates with remaining having master degrees. Average experiences
    of these experts from the three fields were with more than 23 years, 22 years,
    and 23 years, respectively (Table 1). Further, the interrelation among these challenging
    parameters in the implementation of AI was found and an ISM model was developed.
    In general, the beginning of ISM takes place by identifying relevant-variables
    to some problem that can be accomplished through extensive-review of literatures
    as well as experts’ opinion, which extends with selection of a contextually-relevant
    subordinate-relation. In this study, on the basis of the judgment on element-set
    as well as the contextual-relation, a “structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM)”
    was derived from pair-wise variables’ comparison. Then, the relative relationships
    along with the associated-direction of relations among the variables were found.
    The relationship-direction linking the “variables (i, j)” was represented by the
    following symbols: “V, A, X and O” (V: to get factor j, factor i is necessary;
    A: to get factor i, factor j is necessary; X: the contributions of factors i and
    factor j help one another; and O: factor i and factor j have no relationships).
    In the next-step, the SSIM was converted into a “reachability-matrix (RM)” with
    subsequent checking of transitivity, which is the basic assumption in ISM that
    states that “if variable i is related j and j is related to k, then i is necessarily
    related to k”. After completion of the transitivity-embedding, a matrix-model
    was obtained, and with subsequent partitioning of the elements, the structural-model
    called ISM was derived. Further, the “Step-Wise-Assessment and Ratio-Analysis
    (SWARA)” method was utilized [109,111], for ranking of the associated parameters
    for AI implementation based on their preferences by the experts for prioritization.
    Table 1. Experts’ demographics. 4. Results 4.1. The Socio-Demographic Data and
    Awareness of Farmers The socio-demographic data as well as awareness of farmers
    regarding the usefulness of Al in agriculture during COVID-19 is presented in
    Table 2. The majority of respondents were in the age group of 37 to 42 years (45.30%),
    males (60.22%), education-levels of ≤10th (37.01%), agriculture as primary-occupation
    (100%), none as secondary-occupation (96.31%), household-member ranging from 1
    to 5 (92.26%), expertise in farming between 11 to 20 years (21.91%), and 92.63%
    with ownership of farming-land, respectively. Further, 520 farmers (95.76%) preferred
    to use traditional farming techniques. While COVID-19 outbreak was well-understood
    by 100% farmers, the importance, benefits and utilization of AI in agriculture
    or agri-food supply chain was acknowledged by only 22.83%. Only 39.59% of the
    farmers have the understanding that the application of AI in agriculture or agri-food
    supply chain will be beneficial, which revealed the unawareness among most of
    the farming community about the technological advancement which is supported by
    earlier studies [112,113,114,115,116,117]. Table 2. Sociodemographic data and
    awareness of farmers (n= 543). 4.2. Development of ISM Model As shown in Table
    3, various significant “challenging parameters (CPs)” associated with the implementation
    of AIin India’s agri-food supply chain during this COVID-19 outbreak were identified.
    In the process of developing the ISM model, the identified twelve CPs were also
    taken into account to determine their interrelationships. Table 3. CPs associated
    with implementation of AI. On the basis of contextual-relationships, the development
    of SSIM for all the twelve challenging parameters from Table 3 were completed
    by using the symbols like “V, A, X and O” as shown in Table 4. Then, the transformation
    of SSIM into a “binary-matrix (B-M)”, called as “initial reachability-matrix (IR-M)”,
    was done by altering “V, A, X and O” to “0 and 1” respectively (Table 5). By displaying
    the driving-power and dependence of each parameter (Table 6), the “final reachability-matrix
    with transitivity-relation (FR-M)” was created. The driving-power of a parameter
    is the total number of parameters, by itself included, that it assists in achieving.
    The dependence also reflected the total number of criteria that it assists in
    achieving [118,119,120]. Then from the FR-M, the corresponding “reachability-set
    (R-S)” and “antecedent-set (A-S)” for each-element was found, where the R-S included
    the same parameter and other parameters that it helps to achieve, and similarly,
    the A-S also included the same parameter in addition to other parameters that
    help in achieving it. Moreover, the “intersection-set (I-S)” was derived with
    the positioning of top-level in ISM hierarchy for the parameter having same R-S
    as well as A-S. Similar strategies were followed for the identification of the
    elements in the subsequent levels that continued till identifying the levels of
    each element (shown in Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10 and Table 11). The
    identified levels were used in building the diagraph along with the ISM final-model.
    It may be noted that during the subsequent iteration-processes, the elimination
    of few parameters took-place. As illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2, the ISM
    model for the parameters was developed first, and then the ISM final-model. Figure

    Table 10. Iteration-4. Table 11. Iteration-5. 4.3. MICMAC Analysis In the MICMAC
    (Matriced’ImpactsCroisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement) analysis, four
    categories, such as, “excluded, dependent, relay, and influential”, were applied
    to the parameters so as to classify them of the influence of driving-power and
    dependence on such parameters. For the MICMAC analysis, the dependence was plotted
    on “X-axis”, while the drive-power on “Y-axis”, as shown in Figure 3. Given that
    any changes to one cluster’s parameters might have caused equal changes to occur
    in another cluster’s parameters, the system is presumed to be stable. The following
    is how the cluster was classified in the MICMAC analysis along with its typical
    meanings: Figure 3. Diagraph of MICMAC analysis. (a)  Cluster-I This segment is
    referred as the “excluded-enablers” or “autonomous”, with “weak driving-power
    as well as weak dependence”, which look rather out-of-line just with minimal ties
    with the system. In this study, CP1, CP3, CP4, CP6, CP8, CP9 and CP10 such as
    “Response-time and accuracy-level; Requirement of big data; Cost of big data;
    Flexibility; Job-losses; Affordability issues; and Shortage of infrastructures”
    were recognized in this cluster. (b)  Cluster-II These are characterized as being
    “result-enablers”, having “weak driving-power in addition to strong dependency”,
    and even being “little-influent in addition to very-dependent”. The CPs “AI safety-related
    issues (CP12)” was found in this cluster. (c)  Cluster-III These are characterized
    as being “very-influent”. Other terms for them include “relay or linkage enablers”
    that are “unstable” and having “strong driving-power other than strong-dependency”.
    CP2 and CP5 (e.g., “Lack of standardization; and Implementing method”) were in
    this cluster. (d)  Cluster-IV These are characterized as being “very-influent
    and little-dependent”, which regulate the system’s remaining components and are
    sometimes referred to “determinant-enablers” or “independent”, with “strong driving-power
    in addition to weak-dependency”. In the system, these are also referred to as
    “entry-enablers”. The parameters CP7 i.e., “Lack of contextual-awareness” and
    CP11 i.e., “Farmer’s unwillingness” were recognized in this cluster. 4.4. The
    Associated Parameters for the CPs in AI Implementation and Their Ranking The “associated
    parameters (APs)” for the CPs in AI implementation were illustrated in Table 12.
    Table 12. APs for AI implementation. The stages recommended by Keršuliene et al.
    [121] served as the foundation for the SWARA method’s ranking of the most and
    least significant criteria i.e., the associated challenges, at higher- and lower-levels.
    As shown in Table 12, the associated major-parameters and corresponding sub-parameters
    for AI implementation in agriculture were taken into consideration as criteria
    and sub-criteria for further ranking using the SWARA method. The three-criteria
    that were identified in this study included: “Performance (AP1); Costs and methods
    associated (AP2); and Farming-community oriented (AP3)”, respectively. Under the
    criteria AP1,the recognized five sub-criteria included: “Response-time and accuracy-level
    (CP1); Lack of standardization (CP2); Requirement of big data (CP3); Flexibility
    (CP6); AI safety-related issues (CP12)”.Under the criteria AP2, the recognized
    four sub-criteria included: “Cost of big data (CP4); Implementing method (CP5);
    Affordability issues (CP9); and Shortage of infrastructures (CP10)”.Correspondingly,
    the two sub-criteria, under the criteria AP3 included: “Lack of contextual-awareness
    (CP7); Job-losses (CP8); and Farmer’s unwillingness (CP11)”; respectively. Following
    the calculation of the associated criteria along with sub-criteria weights by
    the use of SWARA approach, their ranking was completed. Table 13, Table 14, Table
    15 and Table 16 reflected the weights of the various criterion and sub-criteria,
    accordingly. The participating 32 experts’ assistance was used to determine the
    relative relevance of “average-values (sj)” for both criterion and sub-criteria
    as well. The final-weights of the relevant sub-criteria were calculated by using
    the criteria’s weights. Moreover, the calculation’s evaluation scale was based
    on 5% increments, with the experts indicating a comparison and value differences
    based on 5% increments (like 5%, 10%, 15%, and so forth). The final figures in
    this section, however, were computed using the “arithmetic-average” of the judgments
    of the experts. Table 13. Final-weights of AP1, AP2, and AP3. Table 14. Final
    revised-weight’s of CPs under AP1. Table 15. Final revised-weight’s of CPs under
    AP2. Table 16. Final revised-weight’s of CPs under AP3. *Step-A: Priority-based
    classification of the criteria. On the basis of the relative relevance of each
    criterion, experts ranked the criteria in this phase. Initial placement of the
    most significant criterion came first, and was followed by the placement of the
    least significant criteria in the final position. Step-B: Choosing the “average-values
    (sj)” that are most important. Starting with the criterion that was placed second,
    the relative relevance of average-values (sj) was calculated depending on how
    important criterion (cj) was compared to criterion (cj+1). Step-C: Performing
    the “coefficients (kj)” calculation as represented in Equation (1): 𝑘 𝑗 ={ 1,𝑗=1
    𝑠 𝑗 +1,𝑗>1 (1) Step-D: Performing the “revised-weights (qj)” calculation as represented
    in Equation (2): 𝑞 𝑗 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     1,𝑗=1 𝑞 𝑗−1 𝑘 𝑗 ,𝑗>1 (2) Step-E: Performing
    the “comparative-weights (wj)” calculation as represented in Equation (3) for
    the evaluation-criteria: 𝑤 𝑗 = 𝑞 𝑗 ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑛 𝑞 𝑘 (3) where “n” is the number of
    criterion Table 17 provided a summary of the weights of all relevant criteria
    and sub-criteria along with their respective rankings in relation to the final
    weights’ values. Table 17. Weighted summarization of criterion as well as sub-criteria.
    From the Table 17, it was found that the associated major-parameters for AI implementation
    in agriculture, such as “Costs and methods associated” ranked first followed by
    “Performance”; and “Farming-community oriented”, respectively. Similarly, other
    associated sub-parameters ranking were: cost of big data; implementing method;
    lack of contextual-awareness; both “job-losses” and “affordability issues”; response-time
    and accuracy-level; shortage of infrastructures; farmer’s unwillingness; requirement
    of big data; lack of standardization; flexibility; and AI safety-related issues,
    respectively. 5. Discussion India’s agricultural sector sustainability is essential
    for continued economic growth. AI adoption is perceived to have a positive effect
    on the growth and development of agricultural practices in India. It has the potential
    to offer effective and workable solutions to the majority of the challenges such
    as rising labour costs, cultivation costs, crop’s failures due to diseases with
    unpredictable yields, rainfall uncertainties, climatic alterations, soil fertility
    degradation, and the fluctuating market prices for agricultural products. Under
    the circumstances, AI can offer advanced farming practices to beat the challenges.
    The challenging parameters identified include response-time and accuracy-level,
    lack of standardization, requirement of big data, flexibility, AI safety-related
    issues, cost of big data, implementing method, affordability issues, shortage
    of infrastructures, lack of contextual-awareness, job-losses, and farmer’s unwillingness,
    respectively. The parameters determine how they interacted with one another to
    develop the ISM model, which was then followed by a MICMAC analysis for possible
    mitigation measures. Based on the cluster’s categorization in the MICMAC analysis,
    the challenging parameters such as “response-time and accuracy-level; requirement
    of big data; cost of big data; flexibility; job losses; affordability issues;
    and shortage of infrastructure” were identified in the autonomous category. These
    parameters appear problematic for a number of reasons, including concerns regarding
    the AI’s level of safety. The parameters such as “lack of standardization”, and
    “Implementing approach” are revealed as influential factors. On the other hand,
    “lack of contextual-awareness” and “Farmer’s unwillingness” are two more CPs in
    its list of possible explanations. However, when the SWARA method was used to
    rank all of the criteria, i.e., for the associated major parameters for AI implementation
    in agriculture, it was discovered that “Costs and methods associated” ranked first,
    followed by “Performance” and “Farming-community-oriented”, respectively. Similarly,
    depending on the ranking of corresponding sub-parameters, the descending priorities
    were: cost of big data; implementing method; lack of contextual-awareness; both
    “job-losses” and “affordability issues”; response-time and accuracy-level; shortage
    of infrastructure; farmer’s unwillingness; requirement of big data; lack of standardization;
    flexibility; and AI safety-related issues, respectively. Farmers may be able to
    resolve the complex problems facing the industry by making use of AI platforms,
    which can be done with the available resources. However, the rural farmers must
    approach the government since they cannot afford to invest in the proposed process
    due to the high expense of building agricultural infrastructures. The number of
    initiatives suggested and completely supported by the government was significantly
    affected by the income level of the rural farmers. High-income farmers may fund
    the construction of agricultural infrastructures on their own without putting
    a financial burden on the government [122], while the low-income farmers usually
    avoid of taking such initiatives. The application of AI is highly beneficial and
    has the potential to bring about technological improvement in diverse areas. In
    the context of COVID-19, AI-based systems are still in an early stage, and it
    may take some time before it becomes visible [123]. Additionally, very few AI
    systems have reached an operationally mature state at this point. Despite this,
    the farmers have been facing lot of difficulties in carrying out agricultural
    tasks during this COVID-19 pandemic. Although there are significant variations
    in the rate of AI adoption between countries [124], developing countries are just
    now beginning to experiment with the technology. There has been growing interest
    from the academic and research communities in developing AI methods [125]. Over
    twenty percent of the jobs that are currently held in developed nations such as
    the United Kingdom are expected to be considerably impacted by AI-driven technology,
    according to a report published by the “World Economic Forum” [126]. It is anticipated
    that adoption of AI-driven digitalization will contribute around $15.7 trillion
    to the global financial system by the year 2030 [127], and countries all over
    the world are working to implement it. In addition, a number of other countries
    are rapidly allocating public funding for AI-allied initiatives [128], but they
    also encounter obstacles in their efforts to successfully employ these monies
    [129]. These challenges are around ethical considerations, and value creation
    for the public sector and the community [130]. It is believed that the use of
    AI would result in a competitive edge because it would increase productivity to
    some degree. There have only been a limited number of studies that have sought
    to explain the use and thereby the obstacles in AI adoption [131,132]. Despite
    the fact that AI and ML are very popular as a predictive interdisciplinary approach
    to improve the food and agriculture practices, there are some limitations that
    stakeholders need to understand [133]. The possibility of there being too few
    jobs requirement is by far the most significant societal issue. As robots and
    intelligent machines take over the majority of repetitive tasks, there will be
    a significant drop in human engagement. The skills requirement will rather shift
    from the front-end activities to the back-office operations in the event of AI
    adoption. Other technological challenges like the robots that can only complete
    the occupations or tasks for which they were programmed, otherwise they frequently
    fail or produce irrelevant outputs. The expensive cost of constructing and maintaining
    intelligent devices and computers is another technological limitation. This is
    especially true when it comes to regular updates of hardware and software in order
    to stay up with shifting requirements. Repairing and maintaining machines is an
    expensive endeavour. The relatively expensive price of these applications may
    cause an increase in the overall price of the agricultural product. In addition,
    there may be risks and issues related to sustainability that go beyond the advantages
    offered by intelligent and automated technology. It includes things like enormous
    energy utilisation, issues with e-waste, competitive intensity, job losses, and
    even moral guidelines [134,135,136,137]. It is crucial to keep in mind that most
    rural farmers have limited landholdings and a constrained resource base when using
    AI technology. In order to employ AI technology to enhance their profitability
    sustainably, farmers must be encouraged to see agriculture as a business. Additionally,
    farmers’ interest in employing the already-available AI model has to be piqued.
    Farmers must receive the proper training and demonstrations on how to use certain
    AI-based technologies. Therefore, AI technology is needed to tackle problems in
    the actual world. For AI to be extensively used, it must be adaptable, inexpensive,
    accessible, realistic, and sustainable. In the coming years, AI has a huge potential,
    especially in developing nations. AI tools might help with accurate crop monitoring
    and, to a significant part, solve the labour shortage problem in agriculture.
    With advancements in the IT infrastructure [138,139], the potential of AI technology
    in agriculture adds to greater agricultural growth. A fundamental obstacle to
    the broad use of AI in agriculture is the absence of straightforward solutions
    that smoothly integrate and embed AI in agriculture. The bulk of farmers lack
    the resources and digital abilities to study AI options on their own. These new
    AI technologies must be linked into farmers’ established and systems and infrastructure
    in order to integrate AI seamlessly throughout the agriculture and agri-food supply
    chain. AI is not fully capable of supporting agriculture since it cannot function
    outside of its training. Farmers lack technical understanding and are ignorant
    of such technology, especially those in rural regions. Agriculture may become
    semi-autonomous when knowledge is increased, and technologies are made more available
    to the typical farmer, with AI paving the way. 6. Implications Due to farming’s
    reliance on natural forces for the majority of its output, the rural farmers are
    under a great deal of stress. The unpredictable nature of rain, a labour shortage,
    and a yearly requirement for higher yields all contribute to this stress. This
    means that the agricultural sectors as well as the agri-food supply chain network
    will need to expand up significantly over the next several years, and farm efficiency
    would need to be doubled. AI offers farm automation while taking all of these
    difficulties into consideration. This article gives the targeted academics, readers,
    and researchers a thorough compilation of challenges associated in implementing
    AI in India’s agri-food supply chain during COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The
    untapped challenges and potential opportunities in adopting AI to improve the
    agri-food supply chain are also brought to the readers’ attention. It also has
    the potential to more streamlined approaches to develop AI-based relevant studies
    in this specific subject area. Future AI-powered technologies will cause a huge
    change in the agriculture industry. AI and other cognitive technologies may be
    used by farms all over the world to enhance decision-making, automate tedious
    processes, and increase productivity. The farmers must also realize that AI is
    really a more developed form of earlier, less-complex technology to process, collect,
    and monitor field data. For AI to function, a proper technological base is required.
    Additionally, when farmers become acclimated to a simpler solution, it will be
    acceptable to step up and offer more AI functions. 7. Concluding Remarks AI will
    have solutions for practically everything related to agricultural activities including
    labour support and many other dimensions. It will directly help the Indian farming
    community in the years to come. AI implementation can help in developing smart
    farming for improved agricultural quality and productivity with reduced resource
    consumption. The technical breakthroughs will benefit companies that are interested
    in enhancing AI-based goods and/or services. This will allow better manage food
    supply challenges for a growing population. The future of AI in agriculture will
    require a strong focus on accessibility to rural Indian farming community because
    the majority of cutting-edge technology is presently being employed on large farms
    producing high-quality crops. This study has revealed the difficult aspects of
    applying AI in India’s agricultural sectors, such as response-time and accuracy-level,
    lack of standardization, requirement of big data, flexibility, AI safety-related
    issues, cost of big data, implementing method, affordability issues, shortage
    of infrastructures, lack of contextual-awareness, job-losses, and farmer’s unwillingness,
    respectively. Given the sector highly affected due to COVID-19 pandemic, this
    study has revealed the challenges of AI adoption. The proposed framework in this
    study puts the different potential barriers to AI adoption in the Indian agri-food
    supply chain into hierarchical order and groups them by type so that policymakers
    can think about them. Policymakers and academics could find out how much each
    barrier affects the use of AI in the agri-food supply chain in India, especially
    in rural areas, by paying attention to and analyzing each one separately. This
    could help them develop new skills and policies to reduce the effects of the barriers.
    The provision of infrastructure, the creation of a knowledge base for farmer organizations,
    holding training sessions, and the provision of low-interest bank loans are all
    examples of what the government could do to aid. Future AI technologies will provide
    creative and accurate answers to the main agricultural problems that farmers throughout
    the nation are now facing. The agri-food supply chain is being streamlined by
    AI as it assists farmers in automating their operations and moving toward precision
    cultivation for increased crop production and quality while employing fewer resources.
    Due to the fact that the bulk of cutting-edge technology is now being used on
    large, well-connected farms, the future of AI in agriculture will necessitate
    a strong focus on accessibility. AI will be beneficial and efficient in the agricultural
    sectors and the agri-food supply chain since it maximizes resource usage and efficiency
    and, to a great extent, overcomes the resources and labour deficit. As this study
    is limited to the information gathered from 543 farmers, considering 42 villages
    in Khorda district of Odisha (India), this can be further extended to other different
    village farmers throughout India for more reliable analysis and interpretation.
    Moreover, the identified CPs and APs were limited to very few, which may increase
    if the other farming communities throughout the nation will be considered. Author

    advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the development and implementation
    of digital food systems are becoming increasingly possible. There is tremendous
    interest in using different AI applications, such as machine learning models,
    natural language processing, and computer vision to improve food safety. Possible
    AI applications are broad and include, but are not limited to, (a) food safety
    risk prediction and monitoring as well as food safety optimization throughout
    the supply chain, (b) improved public health systems (e.g., by providing early

    and characterization of foodborne pathogens. However, AI technologies in food
    safety lag behind in commercial development because of obstacles such as limited
    data sharing and limited collaborative research and development efforts. Future
    actions should be directed toward applying data privacy protection methods, improving
    data standardization, and developing a collaborative ecosystem to drive innovations
    in AI applications to food safety. Keywords machine learning, public health, supply
    chain, computer vision, predictive analytics   1.  INTRODUCTION  Food safety remains
    a global concern, as supported by its estimated global impact on the economy and
    public health. Most recent estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate
    that globally every year, foodborne illnesses cause 600 million cases, resulting
    in 420,000 deaths and the loss of 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)
    (WHO 2015). Overall, progress in reducing foodborne illnesses globally has been
    slow and challenging. For example, foodborne illness rates for key foodborne pathogens
    in the United States (e.g., Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes) have been relatively
    steady over the past decade (CDC 2021) and the United States has consistently
    failed to meet many of its “Healthy People” food safety–related public health
    goals. For example, although Healthy People (2020) targeted a reduction in Salmonella
    incidence from 15.0 cases to 11.4 cases per 100,000 people by 2020, Salmonella
    incidence reached 17.1 cases per 100,000 people in 2019 (Tack et al. 2020). The
    challenges to reducing foodborne illnesses are multifaceted and complex and differ
    substantially by region, country, and the specific pathogen and foods of concern.
    In many countries, foodborne illness burdens are essentially unknown, primarily
    due to a lack of both public health surveillance systems and systematic food surveillance
    for foodborne pathogens. Although a focus on other public health issues perceived
    to be more urgent and impactful (e.g., malaria and HIV) may be one reason for
    the lack of surveillance, the costs and complexity of good foodborne disease surveillance
    also represent a barrier. Notably, the WHO recently recognized the public health
    impact of foodborne illness (including its impact on the health of children <
    5 years), which may help enhance foodborne disease surveillance in some countries
    and regions (WHO 2021). However, analytical tools are still needed to support
    the (a) design of improved and efficient surveillance systems and (b) interpretation
    of surveillance data. However, even in countries with relatively sophisticated
    surveillance systems (e.g., the United States, United Kingdom, some Western European
    countries, New Zealand), improved control of foodborne illnesses remains a challenge.
    Reasons for this include the extreme diversity of the food supply system (e.g.,
    large agricultural and food operations as well as hyperlocal small operations)
    and different foodborne pathogens with distinct ecologies, transmission pathways,
    and contamination sources, ranging from pathogens where preharvest contamination
    is a key concern (e.g., Salmonella Enteritidis) to organisms where contamination
    from human sources, typically at the location of meal preparation, is the main
    concern (e.g., norovirus). However, the issue is not as simple as one may think;
    even with limited preharvest control, Salmonella Enteritidis could ideally be
    controlled effectively if all consumers would practice perfect food safety strategies
    (e.g., no cross contamination and no consumption of raw eggs). Although improved
    detection and testing may help reduce foodborne illnesses, testing cannot assure
    safety, as foodborne illnesses and contamination events are typically rare and
    heterogeneously distributed [e.g., a listeriosis outbreak in the United States
    involved one human illness per 339,200 servings (Pouillot et al. 2016)]. Hence,
    novel approaches and strategies are essential for improved control of foodborne
    pathogens. In particular, through improved data analytics and predictive capabilities,
    artificial intelligence (AI) shows tremendous potential for improving food safety,
    as further detailed below.  2.  BACKGROUND ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  2.1.   Overview
    AI is conceptualized as the ability of a computer program or robot to perform
    human tasks (Copeland 2021). Moreover, AI programs are expected to have the ability
    of an intelligent being to interact with the environment and learn from the experience.
    Although not always visible, AI technology is ubiquitous in our lives in the form
    of software or embedded in hardware (Eur. Comm. 2018). Motivations to use AI are
    broad and generally include (a) mimicking human behaviors with the same level
    of competence and therefore reducing human labor or improving efficiency [e.g.,
    an auto-driving car that can recognize obstacles while making appropriate driving
    decisions (Gupta et al. 2021)]; (b) performing complex tasks that require a high
    level of intelligence [e.g., AlphaGo, which outperformed humans in chess (Chen
    2016)]; and (c) performing tasks beyond human capability or intuition [e.g., Netflix
    recommendation systems that automatically find and display movies that users will
    possibly like (Ranjan et al. 2019) and drug and vaccine discovery (Goodswen et
    al. 2021)]. The agri-food industry has also embraced the AI revolution by adopting
    different AI technologies for crop yield prediction (Sinwar et al. 2020), product
    quality control (Kondakci & Zhou 2016), improved traceability (Wang et al. 2017),
    and product development (Garver 2018). Although many review papers have already
    discussed AI applications in the food industry (Kakani et al. 2020, Mavani et
    al. 2021, Misra et al. 2020), this article focuses on AI applications in food
    safety, particularly microbial food safety. 2.2.   Categories of Artificial Intelligence
    Systems AI systems in the food industry can support decision-making based on the
    data streams fed through various processing equipment, instruments, and devices.
    Depending on how an AI system processes data and generates decisions, AI applications
    can be divided into two groups: (a) rule-based AI and (b) data-driven AI. A rule-based
    AI has a list of behavioral rules preprogrammed in advance. These rules are usually
    based on previous knowledge or experience about the physical food system and are
    often determined by expert opinions. As an example, a rule-based system using
    fuzzy rule-based reasoning was designed to assess the risk of violation for a
    cross-border e-commerce commodity (Song et al. 2019). Although a rule-based AI
    can be useful in making real-time decisions, one of its weaknesses lies in the
    inability to improve itself automatically. For example, if there are changes to
    the system (e.g., changes in weather patterns or production processes) that might
    impact the rules governing the food system and thus management decisions, then
    a rule-based AI system needs to be reviewed or verified by experts to remain relevant.
    Another weakness is that due to the complexity of food systems, rules in such
    AI systems are often (a) transformed to qualitative or semiquantitative via fuzzy
    logic, which might limit the exploitation of the data''s full potential, and (b)
    limited to those rules that can be defined with human intuition. In contrast,
    a data-driven AI system can overcome these drawbacks by (a) improving performance
    with the continuous collection of new data and (b) uncovering patterns beyond
    human knowledge. However, it is worth noting that sometimes an AI system can have
    components from both rule-based and data-driven applications, allowing it to be
    more flexible in handling different data sources. For example, a digital system
    named Supply-chain Pedigree Interactive Dynamic Explore (SPIDER) was proposed
    in a study (Wang et al. 2013) and has both a case-based reasoning engine and a
    neural network (NN) as part of the platform. The synergistic effects between these
    two techniques allow it to support and verify the implementation of Hazard Analysis
    and Critical Control Points (HACCP), which is a well-established management system
    for food safety. Despite this example, overall, AI is moving toward data-driven
    applications (Rajan & Saffiotti 2017), which are the focus of this review. Key
    subfields of data-driven AI relevant to food safety include (a) computer vision,
    (b) natural language processing, and (c) analytical tools ( Figure 1 ), which
    are discussed in greater detail below, with examples from the (a) supply chain,
    (b) public health, and (c) microbial data collection ( Figure 2 ). Figure 1 Conceptual
    illustration of key components within the realm of artificial intelligence (AI).
    Machine learning is one of the subfields of AI. Unsupervised learning, supervised
    learning, and reinforcement learning are learning methods within machine learning.
    Classic and neural networks are supervised learning algorithms. Random forest
    (RF), support vector machines (SVMs), and Kernel regression are algorithm subtypes
    within the classic algorithms, whereas recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional
    neural network (CNN) are algorithm subtypes of the neural network algorithms.
    Computer vision, natural language processing, and analytical tools are AI fields.

    CHAINS  “Smart” technologies for the food industry have emerged and advanced rapidly
    in recent years, with numerous companies using AI technologies, especially at
    the production level (Kakani et al. 2020). Notably, there has been investment
    and a growing body of “smart” food industry applied research, including AI-based
    digital tools for data collection and analysis. AI applications in food safety
    across agri-food supply chains have the potential to support traceability, monitoring,
    inspection, and other purposes and processes. To date, however, there has been
    limited generalizability and commercialization of available AI technologies for
    food safety. Here, we present examples of opportunities for AI applications (
    Table 1 ) that support food safety that could be further developed and implemented
    in industry across all stages of agri-food chains, including raw materials, production,
    processing, packaging, storage, distribution, and retail. Table 1 Potential artificial

    Maharana et al. 2019 3.1.   Raw Materials Machine learning (ML) approaches can
    be used to support the inspection of foods, including raw materials. For example,
    a Bayesian network model based on data from the European Union''s Rapid Alert
    System for Food and Feed from 2000 to 2013 was used to predict food fraud (Bouzembrak
    & Marvin 2016). In addition, since launching a pilot program in spring 2019, the
    US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been developing an ML-based screening
    tool using data from past seafood shipments to facilitate identification of high-
    and low-risk seafood shipments (FDA 2022a). ML-based approaches can also be used
    for supplier selection and procurement. For example, Mars, Inc., developed an
    aflatoxin predictive model that has been deployed internally to guide sourcing
    options (FDA 2022b). Another study used extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) ML
    algorithms to predict risk factors associated with abundance of Vibrio parahaemolyticus
    in oyster farms in Taiwan (Ndraha et al. 2021). Future research should support
    ongoing efforts by industry and government to develop tools for food safety inspection
    and procurement of raw materials, which would ideally lead to near real-time prediction
    of high-risk raw materials streams with better specificity and speed compared
    to classical testing-based approaches to assuring low-risk raw materials. 3.2.   Production
    At the production level, AI applications have been developed to support data collection
    and processing, analytics, and management of crops, livestock, water, and soil
    (Astill et al. 2020, Kamble et al. 2020, Kamilaris & Prenafeta-Boldú 2018, Liakos
    et al. 2018, Martos et al. 2021, Sharma et al. 2020, Smith 2019). To date, production-level
    AI food safety research has been primarily focused on ML-based descriptive and
    predictive tools. For example, numerous supervised learning models have been developed
    for predicting foodborne pathogen presence and levels in agricultural water and
    investigating associated risk factors (physiochemical, temporal, geospatial, weather,
    and anthropogenic) (Belias et al. 2021; Harrand et al. 2020; Polat et al. 2020;
    Stocker et al. 2022; Toro et al. 2022; Weller et al. 2020a, 2021a,b). Hence, there
    are opportunities for utilizing ML to support preharvest water management. For
    example, one study trained and compared advantages and disadvantages of various
    ML approaches, including support vector machines (SVMs) and Bayesian, tree-based,
    ensemble, instance-based, penalized regression, and rule-based learners to predict
    enteric pathogen (Salmonella and pathogenic Escherichia coli) presence in agricultural
    water sources; this study demonstrated that ML-based predictive models may be
    useful for identifying when and where pathogens are likely to be present in agricultural
    water (Weller et al. 2020b). ML has also been applied for investigating foodborne
    pathogens in the broader produce field environment. For example, one study utilized
    tree-based modeling to identify landscape and meteorological factors associated
    with the presence of pathogens (L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, Shiga-toxin-producing
    E. coli) in soil, fecal, water, and drag swab samples from produce fields (Strawn
    et al. 2013). Another study utilized random forest (RF) to identify and rank factors
    associated with L. monocytogenes isolation from soil, drag swab, and agricultural
    water samples from produce fields, demonstrating that water-related factors were
    the most important (Harrand et al. 2020). An example of larger-scale data collection
    and modeling is the ongoing Western Growers Food Safety Data Sharing Project,
    which involves utilizing growers’ data (inspections, product and water testing,
    location) as well as temporal, meteorological, and landscape data to train an
    ML model to support food safety risk assessment (FDA 2022b). Few studies have
    utilized supervised ML approaches in production environments other than produce
    (e.g., poultry farms) (Golden et al. 2019a,b). Unsupervised learning approaches
    have also been used at the production level for dimensionality reduction (e.g.,
    principal component analysis) (Ivanek et al. 2009, Park et al. 2014, Strawn et
    al. 2013). Leveraging existing production-level ML applications, future work should
    focus on developing tools to support food safety management by producers, including
    implementation and validation of tools on the farm. 3.3.   Processing and Packaging
    At the processing and packaging levels, AI can be utilized for informed decision-making
    and task automation, facilitating optimization of food quality and safety management,
    reducing risks, and increasing quality and productivity. For example, conditional
    RF was used to identify and rank facility-level quality management factors associated
    with postpasteurization contamination of fluid milk (Murphy et al. 2021). There
    have been numerous applications of ML for anomaly or defect detection in foods
    (e.g., produce) (Nturambirwe & Opara 2020). ML has also been used with sensor-based
    devices (e.g., e-nose, spectroscopy, imaging) for food quality and safety assessment
    (Chen & Yu 2022, Feng & Sun 2012, Ropodi et al. 2016, Zhou et al. 2019). For example,
    one study developed an algorithm to detect fecal contamination on leafy greens
    using hyperspectral imaging (Yang et al. 2010). As previously shown (Haiminen
    et al. 2019), AI based on metagenomics of food and food ingredients can also help
    with food authentication, which is another relevant application to food safety,
    as fraudulent food or food with fraudulent ingredients may represent a higher
    food safety risk. Environmental monitoring programs are implemented in food facilities
    to detect contamination and verify the effectiveness of control measures. Recent
    studies have developed agent-based models of Listeria contamination in food facilities,
    allowing for the simulation of sampling strategies and corrective actions (Barnett-Neefs
    et al. 2022, Sullivan et al. 2021, Zoellner et al. 2019). ML can be combined with
    agent-based modeling to improve model performance and decision-support (Zhang
    et al. 2021b). ML approaches can be also used to design and optimize environmental
    monitoring programs in facilities. For example, at the retail level, one study
    developed ML-based (SVMs and RF) classification models of L. monocytogenes persistence
    in retail delicatessen environments (Vangay et al. 2014). Building on this previous
    work on Listeria, future efforts to develop model-based tools to facilitate decision-support
    relating to environmental monitoring of foodborne pathogens in different types
    of facilities should be pursued. Additionally, the aforementioned agent-based
    models of Listeria in food facilities represent a first step toward development
    of digital twins (i.e., a virtual or digital representation of physical systems
    to simulate the behavior of the system) (Defraeye et al. 2021, Henrichs et al.
    2022, Nasirahmadi & Hensel 2022); these types of tools will provide a tremendous
    opportunity to support and improve food safety management. AI can also be employed
    for monitoring and optimizing cleaning and sanitation in the food industry. Previous
    studies have utilized ML with various sensor technologies (e.g., electrical, optical,
    acoustic, and ultrasonic) to monitor fouling and cleaning of food processing equipment
    (Escrig et al. 2019, 2020a,b; Simeone et al. 2020; Úbeda et al. 2016; Wallhäußer
    et al. 2011, 2013). For example, one study developed NN models able to predict
    area and volume of fouling during cleaning using data from ultrasonic sensors
    (Simeone et al. 2020). Another study developed a system to detect and diagnose
    anomalies in clean-in-place using historical data and ML (multiway principal component
    analysis) (Yang et al. 2018). Preventive and corrective maintenance are important
    for maintaining food safety. Predictive maintenance is the concept of using predictive
    tools to determine when maintenance actions are necessary. Although ML methods
    applied to predictive maintenance across industries have been reviewed recently
    by Carvalho et al. (2019), to date, there have been no published AI-based applications
    for predictive maintenance in food processing facilities, presenting an opportunity
    for research and innovation. 3.4.   Storage, Distribution, and Retail At the storage,
    distribution, and retail levels, there are several AI applications for optimizing
    pricing and scheduling, identifying and navigating distribution, and personalizing
    advertising. However, there are few existing AI applications for food safety.
    Two main areas of opportunity for AI application are (a) supply chain management
    (especially cold chain) and (b) food safety management at retail. Control of environmental
    conditions, especially temperature, in agri-food chains is important for food
    safety. Temperature control and monitoring can occur across all stages, including
    storage, distribution (e.g., refrigerated trucks), and retail (Chaudhuri et al.
    2018, Mercier et al. 2017). Utilizing environmental data collected at various
    stages of supply chains, data analytics and modeling tools can enable traceability,
    risk management, and planning optimization. For example, AI tools can be developed
    to facilitate temperature control that maximizes sustainability and food safety,
    such as the deep learning–based tool termed Nemesyst, which optimizes retail refrigeration
    while ensuring temperatures stay within food safety limits (Onoufriou et al. 2019).
    AI can also be utilized for cold-chain break analysis, including temperature prediction
    and cold-chain break detection (Loisel et al. 2021). Although there are few existing
    AI-based applications for food safety at the retail level, a recent article proposed
    many areas of opportunities for AI in retail (Friedlander & Zoellner 2020). For
    example, the authors proposed that simulation-based training modules utilizing
    vision technologies (such as virtual reality) should be developed to support retail
    food safety training (e.g., handwashing) (Friedlander & Zoellner 2020). ML-based
    approaches can also be used to support inspection of retail settings. For example,
    a recent study developed ML models based on neighborhood characteristics to predict
    food hygiene compliance of food outlets (including retail stores) (Oldroyd et
    al. 2021). Similar tools utilizing previously collected data can be developed
    by food companies with multiple locations to support their internal food safety
    inspections. With the rise of online grocery shopping (i.e., e-commerce), there
    is an increased ability to track products and collect data, which can be leveraged
    for food safety AI applications. For example, one study (Maharana et al. 2019)
    developed ML- and deep learning–based models to identify potentially unsafe food
    products based on Amazon''s customer reviews.  4.  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS
    TO ENHANCE PUBLIC HEALTH  AI technologies can be used to enhance public health
    by increasing our ability to predict (a) restaurants with poor hygiene practices,
    (b) the source of foodborne illnesses, and (c) etiological agents of foodborne
    cases. These predictions can help public health agents intervene more quickly,
    preventing the exposure of subjects to contaminated foods and preventing large
    outbreaks. Although these strategies have not been fully implemented in foodborne
    surveillance and outbreak investigations, they have shown promising preliminary
    results ( Table 2 ). New implementations of these strategies in a format (e.g.,
    apps) that can be easily used by public health investigators are needed before
    we can assess the practical usefulness of these methods in public health. Table

    Improving diagnostic accuracy Analytical tool Mei et al. 2020 4.1.   Surveillance
    Surveillance is a cornerstone of food safety and may include human foodborne disease
    surveillance as well as surveillance of foods for the presence of foodborne pathogens.
    An early example of AI application to foodborne disease surveillance is an ML
    model for real-time detection of foodborne illness using anonymous and aggregated
    web search and location data (termed FINDER) (Sadilek et al. 2018). When applied
    to data collected in two cities, FINDER improved the accuracy of health inspections
    with restaurants identified by FINDER being 3.1 times more likely to show critical
    violations during restaurant inspections. Previous studies have also developed
    ML-based models to detect foodborne illness based on customer restaurant reviews
    (Effland et al. 2018, Harrison et al. 2014). AI has also been used to assign etiology
    to foodborne illnesses investigated through syndromic surveillance via an ML algorithm
    that can assign the most likely etiological agent based on symptoms, onset of
    disease, and geographical location (Wang et al. 2021). ML methods for outbreak
    detection need to overcome the issues of under-reporting and erroneous reporting
    (Zhang et al. 2021a). To address these issues, an ML approach based on hidden
    Markov models for syndromic surveillance monitoring and disease outbreak detection
    was developed and implemented using a smartphone-based app for tracing the location
    of food consumption and subclinical reporting; this approach showed promising
    preliminary results (Teyhouee et al. 2017). These and additional applications
    of ML approaches to foodborne disease outbreak detection have been reviewed recently
    by Deng et al. (2021). As detailed in this review, the development and application
    of AI tools to use disparate data types [from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data
    to web searches and sales data] to detect foodborne disease outbreaks seem to
    be a promising future direction. A framework for AI application to foodborne disease
    outbreak detection could include two types of data: (a) case, outbreak, and other
    surveillance data and (b) data that might influence foodborne disease analysis,
    such as weather, holiday, and social media data (Du & Guo 2022, Kuehn 2014, Sadilek
    et al. 2017). These data should then be integrated into a single ML approach to
    detect outbreaks. 4.2.   Source Tracking and Attribution Source tracking and source
    attribution are important to help (a) identify likely sources of foodborne disease
    cases and outbreaks and (b) focus public health and regulatory actions on those
    sources that cause the largest public health impact. Although non-AI-based tools
    for source tracking and source attribution have been described (Barco et al. 2013,
    Harrison et al. 2021, Mikkelä et al. 2019, Pires et al. 2009, Ranta et al. 2011,
    Thépault et al. 2017, Tyson et al. 2016), new AI-based tools have also been reported.
    For example, Zhang et al. (2019) applied an ML RF classifier for source prediction
    of Salmonella Typhimurium using genomic surveillance data collected in the United
    States. Two studies have used LogitBoost (Munck et al. 2020) and various ML algorithms
    (Arning et al. 2021) to assign sources to Salmonella Typhimurium and Campylobacter
    isolates, respectively. Another study (Duarte et al. 2021) reported a metagenomics-based
    approach to source attribution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants,
    which used different RF approaches to classify resistomes into corresponding reservoir
    classes. Overall, published works clearly support the rich opportunity that exists
    for using AI approaches to enhance foodborne disease source attribution efforts.
    4.3.   Food Safety Risk Prediction AI tools also provide a powerful approach for
    the prediction of times and locations at which there is an increased risk of foodborne
    pathogen presence or where there is an increased risk of food contamination with
    foodborne pathogens (e.g., owing to the occurrence of factors that facilitate
    the transfer of pathogens from the environment or other vectors to finished product).
    The power of this approach has been particularly well demonstrated by several
    studies that used different predictor variables to predict the risk of pathogen
    contamination of agricultural water and the risk of pathogen presence in fields
    used for produce production (see Section 3.2 above). Although in the context of
    supply chain management, these AI tools can be useful to facilitate decision-making
    with regard to harvesting and water treatment, they can also provide value to
    public health. For example, model predictions can be used to enhance testing frequencies
    or interventions at locations and time periods when AI tools predict an increased
    risk of pathogen contamination. AI has the potential to impact other aspects of
    microbial food safety risk prediction. For example, a study on qPCR (quantitative
    polymerase chain reaction)-based diagnosis of COVID-19 showed that AI-based tools
    can be used to combine PCR findings with data from completely different tests
    (in this case CT scans of patients) to improve diagnostic accuracy (Mei et al.
    2020). In a food safety context, a similar approach could be used during production
    or in the finished product to analyze qPCR amplification curves, which are used
    for pathogen detection, along with other data from the same sample (e.g., water
    turbidity, pH) to improve identification of foodborne pathogens in raw materials.  5. 
    ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE–SUPPORTED TECHNIQUES FOR FOODBORNE PATHOGEN DETECTION,
    CHARACTERIZATION, AND IDENTIFICATION  AI applications have the potential to improve
    and enhance (a) detection of foodborne pathogens and indicator organisms (e.g.,
    coliforms, E. coli); (b) classification, identification, and differentiation of
    bacterial isolates, including foodborne pathogens; and (c) characterization of
    bacteria in terms of AMR, host specificity, and virulence, (d) modeling of microbial
    growth, and (e) understanding of population dynamics ( Table 3 ). In general,
    AI applications in these areas have the potential to reduce time, resources, and
    expertise required for detection and data analyses and will help reveal unintuitive
    patterns that could be valuable for food safety decision-making. Notably, there
    is a growing trend in applying image-based analysis to detect bacteria from environmental
    samples or identify bacterial isolates. Because of the speed of image data collection
    and maturity of image technology, some of these applications have features that
    facilitate commercialization and expansion, including (a) hardware and software
    integration, (b) large databases of images that support model training and validation,
    and (c) a platform for acquiring new data. Thus, some of these AI applications
    have potential to be integrated into food safety testing systems. Table 3 Potential

    One emerging area of AI application to food safety is improved detection of pathogens
    and indicator organisms. One study used image-based detection methods to take
    advantage of the fact that bacteria have different morphology in agar plates (Wang
    et al. 2020). With a combination of image preprocessing and a deep NN algorithm
    for classification, this detection system was able to detect E. coli and total
    coliform bacteria at the detection limit of 1 colony forming unit (CFU) in less
    than 9 hours; this approach could easily be adapted to other media and microorganisms,
    allowing interpretation of plating-based tests substantially before colonies are
    easily visible, particularly if methods can be developed for different food matrices,
    media, and plates with high levels of background microflora. AI tools have also
    been applied to other microbial characterization methods such as paper chromogenic
    arrays (PCAs), which are composed of various chromogenic dyes that will change
    color after contact with volatile organic compounds produced by different bacteria.
    In a proof-of-concept study (Yang et al. 2021), the visual results of PCAs were
    used as input features to train a multilayer NN to detect the presence of specific
    pathogens on inoculated romaine lettuce. Although the trained model was able to
    detect E. coli and L. monocytogenes from inoculated romaine lettuce in the test
    data set, the detection limit was reported to be around 3 log CFU/g, which is
    too high for real-world use. 5.2.   Identification and Classification of Bacterial
    Isolates AI-based methodologies have also been applied to the analysis of complex
    and large data sets to facilitate improved classification, identification, and
    differentiation of microbial isolates (Ho et al. 2019, Kang et al. 2021, Sil et
    al. 2021, Weis et al. 2020). For example, several studies have described the use
    of AI-based image detection methods to analyze spectral information that has been
    generated for the identification of bacterial isolates, for example, through Raman
    spectroscopy (Ho et al. 2019, Sil et al. 2021) and hyperspectral microscopic imaging
    (HMI) (Kang et al. 2021). Kang et al. (2021) showed that using the center region
    of interest of living cells as the input data set, the HMI method coupled with
    a recurrent NN was able to classify and differentiate five common foodborne pathogens.
    Ho et al. (2019) reported that Raman-based methods were able to classify 30 selected
    pathogen isolates and predict the antibiotic treatment using recommended empiric
    treatment as the ground truth. In a different study (Sil et al. 2021), Raman spectra
    of bacterial DNA samples, which provide less noise than whole cell samples, were
    used to classify 15 species from Brucella and Bacillus genera. Because the context
    of pathogen identification is highly variable, efforts to develop larger databases
    for bacterial identification are essential, which would provide valuable input
    data for future AI tool development. For example, a database of 660 microscopic
    images representing 33 bacteria of different genera and species supported texture
    recognition (e.g., shape, size, spatial arrangement) in microscopic images through
    a convolutional NN (CNN) with subsequent identification of bacteria via ML algorithms
    (Zieliński et al. 2017). AI has also been used to support pathogen characterization
    and identification by other analytical and diagnostic tools. Weis et al. (2020)
    summarized various studies that use ML algorithms to analyze the spectral features
    from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometry
    (MALDI-TOF MS) (Singhal et al. 2015) to improve species identification. ML has
    also been used to assist bacterial identification by associating digital high-resolution
    melt profiles generated from digital PCR with specific bacterial species (Athamanolap
    et al. 2019). Similar to spectroscopy-based methods, these AI-powered analytical
    methods need a broader database covering common food pathogens to enhance their
    applicability to food safety. Currently, the studies reported (Barreiro et al.
    2010, Böhme et al. 2010, Hazen et al. 2009) only focused on a few pathogens and
    products. 5.3.   Microbial Characterization When applied as an analytical tool
    to existing data (e.g., image data and genomic data), AI can also enhance our
    understanding of pathogen characteristics, including AMR, and host–pathogen interaction
    (HPI). Although AMR characterization can help inform treatment and control strategies,
    for example, for animal-associated pathogens (e.g., Salmonella), HPI characterization
    can inform pathogenicity, which may have implications for dose response. Hence,
    characterization of foodborne pathogens has indirect but relevant implications
    for food safety. One promising and advanced application in this area is the elucidation
    of HPI using computer vision. Although ML models (Sen et al. 2016) have been used
    to study the dynamics of bacterial infection, these models usually need rule-based
    features that are generated from manual labeling and identification of key phenotypic
    features from the image. Automated feature extraction in combination with image
    analysis based on CNN has been shown to reduce bias and improve performance and
    efficiency (Fisch et al. 2019, 2021). Apart from the prediction accuracy (e.g.,
    in terms of predicting protein recruitment), this system exemplifies a mature
    AI technology in that it is automated, user-friendly, and applicable to other
    pathogens with an open platform to facilitate the data collection from users.
    It is important to note that the CNN algorithm used in this system is not novel,
    as it benefits from transfer learning that allows pretrained NN to be customizable
    to other applications. With this in mind, we believe that a similar research approach
    can be applied to other domains of pathogen characterization. Although state-of-the-art
    deep learning algorithms revolutionized our analysis of image and spectral data,
    ML algorithms are still most commonly used to identify attributes of foodborne
    pathogens from genetic data (e.g., WGS data). Applications that leverage genetic
    data include prediction of AMR (Hyun et al. 2020, Jamal et al. 2020), minimal
    inhibitory concentration (Nguyen et al. 2019, Pataki et al. 2020), host specificity
    (Lupolova et al. 2017, 2019), and virulence (Allen et al. 2021). Tree-based methods,
    including XGBoost, AdaBoost, and RF, perform better with strong predictors and
    therefore are commonly selected algorithms because the input data (e.g., k-mer
    representation of genome and expression of specific genes) are categorical. Findings
    from these studies enhanced our understanding of associations between genotypic
    and phenotypic features, which can be used to characterize new foodborne pathogen
    isolates solely based on WGS data. Future development of automated systems integrating
    gene and genomic databases and ML algorithms will make this type of WGS-based
    pathogen characterization more accessible, including to individuals without coding
    knowledge. 5.4.   Modeling Microbial Growth Challenges with modeling of pathogen
    growth, as well as survival and die-off, are numerous and related to the fact
    that it is important to predict growth, survival, and die-off for several different
    pathogens (including possibly different pathogen subtypes) in a variety of different
    foods and under a variety of different environmental conditions (e.g., temperatures).
    ComBase ( https://www.combase.cc/index.php/en/ ) is a database that collects fundamental
    research results about bacterial growth patterns under different food matrix and
    environmental conditions. Utilizing ComBase as a data source, Hiura et al. (2021)
    reported that ML models achieved accurate prediction of L. monocytogenes levels
    within 1 log CFU regardless of the food category, suggesting that more extensive
    usage of such models with other pathogens and food products is possible with the
    support of big data. AI can also be used to predict whether pathogens can grow
    under certain conditions (growth/no growth modeling), which is important for many
    food safety applications. Using a multiclassification model, a study was able
    to classify microorganisms in media under various growth conditions into growth,
    growth transition, and no growth (Fernández-Navarro et al. 2010). Overall, these
    examples illustrate how AI can be used to support decision-making with regard
    to pathogen control strategies, including through “food safety by design” approaches,
    where AI tools would be used to support development of formulations that minimize
    pathogen growth. 5.5.   Studying Bacterial Population Dynamics There are many
    examples of AI application to support modeling and characterization of microbial
    populations and population dynamics, even though most examples are from fields
    other than food safety. Not surprisingly, there are several publications that
    detail AI-based approaches to classify microbial taxa and communities based on
    metagenomics data (Ghannam & Techtmann 2021, Harris et al. 2019). Although 16S
    metagenomics tools, which until recently were the predominant metagenomics approaches
    used in food microbiology, are considered to have limited value for food safety
    (as they typically cannot reliably differentiate foodborne pathogens from closely
    related nonpathogens), increasing application of shotgun metagenomics, including
    AI-based analyses of the resulting data, is likely to broaden food safety relevant
    metagenomics applications. Another research direction to study population dynamics
    is to predict the interaction between microorganisms in a community from various
    traits. Using three microbial communities as experimental examples, DiMucci et
    al. (2018) predicted the microbial interactions of the microorganisms in each
    community from the presence and absence of specific genes or metabolic functions
    observed in the communities. This ML-assisted approach was suggested to have potential
    for discovering therapeutic interventions. In the context of food safety, this
    application might be useful to predict the effect of biopreservatives used as
    control strategies for foodborne pathogens.  6.  CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
    FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO HELP IMPROVE FOOD SAFETY  Although in previous
    sections, we explored different opportunities AI technologies present for the
    improvement of food safety, application of AI tools in food safety still appears
    to lag behind compared to other food-related areas (e.g., marketing, agricultural
    production). The relatively low penetration of AI in food safety appears to be
    due to multiple factors. One key reason seems to be the limited availability of
    data that are needed to develop and implement AI tools for food safety applications
    with key limitations being (a) the low speed and high cost of microbial data collection
    and (b) limited sharing of microbial data, owing to industry concerns about data
    privacy and the business and reputational risk that may be associated with data
    sharing. In some cases, there may be a reluctance from food industry stakeholders
    to develop and adopt food safety AI technologies because of a fear that these
    tools might negatively impact their business interests. This concern is not just
    limited to the data sharing that may be required but may also extend to concerns
    that AI tools, if available to others, could be used to predict whether a specific
    company (e.g., the company that provided the data for the tool development) has
    an increased food safety risk. The lack of a clear legal and regulatory framework
    regarding AI applications and protection of sensitive data that are needed to
    feed these applications may compound these concerns. Even if food safety data
    can be shared, data from different sources often represent distinct formats and
    structures, which makes standardization and data use difficult. Also, data details,
    such as the test methods used and the sample size tested (e.g., 1 g, 25 g), are
    often either inconsistent or not available. Negative test results (i.e., results
    that do not detect a pathogen) may never be available at all or may show even
    less metadata. Another challenge to more widespread AI application is the lack
    of systematic efforts to assemble different AI tools. Given that many food safety
    AI tools are developed by research labs, they tend to fall short of delivering
    practical products that industry can adopt or that at least can be quickly developed
    into usable tools. Furthermore, the problems addressed by “research” AI tools
    are typically specific to a type of product, microorganism, or environmental condition;
    hence, the generalizability is limited and thus those AI tools need to be combined
    for holistic benefit. To address the challenges mentioned above, we propose that
    key directions for future AI development in the field of food safety include (a)
    improving data sharing among different stakeholders through novel privacy preservation
    technologies, data standardization, and regulations, (b) encouraging multidisciplinary
    collaboration to encourage more commercial deliverables, and (c) implementing
    education in data science, software development, and design thinking among food
    safety professionals Innovations in privacy protection methods have the potential
    to improve the utility and scalability of various AI tools by facilitating more
    widespread data sharing, as accessibility to big data is the key to AI applications.
    Two of the most promising approaches are differential privacy and federated learning.
    Differential privacy allows data providers or data processors to intentionally
    manipulate data by adding noise, which grants the data provider plausible deniability.
    Different levels of privacy can be customized depending on the sensitivity of
    the data and the trust level of data providers. Relevant to the area of food safety,
    differential privacy has been applied to protect personal health data to facilitate
    COVID-19 surveillance (Dyda et al. 2021). At the same time, federated learning
    is presented as the emerging tool in medical diagnostics (Rieke et al. 2020),
    which shares similar challenges regarding data sharing as the food safety field.
    Federated learning allows data providers to share local updates to the model on
    the cloud without sharing the data. Thus, the model applications can be trained
    without the need to store data at a central location. With the ability to utilize
    but not compromise patient data, federated learning is a promising approach that
    can aid in the transition of research models to practical tools in clinics. Future
    research and development efforts should apply these novel privacy-preservation
    methods to food safety data; these efforts could provide use cases for industry
    partners and insights into the sample size needed (i.e., a total of collectively
    shared data) to ensure acceptable utility of AI applications. To address the industry
    concerns about the misuse of AI applications, laws and regulations need to keep
    up with the advancement of technology to reflect and avoid potential misuse. For
    example, templates of mutual agreements should be developed to better delineate
    the boundary for interpreting results from AI applications. A food company might
    be more inclined to adopt AI technology if the contamination predicted from the
    model is used for internal decision-making only and cannot be used by government
    and supply chain partners against the company''s benefits. Digital solution providers
    for food safety should help food companies establish protocols and evaluate enterprise
    risks in the case of a data leak or model misuse. These strategies can help food
    companies choose the type of AI technologies they want to use, depending on the
    level of risk they are willing to accept. Importantly, however, data standardization
    still needs to be developed and implemented across the industry to facilitate
    data sharing by limiting the time and effort to unify the data. This process could
    be facilitated with the help of a third-party organization, for example, Global
    Language of Business ( https://www.gs1.org/ ), which is an organization that creates
    a common language for different systems, or through collaboration between different
    stakeholders, as exemplified by Coordinated Innovation Network from Dairy Brain
    (Ferris et al. 2020). Currently, many organizations, including the FDA, have already
    directed efforts toward standardizing metadata associated with WGS data (Balkey
    et al. 2021, Pettengill et al. 2021). To address the lack of deliverable AI tools
    in food safety, researchers need to establish interdisciplinary collaboration
    with computer scientists, software developers, and IT professionals to develop
    user-centered application programming interfaces and data management systems to
    support commercialization or implementation of food safety AI analytical tools.
    Improved education and literacy in data, computer science, and design thinking
    are also needed to help food safety professionals better communicate across disciplines
    and express the specific industry needs. With an extensive library of ML models
    currently developed in academia, it is not difficult to envision the integration
    of these tools into commercial AI applications for food safety. For example, with
    a connection to a public geographical database and implementation of water sensors
    in irrigation water and rapid detection equipment for indicator microorganisms,
    an AI system can be powered by the Internet of Things to provide early warnings
    for increased risk of pathogen presence in agricultural water, fields, and products,
    informing different practices such as testing, irrigation source water selection,
    harvest timing, and harvest equipment sanitation frequency. Further governmental
    support is also needed to facilitate the development and implementation of AI
    technologies in food safety. Similar to the FDA''s regulation of AI-based medical
    devices (Benjamens et al. 2020), clearer regulations with regard to clearance
    levels will help the commercialization of current existing food safety AI.  7. 
    CONCLUSIONS  Although it is tempting to conclude that AI shows promise for application
    in food safety, so far there are only a few convincing examples that would support
    this statement. Most data and examples that provide strong evidence for successful
    application of AI to food safety are in the areas of public health surveillance,
    prediction of preharvest food safety risk factors, and, to a lesser extent, detection,
    identification, and characterization of foodborne pathogens. Key obstacles to
    wider commercialization and implementation of AI tools for food safety applications
    include limited availability of digitized food safety data (food safety data are
    still often collected and stored in hard copy), privacy concerns (most food companies
    hesitate to store food safety data on the cloud), a workforce that often has limited
    data literacy, and a limited food safety innovation ecosystem that could stimulate
    the collaborations needed to foster food systems’ wide implementation of digital
    food safety tools. Overcoming these challenges will require considerable efforts,
    including an improved digital food safety infrastructure, implementation of innovative
    data sharing and privacy protection approaches, and improved digital training
    of food safety professionals. Importantly, industry as well as AI researchers
    and service providers will also need to be careful to not present AI as a panacea
    but to focus on those applications where AI will address specific needs and questions,
    using other more appropriate tools (including simulations, classical statistics,
    etc.) as needed. Finally, despite its alluring name, in the medium term, AI tools
    are likely to help provide decision-support tools, and final decisions will still
    be made by humans.   disclosure statement  The authors are not aware of any affiliations,

    Versions Notes Abstract The use of fossil-fueled power stations to generate electricity
    has had a damaging effect over the years, necessitating the need for alternative
    energy sources. Microgrids consisting of renewable energy source concepts have
    gained a lot of consideration in recent years as an alternative because they use
    advances in information and communication technology (ICT) to increase the quality
    and efficiency of services and distributed energy resources (DERs), which are

    of faults, which have an impact on their performance and necessitate dynamic energy
    management and optimization strategies. The application of artificial intelligence
    (AI) is gaining momentum as a vital key at this point. This study focuses on a
    comprehensive review of applications of artificial intelligence strategies on
    hybrid renewable microgrids for optimization, power quality enhancement, and analyses
    of fault outbreaks in microgrids. The use of techniques such as machine learning

    (AI); hybrid microgrids; distributed energy resources (DER); energy storage system;
    coordination strategies; fault outbreaks; optimization 1. Introduction Microgrids
    (MGs) are advancing in terms of intelligence, distribution, and flexibility. Electrical
    grids are being dominated by cutting-edge power electronics and artificial intelligence
    (AI) techniques, and this trend may continue for many years to come [1]. The increasing
    application of cutting-edge AI approaches in MG controls is significant and provides
    smooth distributed generation (DG) integration and disconnection, improved power
    quality for end users, and greater transient stability of the power system. As
    a result, MGs are becoming a trusted and more environmentally friendly source
    of energy. By emphasizing the independence of local energy supply, MGs that are
    mostly built using renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed energy resources
    (DERs), commonly referred to as DGs, can combine RESs such as wind turbines and
    photovoltaics (PVs) with traditional energy sources such as combustion gas turbines
    and diesel engines. An MG is the combination of groupings of DERs and energy storage
    systems (ESSs), such as batteries, capacitors, hydrogen, and flywheels, with loads
    that are connected via a regional electric power grid [2,3]. Systems that combine
    two or more RESs with traditional energy sources are known as hybrid renewable
    energy systems (HRESs) and are frequently abbreviated as MGs [4,5]. Digitalization
    and automation have had a significant impact on various industries recently because
    of advancements in information and communication technologies (ICT). The key forces
    behind this transformation include significant advancements in the Internet of
    Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), cyberphysical systems (CPSs), and
    big data analytics (BDA) [6,7,8]. The next-generation systems, as described by
    the Industry 4.0 paradigm, are the result of the evolution and convergence of
    new technologies such as onboard computation, intelligent and fast controllers,
    big data analytics, machine learning (ML), and IoT technologies [9]. As a result
    of these developments, it is now possible to continuously collect, process, and
    analyze real-time data streams in conjunction with high-fidelity models to produce
    a digital representation of a complex system that offers an abundance of information
    about its present and potential future operating conditions. The development of
    a new technology field known as the “Internet of Things” (IoT) has been assisted
    by technological advancements in hardware, software, and wireless communication.
    The word “things” in “IoT” are connected “smart” objects, such as sensors, machines,
    and vehicles, with the ability to process information intelligently [1,4]. Smart
    homes, smart cities, intelligent transportation, intelligent energy production,
    and intelligent agriculture are a few intriguing IoT applications [9,10]. IoT
    technology is essential to modern industry since it automates processes and lowers
    costs. Figure 1 shows the overview transmission of power from smart grid comprising
    a grid and PV-wind supply to the customers using AI control strategies. Figure
    1. Smart grid AI control schemes. In recent years, the field of computer science
    known as artificial intelligence (AI) has gained popularity. In the context of
    microgrids, AI has important applications that can effectively utilize the data
    that are available and aid in decision making in challenging real-world situations
    for a safer and more dependable control and operation of the microgrids. The single-
    to multi-microgrid network-regulating environment can be taken advantage of thanks
    to improvements in AI-based algorithms and computational capability with a significant
    number of data-processing capabilities. Important AI subcategories include machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). According to the input training data, ML
    and DL models can generally be either supervised or unsupervised. To more effectively
    handle the observability and controllability challenges in the context of microgrids,
    the system control and analysis requires a sophisticated methodology that not
    only relies on the physical model but also incorporates data-driven modeling [11].
    The microgrid hierarchical control system has many control levels depending on
    the functionality to be addressed while taking into account the amount of control,
    communication needs and energy resources [12]. A microgrid environment can be
    controlled and operated with more accuracy, speed, and efficiency by combining
    AI approaches with these existing schemes [13]. Building an affordable, reliable,
    and ecologically friendly energy system is becoming more and more important. The
    inclusion of distributed power generation based on renewable energy sources is
    part of the solution required to reach the aforementioned goal. If certain characteristics
    and requirements are met, well-defined areas of distributed energy generation
    can be regarded as microgrids (MGs). However, there are still a number of problems
    that need to be resolved before a large number of MGs powered by renewable energy
    sources can be integrated into the current electrical network. Numerous studies
    offer various solutions for dealing with the various control issues that MGs raise
    while ensuring the quality of the energy produced. In [14], an overview of the
    well-known droop control method used on MGs, including virtual impedance loop-based
    droop control, is provided. In addition to this, numerous studies [15,16,17] have
    concentrated on a variety of control techniques for various modes of operation
    of MGs. However, the energy system becomes more uncertain and complex as a result
    of the growing use of renewable energy sources and the active involvement of consumers.
    Due to the difficulties in resolving uncertainty and partial observability issues,
    system analysis and control cannot rely exclusively on physical modeling and numerical
    calculations. Artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), genetic algorithms
    (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), metaheuristic methods, grey wolf optimization,
    ant colony optimization, neurofuzzy inference systems, and evolutionary algorithms
    are a few of the artificial intelligence-based control strategies gaining more
    attention [18]. Since they can adjust to uncertainties and be utilized in situations
    when the precise model of a system is unavailable or prone to changes, intelligent
    controllers are especially well-suited for these kinds of applications. A variety
    of studies are being conducted in this area, and market recommendations are constantly
    changing. By producing green energy options for the reduction of hazardous gas
    emissions and managing the peak load graph, the application of renewable energy
    sources (RES) can offer an alternative source to the reliance on fossil fuels
    in compliance with the international target for the environment. Future power
    systems can support the incorporation of RES with the use of smart grid (SG) technologies.
    With a high penetration of distributed generation in power systems and advancements
    in information and communication technology (ICT) associated with customer data,
    the electric power grid can be transformed [19]. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled
    smart energy markets can make it simpler to establish effective policy incentives
    and enable consumers and utilities to make decisions about their consumption and
    generation in a way that reduces CO2 emissions. Some of the challenges facing
    AI in the electrical power system include designing automation technologies for
    heterogeneous devices that learn to adjust their consumption against pricing signals
    with user constraints, creating channels of communication between humans and controllers,
    and creating simulation and prediction tools for customers and suppliers. Intelligent
    tools and methods are required to manage the system properly and make choices
    on time as the energy sector becomes more complicated. To handle issues of categorization,
    forecasting, networking, optimization, and control strategies, well-known AI approaches
    include the artificial neural network (ANN), reinforcement learning (RL), genetic
    algorithms (GA), and multiagent systems [20]. Because there are not enough sophisticated
    automatic controlled resources, many system operations are still carried out manually
    or with only the most basic automation. However, the introduction of AI into the
    grid system would bring about breakthroughs and provide the electrical grid new
    directions. Figure 1 displays the whole distributed SG concept with AI methods.
    Costs are reduced by optimizing controlled loads using intelligent ways. To maximize
    the controllable loads, for instance, Neves et al. [21] offer a genetic algorithm
    for the management of standalone microgrids (MGs). AI techniques provide considerably
    more effective and powerful ways to deal with the limitations of the conventional
    grid system as a result of advancements in computer power and readily available
    data storage. Additionally, the use of distributed computing technologies in Singapore
    has given rise to numerous security concerns. Threats such as physical and cyberattacks
    can result in infrastructure failure, privacy breaches, disruptions, and denial
    of service (DoS) [22]. This paper examines the smart grid’s current developments
    and difficulties, distributed intelligence for energy production in the future,
    and the function of distributed energy resources (DERs) in that system. Different
    quick and intelligent fault detections and classifications, including localization
    and fault direction identification, protection, and coordination methods, have
    been explored and proposed by many researchers to address the aforementioned problems
    and difficulties. Determining the source of the defect and isolating it are the
    three key components of fault diagnostics [23]. The use of a positive sequence
    component [24] and zero-sequence component [25] in fault detection with protection
    strategies based on sequence components has been proposed. The MG protection system,
    according to Ustun et al. in [26], is based on a communication system and a centralized
    coordinated protection unit. The adaptive and differential protection approach
    was proposed in [27]. However, the fundamental issue with such techniques is their
    high cost and communication network failure. Worth noting in this review paper
    is the aim of this paper, which is to provide a concise review of current AI techniques
    utilized for optimization and power quality management in microgrids with energy
    storage systems for both standalone and grid connected systems. Numerous scholars
    in the past focused on the optimization strategies under normal conditions; therefore,
    the main contribution of this paper is a review of the applications of different
    AI optimization strategies under fault conditions in microgrids. This paper highlights
    more applications of AI, and similarly, the behavior under transient and steady-state
    conditions. This review article contains: Section 2, which presents a comprehensive
    review on microgrid control and describes the microgrid scope, operational features,
    and control scheme methodologies; Section 3 contains the summary of artificial
    intelligence (AI) strategies, and an overview of optimization techniques is presented;
    Section 4 provides reviewed applications of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies
    in microgrids for optimization and a summary of various studies presenting the
    implementation of AI strategies; Section 5 evaluates the Review of Applications
    of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategies under faults outbreaks in microgrids
    and summarizes various studies’ findings on ANN, PSO, FL, GA, and ABC techniques;
    Section 6 is the conclusion of this paper, and projects future prospects and possible
    improvements. 2. Comprehensive Review on Microgrid Control The microgrid can provide
    improved power supply quality, greater energy efficiency, and better service reliability
    when enhanced with contemporary power electronics-based technology [28,29,30].
    The traditional way of controlling the flow of power is eliminated by the integration
    of multiple microsources and a new framework. Because it covers a broad range
    of power electronics and power system topics, research on microgrids has become
    increasingly popular [31,32]. The idea of a microgrid is put out primarily for
    two reasons: to regulate the impact of distributed generators and to make traditional
    grids more compatible with widespread deployment of distributed generators. Microgrids
    help to maintain service quality while also ensuring continuous service. The microgrid
    is capable of low-voltage operation and has a variety of distributed energy resources.
    It is capable of functioning in grid mode or off grid mode [33]. The implementation
    of different smart grid functions, such as digital and two-way communication,
    distributed generation, self-monitoring, self-healing, adaptive and islanding
    mode, remote check and intuitive control, can be sped up with the help of microgrids
    [34]. The microgrid may successfully address a number of power generation-related
    problems and is a complementary suppression for constrained fossil fuels [35].
    Operation in regular and island modes, plug-and-play functionality, protection,
    power quality, security, voltage and frequency control, system stability, and
    energy management are a few of the most important of these problems. Despite their
    numerous advantages, microgrids present numerous technological obstacles, and
    protection is one that needs particular focus. For a microgrid to operate consistently
    and profitably, it must be protected. The protection plan must be capable of handling
    any fault without interfering with the overall structure. It should run in the
    shortest time possible. It must fulfill the conditions for both the grid-tied
    and the islanded modes. The steps in the protection scheme process involve locating
    the problem, cutting off the problematic area from the rest of the system, and
    fixing it as quickly as possible. Therefore, the design of the protection system
    must be precise [36,37,38]. A microgrid is a self-controlled individual entity
    that has a “plug-and-play” capability for each distributed energy supply that
    satisfies the demands of local loads. As a result of all of these qualities, MGs
    can evolve into complex systems with variable degrees of uncertainty and the requirement
    for complicated controllers. Frequency regulation, voltage regulation, load sharing
    and tracking, and fault protection are some of the primary controls that must
    be considered for an MG. 2.1. Microgrid Control 2.1.1. Conventional Control The
    primary operational and control characteristics of the traditional control architecture
    are reviewed. From the comparisons, it can be concluded that distributed control
    approaches will be crucial in decarbonizing the future distribution or island
    grid as DER penetration in the distribution network increases. Although it is
    very complicated to accomplish, it is very successful in terms of control features.
    2.1.2. Unconventional Control A virtual impedance control loop can be added to
    the primary layer to simulate the actual behavior of the system, which is often
    responsible for droop control to stabilize and dampen the system. Local controllers
    carry out the intricate controlling; therefore, this layer can respond quickly
    or in real time. The use of a main control, in which one convertor serves as the
    master and the others as slaves, is also suggested in [39]. 2.2. Microgrid Mode
    of Operation Microgrids can run in one of two ways: connected to the grid or as
    an island. Each operating mode has a separate set of operational needs. The following
    are the modes. 2.2.1. Grid-Connected Mode Without any disruptions to the main
    grid’s power quality leading to power outages, it is otherwise in the regular
    working mode. In this mode, the microgrid may either import or export power to
    the main grid and deliver power to its full local load, depending on the total
    amount of power generation of the local load. The microgrid also keeps the electricity
    flow in this mode bidirectional. 2.2.2. Standalone Mode The microgrid disconnects
    from the main grid and runs independently whenever there is a failure or change
    in power quality on the main grid. The microgrid will sustain high-quality power
    and could give users a continuous supply if there is a problem with the main grid
    causing power outages. Furthermore, the microgrid can easily be islanded from
    the main grid if other disturbances such as frequency drops, voltage sags, or
    any fault develop in the main grid [40,41,42]. 2.3. Microgrid Frameworks The microgrid
    may either import or export power to the main grid and deliver power to its full
    local load, depending on the total amount required for users. Because microgrids
    also manage and distribute the flow of electricity to users, they can be thought
    of as a scaled-down version of the existing centralized electrical system. However,
    it is carried out locally, unlike the normal approach. It is possible to think
    of it as a single aggregated load in a power system because it only has one regulated
    unit [43]. A microgrid is an emerging idea that describes a small power system
    with a group of dispersed generators working together with correct energy management,
    protection devices, control devices, loads, and related software [44,45]. The
    two most important characteristics of microgrids are: Peer-to-peer, which means
    that the operation of the microgrid is not dependent on the availability of a
    specific component, such as a master controller or a central storage system. Plug-and-play,
    which allows DG sources to be placed anywhere in the microgrid without having
    to change the protection scheme. This functionality makes it easier to install
    developing DG sources and lowers the chance of microgrid engineering failures.
    Hybrid microgrids are made up of the individual DC and AC microgrid architectures.
    Consequently, hybrid AC-DC microgrid contains both the AC and DC microgrid’s advantages.
    Figure 2 displays a genuine hybrid DC-AC microgrid architecture. Connecting AC
    and DC microgrids makes use of bidirectional AC-DC converters. For linking DC
    power generators, connecting PV panels, wind energy systems, and energy storage
    systems (ESS) are used, and they connect to the battery in this case, and there
    are loads connected from the system. For greater efficiency, photovoltaic (PV)
    panels connect to the DC microgrid. DC-DC boost converters are used when connecting
    this system for simulation of greater stability performances. Figure 2. Hybrid
    DC/AC microgrid System. 2.4. Importance of Microgrids (i) Microgrids enable distributed
    generation and high penetration of renewable energy sources. (ii) Microgrids support
    adequate generation since they can manage internal loads and generation. (iii)
    Microgrids strengthen local economies, and their structures will attract small
    businesses and provide additional jobs in the area [41,46]. (iv) Areas with microgrids
    will continue to receive regular power supplies during natural disasters, outages,
    etc. (v) If a microgrid can meet local demand, transmission and distribution losses
    in the power system are less expensive, and the cost of expanding transmission
    and distribution is also lowered. (vi) Because microgrids make use of ecofriendly
    renewable power generation techniques, they will aid in lowering CO2 emissions.
    (vii) It provides power to the main grid when the microgrid produces excess energy;
    (viii) Stability is altered by the microgrid. (ix) Compared to traditional power
    generation, the cost of energy produced by microgrids with distributed generating
    assistance is lower [47]. 2.5. AC Microgrid Overview In general, mixed loads (DC
    and AC loads), distributed generation, and energy storage devices are coupled
    to the common AC bus used in AC microgrids. Since most loads and the grid itself
    are AC, AC microgrids can be simply integrated into a traditional AC grid. As
    a result, it is more flexible, capable, and controllable. However, when a DC/AC
    converter is used to connect DC loads, DC sources and energy storage devices to
    the AC bus, the efficiency is intensely reduced [36,48,49]. The primary elements
    that need to be synchronized in AC microgrids are active power, reactive power,
    imbalance components, and harmonics. DC power is the primary element that needs
    to be controlled in DC microgrids. Consequently, the DC microgrid control system
    is easier to use than the AC microgrid control system [50]. In AC microgrid design
    before the connections, photovoltaic (PV) system-generated DC power is converted
    into AC using DC-AC inverters. Rectifiers convert AC power into DC power so that
    it can be utilized to power DC loads. Without any transformation, the AC load
    receives a direct supply from the AC bus. Converters use the connection between
    the AC bus and the wind power generation system to manage both active and reactive
    power. Because just phase matching is needed between the main grid and the AC
    microgrid, connecting to the main grid becomes simpler. 2.5.1. Advantages of AC
    Microgrid (a) The use of high-efficiency transformers. For distribution purposes
    and for the nearby local loads, the voltage of AC microgrids can be increased
    and decreased using transformers, respectively. (b) Protection techniques for
    AC circuits are favorable due to periodic zero voltage crossings since switching
    circuit breakers extinguish the fault current arc at zero crossings. (c) Stable
    voltage can be achieved by independently managing reactive power. (d) In grid-tied
    mode, the AC microgrid will automatically disconnect if any fault conditions arise
    in the microgrid. Since the AC load receives a direct supply from the AC microgrid,
    any disturbances in the main grid will not affect it [51]. 2.5.2. Disadvantages
    of AC Microgrid (a) To power DC loads such as battery charging, computers, DC
    fluorescent lights, etc., AC power must be converted into DC power. These conversions
    result in a decrease in efficiency. (b) The use of power electronic converters
    causes an introduction of harmonics introduced into the main grid. (c) The DC
    output of renewable energy sources must be converted to AC using inverters, which
    makes interconnection difficult [52,53,54]. 2.6. DC Microgrid Overview A common
    DC bus connected to the grid via an AC/DC converter is utilized in a DC microgrid.
    AC microgrids and DC microgrids both operate under similar principles. Since a
    DC microgrid only requires one power conversion to link a DC bus, it is a good
    alternative to an AC microgrid for reducing power conversion losses. As a result,
    the system efficiency, cost, and system size of a DC microgrid are higher. As
    a result of the insufficiency of reactive power, DC microgrids are also more stable
    and better suited for integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) [48]. In
    order to reduce the cost of the power electronics converter and boost efficiency,
    diverse DC loads can be directly linked with the DC microgrid bus without any
    transformation. DC-AC converters are necessary for connecting AC loads. Research
    on DC microgrids is gaining traction due to the growth of DC renewable energy
    sources. 2.6.1. Advantages of a DC Microgrid (a) The direct connection of a battery
    storage system to a power source for backup is possible. In times of peak load
    or in the absence of any distributed generators, a backup storage system will
    provide power. (b) Direct connecting lowers the need for several power conversions
    and boosts system effectiveness. (c) It enables easy connection of renewable energy
    sources. (d) Should there be a power outage in the AC main grid, the DC microgrid’s
    battery storage will routinely supply electricity to loads. (e) The running costs
    and power converter loss of a DC system can be kept to a minimum because all that
    is needed to connect to the AC main grid is a straightforward inverter unit. 2.6.2.
    Disadvantages of a DC Microgrid (a) Most load units in the current power system
    configuration demand AC power. Therefore, a DC-only distribution network is not
    practical. (b) Compared to an AC system, voltage transformation in a DC system
    is less systematic. (c) The integration of AC generators necessitates the use
    of a rectifier to convert AC power to DC power [55,56]. 2.7. Comparison of AC
    and DC Microgrid Conversion The difference between AC loads and DC load conversion
    steps is under investigation by numerous scholars who are interested in the design
    of hybrid renewable energy systems and comparing the benefits of deploying the
    best form. Therefore, there are different conversion steps, and these come with
    different pros and cons. Table 1 presents the comparison of AC and DC microgrid
    loads. Table 1. Comparison of AC and DC microgrid conversion steps. 2.8. Hybrid
    Microgrid There are numerous scholars who are interested in the design of hybrid
    renewable energy systems. Consequently, there is a ton of material on this subject
    that can be used. The aforementioned design subject relates to energy systems,
    where it is observed that the best distribution and optimum placement, kind, and
    size of generation components have been established on particular nodes. As a
    result, this kind of system can load the requirements at the lowest possible cost
    [57]. The idea of hybrid renewable energy can calculate the price and output over
    the technology’s lifetime. The initial estimate for the lifetime cost often comprises
    two components: the operational cost, such as the primary cost; and the preservation
    cost, both of which amount to a “fixed cost”. Furthermore, when calculating the
    lifespan cost, the financial values are updated according to the timing, and should
    be considered. As such, the optimal hybrid system designs mix producer kinds and
    sizes to achieve the lowest possible lifespan cost and productivity. Thus, the
    “optimal configuration” or “optimal design” is defined as the design with the
    lowest “net present value” (or NPV), with all possible hybrid system designs being
    in optimal transition [58,59]. To act as real-time system integration, there are
    numerous ways to provide an “optimal design” indicator and numerous commercially
    available software products. In addition, many optimal strategies are used by
    numerous researchers for hybrid renewable energy system sizing. In order to optimize
    hybrid PV/wind energy systems, researchers have used a variety of optimization
    techniques, including graphical construction [60,61], probabilistic techniques
    [62], iterative approaches, dynamic programming, artificial intelligence (AI),
    linear programming, and multiobjective optimization [63]. DC-DC buck converters
    are used to link DC loads to the DC microgrid, such as fluorescent lighting and
    electric automobiles. Energy storage devices are connected to the DC microgrid
    using bidirectional DC-DC converters [64]. The AC microgrid is also directly connected
    to AC loads, such as AC motors. When an AC microgrid is overburdened, power will
    switch over to a DC microgrid [65]. The main converter will serve as an inverter
    during this operation. Power will flow from the AC microgrid to the DC microgrid
    during the overloaded state of the DC microgrid, and the interlinking converter
    will serve as a rectifier [66]. Bidirectional AC/DC converters’ primary goal is
    to regulate power flow between DC and AC microgrids while stabilizing their respective
    DC and AC bus voltages and frequencies [67,68,69]. Hybrid model techniques are
    a beneficial collaboration of two or more separate methods that employ the beneficial
    effects of the methods to achieve the best possible result for a specific design
    problem. Because many of the challenges we face are multiobjective in nature,
    implementing a hybrid technique is an ideal aim in nature, and adopting a hybrid
    approach is a suitable alternative method to address problems that necessitate
    a thorough understanding of all the methods. To handle a multiobjective problem
    that encompasses costs, environmental consequences, fuel price risks, and imported
    fuel, Meza et al. [70] established a multiobjective model to generate expansion
    planning (MGEP) and an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model. 2.9. Energy Storage
    System Electrochemical systems (batteries and flow batteries), kinetic energy
    storage systems (flywheels), and potential energy storage are the three categories
    into which energy storage devices (ESS) can be divided (pumped hydro and compressed
    air storage). A thorough comparison of various energy storage technologies may
    be found in References [71,72,73,74]. Small-scale renewable energy systems cannot
    use pumped hydro storage or compressed air energy storage systems since these
    large-scale energy storage devices are typically used in high power ranges for
    regular power systems. In microgrid applications, energy storage devices may enhance
    the power quality, reliability, and stability between loads and the output of
    distributed generated resources. According to the characteristics of loads and
    dispersed energy resources, it is possible to identify more suitable energy storage
    devices. The following is a summary of some important energy storage technologies
    suitable for MG applications: One of the most popular forms of energy storage
    is batteries. They fall under the categories of lithium-ion (Li-on), lead acid,
    nickel cadmium (Ni-Cd), and nickel metal hydride batteries. Long-term energy storage
    is possible using lead acid batteries, despite their poor performance and short
    cycle life (1200–1800 cycles). Ni-Cd batteries have higher energy densities, longer
    cycle lives, and require less maintenance when compared to lead acid batteries.
    However, its biggest drawback is a large initial capital expenditure. The energy
    density of NiMh batteries is around 25–30% higher than that of NiCd batteries,
    and they also have a cycle life that is comparable to that of lead acid batteries.
    In comparison to lead acid, Ni-Cd, and NiMh batteries, Li-on batteries have the
    best energy density; nevertheless, the investment cost and short life span are
    the key downsides of Li-on batteries [75,76]. To lessen the negative effects of
    PV integration, a battery storage system integrated with solar PV systems has
    been presented in Reference [77]. Simulink and Homer analyses were conducted in
    Ref. [75] to evaluate various battery storage solutions from a technoeconomic
    standpoint. Flywheel energy storage systems have a long lifespan, a high energy
    density, and a high power density. However, the disadvantage of flywheel energy
    storage is that substantial friction losses are likely to occur. They can be applied
    to lessen the erratic power output of solar and wind power systems. In Refs. [78,79],
    flywheel storage systems and a diesel generator are utilized to provide a UPS
    service to the critical loads. Supercapacitors, which are based on the characteristics
    of capacitors and electrochemical batteries without a chemical process, are also
    known as ultracapacitors or electric double-layer capacitors. The use of porous
    membranes, which enables ion movement between two electrodes and offers direct
    energy storage while also reducing response time, is the primary distinction between
    a capacitor and a supercapacitor [75]. Additionally, its energy density and capacitance
    values may be hundreds to thousands of times greater than those of the capacitors.
    Supercapacitors have a longer cycle life, better power density, and an energy
    efficiency of roughly 75–80% when compared to lead acid batteries, which have
    a lower energy density. However, the biggest drawback of this technology is its
    expensive price, which is almost five times greater than that of lead acid batteries
    [76]. Supercapacitors have been presented as a good option for reducing the natural
    variations prevalent in the intermittent renewable energy sources of wind and
    wave, respectively. SMES systems feature extremely long lifespans (tens to thousands
    of cycles), extremely high efficiency (up to 95%), quick response times, and expensive
    implementation costs. Power factor optimization, frequency management, transient
    stability, and power quality enhancement are potential applications [80,81]. 2.10.
    Faults and Protection in Microgrid A hybrid microgrid’s faults can be classified
    as load, converter, generator side, sensor and cyberattack-initiated problem [82].
    Pole–pole faults and pole–ground faults all occur at the DC load side in a hybrid
    microgrid [83]. The AC side experiences conventional faults, such as line to ground
    (L-G), line to line (L-L), line to line to ground (L-L-G), and line to line to
    line (L-L-L), while the AC microgrid may also experience converter faults. Given
    that the dispersed generator is located close to the load center, the likelihood
    of DC transmission line faults is lower than the likelihood of AC line failures.
    By using standard detection and isolation procedures, the AC side problems can
    be found. When a problem occurs on the DER or load side of a DC microgrid, it
    is important to determine if the system is in islanded mode or grid-connected
    mode initially. As RES cannot supply very high fault currents where synchronous
    generators typically deliver, the threshold value of a fault current is lower
    when the system is operating in standalone mode. The threshold signal value should
    be revised in this situation. In a DC microgrid, converter faults are caused by
    either an open circuit or a short circuit in the power converter switches. Since
    heavy current does not flow through an open circuit when it occurs, protective
    devices cannot detect this problem using the overcurrent phenomena, making open
    circuit detection more difficult than short circuit detection. In a level 3 boost
    connected grid [84], a unique control approach is employed to resolve this issue.
    According to this method, the boost converter functions as a 3 level boost converter
    under normal circumstances while acting as a 2 level boost converter in abnormal
    circumstances [85]. The system is resilient enough to deliver half of the load
    because the supply is unbroken even when it is malfunctioning. In an active hybrid
    system, the various defects include sensor faults and problems brought on by cyberattacks.
    Actual values of the system parameters are provided by sensors for various controller
    actions. In the event that the system’s characteristics are not accurately represented
    by the sensor output, the controller will process misleading data and send undesirable
    pulse signals to the converters, which will cause the system to behave incorrectly
    and lose stability. The grid side converter fails to maintain current and voltage
    in such a circumstance. The adversary can launch a cyberattack by overwriting
    the sensor value in order to impose the broken state in the grid. The sliding
    mode oberver technique is used to estimate error due to sensor failure or a defect
    caused by a cyberattack in a hybrid microgrid attack [82]. The absence of zero
    crossing current, reliance on converter topologies, output filter effect, and
    system grounding provide obstacles to DC microgrid protection, which must be addressed
    in a new protection scheme. A big amount of arc forms once a protection device
    quickly breaks a high current. Because AC has a natural zero crossing of the current,
    fault isolation is performed at the zero current occurrence, which results in
    the lowest amount of arc production. In contrast to an AC system, a DC system
    lacks a natural zero crossing, hence the arc’s strength is much higher. Despite
    several benefits, DC microgrid protection faces several difficulties. Some common
    issues to AC and DC systems include the inability of overcurrent relays to protect
    microgrids or limited fault currents in islanded mode. Despite this, there are
    certain additional problems that impair microgrid protection. 3. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) Strategies John McCarthy, a computer scientist, created the term “artificial
    intelligence” [86] in 1979 and later defined it as “the science and engineering
    of constructing intelligent machines” [87]. The definition of artificial intelligence
    is teaching computers to resemble human thought processes and even emulate human
    behavior [88]. A data-driven system that enables a computer or software to carry
    out tasks or make judgments is also an area of computer science devoted to replicating
    human cognitive processes. In their book “The Race Against the Machine” [88],
    Brynjolfsson and McAfee argued that due to major advancements in AI and ML, human
    civilization will not be capable of supporting anything like full employment.
    The routing algorithm is one of the most important characteristics of computer
    networks because it is responsible for delivering data packets from source to
    destination nodes. Although static and centralized routing algorithms could satisfy
    industrial-age networks, they are incapable of responding to new-age networks
    that deal with massive amounts of data and a large number of heterogeneous users
    and traveling entities. AI has numerous applications in power system engineering.
    Artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced numerical computation software are critical.
    Sensors have a wide range of applications in industrial settings, including safety
    enhancement, data acquisition, and environmental and human body monitoring. Wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) may use multiple antennas to transmit sensing data. A previously
    unexplored path for the shrinking of wireless sensors has now been made possible
    by additional advancements in the design of planar antennas. Designers may create
    networks of interconnected sensors and cameras using AI technology, ensuring that
    an autonomous vehicle’s AI can “see” its surroundings. They must also make sure
    that information from these on-board sensors is transmitted quickly. Utilizing
    the capabilities of AI applications may also make it possible to improve system
    performance while solving issues more effectively. They have the chance to adjust
    how their organizations run day-to-day business and develop over time. 3.1. Advantages
    of Artificial Intelligence Superior demand forecasting, direct automation, a safer
    workplace, sophisticated root cause analysis, smooth 24/7 production, a smarter
    workforce, increased workplace safety, lower operational costs, improved production
    defect identification, automated quality management, higher operational efficiencies,
    better power product or equipment design, quick decision making, predictive maintenance,
    testing, and qualification are just a few of the benefits of artificial intelligence
    [89]. 3.2. Strategies of Artificial Intelligence to Support the Optimization of
    Hybrid Energy Systems 3.2.1. Genetic Algorithm Utilizing fitness (objective) function
    and constraints, the genetic algorithm (GA) generates the best solution from the
    available solution domain [90,91]. GA can be divided into two categories: single-objective
    function optimization and multiobjective function optimization. Single-objective
    function optimization produces a unique solution that can be either maximum or
    minimal by optimizing just one objective function. However, in the optimization
    of a multiobjective function, many objective functions are optimized, leading
    to a solution space that is not dominated (from the entire feasible solution domain,
    a sub domain is obtained, which is better than the remaining solution space).
    GA encompasses the three fundamental genetic processes of crossing, mutation,
    and selection. Choosing the population size is the initial stage in using GA to
    find a feasible solution. The population size can be chosen at random [92] or
    based on our knowledge of a possible solution. The value of the objective function
    is examined at each population size point. The population size’s points that produce
    an accurate fitness value are regarded as parents in GA. The new population known
    as children is created using these parents [93]. Crossover and mutation are two
    methods that could be used to accomplish this [94,95]. While mutation creates
    various changes to the present parents based on fitness value, crossover is the
    combination of many parents. In many instances, elite offspring with the same
    parents may be produced (in those cases when the selected initial population gives
    an accurate fitness value). Up until a workable solution is found that provides
    an accurate fitness value, GA creates new populations. The algorithm is stopped
    using specified stopping criteria after the accurate fitness value is obtained.
    Time limit, fitness limit, generation size, function toleration, and constraint
    tolerance are just a few examples of stopping criteria for GA. Numerous published
    studies discuss the use of GA in hybrid systems for sizing research. For instance,
    Yang et al. [96,97] and Bilal et al. [98] used GAs to size a PV hybrid wind system.
    The deployment of hybrid PV/wind systems can result in reduced system expenses
    when compared to systems in which the sources of only PV and WG are applied, according
    to Koutroulis et al. [99,100], who employed genetic algorithms to determine the
    energy costs of the entire system. On the other hand, Lagorse et al. [101] used
    the concept of a multisource hybrid source combining wind and oil to make use
    of GAs. The authors of [102] reported that their use of genetic algorithms resulted
    in improved battery size. Additionally, Lopez et al. in [103,104,105] created
    a simulation application called Hybrid Optimizations based on Genetic Algorithms
    (HOGA) to program compounds of standalone hybrid energy systems with content from
    renewable sources and conventional diesel generators. Lagorse et al. employed
    a hybrid GA and simplex-based approach [106], whereas Zhao et al. [107] designed
    a GA that has, as its primary components, a wind source and essential technical
    specifications. These served as the parameters for the input. To lower production
    costs and increase the dependability of the system, a wind source of energy was
    also constructed. Furthermore, Li et al. [107] made use of a GA to increase the
    rate of gearbox proportioning, which in turn increased the power ratings of the
    multihybrid stable wind generators. The locations of the wind turbines on the
    property are included in the wind outline, which aims to maximize energy production
    [108]. Grady et al. [109] provided a GA to determine the best generation of wind
    turbines with the highest output capacity while limiting the number of fixed turbines
    and the amount of land that each wind farm occupied. The solution to this difficulty
    was developed by Emami and Noghreh [110] using a fresh coding strategy and a brand-new
    objective function with GAs. For the management of the cost, electricity, and
    efficacy of the wind farm, their solution outperformed earlier methods that were
    suggested. In order to tackle both active control algorithms for the wind and
    optimal design challenges, Li et al. [111] employed a multilevel GA. Kalogirou
    [112] also employed ANNs and GAs to achieve his financial objectives in order
    to expand the solar energy infrastructure. The ANN method is appropriate for establishing
    a connection between a high container size and a collector region while using
    minimum power, which is ideal for the system. Then, using a GA, the optimum magnitude
    of factor to use to extend the life-cycle reserves is determined. By reflecting
    a variety of systems and operating conditions, Sharma et al. [113] used the GA
    approach to improve the thermal performance of flat laminate solar air warmers.
    In order to determine the electrical factors, Zagrouba et al. [114] used the GA
    technique. For identifying the equivalent highest power point, this study uses
    photovoltaic solar cells and modules. 3.2.2. Particle Swarm Optimization A population-based
    stochastic optimization technique is called particle swarm optimization (PSO).
    This tactic has been influenced by practices such as fish tutoring or bird flocking.
    The authors of [115] carry out an ongoing or continuous EMS PSO inside an MG.
    The replica has been updated every three minutes. Reducing or limiting the system’s
    overall power expense is the goal. To determine the ideal positioning and size
    of the MG components to ensure the system’s dependability and profitability, the
    multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) was implemented in [116]. For
    the system configuration and dimensioning, a multiobjective PSO methodology is
    presented [117]. Reliability (unwavering quality), running costs, and natural
    effects are three competing criteria that must all be balanced for an MG to operate
    at its best. Refocusing optimal energy management for industrial MG was put forth
    by Li et al. [118] and is based on PSO. It may be used in standalone and network-associated
    modes. Keeping MGs operating and maintenance costs to a minimum is the goal of
    the standalone mode. However, in network-associated mode, it also increases the
    benefit of power exchanging with the main network. In terms of the overall optimal
    solution and computation time, the suggested approach produces better results
    when compared to the genetic algorithm. PSO has recently solved a significant
    problem in the power consumption of high-gain antennas. This nature-based optimization
    algorithm (i.e., PSO) also has reduced power dissipation in long-distance communications,
    as discussed in “Multi-objective particle swarm optimization to design a time-delay
    equalizer met surface for an electromagnetic band-gap resonator antenna”. These
    aspects show how PSO is making changes in the electrical engineering field. 3.2.3.
    Artificial Neural Network An artificial neural network (ANN) is a replication
    of a biological neural network that efficiently links different parameters to
    a greater number of uncertain data points. To relate different parameters, ANN
    models do not need complex mathematical bases or equations [119]. As a result,
    ANN takes less computational work when coupling any number of parameters with
    a large number of uncertain data points than previous approaches [120,121,122].
    The process of training an ANN using imported data is known as supervised learning,
    or training. Like the neurons in the human brain, ANN has a number of these [123,124,125].
    Weight is a fractional value that connects these neurons to one another [123,126].
    The values of weight become constant when error reaches a reasonable level during
    the training phase in order to predict correct results [127]. The basic framework
    of the ANN model is depicted in Figure 3. The input layer, hidden layer, and output
    layer of an ANN are each made up of neurons [128,129,130]. The quantity of input
    parameters determines how many neurons are in the input layer, and the quantity
    of output parameters determines how many neurons are in the output layer [131].
    The number of neurons in the hidden layer is typically determined using (1), which
    depends on the quantity of input + output neurons and the quantity of training
    data points [132]. The number of hidden neurons is frequently determined by using
    the trial-and-error method [92]. ANN has a wide application in various industries,
    such as space exploration. 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 ℎ𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑛 𝑛𝑒𝑢𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑠= 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑠+𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑛𝑒𝑢𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑠

    is very important, where t stands for time and bias is a second parameter used
    to modify the neural network’s output. The inputs could be added to the network
    at different times, according to the right-side neural network. The entire collection
    of data for an input–output parameter is split into two groups: the training data
    set, which contains a larger percentage of the data points, and the validation
    data set, which contains the remaining data points and is used to verify the trained
    neural network [133,134,135]. Neural networks import input–output parameters together
    with their training data points. The training of this network continues until
    the acceptable error is reached. Once the allowable error is determined, the trained
    network is validated by importing the values of the validation data set’s input
    parameters and predicting the corresponding values of the output parameters. If
    the difference between the actual and predicted results is within the allowable
    limit, the trained neural network may be suggested as the best neural network
    for the prediction. These predicted values of the output parameter of the validation
    data set are compared with corresponding actual values of the output parameter
    of the validation data set [135,136]. Different training algorithms are used to
    train neural networks, and these algorithms include training function, learning
    variant, transfer function, and the number of hidden neurons [137]. There are
    several different training functions, learning variants, and transfer functions
    accessible [138]. A reasonable number of epochs are trained for the outputs. The
    neural network predicts the values of the output parameter for the associated
    input values for the appropriate training algorithm and training epochs. The trained
    neural network with that combination of training algorithm may be chosen as the
    best neural network with the best training algorithm if the error value is smaller
    than the allowable value. When the error is bigger, the neural network is trained
    either using the same training algorithm for a different number of epochs or using
    a different training strategy until the error is below acceptable limits [139].
    The predictions made by the best neural network utilizing validation data points
    demonstrate that the trained neural network generalizes well in [140]. Every neural
    network has a threshold value and an output value is only predicted when the sum
    of all the input values multiplied by their associated weight values exceeds the
    threshold value, as shown by (2) [122,139,141]. 𝑌 𝑘 = ∑ 𝑚 𝑖=1 𝑊 𝑘𝑖 𝑥𝑖 (2) where
    𝑊 𝑘𝑖 is the weight at the ith neuron, and 𝑥𝑖 is the value of the ith neuron. 𝑌
    𝑘 is the neural network output. There are numerous types of neural networks that
    are available and are detailed based on various topologies and properties. The
    ANN determines a related output when an input training pattern is introduced.
    It is compared to the output that is already available. The optimization technique
    makes use of this difference to train the network. The ANN determines a related
    output when an input training pattern is introduced. It is compared to the output
    that is already available. The optimization technique makes use of this difference
    to train the network. 3.2.4. Fuzzy Logic Instead of dealing with data points,
    fuzzy logic (FL) deals with the ranges of the various parameters. FL could therefore
    anticipate precise outcomes for all data points within the limits of different
    parameters [142]. The human understanding is what determines FL accuracy [143].
    The general fuzzy model diagram is displayed in Figure 4. Two modules, Mamdani
    and Sugeno, make up FL. Unlike the Sugeno module, where input parameters have
    a variety of ranges and output parameters include data points, the Mamdani module
    of FL divides both input and output parameters into ranges [144]. FL is divided
    into two portions, the first of which presents the influencing (input) parameters
    and the second of which displays the performance (output) parameters. Each input/output
    parameter’s whole range is broken down into a number of minor ranges [145]. A
    suitable basic shape, such as a triangular, trapezoidal, sinusoidal, or Gaussian,
    is used to represent each small range of variation [146]; these shapes are shown
    in Figure 4. Figure 4. Fuzzy logic model diagram. The choice of this basic form
    for any range is made depending on how frequently the values in that range vary.
    A membership function is a range with the appropriate primitive shape [147]. The
    number of membership functions and the border range of each membership function
    depend on how imported input–output data behave. Following the selection of membership
    functions, rules are created in the fuzzy modular’s rule editor based on the values
    of the input–output parameter. Data sets are divided into training and validation
    data sets to ensure the accuracy of fuzzy models that have been developed [121,133,134].
    If-then statements and “AND,” “OR,” or “NOR” Booleans are used in rules to link
    the input and output values [148,149]. The connection between the input and the
    relevant output values is thus made by rules. Because there are fewer rules due
    to the smaller quantity of data points, it may anticipate erroneous results for
    some imported input values. Larger numbers of data points result in more rules,
    which improves accuracy, but occasionally creates overfitting (where there may
    be several output values for a single imported input value), which also forecasts
    erroneous results [143,149]. In the fuzzy modular’s rule viewer, rules are put
    into action. The rule viewer is divided into two sections, the first of which
    contains all the input parameters and their membership functions, and the second
    of which contains the output parameters and their membership functions. Output
    values are predicted based on the chosen rules by importing input values from
    the training data set. There are numerous defuzzification methods, including centroid,
    last of maximum, mean of maxima, middle of maximum, center of area, center of
    gravity, and bisector of area, among others. Additionally, the user can create
    their own defuzzification methods and membership functions (type, number etc.)
    [136]. 3.2.5. Artificial Bee Colony The metaheuristic algorithm artificial bee
    colony (ABC) is inspired by honey bees’ clever activities, such as collecting
    and distributing nectar. To avoid the local optimum and find the global optimum,
    ABC uses stochastic principles rather than gradient information. The ABC method
    was employed by the authors of [150] to address the question of the ideal microgrid
    size. The NPV has been optimized for the microgrid’s advantage. The methodology’s
    effectiveness was tested using real data on the climate and electricity demand
    in the east-central region of Italy to study the best evaluations for solar, wind,
    and energy storage systems. The impact of AI is growing across many sectors of
    engineering, particularly in sustainable energy systems. AI has been used in a
    wide range of applications, as seen in Table 2, which presents the application
    of artificial intelligence in various power systems. The employed bees (EBs) and
    onlooker bees (OBs) make up the artificial bee population. The environment is
    represented by the search space in ABC, and each point in the search space corresponds
    to a potential food source (solution) that the artificial bees can use. The value
    of the function that needs to be optimized at the appropriate position indicates
    a food source’s quality. Initially, the EBs scout, and each EB decides to take
    advantage of a food source it has discovered. The number of food sources that
    are now being used in the system and the number of EBs are thus related. Table

    Applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategies in Microgrids for Optimization
    The study of AI is a segment of computer science that advances AI software and
    hardware. AI has several subareas, including hybrid techniques such as ANN, FL,
    GA, PSO, and ABC, that combine two or more of these divisions. The appropriate
    usage of AI technology sets the stage for systems with strong AI performance or
    other qualities that might not be compatible with conventional methodologies.
    4.1. Reviewed AI Optimization Strategies Optimization methods have grown in admiration
    since they play a vital role to approach practical complex difficulties in electrical
    systems with the preferred forecast precision. The reviewed enhancement strategies
    and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies in microgrids for
    optimization using solo prediction and a summary of various studies presenting
    the application of AI strategies is included in this study. 4.1.1. Reviewed Optimization
    of GA GA is a type of global search heuristic. A specific subset of evolutionary
    algorithms, such as mutation, selection, and combination, use these methods to
    be inspired by evolutionary biology. Both of the following are necessary for a
    normal GA: a genetic demonstration of the problem domains, and using the fitness
    function (FF) to calculate the solution domains; for problem domains with the
    complex FF landscape and the conventional hill climbing strategy that may not
    succeed, GA may be helpful. For the best sizing of a standalone hybrid SPV/WTG
    system per year in [169], the authors used GA and elitist techniques (8760 h).
    4.1.2. Reviewed Optimization of FL The fact that the FL-developed models map the
    precise situation to the best level accounts for their widespread use; therefore,
    it is considered in many cases. This approach is used when the experts’ response
    is hazy. To reach consensus, professionals debate for a long time. In fuzzy regression,
    the dependent and independent variables’ data are both represented as fuzzy data,
    and the resulting regression equation calculates the effects of the independent
    factors on the dependent variable. The regression approach is comparable to fuzzy
    gray prediction in that the old area in the variables considered for dependence
    prediction is presented using fuzziness. To determine the variables’ relative
    status, fuzzy AHP and ANP are used. When ranking the variables, the fuzzy technique
    helps to accurately capture the fuzziness in people’s attentions. The range of
    the variables is given to the variables to help clearly define the clusters and
    establish borders. These strategies are applied to a problem domain. Fuzzy regression
    and fuzzy gray prediction are used for the forecasting. For determining the relative
    importance of energy resources, fuzzy AHP and ANP are used. Fuzzy clustering is
    used to gather resources that depend on factors such as cost, availability, pollution,
    etc. These methods, which are used to anticipate or assess the importance of electrical
    utility, are characterized as “simple” methods due to the complexity of the method
    itself. 4.1.3. Reviewed Optimization of ANN A structured collection of AI neurons
    known as the optimization of ANN employs mathematical models for information processing
    that rely on the connectionist approach to computation. The authors of Reference
    [88] used ANN-based techniques to implement preemptive control strategies for
    large HRES. Essential components of the dynamic safety pattern class that calculate
    the level of safety and are superior to conventional statistical approaches are
    artificial neural networks (ANNs). By analyzing the peculiarity of SPV, WTG, the
    reference [170] provided an ANN control technique for a multienergy common DC
    bus hybrid power supply. In the operational circumstances of the grids under changing
    load, voltage and frequency variations, as well as active–reactive (PQ) power
    control, are significant challenges. When renewable resources such as solar, wind,
    and battery storage units are operated with grid interaction and integrated into
    the grid, these fluctuations and power flow become more challenging to manage.
    Controlling the systems during the grid connection of the RES that works with
    the grid is challenging because of unbalanced load circumstances and abrupt power
    changes of the sources. Numerous issues have been discovered on both the load
    and source sides when issues of grid-interactive systems using RES are examined
    [171]. The following is a list of some of these issues: Voltage and frequency
    oscillations brought on by RES’s unreliable power generation. Disturbances in
    voltage and frequency brought on by load imbalance in systems that interface with
    the grid. PQ power transmission imbalances caused by the sources’ fluctuating
    load circumstances. The grid’s reflection of output surplus as reactive power,
    which happens when renewable energy systems are improperly planned. Connection
    issues that occur when RES are connected to the grid. 4.2. Reviewed Hybrid Microgrid
    Optimization Using Artificial Intelligence Strategies Combining two prediction
    models has grown in popularity as a way to address complicated real-world problems
    with the desired prediction accuracy. A hybrid model is one that combines two
    prediction models. Each solo prediction model has its own set of restrictions.
    In order to produce better outcomes, hybrid models are therefore chosen to eliminate
    or lessen the limits of one model by fusing it with another model. Many hybrid
    models have been developed recently; however, according to the researched literature,
    ANN + FL, ANN + GA, and FL + GA are the most often used hybrid models for problems
    relating to solar energy. The hybrid models are explained and reviewed in this
    paper. 4.2.1. Applications of Fuzzy and Ann in Voltage and Frequency Fluctuations
    Different techniques have been used to reduce voltage and frequency variations
    of grid-interactive systems working concurrently with RES employing FL and ANN
    algorithms. Following are some recent studies that have been published in the
    literature, with an emphasis on FL and ANN. An FLC is suggested by Rajesh et al.
    to regulate the WT’s rotor frequency in hybrid renewable energy systems. This
    model’s efficiency has been demonstrated by performance evaluations on a variety
    of controllers based on switching time, settling time, rising time, and percentage
    overshoots [12]. Fathy et al. propose an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system
    (ANFIS) algorithm trained through the ant lion optimizer (ALO) in order to achieve
    optimal load frequency control (LFC) in a system consisting of RES. In the designed
    system, the error signal obtained from the fuzzy system and the PI output are
    given as a feed input to the ANFIS controller for training with a loop. ALO-ANFIS’s
    results are compared with other approaches. Data such as performance characteristics,
    settling time, frequency, and over and under drawn from power line deviations
    were calculated and compared with other reference algorithms [172]. An approach
    based on a dynamic dead band and frequency filter is proposed by Aziz et al. With
    a variable speed WT generator running in grid contact, this method offers power
    and frequency responsiveness. In order to combine the benefits of FL and conventional
    PID control, the proposed LFC employs a two-stage control mechanism. The unpredictable
    variations in wind output produce nonlinear conditions in the control area of
    the WT generator, which can be adequately compensated for by the fuzzy LFC. According
    to the simulation results, FGS-PID LFC operates better in a control area with
    low inertia [173]. To maintain frequency and voltage stability in microgrids,
    Angalaeswari et al. suggest an iterative learning controller (ILC) that can function
    in fluctuating situations in an autonomous grid. The suggested ILC outperformed
    competitors in both off-grid and on-grid modes under a variety of conditions for
    voltage and frequency stability. Voltage imbalance is minimized and running duration
    is decreased with this method. The suggested ILC achieves a maximum error reduction
    of 79% [174]. Thao et al. propose a FL-based two-stage framework. The goal of
    this coordinated FL structure is to manage the grid frequency by adjusting the
    active power provided to the grid by the PV plant. Finally, simulations reveal
    that the suggested technique can regulate frequency in transient and steady-state
    modes within permitted deviation ranges of 0.2 Hz and 0.05 Hz, respectively [175].
    To optimize the operating efficiency of DC side voltage controllers in grid-connected
    PV systems, Tripathi et al. suggest a new method, termed fictitious reference
    iterative tuning. In the investigation, 2-DOF PI is employed, and DC side control
    is achieved with enhanced distortion response. As a result, it was established
    that improved results in DC voltage regulation were obtained [171]. To improve
    the frequency response of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) in wind energy
    conversion systems, Peng et al. suggest a coordinated FL-based algorithm using
    the DFIG-energy storage couple. The system’s frequency responsiveness is enhanced
    with the suggested design in the short term and for various wind speeds [176].
    In a different study, Peng et al. used a FL-based algorithm to execute optimal
    control strategy and sizing with a DFIG energy storage pair in wind energy conversion
    systems. According to the claim made in [177], the suggested system performs properly
    in terms of frequency regulation and power generation in WT and battery storage
    systems. A smart coordinated control is proposed by Roselyn et al. In order to
    reduce the imbalance between supply and demand while the microgrid is operating,
    this method, which is based on ANFIS, combines control techniques such as current,
    virtual impedance, and reverse fall controls. Experiments based on simulation
    have been conducted to compare the fast switching response of different control
    methods. The proposed design is said to perform better in various system situations
    as a result of investigations [178]. To manage frequency oscillation in power
    networks, Yu et al. suggest an adaptive multiple-input and single-output (MISO)
    FL algorithm. They want to make the system less expensive. In the controller design,
    the PSO algorithm is utilized for the system’s effective operation. It was concluded
    that the MISO structure functions more effectively in comparison to other structures
    as a result [179]. In order to reduce the detrimental impact of partial shadowing
    situations on the frequency regulation of the grid in big power PV systems, Rahman
    et al. suggest a new ANN-based control technique. The study’s findings demonstrate
    that the suggested technique has a favorable impact on the network’s frequency
    performance [180]. A control system based on ANNs was suggested by Kaushal et
    al. By controlling power quality in accordance with IEEE/IEC standards, this technology
    reduces voltage and frequency fluctuations in systems that connect distributed
    resources. In the simulation environment, a microgrid structure was created using
    the proposed controller structure [181]. In order to estimate very short-term
    frequency voltage in renewable energy systems, Chettibi et al. suggested a technique
    based on ANN and deep recurrent neural networks. The University of Manchester’s
    on-grid battery energy storage system was used to provide the validation data
    that were used to test the system. It was found, as a result, that the created
    algorithm predicts the variables with a reasonable level of accuracy [182]. According
    to the literature review cited above, using FL and ANN applications to stabilize
    the grid’s voltage and frequency is a very important strategy. 4.2.2. Applications
    of Fuzzy and Ann in Active Reactive Power Quality Control Different techniques
    have been used to implement FL and ANN algorithms for PQ control and power quality
    improvement of grid-interactive systems that operate concurrently with RES. The
    studies in the literature that specifically use FL and ANN are listed below. Shunt
    hybrid filters were used in a design by Das et al. to enhance power quality and
    PQ in microgrids. The proposed architecture employed a fuzzy neural network, and
    the outcomes were evaluated in comparison to those of alternative control strategies
    [183]. In order to improve the power quality of a solar energy conversion system
    (SECS), correct the compensation for reactive power, and maximize active power
    generation, Ouai et al. suggested a model for the potential utilization of PV
    plants and for power conditioning to operate at full capacity. The study’s findings
    demonstrate that the proposed control technique performs optimally and at its
    highest level of efficacy. It confirms that SECS can be completed at its maximum
    power, even though the power quality in the planned system can be enhanced with
    active filtering and reactive power adjustment [184]. Hou et al. presented a fuzzy
    proportional complex integral control method to reduce the quasi-Z source on-grid
    PV inverter’s negative control effect. For the AC distortion signal of a chosen
    particular frequency and excluding the steady-state error, this approach includes
    the exclusive of zero steady-state error improvement [185]. Using a supercapacitor
    as energy storage, Carvalho et al. suggested a FL-based model for power smoothing
    of WT power fluctuations. The supercapacitor energy storage’s state of charge
    (SOC) is controlled by the model both during successful and unsuccessful WT power
    smoothing and in the simulated microgrid. In all circumstances, the proposed model
    exhibits improved and good performance of the FL-based method compared to the
    baseline scenario and conventional smoothing technique [186]. Faroug et al. created
    proportional–integral (PI) controlled static synchronous compensator (STATCOM)
    controllers. After this, STATCOM controllers with FL control were compared. By
    introducing reactive electricity into the grid, STATCOM and fuzzy logic-controlled
    STATCOM corrected the problem. By preventing the tripping of WT generators, they
    used to be able to stabilize the voltage in wind turbine (WT) power [187]. For
    an effective low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability, Roselyn et al. developed
    a smart fuzzy-based reactive and real power regulation of the inverter. The suggested
    LVRT solution [188] incorporates a dynamic braking resistor and a braking chopper
    to categorize the overshoot in DC connect voltage during grid errors. Babu et
    al. suggested a fuzzy-based ideal point speed ratio MPPT controller for an on-grid
    wind system. An FLC, a PWM inverter, a DC boost chopper, a three-phase uncontrolled
    rectifier, a permanent magnet synchronous generator, and a three-bladed permanent
    field turbine are all components of the overall system. The MPPT controller on
    the generator side succeeded in obtaining the WT’s maximum power at any speed
    [189]. With the aid of a battery energy storage system, Yang et al. optimized
    fuzzy logic empirical mode disintegration to lessen the variations of WT power.
    For this reason, the WT power signal was divided into two parts: the low-frequency
    part and the high-frequency part. The battery system’s level of charge and the
    pace of power fluctuation are advanced restrictions that the filter is proposing.
    Results show that the proposed model can perform passable smoothing of wind power
    variation [190]. Efrain et al. made reactive FL-based control of smart PV inverters
    possible. In this study, smart distribution power grids were simulated using a
    real-time digital simulator. Results show that the suggested model lowers power
    losses, lowers PV reactive power injection synchronously, and increases magnitude
    voltage [191]. A distributed power flow controller-based integrated hybrid system
    model was created by Naidu et al. FOPID and PQ theory controllers are employed
    in this hybrid model. ANFIS, FUZZY, and PI controller comparisons are used to
    validate the proposed system. As a result, the FOPID controller performs better
    in terms of harmonic reduction, transition fall and rise voltages, and voltage
    compensation [192]. Rezaie et al. used a static fuzzy-based volt-ampere reactive
    (VAR) compensation to increase a wind turbine system’s capacity to operate at
    low voltage. The proposed controller would reduce the maximum voltage drop during
    fault conditions and increase steady-state voltage. The biggest voltage losses
    occur after the steady-state voltage error at the load bus and the fault incidence
    at the WT generator bus, which are reduced by an average of 25.16% and 74.44%,
    respectively [193]. In a PV system connected with a microgrid, Kaushal et al.
    developed power quality control based on power factor, total harmonic distortion,
    frequency, unbalancing, and voltage sag/swell using ANN. This system’s effectiveness
    is demonstrated by the line communication and impedance delay development for
    the evaluation of power quality metrics. As a result, the suggested controller
    can function as intended even if RES’s nature changes [181]. In order to solve
    the power quality issues, Kumar et al. used a WT, PV, and fuel cell-based hybrid
    renewable energy system. Some authors used ANFIS, ANN, and FL-based control algorithms
    to maximize the dynamic performance of this filter. These controllers employ nonlinear,
    balanced, and unbalanced loads to achieve the smooth DC link voltage while minimizing
    the total harmonic distortion produced in [194]. An ANN-based direct power control
    technique was made possible by Douiri et al. to synchronize DFIG and manage power
    flow with voltage-oriented control and a grid. The suggested model architecture
    achieves significantly shorter performance times, and the faults that cause time
    delays are decreased [195]. In order to optimize the power output of a small-scale
    Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine, Abdalrahman et. developed intelligent blade
    pitch control. Dynamic ANNs were utilized by Mordjaoui et al. to forecast daily
    power consumption. On the basis of load data, the effectiveness and applicability
    of this procedure were established. This information came from the website of
    the French transmission system operator. Results of the forecasting approach show
    that for historical and predicted loads, respectively, the mean absolute percent
    error is 4.223% and 3.266% [196]. Seven alternative ANN training methods were
    examined by Monteiro et al. to estimate the generation of active power. Researchers
    compared the performance of the Kalman filter and support vector machine in this
    study using data on the number of hours in the day, solar panel temperature, air
    temperature, and irradiance. Therefore, the relative MAPE results for ANN, SVM,
    and KF are 0.02%, 0.33%, and 3.41% [197]. Saviozzi et al. used ensembles of ANNs
    for load prediction and modeling. The data set for this investigation included
    historical load time series and data associated with network users. Results show
    that using both of the suggested strategies can help people achieve successful
    outcomes on actual distribution networks [198]. In order to successfully implement
    PQ power regulation in the grid, the literature review described above emphasizes
    the importance of FL and ANN applications. The summary of evaluation of different
    optimization AI techniques in microgrids is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Summary
    of different optimization AI techniques used in microgrids. 5. Review of Applications
    of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategies under Fault Outbreaks in Microgrids
    ANN, FL, PSO, GA, and PSO are just a few of the AI-based fault detection and classification
    methods that have recently been used for microgrid protection. For a microgrid
    protection system to enable speedy repairs—including network restoration—and cut
    down on interruption time, efficient fault detection and its categorization methodologies
    are necessary. For quick and accurate fault detection and classification for the
    microgrid system, however, it is necessary to take into account the performance
    of AI-based techniques and their computational time. In numerous investigations,
    various AI-based defect detection and classification approaches have been published
    and summarized in this paper. 5.1. Energy Flow and Management under Faults In
    order to ensure stable, dependable, and sustainable operation of the microgrid
    and other operational goals such as minimizing costs and fuel consumption [206,207],
    an energy management system (EMS) is important [208], it is a control tool that
    manages the power flows among the main grid, DERs, and loads. Additionally, it
    is in charge of resynchronizing the system while switching between grid and island
    mode. Decentralized and centralized control, with varied hierarchical controls,
    are the two basic EMS strategies that can be distinguished [209]. 5.1.1. Centralized
    Controller All the measured data from all DERs in the microgrid are gathered by
    the centralized controller, which subsequently modifies the control variable for
    each piece of equipment and sends the updated data to the central system [210].
    In particular, small-scale MGs are a perfect fit for this control. The dependability
    and redundancy of this form of control are low. The fact that this control may
    result in a number of communication issues and that it necessitates system shutdown
    in the event of system maintenance are two additional downsides. Centralized hierarchical
    control offers a successful answer from an economic perspective. Depending on
    the type of microgrid or the existing infrastructure, the hierarchical control
    architecture may be used. The following three tiers of controllers could make
    up a centralized hierarchical control scheme in this situation: local controllers,
    a microgrid central controller (MGCC), and a distribution management system (DMS).
    Because communication networks are frequently avoided for reasons of reliability,
    local controllers employ local measurements to manage the voltages and frequency
    of the MG system without the need of communication systems. Each microgrid has
    an MGCC that can connect to the DMS. The MGCC manages the microgrid’s power by
    assessing the DERs’ active power, load demand, and storage needs. The two-way
    communication between the MGCC and LC allows it to fulfill the utility requirements
    [211]. Overall grid demands and stability requirements are satisfied at the DMS
    level [212]. 5.1.2. Decentralized Controller In a decentralized controller, independent
    control of DER units and loads is possible because of the decentralized EMS. If
    microgrid users have different goals or operate in a different operational environment,
    this sort of EMS is more appropriate. All local controllers in this management
    system are linked together by a communication bus. Each household or DG exchanges
    data using this bus [207]. In such a distributed system, local controllers are
    no longer subject to an MGCC to choose the best power output. As a result, the
    computational demand is greatly reduced by this type of structure, which also
    relieves pressure on the communication network throughout the entire microgrid
    system [206]. The most effective illustration of a decentralized energy management
    system is the multiagent system (MAS) approach [213]. This technology uses artificial
    intelligence-based techniques such as neural networks and fuzzy systems to establish
    each DG’s operation point while enhancing the stability of the microgrid [207].
    Its goal is to break down big, complicated systems into smaller, autonomous subsystems.
    Compared to centralized EMS, the decentralized-based MAS has a number of benefits.
    The MAS reduces calculation time since it allows DGs to work autonomously and
    uses the necessary data from the local controller. However, centralized control
    necessitates a sizable data flow to a single location [214,215]. The flexibility
    to plug and play is another benefit. A programmable agent in its control is supplied
    without changing the rest of the control if a new DER is linked to the microgrid.
    However, when a new DER is connected under centralized controls, the MGCC must
    be programmed [215]. Table 4 presents AI based control for the dynamic response
    and power quality enhancement of MGs. Table 4. AI-based control for fault dynamic
    response and power quality enhancement of MGs summary. 6. Conclusions and Future
    Outlook An overview of AI-based control in microgrid contexts is given in this
    study. The necessity for AI approaches and their implementation at the various
    levels has been examined and future scopes have been presented. An overview of
    current traditional control methods, optimization strategies, fault circumstances,
    and their limitations have also been evaluated. Despite the difficulties and complexity
    of system models, it is discovered that AI can unquestionably be a crucial instrument
    for facilitating the smooth integration and control of DERs at the local and networked
    levels. On all levels, ANN-based models are receiving increased attention. The
    majority of AI techniques currently in use are simulation and physical model-based
    but data-driven techniques should also draw more attention. The design becomes
    less difficult since a data-driven model does not need comprehensive physical
    system information. There is a deficit of data at the level of the low-voltage
    distribution network but for some particular applications, such as inertia calculation
    in the primary control. The public data sets for ESS levels need considerable
    preprocessing to improve the data quality and predictability because ESS is becoming
    a crucial component of decarbonizing smart and microgrid networks. The microgrid
    domain does not currently use semisupervised learning, although it can be applied
    in cases where the supplied data set is not entirely labeled. Another barrier
    to efficient control in the secondary layer is the communication infrastructure.
    While further study is needed to lessen the complexity of model construction,
    the current research on AI-based communication focuses on ANN-based strategies
    that have been adopted to mitigate the communication requirement. Autonomous market
    participation is another area in the tertiary layer that needs more study. PSO
    is frequently used in microgrids for control and optimization. Research on FL
    and GA is ongoing as well. In networked microgrids, several AI-based solutions
    have not yet been taken into consideration. The validation of the created/proposed
    solutions for standalone or networked microgrid contexts needs to be a priority
    as well. The conventional power system approaches create constraints in processing
    and analyzing the vast volumes of data that are now the standard with a smart
    grid as the traditional electric grid system evolves into a smart grid system.
    In order to address a variety of applications in smart grid systems, AI approaches
    are being developed and put to use, and the results thus far are encouraging.
    In addition, this work gives a summary of new applications of AI techniques in
    four crucial domains (i.e., optimization, load forecasting, power grid stability
    assessment, defects detection and security challenges) not previously covered
    in earlier research. The use of AI approaches to build a genuinely smart grid
    is also covered, along with current difficulties, potential gains, and future
    prospects. The study can be summed up as follows based on the results of this
    survey: (i) AI techniques have been used in a number of application areas essential
    to the dependability and resilience of a smart grid. (ii) Despite this, there
    are still some obstacles preventing further applications of AI techniques. The
    handling of the fault’s nature of some AI techniques to achieve a human-centered
    approach to AI solution design, as well as data privacy and security, are among
    the biggest challenges. (iii) This survey should stimulate discussions in the
    application areas surveyed in this paper, which could further strengthen exchange
    of ideas. In conclusion, smart grid systems’ reliability and resilience are enhanced
    and improved through the use of applications of AI approaches. Future research
    in this field will concentrate on examining the effects of the AI approaches character
    on smart grid operations and develop new optimization formation strategies. Future
    study will look at how this issue has been addressed by smart grid operators.
    Such a poll could assist academics in developing AI solutions that are more focused
    on the needs of people. Author Contributions This review article is part of the

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract The recently introduced continuous-time perfect
    control algorithm has revealed a great potential in terms of the maximum-speed
    and maximum-accuracy behaviors. However, the discussed inverse model-originated
    control strategy is associated with considerable energy consumption, which has
    exceeded a technological limitation in a number of industrial cases. In order
    to prevent such an important drawback, several solutions could be considered.
    Therefore, an innovative perfect control scheme devoted to the multivariable real-life
    objects is investigated in this paper. Henceforth, the new IMC-related approach,
    strongly supported by the vital sensor-aided system, can successfully be employed
    in every real-time engineering task, where the precision of conducted processes
    plays an important role. Theoretical and practical examples strictly confirm the
    big implementation potential of the new established method over existing ones.
    It has been seen that the new perfect control algorithm outperforms the classical
    control law in the form of LQR (considered in two separate ways), which is clearly
    manifested by almost all simulation examples. For instance, in the case of the
    multi-tank system, the performance indices ISE, RT, and MOE for LQR without an
    integration action have been equal to 2.431, 2.4× 10 2 , and 3.655× 10 −6 , respectively,
    whilst the respective values 1.638, 1.58× 10 2 , and 1.514× 10 −7 have been received
    for the proposed approach. Keywords: continuous-time systems; perfect control;
    practical implementation; real-life plant; state-space description 1. Introduction
    The paradigm of designing the “ideal” control in modern automation systems has
    remained the same for decades. Designers and scientists constantly address inconveniences
    regarding fulfilling exorbitant quality indices related to the accuracy and dynamic
    properties of the control process. Most approaches focus on obtaining an “optimal”
    solution, i.e., a consensus between the efficiency and the acceptable energy consumed
    by the aforementioned system [1,2,3]. This approach leads to many problems in
    the context of minimizing/maximizing multi-criteria quality indices [4,5,6,7].
    Moreover, often the optimization algorithm itself exceeds the computational capabilities
    of the system on which the target control system is to be implemented in, which
    opens the possibilities for the artificial intelligence systems (AI) [8,9,10,11,12].
    However, an alternative seems to be solutions that, from the set of numerous performance
    indices, focus only on the one parameter, e.g., accuracy, and regardless of the
    others, they are designed to keep the system in a given state (even at the expense
    of high control energy) [9,13,14]. The result mentioned above seems to be trivial,
    but it can make the plant independent of the entire machinery of optimization
    research or of implementing the AI. One of the considered approaches is the Continuous-Time
    Perfect Control (CTPC), which fits into the paradigm of the Inverse Model Control
    (IMC) systems [15]. The aforementioned perfect algorithm, developed for both discrete-
    and continuous-time systems, has already been supported by numerous publications,
    which confirms its significant implementation potential [15,16,17,18]. The significant
    merit involves obtaining a reference value in an extremely short time. On the
    other hand, it requires high-energy injection, which means that it may not be
    feasible for some class of systems, especially those with high inertia. Nevertheless,
    studies have shown that, in non-square plants, it is possible to reduce the said
    energy injection even up to 80% in the context of an appropriate choice of so-called
    degrees of freedom emerging in a properly selected inverse [18]. Moreover, it
    is possible to select good control parameters for the selected operating point
    while maintaining low energy consumption and high accuracy [9,15,18,19,20,21,22].
    However, the reduction mentioned here, even at the level of ten percent, may not
    be sufficient for some systems. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to introduce
    a new approach that makes it feasible to use the perfect control algorithm in
    real-life tasks. For this purpose, apart from theoretical considerations, a thermal
    object and a multi-tank system have been investigated by means of simulations.
    Furthermore, a real experiment has been carried out on a sensor-aided servomechanism.
    Let us observe that the preliminary studies have shown a possibility to obtain
    the inverse model control-related sensor-supported measurement system toward the
    practical implementation. Henceforth, the perfect control-originated maximum-speed
    and maximum-accuracy behaviors can outperform the properties of classical control
    methods according to different performance indices. This merit is effectively
    presented throughout the manuscript. Furthermore, the similar structures, connected
    with the control of the DC motor, can be found in [23,24] or by using the Extended
    State Observer (ESO) for different objects in [25,26,27]. In these cases, special
    attention has been paid to the fact that measurement issues play a large role
    in the context of proper sensor selection or its location [28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39].
    This article is no different; sensors are important elements which play an important
    role in the context of the new control law. The encoders used in the research
    object to measure the speed and position values are the incremental ones with
    4096 pulses per rotation. Nevertheless, in the case of using lower resolution
    sensors, some solutions can be found in [40]. This paper is structured as follows.
    After presenting the system in Section 2, the preliminary information on the generalized
    𝜎 -inverse, applied control mechanisms, and systems used in simulation studies
    are introduced in Section 3. In the Section 4, the new developed perfect control
    law dedicated to real objects is presented. In Section 5 and Section 6, the simulation
    studies are conducted, whereas the subsequent Section 6, Section 7, Section 8
    and Section 9 discuss the obtained results of the real-life sensor-aided system.
    This paper is finalized by the conclusions and open problems Section 10, which
    precedes Appendix A. 2. System Representation The proposed new approach in this
    paper must be described in state-space representation in the following manner:
    { 𝐱 ˙ (𝑡)=𝐀𝐱(𝑡)+𝐁𝐮(𝑡), 𝐲(𝑡)=𝐂𝐱(𝑡) 𝐱(0)= 𝐱 0 , (1) where appropriate forms 𝐀∈ ℝ
    𝑛×𝑛 , 𝐁∈ ℝ 𝑛× 𝑛 𝑢 , and 𝐂∈ ℝ 𝑛 𝑦 ×𝑛 are state, input, and output matrices, respectively,
    while 𝐱(𝑡) , 𝐮(𝑡) , and 𝐲(𝑡) are the n-state, 𝑛 𝑢 -input, and 𝑛 𝑦 -output vectors,
    respectively. Furthermore, the mentioned description has an initial condition
    vector 𝐱 0 in the continuous time 𝑡=0 . Moreover, due to the Kalman-oriented control
    ability properties, the considered system must fulfill the condition 𝑛 𝑢 ≥ 𝑛 𝑦
    , i.e., number of system inputs must be greater or equal to the number of outputs.
    3. Preliminaries In this section, some essential knowledge, concerning background
    of this paper’s consideration, has been presented. 3.1. Generalized 𝜎 -Inverse
    The control law devoted in this article fulfills the IMC paradigm and meets, as
    mentioned in the previous section, assumptions related to system dimensions. Therefore,
    in the case of the inverse of the non-square system ( 𝑛 𝑢 > 𝑛 𝑦 ), we have to
    use generalized inverses. As it has recently been shown in numerous articles,
    𝜎 -inverse seems to be an excellent solution for this purpose [15,17,41]. For
    the considered systems, the right invertible approach has the following form [15]:
    𝐁 R 𝜎 = 𝜷 T (𝐁 𝜷 T ) −1 , (2) while left is as follows: 𝐁 L 𝜎 = ( 𝜷 T 𝐁) −1 𝜷
    T , (3) where 𝛽 stands for the so-called degrees of freedom matrix. Introduced
    Equations (2) and (3) are equivalent, or even better than the Moore–Penrose inverse,
    in some sense. Moreover, they are the basis for continuous-time perfect control,
    which is introduced in the next paragraph. Remark 1. In spite of the proposed
    σ-inverse, it is possible to use commonly known Moore–Penrose inverse in perfect
    control approach. However, this involves limiting the corrective possibilities.
    3.2. Continuous-Time Perfect Control The newly developed Real Continuous-Time
    Perfect Control (RCTPC) introduced in this article was based on the CTPC mechanism.
    Therefore, let us remind some important aspects of the recalled approach. For
    the continuous-time system given by Equation (1), the control signal of CTPC is
    defined in the following manner [15]: 𝐮(𝑡)=[− (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐂𝐀− 𝐁 R 𝐌]𝐱(𝑡), (4) where
    𝐌 is defined as: 𝐌= 𝐂 R 1 𝑑𝑡 [𝐂𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )− 𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 )] 𝐱 L ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 ), (5) where
    (.) R and (.) L stand for every right and left generalized inverse, respectively,
    whilst the notation given as 𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 ) is a reference value. It should be
    emphasized that, used in Equation (5), operators 𝑡 𝑘−1 and 𝑡 𝑘 are representation
    of the continuous-time t in the form of 𝑡 𝑘 = 𝑡 𝑘−1 +𝑑𝑡 where 𝑑𝑡→0 . Remark 2.
    Although the CTP control allows for the use of various generalized inverses for
    non-square matrices, it is suggested to use the previously mentioned σ-inverse,
    which by implementing the degrees of freedom matrix β makes it possible, e.g.,
    to reduce the energy of the control signal [18]. The control law presented in
    Equation (4) can be rapidly verified. For this purpose, let us apply relations
    between two adjacent continuous-time function values in the form [15]: 𝐟( 𝑡 𝑘
    )=𝐟( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )+ 𝐟 ˙ ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )𝑑𝑡, (6) where 𝐟(𝑡) stands for any continuous function.
    After we substitute the mentioned control with relation to Equation (6) into state
    vector Equation (1), the result takes the following form: 𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘 )=( 𝐈 𝑛 +(𝐀−𝐁
    (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐂𝐀−𝐌)𝑑𝑡)𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 ). (7) Finally, the target equation of the output, after
    collecting the all above together, can be proved as follows [15]: 𝐲( 𝑡 𝑘 ) =(𝐂−𝐂𝐌𝑑𝑡)𝐱(
    𝑡 𝑘−1 )=𝐂𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )− 𝐂 𝐂 R ⏟ 𝐈 𝑛 𝑦 1 𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑡 ·[𝐂𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )− 𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 )] 𝐱 L (
    𝑡 𝑘−1 )𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )          unity = 𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 ). (8) The above consideration
    confirms the accuracy of the proposed approach. It has been shown that the CTPC
    can provide high accuracy of control objects after just one simulation time step
    [15]. Nevertheless, it demands high energy injection of the control signal, which
    excludes its use in real systems with high inertia. Therefore, the next main section
    is a solution to address the mentioned inconvenience in case of new RCTPC law.
    Meanwhile, the next two following subsections introduce well-known control laws
    used to verify the proposed new approach. 3.3. The LQ Regulation In order to verify
    and compare the correctness of the new RCTPC application, an approach based on
    the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) has been considered. Such a mechanism is
    structurally stable, although an appropriate chosen value of the control energy
    is very important for its facility and its proper operation. A high energy value
    allows us to obtain a reference value at the output in a relatively short time.
    However, technological or financial limitations do not permit the system to achieve
    infinite (“ideal”) control signal values. In the case of the need to reduce the
    consumption of control energy, it possible to achieve this by the proper selection
    of some parameters. In consequence, the reference value is still guaranteed. Nevertheless,
    the time to reach the set point is lengthened. The main parameters of this regulator
    are 𝐏 —positive symmetric and Q—positive symmetric semi-definite matrices. The
    value of the first one is responsible for the input of the system, while the second,
    for its output. These structures are important in the robustness properties of
    the control system. In the basic approach, without integrating action, due to
    appropriate values of the mentioned matrices, the cost function index is minimized
    by fulfilling Equation [42,43,44,45]: 𝐽= ∫ T 0 { [ 𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 −𝐲(𝑡)] T 𝐏[ 𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 −𝐲(𝑡)]+
    𝐮 T (𝑡)𝐐𝐮(𝑡)}, (9) where the used signals result from system Equation (1). An
    important issue in this type of control is the feedback from the state vector,
    not the output of the system, as for many control cases. Moreover, control laws
    in a great number of studies are presented to achieved zero value. However, in
    case of any reference value, the second used term should be used in the following
    manner [45]: 𝐮(𝑘)=− 𝐊 𝐟 𝐱(𝑡)+ 𝐊 𝐫 𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 , (10) where the feedforward matrix 𝐊
    𝐫 is the gain inverse matrix for the steady-state system and is defined as follows
    [45]: 𝐊 𝐫 = ( 𝐁 T 𝐒𝐁+𝐑) −1 𝐁 T [ 𝐈 𝐧 (𝐀− 𝐁𝐊 𝐟 ) T ] −1 𝐂 T , (11) whilst the feedback
    matrix 𝐊 𝐟 can be obtained from the following Equation [45]: 𝐊 𝐟 = ( 𝐁 T 𝐒𝐁+𝐐)
    −1 𝐁 T 𝐒𝐀. (12) The occurred matrix 𝐒 comes form the Riccati equation, and is
    a solution to the problem of the LQ Regulator [45]: 𝐒= 𝐀 T [𝐒−𝐒𝐁 ( 𝐁 T 𝐒𝐁+𝐐) −1
    𝐁 T 𝐒]𝐀+𝐏. (13) The presented control law is well-known and used due to its invaluable
    possibilities in the control process. Nevertheless, in the next paragraph we consider
    its variation with integrating action to wide the comparative capabilities for
    the new introduced RCTPC mechanism. 3.4. The LQR with Integrating Action Another
    type of control, which has been used to compare with new approaches, is modified
    LQR. The added aspect is an integrating action which is responsible for the amplification
    of the output signal and ensures that the reference value is received by minimizing
    the static error. In a latter part of the paper, the mentioned control has been
    used according to the following Equation [45]: 𝐮(𝑡)=− 𝐊 𝐟 𝑥(𝑡)+ 𝐊 𝐫 𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 (𝑡)+
    𝐊 𝐢 ∫ 𝑡 0 [( 𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 (𝑡)−𝐲(𝑡))]𝑑𝑡, (14) where 𝐊 𝐢 stands for integral gain matrix.
    The next paragraphs introduce the objects to be used in the further simulation
    studies. 3.5. Systems under Consideration A total of three different objects have
    been considered in this paper. Two of them are real objects in the form of nonlinear
    and linear dynamics equations, while the third one is a real-life plant. Due to
    the separation of the simulation part from the practical verification, the third
    system will be examined later in the manuscript. The dynamics of the first two
    mentioned systems show in each case the high inertia and limitations concerning
    the control signals. Therefore, they are ideal for the verification of the new
    RCTPC law. The objects under consideration are discussed in the separate subsections
    below. 3.5.1. The Cascade Multi-Tank System The first of the analyzed objects
    is a system of interconnected tanks, developed by the Inteco Company. Its structure
    is composed of three containers, each with a different configuration (see Figure
    1). The purpose of the control process is to stabilize the liquid at an indicated
    reference value, which can be achieved in three ways: controlling the fill pump
    by covering the upper tank, controlling the surface throughput of individual valves,
    or both at the same time (pump and valves) [46,47,48,49,50,51]. The equations
    of the presented multi-tank system are as follows (based on [47]): 𝑑 𝐻 1 (𝑡) 𝑑𝑡
    𝑑 𝐻 2 (𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 𝑑 𝐻 3 (𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 𝑉 1 𝑉 2 𝑉 3 = 1 𝛼 1 𝑤 1 𝑞(𝑡)− 1 𝛼 1 𝑤 1 𝑉 1 , = 1 𝑐
    2 𝑤 2 + 𝐻 2 (𝑡) 𝐻 2𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑏 2 𝑤 2 𝑉 1 − 𝑉 2 , = 1 𝑤 3 𝑅 2 − (𝑅− 𝐻 3 (𝑡)) 2 − − −
    − − − − − − − − − − − − √ 𝑉 2 − 𝑉 3 , = 𝐶 1 𝐻 1 (𝑡) 𝛼 1 , = 𝐶 2 𝐻 2 (𝑡) 𝛼 2 ,
    = 𝐶 3 𝐻 3 (𝑡) 𝛼 3 , (15) where symbols and their values’ specification can be
    found in Table A1 of Appendix A. Figure 1. The arrangement scheme of cascade multi-tank
    system [46]. 3.5.2. The Two-Level Thermal Object The second system presented in
    this paper is a thermal object in the form of a house (see Figure 2). The plant
    consists of two stories of different sizes, heat capacity, and heat loss coefficients
    between the system elements, the dynamic of which is described by the following
    differential Equations [52,53,54,55,56]: 𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑡 (𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 𝑇 𝑎𝑡𝑡 (𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 = ( 𝑄 ℎ − 𝐾
    𝑖𝑒 ( 𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑡 − 𝑇 𝑒𝑥𝑡 )− 𝐾 𝑖𝑎 ( 𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑡 − 𝑇 𝑎𝑡𝑡 )) 𝐶 𝑣𝑖𝑛 , = ( 𝐾 𝑖𝑎 ( 𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑡 − 𝑇 𝑎𝑡𝑡
    )− 𝐾 𝑎𝑒 ( 𝑇 𝑎𝑡𝑡 − 𝑇 𝑒𝑥𝑡 )) 𝐶 𝑣𝑎𝑡 , (16) where as before, the symbols and their
    values can be found in Table A2 of Appendix A. Figure 2. Scheme of the the two-level
    thermal object (source: authors). Remark 3. Naturally, several types of sensors
    can be applied to the physical systems. An interesting solution seems to be an
    involvement of the LK0264A-A-00KQPKG/US and TN-045KCBD18-MFPKG/US tools for measuring
    both liquid level and temperature, respectively. 3.6. Quality Criteria The simulation
    studies of the control of the analyzed objects, as well as practical verification,
    have been conducted by the application of the following quality indices [9,57,58]:
    ISE—Integral of Squared Error defined by 𝐼𝑆𝐸= ∫ 𝑡 𝑡 0 𝑒 2 (𝑡)𝑑𝑡, (17) where 𝑒(𝑡)
    is a control error; MOE—Minimum of energy which is an integral of squared control
    signal 𝐽(𝑢)= ∫ 𝑡 𝑡 0 𝑢 𝑇 (𝑡)𝑢(𝑡)𝑑𝑡; (18) RT—Regulation time which is a time considered
    from the beginning of the simulation to receiving the tolerance range ±5% of the
    expected value by the system output. Two of the presented indices are integral
    and the third one takes into account the dynamics of the control process. Therefore,
    they are sufficient to verify the control strategies of the analyzed approaches
    in this paper. 4. The Real Continuous-Time Perfect Control Despite the significant
    advantage of the recently introduced perfect control of continuous-time domain
    systems related to their high accuracy, they possess a serious drawback, which
    is related to the demand of high energy expenditure [15]. This can be noticed
    in the control Equation (4), where the term 𝑑𝑡→0 is in the denominator (Equation
    (5)). Therefore, only some particular systems can implement this type of regulation
    [15]. This paper is an extension of the mentioned approach to the wide class of
    different real objects, especially with a high inertia property. The proposed
    new approach consists of determining the feasibility of the energy injection required
    in the control process. Certainly, this signal, for an arbitrarily control process,
    depends on the difference between the initial and the expected value. Nevertheless,
    within a fixed reference value, it can be limited. One of the approaches to achieve
    this is the selection of appropriate values of the degrees of freedom in some
    inverse process (see Remark 2). In some cases, it is possible to reduce the control
    energy even by 80% according to the following performance index [18]: 𝐽(𝐮, 𝐱 𝟎
    ) = min 𝛽 [[−( 𝛽 𝐓 (𝐂𝐁 𝛽 𝐓 ) −𝟏 𝐂𝐀− 𝐁 𝐑 𝐌)]𝐱(𝐭)] 𝐓 ·[−( 𝛽 𝐓 (𝐂𝐁 𝛽 𝐓 ) −𝟏 𝐂𝐀− 𝐁
    𝐑 𝐌)]𝐱(𝐭). (19) Unfortunately, not all plants have such high reduction possibilities.
    Moreover, even the limitation at the mentioned level may also not be a remedy,
    due to the finite efficiency of the actuator system [18]. Therefore, the approach
    presented in this paper is to limit the control signal energy at the expense of
    extending regulation times. Hence, after revealing the restrictions and saturations
    of the controlled system, the maximum efficiency of the actuators 𝐮 𝐦𝐚𝐱 (𝑡) must
    be specified. This can allow us to determine the appropriate partial reference
    value 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 (𝑡) , which finally leads to the total reference value, which will
    be explained in the following paragraphs. In order to determine the new control
    law, taking into account all the above, let us rewrite Equations (4) and (5) into
    the following statement: 𝐮 𝐦𝐚𝐱 ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )= [− (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐂𝐀− 𝐁 R 𝐂 R 1 𝑑𝑡 [𝐂𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1
    )− 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 )] 𝐱 L ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )]𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 ). (20) According to relation: 𝐁 R
    · 𝐂 R = (𝐂𝐁) R , (21) we can rewrite Equation (20) into the new Real Continuous-Time
    Perfect Control law: 𝐮 𝐦𝐚𝐱 ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )=− (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐂𝐀𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )− 1 𝑑𝑡 (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐂𝐱( 𝑡
    𝑘−1 ) 𝐱 𝐿 ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )          𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 + 1 𝑑𝑡 (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 (
    𝑡 𝑘 ) 𝐱 𝐿 ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )          𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 =[− (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐂𝐀− 1 𝑑𝑡 (𝐂𝐁)
    R 𝐂]𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 ) + 1 𝑑𝑡 (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 ). (22) It is easy to prove that the
    introduced new approach is correct and useful. For this reason, let us transfer
    the appropriate phrases to the other side and right-multiply them by the expression
    𝑑𝑡𝐂𝐁 . In that case, we receive: 𝑑𝑡 1 𝑑𝑡 𝐂𝐁 (𝐂𝐁) R      𝐈 𝑛 𝑦 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡
    𝑘 )=𝑑𝑡 𝐂𝐁𝐮 𝐦𝐚𝐱 ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 ) + ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑑𝑡 𝐂𝐁 (𝐂𝐁) R      𝐈 𝑛 𝑦 𝐂𝐀+𝑑𝑡 1 𝑑𝑡 𝐂𝐁
    (𝐂𝐁) 𝑅      𝐈 𝑛 𝑦 𝐂 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ 𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 ). (23) Then, the form of the partial
    reference value is as follows: 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 )=𝑑𝑡 𝐂𝐁𝐮 𝐦𝐚𝐱 ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )+[𝑑𝑡𝐂𝐀+𝐂]𝐱(
    𝑡 𝑘−1 ). (24) At the same time, based on Equation (6), the following expression
    is true: 𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘 )=𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )+ 𝐱 ˙ ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )𝑑𝑡. (25) After taking Equations (1)
    and (22) into account, we receive the subsequent relation: 𝐱 ˙ ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 ) =𝐀𝐱(
    𝑡 𝑘−1 )+𝐁[[− (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐂𝐀− 1 𝑑𝑡 (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐂]𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )+ 1 𝑑𝑡 (𝐂𝐁) R 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 )].
    (26) Now, multiplying Equation (25) by the matrix 𝐂 , we obtain the output equation
    according to Equation (1): 𝐲( 𝑡 𝑘 )=𝐂𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘 ). (27) Ultimately, considering the
    above Equations (25)–(27), we obtain the following expression: 𝐲( 𝑡 𝑘 ) =𝐂𝐱( 𝑡
    𝑘−1 )+𝐂 𝐱 ˙ ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )𝑑𝑡=𝐂𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )+𝐂𝐀𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )𝑑𝑡−𝑑𝑡 𝐂𝐁 (𝐂𝐁) R      𝐈 𝑛𝑦
    𝐂𝐀𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 ) −𝑑𝑡 1 𝑑𝑡 𝐂𝐁 (𝐂𝐁) R      𝐈 𝑛𝑦 𝐂𝐱( 𝑡 𝑘−1 )+𝑑𝑡 1 𝑑𝑡 𝐂𝐁 (𝐂𝐁) R 
        𝐈 𝑛𝑦 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 )= 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 ). (28) As can be seen from the above
    equation, knowing the capabilities of the control system and the behavior of the
    state variables, it is possible to determine the value of 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 (𝑡) , which
    the system can receive after one simulation step time equal to 𝑑𝑡 . Hence, the
    searched final reference value can be determined by the following relationship:
    𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 (𝑡)= 𝐲 𝟎 + ∫ 𝑡 𝑠 0 ( 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘 )− 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 ( 𝑡 𝑘−1 ))𝑑𝑡, (29) where 𝐲
    𝟎 stands for the initial output of the system. In order to establish that the
    proposed approach is correct, let us now consider simulation studies in Section
    5, in order to finally move onto a sensor-aided plant and to verify the practical
    operation of the real-life system in Section 7. 5. Simulation Studies In this
    section, the results of the simulation studies of the new introduced RCTPC algorithm,
    for the objects presented in the earlier paragraphs (Section 3.5.1 and Section
    3.5.2), have been given. Due to verification reasons, other classical control
    types mentioned before have been also used, to compare the quality of the new
    approach. 5.1. The Cascade Multi-Tank System Control The objective of controlling
    the system of interconnected tanks was to maintain the liquid level in the middle
    tank at the reference level equal to 𝐻 2 = 0.25 m (see Figure 3). For this reason,
    we assumed appropriate parameters represented by 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 , 𝐶3 (valve settings
    can be found in Appendix A), whereas pump flow q was the variable in the control
    process. Therefore, depending on the type of control used, different settings
    were adopted. Figure 3. Geometry of the tank in which the water level was maintained—dimensions
    given in cm (source: authors). In the case of fluid height adjustment using the
    LQR without an integral action, the following settings have been assumed: 𝐑=1
    and 𝐐=1.705 . The implementation of the LQR with an integral action received the
    settings: 𝐑= 800, 𝐐= 600, and 𝐊 𝐢 = 10 −2 . For new RCTPC, as in other cases,
    the initial value of the middle tank was 𝐲 𝟎 = 𝐻 20 =0 m. The time step was 𝑑𝑡=1·
    10 −3 s and depending on the pump parameters, the partial reference value was
    assumed at 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 = 10 −5 m. The simulation studies of stabilization of the liquid
    height of the second tank have been performed for each of the introduced approaches.
    Some of the results for the time domain plot are presented in Figure 4, while
    the used quality criteria are analyzed in the next section. Figure 4. Control
    process of the filling of the second tank (source: authors). 5.2. The Two-Level
    Thermal Object Control The purpose of controlling a two-level thermal object was
    a obtaining the indoor room temperature at a value of 𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑡 = 25 °C. For this
    reason, the appropriate heat power 𝑄 ℎ had to be selected. As it results from
    the characteristics of the room (see Figure 5), the whole heating process has
    an effect on the attic temperature, which on the other hand, has an effect on
    the temperature being regulated in the internal room. For simulation studies,
    it has been assumed that the temperature of both rooms has an initial value 𝑇
    𝑖𝑛𝑡0 = 𝑇 𝑎𝑡𝑡0 = 0 °C. Meanwhile, a disturbance of the control process is the external
    temperature of the system with the value 𝑇 𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 0 °C. Figure 5. Interior temperature
    control (source: authors). In the same manner as for the multi-tank system, simulation
    studies have been performed for three control strategies including the new introduced
    one in this paper. In the case of temperature control using the LQR controller
    without an integral action, the following parameters have been assumed: 𝐐=0.889·
    10 −3 , and 𝐑=3.195· 10 −7 . The LQR control with an integral action has been
    accomplished with the settings: 𝐐=6· 10 1 , 𝐑=1· 10 −4 , and 𝐊 𝐢 =5· 10 1 . For
    all types of control, the initial temperature was 𝐲 𝟎 = 𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑡0 = 0 °C. Using the
    new RCTPC algorithm, the partial reference value was raised with the time step
    𝑑𝑡=1· 10 −3 s by the gain 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 = 1· 10 −4 °C, until the final reference value
    𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐟 = 25 °C was reached. The results of the simulation studies concerning the
    temperature control of a two-level thermal object in time domain are presented
    in Figure 5. Subsequently, other performance indices have been analyzed in the
    next section. 6. Discussion on the Obtained Simulation Results The received results,
    through the prism of the values obtained in Table 1 and Table 2, indicate that
    the RCTPC has great control potential. The innovative real perfect approach was
    able to address the task of regulation in the best manner. The worst results in
    terms of the control accuracy have been achieved by the classic LQR control system.
    This also applies to the control time, where the differences between the classical
    controller and the controller with an integrating action were significant. As
    it can be seen, adding an additional integrator to the LQR-based control made
    it possible to reduce the settling time of the system and its accuracy in relation
    to the setpoint at the input. However, more energy expenditure was required to
    drive the system. In conclusion, the used indices confirmed that the innovative
    real perfect control approach works and outperforms the classical ones. The mentioned
    algorithm makes it possible to obtain the reference value in a much shorter time
    and with a smaller error than other controls that have been considered until now.
    Moreover, as it can be seen in the simulation figures, the derivative of the signal
    for controlling the system by LQR is greater than the RCTPC control, which means
    that the new approach has no maximum values. Thanks to this strategy, it is able
    to provide a margin for signal growth, which minimizes the saturation phenomenon.
    On the other hand, it also means that it can increase the RCTPC control results
    by increasing the partial reference value 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 (𝑡) . Table 1. The results of
    the quality criteria for the cascade multi-tank system control. Table 2. The results
    of the quality criteria for the two-level thermal object control. Figure 6 seems
    to better describe the results of Table 1 and Table 2. Figure 6. Graphical presentation
    of Table 1 and Table 2 (source: authors). At this point, we end the part focused
    on the simulation studies. The next part of this paper is devoted to the verification
    of the newly developed algorithm in the real-life systems. 7. The Sensor-Aided
    System—A Real experiment Setup After a successful verification of the RCTPC strategy
    in simulation cases of earlier sections, let us switch to a real experiment. For
    this reason, a sensor-aided system in the form of a servomechanism didactic set
    has been investigated. The considered device, presented in Figure 7, was connected
    with a computer to an installed Matlab/Simulink environment. Including a measurement
    card, such as a structure, gives possibilities to measure the value of the angle
    and rotational speed, as well as to implement the control algorithm. Figure 7.
    The examined modular sensor-aided servomechanism (source: authors). In the conducted
    study, a model of the object linearized at the operating point was also used.
    This strategy was necessary from the point of control view. Therefore, it was
    necessary to consider two main equations of the DC motor (see Figure 8) describing
    the electrical (Equation (30)) and mechanical (Equation (31)) parts of the model
    in the following manner [47]: 𝑣(𝑡)=𝑅𝑖(𝑡)+ 𝐾 𝑒 𝜔(𝑡), (30) and 𝐽 𝜔 ˙ (𝑡)= 𝐾 𝑚 𝑖(𝑡)−𝛽𝜔(𝑡),
    (31) where the parameters used in the model are gathered in Table 3. Figure 8.
    Diagram of DC motor [47]. Table 3. The parameters of the sensor-aided servomechanism
    system [47]. Combining the above Equations (Equations (30) and (31)), the subsequent
    function has been obtained [47]: 𝑇 𝑠 𝜔 ˙ (𝑡)=−𝜔(𝑡)+ 𝐾 𝑠𝑚 𝑣(𝑡), (32) where 𝑇 𝑠
    = 𝑅𝐽 𝛽𝑅+ 𝐾 𝑒 𝐾 𝑚 a𝑛𝑑 𝐾 𝑠𝑚 = 𝐾 𝑚 𝛽𝑅+ 𝐾 𝑒 𝐾 𝑚 . (33) Going further, the transfer-function
    of system angular velocity and angular position are first- and second-order inertia,
    respectively. This fact can be described in the following manner [47]: 𝐺(𝑠)= 𝜔(𝑠)
    𝑢(𝑠) = 𝐾 𝑠 𝑇 𝑠 𝑠+1 , (34) and 𝐺(𝑠)= 𝛼(𝑠) 𝑢(𝑠) = 𝐾 𝑠 𝑠( 𝑇 𝑠 𝑠+1) . (35) Nevertheless,
    the new control law introduced in this paper is strictly connected with the state-space
    description. For this reason, the equations of velocity and angular position (Equations
    (34) and (35)) can be described by Equation (1), in the form of appropriate matrices,
    as follows [47]: 𝐀= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ 0 0 1 − 1 𝑇 𝑠 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ,𝐁= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ 0 𝐾 𝑠 𝑇 𝑠 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ,𝐂=𝐈,
    (36) where 𝐈 stands for the identity matrix of dimension two. The rated parameters
    proposed by the manufacturer are: 𝑣 𝑚𝑎𝑥 =12 [V], 𝑇 𝑠 =1.04 [s], and 𝐾 𝑠 =186 [rad/s]
    [47]. After an introduction of a measurement setup, we can now perform research
    studies in the next section. 8. A Real Experiment on a Sensor-Aided Servomechanism
    After introduction concerning the configuration of the system, let us focus on
    an experiment involving a real-life servomechanism. For this reason, many examination
    procedures have been carried out, mostly with different initial parameters. Nevertheless,
    in this paper only three of them have been presented. For study verification reasons,
    the authors proposed the structure of the control system shown in Figure 9. This
    approach significantly simplifies the control plant and also has a lower demand
    for the computational effort, than in the case of the use of a state observer,
    e.g., a Luenberger one. Hence, a well-chosen model for a considered system now
    is crucial. However, the state-space solution of the servomechanism represents
    rather well the real state of the system and is relatively simple to create. Therefore,
    for each of the presented experiments, the real-life object has been linearized
    at a given operating point. Figure 9. Diagram of control system (source: authors).
    Now, when the configuration of the control process is established, let us finally
    switch to the research on a real object. 8.1. The First Experiment with the RCTPC
    Law In the first experiment on a real-life sensor-aided system, the considered
    reference angle has been assumed at a value of 100°. After a linearization process
    at a given operating point and the creation of a model of the servomechanism,
    the following transfer functions have been received (see Equations (34) and (35)):
    𝐺 𝜔 (𝑠)= 173.3 1.04𝑠+1 and 𝐺 𝛼 (𝑠)= 173.3 𝑠(1.04𝑠+1) . (37) Finally, the expected
    representation in the examined case, according to Equation (1), is given by the
    following matrices: 𝐀=[ 0 0 1 −0.96 ],𝐁=[ 0 14.21 ],𝐂=[ 1 0 0 1 ]. (38) After
    a verification of the control process of the sensor-aided system, the received
    responses of the model and real-life object have been presented in Figure 10 and
    Figure 11. The first one includes graphs that show the obtained servo angle positions
    both from the model and three sample attempts to control of the object. Subsequently,
    the second one depicts the received angular velocity. Figure 10. The received
    angular position of the model and the sensor-aided object—results of the three
    attempts with 100° reference value (source: authors). Figure 11. The received
    velocity of the model and the sensor-aided object for 100° reference value (source:
    authors). The control process is characterized by a minimal inaccuracy in controlling
    the real object (Figure 10). This phenomenon is probably caused by factors such
    as measuring error of the encoder, play on the motor shaft (object wear), or inaccuracy
    in the modeling process. Nevertheless, a steady-state error of less than 0,4%
    is rather good accuracy for the first tests of the new introduced control law.
    Moreover, from the presented Figure 10, it can be seen that for all three trials
    that the real object reached the reference value much faster than the model. In
    Figure 11, a very fast increase in the angular velocity value can be noticed.
    This phenomenon is natural for CTPC and now for new established RCTPC. Furthermore,
    taking into account the characteristics of the presented control, it can be seen
    that the model has a smoother course than the sensor-aided system, which is probably
    caused by the resolution of the encoder. In the next subsection, an experiment
    with the new control law has been performed for another operating point. 8.2.
    The Second Experiment with the RCTPC Law The second experiment with the new Real
    Continuous-Time Perfect Control has been performed for the reference angle value
    of 300°. The object linearization has been executed in the same manner such as
    in the previous Section 8.1. In the examined case, the received gain value was
    𝐾 𝑠 =185 , while the parameter 𝑇 𝑠 remained unchanged. Therefore, for the considered
    system, the appropriate angular velocity and angular position transfer-functions
    take the following form: 𝐺 𝜔 (𝑠)= 185 1.04𝑠+1 and 𝐺 𝛼 (𝑠)= 185 𝑠(1.04𝑠+1) . (39)
    Meanwhile, the matrices in the state-space representation are as follows: 𝐀=[
    0 0 1 −0.96 ],𝐁=[ 0 14.82 ],𝐂=[ 1 0 0 1 ]. (40) After studies are performed on
    a sensor-aided system, the received results of the RCTPC algorithm have been presented
    in Figure 12 and Figure 13. The accomplished verification confirms the previously
    presented advantages and disadvantages of the new control law dedicated to the
    real-life objects. Figure 12. The received angular position of the model and the
    sensor-aided object—results of the three attempts with 300° reference value (source:
    authors). Figure 13. The received velocity of the model and the sensor-aided object
    for 300° reference value (source: authors). In the future research effort, the
    control structure form Figure 9 should be slightly changed to receive feedback
    from the real-life object as well as the model. This approach should erase the
    revealing steady error of control process. To confirm the usefulness of the new
    RCTPC algorithm, the classical PID control is presented in the next section. This
    comparison should clarify any doubts related to the advantages of the new perfect
    control dedicated to the real-life objects. 8.3. Experiment with PID Regulator
    To compare the research performed in the previous two subsections, the PID regulator
    has been selected. This approach has been chosen due to the fact that this type
    of control has been provided by the manufacturer of the considered servomechanism
    real-life object. Therefore, for each reference angle considered in previous studies,
    one test with the PID regulator has been performed. The system has been controlled
    according to Figure 9, which means that this control is performed in the same
    manner as in the case of the perfect control algorithm, which enables the research
    to be unambiguous. The received results for the reference values 100° and 300°
    have been depicted in Figure 14 and Figure 15, respectively. The mentioned graphs
    are intended to provide a comparative analysis between the new perfect control
    versus the control dedicated by the manufacturer. Thus, it was decided to perform
    only one test for each of the two reference values of the angular position. Figure
    14. The received angular position of the the sensor-aided object for 100° reference
    value (source: authors). Figure 15. The received angular position of the the sensor-aided
    object for 300° reference value (source: authors). The received results presented
    in whole Section 8 should carefully be reviewed in terms of performance indices.
    Therefore, the next paragraph of the article will provide an effective overview
    and discussion of the achieved outcome. 9. Discussion on the Obtained Sensor-Aided
    System Control Results The results obtained during the research studies have been
    subjected to the performance indices. Moreover, the used ISE quality index has
    been considered in three different configurations. In the first one, the error
    between the real-life object (signal from the sensor) and the reference value
    has been measured. In the second one, the error of the model control, whilst in
    third one, the difference between model and sensor-aided system has been taken
    into account. These approaches make it possible to receive three types of analyzed
    errors 𝑒 𝑟 (𝑡) , 𝑒 𝑚 (𝑡) , 𝑒 𝑐 (𝑡) for the mentioned structures. The results obtained
    on this basis are presented in Table 4, whereas their selected graphical instances
    are depicted in Figure 16. Figure 16. Graphical presentation of Table 4 (source:
    authors). Table 4. The results of the performance indices. The differences in
    the results of the quality criteria for the real object result from the factors
    mentioned in the previous section. Moreover, an increase in the ISE and RT errors
    is visible with an increase in the angle reference value. It is a natural phenomenon
    resulting from the integral nature of the revealed inaccuracies. Comparing the
    perfect control system with a dedicated PID controller, a clear conclusion has
    been drawn. The RCTPC algorithm guarantees a better control of the angular position
    of the servo in terms of the ISE criterion. This is due to the lack of oscillations
    that could be observed in the PID-oriented control. Simultaneously, the RT performance
    index turned out to be better for the classical regulation. Hence, it can be seen
    that in the new introduced approach, the used safety margin can be reduced by
    increasing the value 𝐲 𝐩.𝐫𝐞𝐟 (𝑡) . This operation should shorten the control time
    while increasing the control energy consumption. However, as the example of the
    PID controller demonstrated, the aforementioned energy requirement is feasible
    in practice. Therefore, the discussed case warrants further research studies.
    10. Conclusions and Open Problems In this paper, the new perfect control law devoted
    to the continuous-time physical objects has been introduced. The presented approach
    guarantees an appropriate regulation of plants having high inertia and characterized
    by the control signal limitation property. In order to verify such a behavior,
    a set of the real-life-originated numerical tests has been conducted under the
    research studies. Moreover, this article constitutes a first attempt toward the
    implementation of the perfect control in the sensor-aided systems. Henceforth,
    a simple control structure, which successfully reduces the computational burden,
    can be effectively employed. Having the experience gained from the practical research,
    the key open problems have been formulated. Firstly, it would be interesting to
    examine the discussed perfect control algorithm in the context of the Luenberger
    state observer application. Secondly, in order to address a problem covering the
    transition between the continuous- and discrete-time plants resulting from some
    digital operations, a new perfect control law defined in the discrete-time domain
    should be invented. In the end, these challenges warrant further in-depth research
    investigations. Author Contributions Conceptualization, P.M. and D.P.; methodology,

    1 INTRODUCTION In the future, with the advent of Industry 4.0, computers will
    be able to interact and make decisions without human intervention. The combination
    of web physics system, the Internet of Systems (IoS) and Internet of Things (IoT)
    allows Business 4.0 to become a better industry. The manufacturing industry is
    busy converting goods, materials or products into new products. Plants, mills,
    or factories that produce products for general consumption are often owned by
    manufacturers. Machinery and tools are often used in the manufacturing process.
    This includes food, chemicals, textiles, machinery, and equipment.1 It contains
    all the refined metals and minerals extracted from the ores. This includes wood,
    timber, and wood products. Production is the production of materials using labor,
    machinery, equipment, chemical or biological processing or work. This is the essence
    of the second sector of the economy. The term can cover a wide range of person
    behavior, from handicraft to high-tech, but it is also often used for manufacturing
    mean, in which raw materials are converted into large-scale finished goods. Such
    products are available to other manufacturers of other complex products.2 The
    IoT model, first introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1998, has paying attention a lot
    of notice in education and manufacturing. By incorporating mobile adapters into
    short gadgets and everyday distances, IoT allows a new dimension of communication
    between people and objects, giving a whole original measurement to the world of
    in sequence and communiqué.3 There is no doubt that this has a huge impact on
    many aspects of daily life and the behavior of potential users. From a private
    consumer perspective, the most obvious outcome of IoT is employment and the domestic
    sector.4 In this regard, appropriate living conditions, smart homes, offices,
    hygiene and modern training are just a few examples of the situation in which
    a new model will play an important role in the future. Similarly, from the point
    of view of business customers, very clear results can be equated with areas such
    as automation, industrial construction, logistics, business process management,
    and intelligent transportation of people and goods.5 Many scientific endeavors
    in the manufacturing sector reflect such an impact on IoT technologies. The Organizes
    information in a process environment related to the assembly of IoT large aircraft
    components.6 Process automation uses a general application model and IoT framework
    to simplify the process environment. The increasing impact of IoT on enterprise
    systems (ES)7 for modern manufacturing domains was discussed. The relationship
    between IT infrastructure and enterprise organizations was examined to identify
    technical gaps in companies'' adoption of IoT policies as IT infrastructure. The
    analyzed IoT technology applications are considered within the framework of cloud
    computing (CC)8; CC & IoT based cloud manufacturing (CMFG) service system (also
    known as CCIODCMFG) and its structure.9-11 Based on IoT, an intelligent concept
    of production sources and available architecture was developed and proposed. Its
    key technologies are described in the context of cloud-based building systems;
    a prototype has been developed to change attitudes.12 The evolution of the industrial
    ecosystem is related to the advancement of information technology (IT) systems.13
    Product communication, processing, usage logic and decision making are the factors
    that support the development of production methods. In addition, companies rely
    heavily on a variety of professional IT tools and solutions to manage different
    positions in their industry.14 Today, the rapid growth of miniature systems and
    the general interest in global inventions are leading to the next generation of
    industrial habitats that can use low power networks to monitor and control operations.15
    Most of these systems work with modern microelectronics and wireless data communications.
    Some technologies such as wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs)16 are
    increasingly used in industrial processes to monitor and control industrial processes
    and to detect short circuits containing energy at short distances.17 The most
    effective use of an IoT-enabled product is direct data reporting. It allows users
    to make accurate decisions based on such data.18 Big Data Analytics is the process
    of evaluating various databases, methods, contacts, market trends, and other useful
    information that allow companies to make informed decisions.19 This includes the
    processing of any information that is considered to refer to an item or person,
    such as a user ID or age. The largest data analysis will be used in the operation
    of the most important construction plants.20 Our contributions: A hybrid machine
    learning technique is proposed for IoT enabled industrial monitoring and control
    system (IoT-HML) to overcome problems in both information security issues with
    accurate monitoring and control system. The cat induced wheel optimization (IWO)
    algorithm was used for clustering which consists of cluster formation and CH selection
    process. The cuckoo search algorithm was utilized for the optimal best path computation
    among multiple paths. A coach and player learned neural network (CP-LNN) is used
    for monitoring the industry and preventing accidents by basic control strategies.
    The rest of this research is as follows. Section 2 discusses the recent literature
    works. Section 3 states the problem, and Section 6 demonstrates the proposed work.
    Section 13 illustrates the results and discussion of the research work. Finally,
    Section 20 summarizes the research. 2 RELATED WORKS Christou et al.21 presented
    the architecture, design, practical implementation, and evaluation of an end-to-end
    platform that addresses the challenges. Selim et al.22 explored an analytical
    study of detecting anomalies, malicious activities, and cyber-attacks in a cyber-physical
    of critical water infrastructure in the IIoT infrastructure. Selim et al.23 developed
    a Machine Learning Model for Malicious Activities Recognition in Water-based Industrial
    Internet of Things (MARWIIoT). Vakili et al.24 developed different machine learning
    algorithms to the dataset and it was found that AdaBoost has better accuracy and
    performance compared to other algorithms and when it comes to deep learning CNN
    had the best accuracy compared to other ones. A secure demand-side management
    (DSM) engine was proposed using machine learning (ML) for the Internet of Things
    (IoT)-enabled grid.25 An open-source technology based smart system to predict
    the irrigation requirements of a field using the sensing of ground parameter like
    soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with the weather
    forecast data from the Internet.26 Patel et al.27 developed a scaled-down prototype
    of an IoT-enabled datalogger for photovoltaic system that is installed in a remote
    location where human intervention was not possible due to harsh weather conditions
    or other circumstances. Ahmed et al.28 aimed to examine the convergence of blockchain
    technology and artificial intelligence, a unique driver towards technological
    transformation in intelligent and sustainable IoT applications. 3 PROBLEM METHODOLOGY
    AND SYSTEM MODEL 3.1 Problem methodology The robust overall structure of the IoT
    Industrial Control System is determined by a reliable operating module that measures
    reliability and controls for optimal performance. Wang29 Sensitive environment
    is very difficult for IoT. The cluster-based routing system used to ensure the
    reliability and security of a data source maintains the routing protocol efficiently
    and reliably. Parallel node display is recommended for scenes with multiple malicious
    nodes. Abnormal attacks disturb the Bayesian dynamic balance between the striker
    and the detection node. Industry 4.0 further weakens manufacturers of current
    challenges and makes it easier to adapt to changes in the market. This will accelerate
    innovation and make it more customer-oriented, leading to faster design processes.
    It is important to focus on monitoring and controlling the production system before
    complex accidents occur. Industrial IoT is defined as a network of devices, machinery
    and sensors connected to each other and to the Internet, with the purpose of collecting
    data and analyze it to apply this information in continuous process improvement.
    In this industrial IoT applications, it provides access to real-time supply chain
    information by tracking materials in transit, products, and equipment as they
    move through the supply chain. Through effective reporting manufacturers are able
    to collect and feed the delivery information into systems like ERP, PLM, and so
    forth. Industrial IoT does not replace, but works together with automation, human-machine
    interface (HMI), MES, ERP, enterprise manufacturing intelligence (EMI), and analytics,
    adding benefits. The fourth industrial revolution has been underway for a while
    now. People call it digital transformation, Industry 4.0, digitalization, or just
    smart manufacturing. Regardless of the name, all the new technology coming from
    this revolution is driving real economic benefits and helping fuel a big boom
    in manufacturing around the world. Most manufacturing companies are already undertaking
    some kind of Industry 4.0 project or are planning to in the very near future.
    The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), artificial intelligence (AI), augmented/virtual
    reality (AR/VR), digital twins, digital threads, cloud and edge computing, and
    a whole lot more are all part of Industry 4.0, but maybe none more so than the
    IIoT. When an existing intelligence system fails to respond to a pre-disaster
    situation, its rapid operation can cause the server''s IoT components to crash
    for years. Moreover, an industrial control system facing information security
    problems in recent times because of the nature of IoT, which affects the evaluation
    of abnormal predication. To overcome above research gaps, we shift to industrial
    4.0, which combine IoT and mechanism learning for industrial monitor and organize.
    We propose a hybrid machine learning technique for IoT enabled industrial monitoring
    and control system (IoT-HML). The main goal of the research is to overcome the
    issues of information security and control systems by developing a hybrid machine
    learning technique. Here, we concentrate both information security issues with
    accurate monitoring and control system. The major donations of planned IoT-HML
    technique are summarizing as follows: The first section of planned IoT-HML scheme
    is to introduce the cat induced wheel optimization algorithm for cluster formation.
    The process consists of clustering and cluster head (CH) selection. The source
    node forward information to destination through CH only which avoids the unwanted
    data loss and improve the security, because the information travel through trusted
    path. For route selection process, we utilize the cuckoo search algorithm to compute
    the optimal best path among multiples. In second section, we illustrate a coach
    and player learned neural network (CP-LNN) for monitoring the industrial and prevent
    from accidents by basic control strategies. Finally, the proposed IoT-HML system
    can evaluate with different set of data''s to prove the effectiveness. 3.2 System
    architecture of proposed IoT-HML system Figure 1 shows the proposed system model.
    The system consists of an industrial environment. In order to detect the temperature,
    pressure and the speed three different sensors are used, that is, temperature
    sensor, pressure sensor and speed sensor. For monitoring the data transmission
    data monitoring center is used. The vehicles will take data from the base station
    and it is send it to nearby nodes. The terminal ranges are used to identify the
    nearest node location. The nodes are clustered. The paths are formed between the
    nodes for the transmission. From the multiple nodes aggregated nodes are identified.
    The access point, base station is there for proper data transmission. The data
    that are sending from the sensors are given to the cloud platform after that only
    it will be given to the monitoring unit. When the sensor wants to send the data
    to the vehicle it will check for the vehicle which is free by sending the request
    to the base station. The base station will check for the free vehicle. In case
    if the entire vehicle is busy then the sensor will hold the data in the sensor
    node until the base station send the acknowledgement related to the free vehicle.
    At that period of time the internal process of the industry will be in an interrupt
    form. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint System model of proposed IoT-HML
    system 4 HYBRID MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE FOR IoT ENABLED INDUSTRIAL MONITORING
    AND CONTROL SYSTEM (IoT-HML) 4.1 Clustering using cat induced wheel optimization
    (IWO) The purpose of clustering is to divide the whole network into separate parts
    to ensure the reliability and the security data. Then, select the cluster heads
    with unknown nodes at the nearest cluster host terminal and its cluster number.
    Data clusters arise from the need to find interesting formats or groups of similar
    features in a given data set. Using the IWO algorithm, the security and the reliability
    data are transferred from the source node to the destination which is selected
    on the basis of the cluster head process. Clustering is a compilation process,
    so every member of a division has some similarities based on some similarities.
    A cluster is a set of objects, their similarity or proximity is bundled. A Clustering
    aim is to collect data/objects in clusters, as each cluster contains similar data.
    This technique does not contain any information about the cluster or group method,
    which is why clusters should be included in the supervised study. Cluster complex
    and linearly indistinguishable data sets, without prior knowledge of the number
    of groups in nature. Unlike most existing clustering techniques, specific algorithms
    do not require prior knowledge of the data. In super wide wheels that are wider
    than other rover wheels, the shape of the profile can significantly change the
    performance of the drive or reduce side curves with lateral deflection. To get
    the optimal shape of the wheel with more traction and resist lateral overturning
    with less torque, following objective functions are defined. The required torque
    of motor for generating the wheel angular velocity of nominal magnitude is minimized
    by the first objective. In the real case the angular velocity is generated by
    the torque of motor . The fraction of the real torque and the nominal torque of
    angular velocity is represented in the first objective function. (1) where, denotes
    the torque of the ideal magnitude. The tractive and torque relation can be denoted
    by the effective radius of the wheel. The radius of the effective is equal to
    the radius of the wheel average in the ideal slip less rigid contact. Thus, the
    2nd objective function is, (2) The rover platform depends on the third objective.
    To avoid the slipping of lateral, the force of lateral is used as a parameter
    when the rover front axis is rotated. The force of lateral resists against the
    rover steering once the front axis is fixed. Then, the third objective function
    is, (3) The total function of the objective is defined as sum of these functions
    as (4) where, indicates the coefficient of priority which evaluates the significance
    of the function in design. The seeking mode and the tracing mode are the two modes
    in the behavior of the cat characteristic which is used to solve the different
    optimization problem. Cats spend a lot of time relaxing, but are always wary of
    their surroundings in seeking mode. (5) On updating the values, the equation is
    (6) The tracing of target is modeled in tracing mode as follows: (7) Calculate
    the Informative score by using the equation, (8) The working function of cluster
    formation using cat induced wheel optimization is given in Algorithm 1. Algorithm

    5 Compute the and 6 Evaluate the 4.2 Optimal best path using cuckoo search algorithm
    Data can go through many intermediate paths and need to select the best optimal
    nodes for data transfer. These optimal nodes contribute to the optimal operation
    of the network. Extensive work has been done to improve the efficiency of network
    routing and to identify the best route to prevent congestion. There are many techniques
    for finding optimal path, here we are describing about cuckoo search algorithm.
    The main function of the router is the best way to send packets. To determine
    the best path, the router searches its routing list for a network address that
    matches the packet''s target IP address. The idea of this method is based on the
    spread of parasites on some cuckoo. There are two instances of cuckoo eggs in
    other bird cages. The high quality egg nest selected for the new generation coincides
    with the ability to lay a new egg cuckoo. First, it usually emerges from the nest
    if it cannot find the first-born cuckoo eggs or extra little birds of the crowd.
    Second, it fixes and removes the host bird. The Levy plane has an imperative responsibility
    to explore the given investigate space: (9) (10) Levy flight creates the individual
    value j, where is the velocity. The new and best position of the individual j
    are and . The value of coefficient range is 0 and 1. Until the current iteration
    the current best solution . The distribution coefficient range is of 0 and 3.
    1.5 is set to typical. To use the search space described below, the Exotic Egg
    Detection Technique uses random technology: (11) (12) By random walk technique
    the individual j creates the velocity value of . Z is a binary matrix defined
    by Z = RAND(C, M). The individuals chosen randomly are . The below equation describes
    the solution of candidate in continuous domain: (13) where, is the solution j
    (j = 1, 2, … , M) in the population. The number of binary bits represents the
    problem in control variable in the binary version. The following equation represents
    the candidate solution. (14) The below equation determines the dimension of problem,
    that is, (15) The continuous variable in the double domain is represented by digit
    of binary bits . Based on the equation, 50% has value 1 and remaining has value
    0. (16) When deciding on a binary domain candidate, each person should switch
    to a nonstop domain to appraise health performance. This revise uses the technique
    of converting an individual scale binary domain into a continuous domain. The
    binary domain is represented by which determines the quantization value by the
    following equation. (17) The quantization value of in the range of [0, 1]. The
    bit n = 1, 2, … , with status BIT[n]. The limits of with continuous domain value
    of is calculated as follows: (18) Equations (21-23) updates the new position (19)
    (20) where, transfer function is a transport meaning which maps speed values into
    likelihood standards. The new and current position are and . is the inverse of
    . Like the Levy''s aviation system, EPCSA''s discovery of a strange egg creates
    another new solution for the population. (21) Then, in order to generate new solution
    approximately the best explanation of all time, you need to configure the existing
    solution for all control bits starting the worth of 0 to 1 or vice versa. (22)
    (23) (24) So far there are two conventional transmission functions with S shaped
    and V shaped. (25) (26) The control variable position is updated by Equation (20)
    (27) (28) The individual position is updated by combining Equations (25) and (26)
    the position is set by 0 or 1. Therefore, cuckoo search algorithm selects the
    appropriate transmission function to solve the NR problem (Algorithm 2). Algorithm

    learned neural network (CP-LNN) Here is a specific training program for coaches
    and players with intermediate networks. During the training phase, the coach and
    player networks teach simultaneously with the confirmation system. The major idea
    of our training program is those coach and player recession networks use similar
    skin tone beginning communal conversion network so that the player relapse system
    can simply copy the coaching network. These training programs allow a system of
    players to maintain excellent performance when they have a limited number of options.
    On the using the concept of the CP-LNN algorithm the data are monitored in the
    industrial field and also prevent the accidents using the basic control strategies.
    Figure 2, at the end of the transition layers the two network branches are divided
    into coach and player intermediate network. The fully related coating of the back
    coach complex is called the T-FC. The associated layer on the player log complex
    is called STD-FC, which has a 1 to 1 jump and a universal standard pool. FIGURE

    model Features are integrated into the coach latency network and the player latency
    network. Note that the functions of the coach and the player''s intermediate network
    are encoded with the usual layers of data verification. Completely associated
    layer play an important role in the FLD complex as the CNN feature makes the map
    an important strategy. As a result, collective training requires loss target operations,
    so the STD-FC layer is the D-FC layer. To do this, according to the proposed law,
    the loss is divided into three functions. The first branch is for the Coaches
    Regression Network and the next branch is for the Player Regression Network. All
    network are taught from the end with three loss functions . The second loss function
    , is responsible for reducing the error production of the player''s middle network.
    The third loss function, , is difference flanked by the loss output vectors T-FC
    and STD-FC. In preparation, the loss reflected in all three sub-networks: unit
    switching network, coach regression network, and player regression network. The
    three terms of loss terms can be printed as follows: (29) (30) (31) where, n is
    the digit of teaching imagery, j is the directory of an input picture, is position
    fact facial marker organize and is the input picture. The g (.) is the meaning
    of common problem complex parameterized by . b (.) is the meaning of the coach
    regression network parameterized by . g (.) is the occupation of the player regression
    network parameterized by . And is output vector of S-FC and is that of STD-FC.
    The Algorithm 3 represents the working function of the coach and player learning
    neural network. Algorithm 3. Working function of coach and player learning Input

    set these settings correctly. Through training, the trainer should be trained
    regularly as the regression network should perform well. If the coach''s intermediate
    net is not working properly, the player''s intermediate net is not working properly.
    Therefore, we fixed from opening to end to attain the best presentation. Then,
    we augment from 0 to 1 steadily (i.e., , where s is sth epoch), which they shape
    to the coach and player regression network and communal difficulty network together.
    If we originally set , the coach regression network presentation is drenched before
    it achieves the best presentation. Thus, at the beginning of the preparation,
    the overall transformation network and coaching network dominate. Once that, the
    players'' intermediate network is gradually trained. Algorithm 3 describes the
    operation of the coach and the player learning model. Indicates the type of in-depth
    machine training of the neural network when multiple layers of input are used
    for computer tasks for optimal performance. This means that the data is very constructive
    and concise. We teach the player the correct knowledge by integrating the knowledge
    of several coaches to improve accuracy after the abstract. We have optional several
    authors within the framework of information filtering, the logits vector shaped
    by the player network for an input video represented by , where the dimension
    of vector is the number of categories d. the SOFTMAX layer converts the logits
    vector to a probability distribution describes as, (32) where (33) On the other
    hand, the logits vector bent by the coach network for an input video is represented

    parameter called warmths, the widespread SOFTMAX layer FSOFTMAX converts the logits
    to soft probability distribution (34) (35) The first objective function w1 minimizes
    the cross entropy with the soft labels and the soft probability produced by the
    player model. is computed by FSOFTMAX with the same warmth t as the coach model,

    state of art data gathering technique are cluster based and AODV routing. The
    different metrics are worn to examine the presentation of proposed steering such
    as delay, energy consumption, throughput, data delivery ratio, and data loss ratio.

    is normal or abnormal. When the abnormal is detected it shows that the test is
    positive, that is, among the total abnormal, it shows the correct amount of positivity.
    (41) Specificity is used to predict whether the given sample is normal or abnormal.
    When the abnormal is absent, it shows that the test is negative, that is, among

    technique is proposed for IoT enabled industrial monitoring and control system
    (IoT-HML) to overcome problems in both information security issues with accurate
    monitoring and control system. Clustering uses the cat induced wheel optimization
    (IWO) method for cluster formation and CH selection. The cuckoo search method
    computed the optimal path among multiple paths. A CP-LNN monitored the industry
    and avoid accidents using basic control strategies. The proposed C-IWO-based routing
    protocol outperformed the existing AODV protocol in terms of 19.2% average delay,
    12.7% average energy consumption, 10.26% average throughput, 3.8% average delivery
    ratio, and 16.33% average loss ratio, respectively. In addition, the proposed
    CP-LNN technique'' attained 98.5% accuracy, 97.3% sensitivity, 98.2% specificity,

    compared to state-of-the-art classifiers. This research may be enhanced in the
    future by analyzing more complicated industrial networks. CONFLICT OF INTEREST

  description: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that can be employed to
    monitor several sectors, mostly precision agriculture, where environmental data
    can be used to better manage resources, reduce costs, and improve the use of natural
    resources. This work proposes the application of cloud-based IoT for monitoring
    irrigation water in rice fields. Southern Brazil was chosen as a case study because
    it suffers from water pollution problems due to urban activities, coal mining,
    and the inflow of saline water into the Araranguá River estuary. All these factors
    can compromise the water quality for irrigation. The presence of salt in irrigation
    water can compromise rice growth, making its monitoring essential for successful
    cultivation. Currently, the rice farmer needs to travel to the riverbank to assess
    the water quality using a manual sensor. This procedure demands time and resources
    and is not always efficient. The technology helps indicate whether the water is
    of quality to irrigate crops, helping the farmers decide whether to use that water
    to irrigate their fields. The solution is based on low-cost wireless sensor network
    devices, with subsequent transmission of data from the gateway using the network
    mobile phone cloud. Data collected were also accessed by the smartphone through
    a mobile application. This system was implemented for testing in the Araranguá
    River estuary, southern Santa Catarina, Brazil. Also, it appears as an option
    for farmers who need to monitor the quality of the water channel of the crop,
    thus avoiding the loss and reduction in crop productivity because the system can
    be continuously monitored and show notifications to the user. The highlights of
    this work were prototyping a complete solution to help the farmer using a smartphone
    application.

    that can be employed to monitor several sectors, mostly precision agriculture,
    where environmental data can be used to better manage resources, reduce costs,
    and improve the use of natural resources. This work proposes the application of
    cloud-based IoT for monitoring irrigation water in rice fields. Southern Brazil
    was chosen as a case study because it suffers from water pollution problems due
    to urban activities, coal mining, and the inflow of saline water into the Araranguá
    River estuary. All these factors can compromise the water quality for irrigation.
    The presence of salt in irrigation water can compromise rice growth, making its
    monitoring essential for successful cultivation. Currently, the rice farmer needs
    to travel to the riverbank to assess the water quality using a manual sensor.
    This procedure demands time and resources and is not always efficient. The technology
    helps indicate whether the water is of quality to irrigate crops, helping the
    farmers decide whether to use that water to irrigate their fields. The solution
    is based on low-cost wireless sensor network devices, with subsequent transmission
    of data from the gateway using the network mobile phone cloud. Data collected
    were also accessed by the smartphone through a mobile application. This system
    was implemented for testing in the Araranguá River estuary, southern Santa Catarina,
    Brazil. Also, it appears as an option for farmers who need to monitor the quality
    of the water channel of the crop, thus avoiding the loss and reduction in crop
    productivity because the system can be continuously monitored and show notifications
    to the user. The highlights of this work were prototyping a complete solution
    to help the farmer using a smartphone application. Downloads Download data is

    Download conference paper PDF 1 Introduction The high demand and limited supply
    of oil palm fruit production have urged many oil palm plantation companies to
    intensify the technology implementation to boost productivity whilst preserving
    efficiency. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), one of the biggest
    oil palm stakeholder groups, indicated that optimizing productivity and efficiency
    in oil palm fruit production has been their priority since 2018 [1]. As the global
    leader in Crude Palm Oil (CPO) production, Indonesia and Malaysia control approximately
    86% of the global CPO supply [2]. It elevates CPO to a vital component of Indonesia’s
    and its consumer countries’ food security [3]. Furthermore, the rapid demand growth
    has been fueled by the demand for biofuel raw materials as well as other less
    harmful alternative raw materials [4]. The issue for Indonesia and Malaysia is
    to boost national oil palm fruit production while avoiding deforestation. A thorough
    examination of several production metrics is required to identify the potential
    for improving the productivity of existing plantings and ongoing replanting programs
    [5]. The significant current gap between an oil palm plantation’s potential and
    actual production indicates that there is still scope for further improvement.
    However, relying simply on conventional human intuition to make modifications
    to a large plantation area is regarded as risky [6]. To tackle this problem, Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) technology offers an objective and rational perspective of complex
    production systems through data-driven analysis. Several AI implementations have
    been employed to generate valuable information in increasing oil palm productivity.
    One of them is classifying the ripeness level of oil palm fresh fruit bunches
    (FFB) [7, 8]. AI can also analyze the availability and loss of nutritional components
    using Android-based applications [9]. Another advantageous implementation is the
    identification of oil palm leaf deficit [10], fertilization recommendation system
    [11], computer vision-based for object counting [12], irrigation mapping system
    [13,14,15], and weed detection [16, 17]. One of the most pressing problems is
    projecting oil palm plantation productivity using machine learning to provide
    comprehensive insight into the critically necessary materials to minimize future
    resource loss [18,19,20]. Numerous studies on oil palm yield prediction using
    machine learning have also been attempted using a combination of associated factors.
    These studies concluded that climatic data, such as rainfall indices, wind speed,
    and relative humidity, had a significant impact on oil palm yield projection [21,22,23].
    However, there are many other factors that determine oil palm yield forecast,
    such as fertilizer content, planting density, crop age, soil type, and so on [24,25,26].
    A comparison of two machine learning models to regress annual oil palm yield is
    reported in this research. Correlation analysis was first conducted to select
    variables that are highly correlated with the output and use them to train the
    models, which include meteorological, soil, and plantation data. Min–max normalization
    and z-score standardization were also performed on the data to further assist
    the models in learning. The findings of this comparative research will subsequently
    be linked to a feature in an oil palm plantation management recommendation system.
    2 Related Works Among various ML algorithms, the Bayesian Networks (BN) and Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) have been widely adopted in predicting oil palm yields despite
    the limited number of studies in this field. Chapman et al., had utilized such
    models to predict oil palm yield using meteorological data in the form of total
    rainfall up to two years prior to the year of harvest, fertilizer usage, soil
    conditions, tree age, and chemical contents in frond 17 of the oil palm trees.
    Both models obtained mean R2 values of 0.6, indicating that they performed quite
    well. It was also implied that the rainfall conditions brought about a significant
    influence on the number of yields [21]. In a similar research, such findings were
    also found where usage of rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, light intensity,
    and wind speed data in the past 12 months to train ANNs allowed them to obtain
    up to 0.4707 MSE in forecasting oil palm yield [23]. In one of the most recent
    studies, other ML models such as XGBoost and Random Forest (RF) obtained outstanding
    results with more than 0.7 R2 values in predicting oil palm yield based on satellite
    multispectral images [22]. ANN had also been used in another similar study with
    the Non-linear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) to predict oil palm yield using
    air pollution data as inputs in addition to the meteorological dan plantation
    area data. Trained and tested on data collected from nine states in Malaysia,
    both the ANN and NARX models obtained R2 values larger than 0.87 [27]. Such results
    imply that the plantation area and air pollution data may also be highly influential
    albeit the importance of each feature may differ according to the location of
    the oil palm plantation fields as climate changes played major parts in both regional
    and global oil palm yields [26]. This means that the ML models used had to be
    fine-tuned according to the data for each different plantation region according
    to the geographical and climatic characteristics. 3 Theoretical Statistics 3.1
    Min–Max Normalization Normalization is the process of converting a set of numerical
    values into a standard range of values, such as (0–1) in the case of min–max normalization.
    It is mainly aimed to transform features to a similar scale and minimize the risk
    of some features dominating the contributions to the output, which is formulated
    as follows: $$ X_{\\text{norm }} = \\frac{{X - X_{\\min } }}{{X_{\\max } - X_{\\min
    } }} $$ (1) where \\(X_{{\\text{norm}}}\\) denotes the normalized value, \\(X\\)
    is the original value, \\(X_{\\min }\\) is the minimum value of the variable,
    and \\(X_{\\max }\\) is its maximum value. 3.2 Z-score Standardization The standardization
    of data is the transformation of features into their standard scores also known
    as z-scores, which is done by subtracting from the mean of the whole data and
    dividing by the standard deviation. The z-score can be calculated as follows:
    $$ X_{{\\text{stand}}} = \\frac{{X - X_{{\\text{mean}}} }}{\\sigma } $$ (2) where
    σ is the standard deviation of the variable. Similar to normalization, its main
    purpose is to make sure that all features have equal probabilities of contributions
    when the ML model is trained, as features with larger range of values may significantly
    be more impactful to the model’s predictions. Under the assumption that the data
    follow the Gaussian distribution, this method has been regarded as suitable to
    use. 3.3 Model Evaluation Method The regression models were evaluated by calculating
    the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and coefficient-of-determination
    (R2). The equations behind these metrics are presented in Eqs. (3)–(5), respectively.
    $$ MAE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n {\\left| {y_i - \\hat{y}_i } \\right|} $$
    (3) $$ RMSE = \\sqrt {\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n {\\left( {y_i - \\hat{y}_i }
    \\right)^2 } } $$ (4) $$ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{{\\sum_{i = 1}^n {\\left( {y_i - \\hat{y}_i
    } \\right)^2 } }}{{\\sum_{i = 1}^n {\\left( {y_i - \\overline{y}} \\right)^2 }
    }} $$ (5) where \\(y_i\\) and \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) denote the ground truth and predicted
    values, whereas \\(n\\) is the number of samples. In addition, the prediction
    latency of the models was also calculated to evaluate their computational complexity.
    4 Dataset and Experiment Setup 4.1 Dataset Description The dataset used was a
    compilation of oil palm yield records in 2021 from plantation areas with two different
    soil types in Riau province, Indonesia. The data was then integrated with the
    regional meteorological data from 2017 to 2021. The rainfall indices and annual
    total rainy days in the region were included as the independent variables. The
    dataset contains 2472 samples with 15 input variables and the total number of
    yields in the current year as the dependent output variable, with 2 samples containing
    null “yield_1” values, 1976 samples used as the training data, and 494 samples
    as the testing data. Table 1 presents the full descriptions of each variable in
    the dataset. Table 1 Description of each feature in the dataset, the asterisk
    (*) denotes the output variable Full size table 4.2 Experiment Setup The prediction
    models, SVR and KNN, were constructed using the Scikit-Learn library of the Python
    programming language. The two models were selected for this study as SVR has been
    known to be an accurate algorithm that is less likely to overfit, whereas KNN
    is one of the lightest ML models with high accuracy [28, 29]. To minimize error
    outcomes, feature selection and data scaling were conducted beforehand. Feature
    selection was intended to filter out input variables that are less relevant to
    the output [30]. In this research, the selection was performed based on Pearson’s
    correlation coefficient and p-values, which examines the relationship between
    two continuous variables where higher values indicate stronger positive correlations.
    The coefficient was selected as the independent and dependent variables are numerical
    and indicated to have linear correlation [31]. Only variables with absolute Pearson
    correlation scores > 0.1 and p-values > 0.05 were used as input variables for
    the ML models. Feature scaling using normalization and standardization was performed
    on the selected variables. The SVM and KNN were then trained using the scaled
    variables and compared to those without scaling, producing three models for each
    ML algorithm that are trained on: (1) unscaled data, (2) normalized data, and
    (3) standardized data. MAE, RMSE, and \\(R^2\\) were used in evaluating the models’
    performance. It should be noted that all models used the default configurations
    provided by the Scikit-Learn library without fine-tuning. 5 Results and Discussions
    5.1 Correlation Analysis for Feature Selection By using the “yield” variable as
    the dependent variable, the correlation analysis was performed on the 15 independent
    variables. Table 2 presents Pearson’s correlation coefficients and the p-values
    of these variables. It can be seen that “yield_1” and “crop_age” have the highest
    positive correlation to “yield” with p-values < 0.05, meaning that the positive
    correlations are statistically significant, and the variables may greatly affect
    the output. Therefore, the eight variables with absolute Pearson correlation scores > 0.1
    and p-values > 0.05 were selected as inputs for the ML models. The eight variables
    were marked by the asterisk (*) symbol in Table 2. These variables were then used
    in the modeling process using KNN and SVR algorithms. Table 2 Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient and p-value of each input variable to the output Full size table The
    correlation coefficient threshold value of 0.1 in this study is less rigorous
    than in other previous studies [32, 33]. As such, half of the available independent
    variables were used. However, it can still be inferred that meteorological factors
    still possess significant impacts on the overall oil palm yield, which aligns
    with the findings from previous studies [18, 21]. Additionally, the soil types
    also affect the yields, where the area of mineral soils is positively correlated,
    and the area of peat soils is negatively correlated. Overall, the number of yields
    in the previous year had the most impact. 5.2 Experiment Results and Discussions
    Earlier studies had proven that both standardization and normalization of data
    are highly beneficial in improving the accuracy of ML models [34, 35], especially
    in cases where the variables possess different ranges. Standardization may be
    more suitable when the data follows the Gaussian distribution. From the visualization
    provided in Fig. 1, the data closely follows the Gaussian distribution albeit
    slightly left-skewed. However, deeper analysis is required to observe whether
    standardization can provide the best results. Fig. 1 Visualization of the distribution
    of the yield data Full size image Table 3 displays the evaluation results of the
    KNN and SVR models, which shows that the standardized and normalized training
    data produce better results than the one without the feature scaling approach.
    On the KNN model, standardization allows the model to obtain 0.8171 R2 value whereas
    the usage of normalization resulted in 0.7975 R2. On the contrary, the SVR model
    obtained 0.8709 and 0.8617 R2 on the standardized and normalized data, respectively.
    Therefore, it can be concluded that standardization is more suitable for this
    case with the average R2 value of 0.844 on both models which may have been caused
    by the normal distribution of labels. However, the prediction latency of KNN is
    almost 10-times better than SVR. Table 3 Evaluation results of the KNN and SVR
    models Full size table When comparing the two models, SVR is clearly superior
    to KNN on both the normalized and standardized data in terms of errors. On the
    standardized data, SVR obtained 18.73% and 15.99% lower MAE and RMSE, respectively
    compared to KNN. The lower RMSE also indicates that the difference between the
    ground-truth yields and predictions made by the SVR are generally lower, which
    can also be inferred from the scatterplots in Fig. 2. From the scatterplots, it
    is apparent that the errors of the SVM model are less dispersed and generally
    closer to the red regression line, which illustrates the perfect projection where
    the predicted value perfectly fits the actual value. In addition to the difference
    in MAE, RMSE, and R2 values, the scatterplots further prove that the SVR is superior
    to KNN. However, it should also be noted that hyperparameter fine-tuning was not
    conducted in this study. Further fine-tuning may result in better prediction results
    for both models in future studies. Fig. 2 Scatter plot of yield predicted value
    against the actual value of A KNN and B SVR models trained on the standardized
    data Full size image 6 Conclusion In this research, KNN and SVR were utilized
    to predict oil palm yields using various inputs including meteorological, soil,
    and plantation data. Through the correlation analysis process, variables with
    high correlation to the output were selected. It was found that the total yield
    in the previous year is the most influential variable, followed by the crop count
    and area of each soil type. By using z-score standardization, both ML models managed
    to obtain outstanding accuracy with SVR being the superior model, achieving 0.8709
    R2 value with 1.372 MAE and 1.8025 RMSE. The low dispersion of prediction data
    points in the SVR regression model indicates that it can provide generally accurate
    predictions. In future studies, hyperparameter fine-tuning can be performed to
    further improve the models’ performance. In addition, deeper analyses of the independent
    variables’ influence on the yield data can also be studied to assist oil palm
    planters in extracting insights to increase the annual oil palm yield. References

    Abstract IoT based agriculture (Ag-IoT) is an emerging communication technology
    that is widely adopted by agricultural entrepreneurs and farmers to perform agricultural
    agro-chores in the farm to improve productivity, for better monitoring, and to
    reduce labor costs. However, the use of the Internet in Ag-IoT facilitates real-time
    functionality in an agriculture system, it can increase the risk of security breaches
    and cyber attacks that would cause the Ag-IoT system to malfunction and can affect
    its productivity. Ag-IoT is overlooked in cyber security parameters, which can
    have severe impacts on its trustworthiness and adoption by agricultural communities.
    To address this gap, this article presents a systematic study of the literature
    published between 2001 and 2023 that discusses advances in Ag-IoT technology.
    The subjects included in the study on Ag-IoT are emerging applications, different

    agriculture (Ag-IoT)IoT ApplicationIoT ArchitectureEmerging Cyber Attacks and
    Cyber CrimeDigital Forensics 1. Introduction The Globle Food and Agriculture Report
    of the UN [1] mentioned that the food requirement was expected to increase by
    70% more to meet the need for an estimated population of 10.1 billion by 2050.
    Furthermore, it is observed that the 26.7% global population and approximately
    58% of the Indian population depend on agriculture and agriculture to make their
    livelihood. The economic survey of India 2020–21 report stated that in FY20, India
    recorded total food grain production at 296.65 million tonnes [2]. This high dependency
    makes agriculture a significant factor in improving higher yields and better quality
    and production. Volatility in food prices, climate change, and timely harvest
    forecasts are crucial parameters to counteract. These parameters have a major
    impact on the economy and are closely related to issues such as malnutrition and
    undernutrition [3], [4], [5]. [6] expect that by 2050 the global population of
    9 billion people will face the challenge of feeding. It is essential to ensure
    food security, sustainable agricultural practices, and efficient resource management.
    Traditional farming techniques, while reliable, are no longer capable of meeting
    the demands of the world. To address this, a technological revolution is taking
    place that combines the ancient practice of farming with the modern technology
    of the Internet of Things (IoT). This combination, known as Ag-IoT, is a major
    shift in agriculture that could change the way we cultivate, manage, and secure
    our food resources. This revolution is known as Agriculture 5.0. It is a modern
    technique used in precision farming that uses computers and electronics for autonomous
    decision support systems. It uses technologies such as IoT, robotics, and AI [7].
    Ag-IoT uses interconnected devices, data analytics, and automation to optimize
    agricultural operations. It can be used to monitor soil conditions in real-time,
    remotely control irrigation systems, track livestock health, and predict crop
    yields with accuracy. Currently, many developed and developing countries, such
    as China, India, the United States and Israel, are widely using IoT-based agriculture
    (Ag-IoT) [8]. Many IT organizations such as Google, Microsoft, Watson, IBM, Intel,
    Jasper, CISCO, Dell, HPE, Hello Tractors, Farm 2050, and Qualcomm are continuously
    developing Ag-IoT solutions that would have a huge economic impact [9]. Ag-IoT
    is used to increase the quality and quantity of agriculture production, so agriculture
    can be monitored or operated from remote locations, and Ag-IoT can take action
    according to the requirements of plants and animals. It reduces monitoring and
    labor costs [10]. Ag-IoT is seen as a technological lifeline, providing farmers
    and agribusinesses with unprecedented insights into their ecosystems. It has the
    potential to revolutionize crop management, animal husbandry, supply chain logistics,
    and more by enabling a data-driven approach to agriculture. Ag-IoT is helpful
    for various farm activities such as crop monitoring, automated irrigation system,
    insect/pest monitoring, food warehousing, supply chain, livestock management,
    livestock disease monitoring, dairy management, etc. The authors of [11] also
    estimate 6.2 trillion business each year, which may bring about a revolution in
    the agricultural domain. At present, more than 26 billion smart devices are in
    circulation, while a forecast says that this number will triple in the next 5–6
    years [12]. Karl Steinbuch, a German computer science pioneer, predicted that
    in a few decades computers would be integrated into almost every industrial product.
    Recent estimates suggest that the value of the Internet of Things (IoT) market
    is projected to reach 157 billion USD in 2016 and 771 billion USD by 2026. Cisco
    has predicted that by 2030, 500 billion objects will be connected to the Internet
    [13]. Technologies such as GPS (Global Positioning System), sensor networks, the
    Internet, and remote sensing are commonly used in Ag-IoT [14], [15]. However,
    the journey to realize the full potential of Ag-IoT is fraught with risks of cyber
    attack and cyber crime due to the lack of standardization of IoT architecture
    and security. This could disrupt agricultural production, which is heavily reliant
    on the Ag-IoT system, leading to economic losses for individual farmers and agribusinesses.
    If this destruction or obstruction of the functionality of the Ag-IoT system is
    nationwide, it could result in an increase in hunger, inflation, and a decrease
    in GDP. Generally, the agriculture sector is overlooked when it comes to security
    and privacy. If any security incident occurs in Ag-IoT, various challenges may
    arise due to the lack of a standard forensic investigation model available for
    Ag-IoT. However, the integration of IoT into agriculture brings with it a range
    of complex challenges and opportunities. This study embarks on a comprehensive
    exploration of Ag-IoT and its application, with a focused lens on different IoT
    architectures, emerging cyber attacks and cyber crime, and challenges in incident
    response in digital forensics investigation. It also brings complexity in terms
    of infrastructure, data security, and the need for digital forensics. To successfully
    traverse this terrain, it is essential to investigate the architectural frameworks
    that underpin Ag IoT systems, understand the intricate web of security issues,
    and examine emerging trends in digital forensics tailored for agricultural contexts.
    1.1. Organization of this article The purpose of this article is to provide a
    comprehensive overview of Ag-IoT, with a particular emphasis on three key aspects:
    architecture, emerging cyber attacks and cyber crime, and challenges in forensics
    investigation. In the following sections, we delved into the architecture of Ag-IoT
    systems, exploring the complexities of their design and implementation. Subsequently,
    there is covered the multifaceted area of cyber attack and cyber crime, looking
    at the difficulties and solutions related to protecting Ag-IoT ecosystems. Finally,
    we investigated the relatively unexplored field of digital forensics in Ag-IoT,
    examining its potential to ensure accountability and resilience within these systems.
    As we traversed this landscape of technology and agriculture, we invite our readers
    to join us in the exploration of Ag-IoT, a revolutionary marriage of tradition
    and innovation that holds the key to transforming the future of agriculture and
    ensuring the survival of generations to come. This article presents a review of
    different articles on IoT and Ag-IoT devices supporting agricultural use, focusing
    on applications, emerging Cyber Attack and Cyber Crime (CACC), and Digital Forensics
    (DF) challenges. Agribusiness people are increasingly relying on automation to
    keep track of and oversee agricultural activities such as watering, feeding, growth,
    and health monitoring. However, automated agriculture and Ag-IoT, in particular,
    are vulnerable to security threats. The predicted growth of Ag-IoT solutions could
    lead to an increased risk of cyber crime. Sensitive data processed through Ag-IoT
    could be a lure for cyber criminals. They can target Ag-IoT for financial gain,
    cyber warfare, activist/political purposes, or to obtain intellectual property
    and technological advancements. This study aims to review the literature in the
    context of CACC and the challenges in DF in Ag-IoT. The objectives of this article
    are to review the following. Ag-IoT Ecosystem Comparison among various Ag-IoT
    architectures Five layer Ag-IoT architecture Different kinds of Ag-IoT applications
    and their solutions Emerging Cyber Attack and Cyber Crimes (CACC) and Cyber Security
    Challeneges in Ag-IoT Digital Forensics challenges and proactive measures. The
    review article is organized as follows: Section 2 includes the review selection
    methodology. The Ag-IoT and its applications are discussed in Section 3. Section
    4 contains a review of various articles which have been published on the Ag-IoT
    architecture, the Ag-IoT application, available solutions for existing vulnerabilities
    in Ag-IoT, existing and emerging cyber attack and cyber crimes Section 5 related
    to Ag-IoT, and the challenges of Digital Forensics (DF) Section 6 in Ag-IoT. Our
    views on DF challenges are discussed in Section 7 and the article is concluded
    in Section 8. 2. Review selection method In this article, we follow a systematic
    literature review (SLR) based article selection methodology as shown in Fig. 1.
    In this figure, the first step is to select reputed journals. The primary focus
    of the search was on publishers of scholarly research, including Elsevier, IEEE
    Xplore, Springer, Wiley, MDPI, Inderscience, Taylor & Francis, and journals listed
    by UGC-CARE. We have also considered a few whitepapers, statistical survey papers,
    and websites to refer to Ag-IoT based tools. The second phase of the SLR is for
    considering articles published only between 2001–2023. The third step includes
    the article if it is related to IoT/Ag-IoT. The fourth phase aims to verify the
    relativity of the articles with respect to the architecture, security, CACC, and
    DF challenges of Ag-IoT or IoT. Articles that met these criteria were considered
    in this review of the literature. We have considered various Ag-IoT relevant keywords
    to find relevant articles. The keywords considered in this article were (“Internet
    of Things” OR “Ag-IoT” OR “IoT based Agriculture Tools OR Appliance” OR “Unmanned
    Ground Vehicle (UGV)” OR “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)”) AND (“Internet of Things
    based Agriculture” OR “Precision Farming” OR “Smart Agriculture” OR “e–Agriculture”
    OR “Smart Farming” OR “Smart Livestock Management” OR “Livestock Disease Monitoring”
    OR “Smart Cattle Management” OR “Food Monitoring” OR “Crop Monitoring” OR “Plant
    Monitoring” OR “Smart Irrigation” OR “Automatic Irrigation” OR “Disease Monitoring-Detection”)
    AND (“Digital Forensic in IoT” OR “Challenges OR Issue in IoT”). Using the SLR
    method, we identified 132 references for the study, which included 88 articles
    from journals, 22 conference articles, 8 book chapters, 4 white papers, and 10
    websites. These articles were analyzed, evaluated, and classified according to
    their relevance to the Ag-IoT and agriculture applications of the method used

    (Ag-IoT) Ag-IoT is an automated system in which devices communicate over the Internet
    and function according to the requirements of the environment. Ag-IoT allows devices
    to operate automatically so that agriculture chores can be remotely monitored
    and controlled remotely. Ag-IoT employees the Internet to connect sensors, a single-board
    computer (SBC), and servers. Sensors sense the state of the agricultural environment
    (plants, crops, animals, and their relative parameters such as soil moisture,
    soil nutrient ingredients, pest images, water quality, climate, humidity, temperature,
    crop status, animal health, and reproductive system). Some of the sensors used
    in Ag-IoT are soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, distance sensors, direction
    sensors, livestock temperature sensors, humidity sensors, ultrasonic sensors,
    acoustic sensors, leaf sensors, stem sensors, and fruit size sensors. These sensors
    have specific functionality in IoT applications such as identifying the environment
    temperature, crop status, soil preparation, irrigation, pest monitoring and detection
    [9]. The detected data are sent to the SBC. SBCs such as Node MCU, Arduino, Raspberry
    Pi, etc. controls and operates the smart system according to threshold values
    and updates agriculture status with the help of the Internet. Ag-IoT applications
    have become very popular among farmers due to their efficiency and productivity.
    Its solutions are designed to help farmers improve time efficiency, productivity,
    and better monitor daily agricultural tasks. Ag-IoT applications can manage land,
    animals, crops, and farms without human intervention and are also known as smart
    agriculture [34], precision agriculture [35], [36], digital agriculture [37],
    smart agriculture [38], [39] or digital agriculture [40]. Table 1. Ag-IoT solutions

    the Niger research project to highlight the development of smart cities based
    on IoT and smart villages to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-2030)
    11 and 9 for revolution through smart cities and smart villages in Niger. Ag-IoT
    applications are classified into two categories: crop and livestock applications.
    The classification of holistic Ag-IoT applications and various Ag-IoT solutions
    is tabulated in Table 1. Crop-based Ag-IoT applications mostly include smart irrigation,
    frost protection, compost management, pest control and monitoring, weed detection,
    chemical control, seedbed preparation to reseeding, yield analysis and mapping,
    arable farming, spraying, vehicle and machinery control, soil quality, agricultural
    drone or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and smart greenhouse. Ag-IoT application
    for livestock management includes livestock monitoring, livestock identification,
    milking automation technology, early disease detection, offspring management and
    care, and smart poultry farming. Based on usage, Griffith et al. [43] classified
    Ag-IoT applications into two types, indoor (that is, crop beds, greenhouse, hydroponic)
    and outdoor (arable land, orchard). Other works include smart greenhouses based
    on IoT and precision agriculture [44]. Bhattacharya and Debashish [45] presented
    a detailed review of Ag-IoT applications. Virk et al. [39] focused mainly on holistic
    definitions of Ag-IoT and its applications, such as crop health, weeding and spraying,
    seed sowing, preparation of seedbed for reseeding, planting from air, harvesting,
    drones for yield analysis, and mapping. Islam et al. [46] described the types
    of agricultural UAV (harvesting UAV, spraying UAV, mapping UAV, and detection
    UAV), including their application area in terms of seeding, planting seed, monitoring,
    weed detection, mapping, infestation, and spraying pesticides/fertilizers, forecasting,
    and control. Nayak et al. [47] have discussed Ag-IoT applications that have utilized
    modern technologies such as WSN, RFID, cloud computing, and end-user applications.
    These Ag-IoT devices are found to be automotive, cost-efficient, and time-efficient
    for farmers. The authors have also presented Ag-IoT technologies and the classification
    of Ag-IoT applications for monitoring activities. The applications are irrigation
    and water quality monitoring, soil monitoring, weather monitoring, farm monitoring,
    disease and pest control, greenhouse production, automation and precision, agricultural
    machinery, and crop management, with other applications in smart farming such
    as smart cattle farming, smart poultry, smart hatchery, smart aquaponics, and
    smart beehive monitoring. Saiz-Rubio et al. [48] conducted a comprehensive study
    on crop data management in agriculture 5.0. The authors displayed a tabular analysis
    of various crop data management applications and their main features based on
    parameters, namely software, company, headquarters, and relevant features. Terence
    et al. [49] discussed various solutions used in Ag-IoT. Some of the Ag-IoT solutions
    include water quality monitoring, farmland monitoring system, greenhouse environment
    monitoring system, automated hydroponic system, smart mushroom farms, smart vegetable
    storage, smart vineyard monitoring system, and others. They compared Ag-IoT monitoring
    and control systems based on parameters such as gateway, sensor and actuator,
    communication system, storage, user interface, nature of the experiment (outdoor/indoor),
    plant name/type, and advantages of the existing system and weaknesses in the current
    system. Some states in India such as Orisa, Madhya Pradesh, and Kerela faced the
    problem of crop vandalization. To deal with this situation, an Ag-IoT based alarming
    system has been designed which activates an alarm whenever the smart camera detects
    any suspected activity due to trespassing of the elephants. [50]. 4. Ag-IoT architecture
    In general, there are five layers in Ag-IoT architecture, that is, the cloud layer,
    the application layer, the fog layer, the edge layer, and the physical layer [51],
    [52], [53]. The ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union Telecommunication
    Standard) proposed a four-layer architecture for holistic IoT [54]. The layers
    in the architecture presented in this article are the device layer, network layer,
    service support and application support layer, and application layer. The device
    layer senses data from sensors, actuators, RFID tags, and GPS in the IoT and sends
    them to the second layer. The second layer is the network layer, which is responsible
    for activities related to networking, communication, and transport. The service
    and application support layer is the third layer. The top layer is the application
    layer, which receives data from the third layer and is responsible for presenting
    the data in a user-readable format. In IoT World Forum 2014, [55] presented a
    reference model of a seven-layer IoT architecture that combined three and five-layer
    architectures. These layers are physical, connectivity, edge computing, data accumulation,
    data abstraction, application, collaboration, and processes. The physical layer
    is responsible for managing things in the IoT, while the connectivity layer handles
    communication and processing units. The edge computing layer analyzes the data
    received from the connectivity layer. The data accumulation layer serves as a
    storage for data to be received or sent. The abstraction layer performs aggregation
    and access to the data. The application layer controls, analyzes, and presents
    a report of the functionality of IoT in the current environment. Finally, the
    collaboration and process layer includes people and business processes. In the
    process of developing new architectures, Kuaban et al. [56] proposed a three-layer
    Ag-IoT architecture. The authors adopted the concept of fog computing and cloud
    computing in their architecture. The first layer is named the IoT layer, which
    includes Ag-IoT hardware such as sensors, drones, SBCs, and actuators. Sensors
    measure environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture
    and activate actuators to perform their respective functions in agriculture. The
    second is the fog layer where Ag-IoT devices are connected to gateways by LoRaWAN
    or another network. The third layer is the cloud layer, which deals with APIs
    to manage the data received from the agricultural environment. Verma et al. [57]
    proposed a four-layer-based Ag-IoT architecture. In this architecture, the perception
    layer consists of sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers. It senses data from
    an agricultural environment and forwards these raw data to the network layer.
    The network layer performs the abstraction of raw data received from the perception
    layer and transmits them to the middleware layer. It also manages resources and
    services, including a real-time database. The application layer receives data
    from the middleware layer. It contains communication protocols such as MQTT, AMQL,
    and CoAP. It receives encrypted data, decrypts it to make it user-readable, and
    stores the data on the local machine for future use. Symeonaki et al. [58], [59],
    [60] discussed a three-layer architecture for Ag-IoT. The first layer is the physical
    layer where devices such as sensors, actuators, gateway, and mobile devices are
    present to sense the data from the sensors and forward them to the middleware
    layer. The middleware layer acquires, manages, and stores the context of the data
    received from the physical layer and forwards it to the application layer. This
    layer is also responsible for providing security and privacy to the data and its
    communication over the upper layer. The upper layer named the application layer
    is centrally hosted and accessed remotely by users. Marcu et al. [52] presented
    a three-layered Ag-IoT architecture that includes a platform layer, an edge layer,
    and a communication layer. The platform layer collects raw data from Ag-IoT hardware
    by sensing the agricultural environment and sending them to the edge layer. The
    edge layer performs decision making based on data received from the platform layer
    and performs fusion and processing of the sensor data. The communication layer
    obtains data from the edge layer and establishes communication between the gateway
    and the cloud. Similarly, Vha et al. [61] also discussed the three-layer Ag-IoT
    architecture, which included a device layer, a network layer, and an application
    layer. Al-Qaseemi et al. [62] studied two types of architecture for comprehensive
    Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IoT architectures are three-layer and five-layer
    according to different IoT vendors. The authors highlighted a problem concerning
    the standardization of Ag-IoT architectures. Quy et al. [63] discussed a common
    Ag-IoT architecture. The architecture consists of three layers, namely Ag-IoT
    hardware, communication technology, and data processing and storage. Ag-IoT hardware
    included sensors, actuators, embedded system with processor, communication modules,
    memory, I/O interfaces, and battery power. The authors have discussed various
    communication technologies such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, 6LoWPAN and NFC, based on various
    parameters such as license, transmission distance, frequency, and data rate. Alharbi
    et al. [64] presented the drawbacks of traditional cloud-based architecture, and
    to overcome them, proposed an edge and fog computing architecture for Ag-IoT.
    The weakness of the existing system is high energy consumption during agricultural
    data transfer from and to the cloud and high network traffic. The proposed architecture
    reduces the load on the cloud layer, minimizing energy consumption, network traffic,
    and latency for Ag-IoT applications and services. It consists of four layers,
    namely: IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. The IoT sensor
    layer is responsible for all Ag-IoT hardware deployment. The edge layer performs
    the computation of data received by the sensors/actuators. The fog layer is responsible
    for the process and analyzes complex data received from Ag-IoT sensors through
    the edge layer. The cloud layer offers increased scalability and the ability to
    access computing resources such as storage, networking, and processing on demand.
    Sinha et al. [65] proposed a user-centric Ag-IoT architecture that consists of
    three layers: perception layer, communication layer, and control layer. The perception
    layer is responsible for the acquisition of data through sensors. The communication
    layer transmits the acquired data to and from the network. The control layer works
    as a decision maker and performs analysis of the acquired data. Mohapatra et al.
    [66] proposed Ag-IoT architecture based on the holistic Ag-IoT architecture. This
    proposed architecture contains six layers, namely the device layer, network layer,
    session layer, application layer, cloud layer, and business layer. The business
    layer consists of several business modules where the information can be accessed
    according to the nature of the business. The comparison in various Ag-IoT architectures
    is presented in Table 2. This table includes parameters such as the total number
    of layers used in Ag-IoT, the name of the layers, and the function of each layer.
    Based on the review of articles related to various architectures, we feel that
    a five-layered architecture as shown in the following figure could be made a standardized
    architecture. The main reason for proposing this is to overcome the issues of
    standardization of Ag-IoT architectures. This general Ag-IoT architecture is presented
    as shown in Fig. 2. Table 2. Comparison of different Ag-IoT architectures. Article

    full-size image Fig. 2. Ag-IoT Architecture. 4.1. Physical layer The Physical
    Layer is also known as the device layer/perception layer [67]. The Physical Layer
    consists of physical devices such as sensors, actuators, SBC (Single Board Computer),
    and a gateway in the farm [68]. This layer senses and collects specific agricultural
    environment data through sensors. Depending on the specific type of sensor, the
    collected data can be related to location, temperature, orientation, motion, vibration,
    acceleration, humidity, and chemical changes in the air. This data is securely
    transmitted to the next layer [69]. 4.2. Edge layer The edge layer collects raw
    data from the physical layer and passes them to the next layer. It merges all
    the incoming sensor data, processes them and activates the system according to
    the condition [52]. Some of the communication technologies, namely 802.11*, Sigfox,
    LoRaWAN, NBIoT, LTE-3GPP, EC-GPRS, WiMAX, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave, 6LoWPAN,
    and NFC used in Ag-IoT are classified according to distinct parameters such as
    licensed spectrum, transmission distance, type of network used, frequency and
    data rate [61], [63], [68], [70], [71]. Communication technology allows hardware
    (in the physical layer such as sensors, actuators, and controller) to communicate
    by wired or wireless medium [72]. According to Chanak et al. [73], low frequency
    communication (LFC) is popular in smart villages due to the lack of infrastructure.
    However, some prominent high communication technologies used in Ag-IoT is IEEE
    802.15.4, Zensy Wave, Long-Term Evolution (LTE), Long-Range (LoRa), Near Field
    Communication Ultra Wide Band (UWB), and others. These communication technologies
    help communicate hardware such sensors and actuators in Ag-IoT devices present
    in the farm. 4.3. Fog layer Fog layer is a virtual cloud that receives data from
    the edge layer and transmits it to the upper layers. Processes and analyzes complex
    data received from Ag-IoT sensors through the edge layer. It includes fog nodes
    such as gateways, routers, entry points, and distinct fog servers. The fog nodes
    are located between the end devices and cloud data centers. This layer works as
    a local cloud server. It provides intranet communication for the Ag-IoT system.
    By this means, the Ag-IoT devices communicate through low frequencies and activate
    the actuators. The raw data collected from the sensors do not need to travel frequently
    over the Internet. Hence, the concept of fog layer overcomes the drawback like
    high latency because of real-time control and mitigates security risk about data
    transmission as the Internet were acted as a backbone. [56]. 4.4. Application
    layer Application layer provides a graphical user interface of the information
    of the agricultural environment processed by the middleware layer in encrypted
    form and internally decrypts this information using software, thus storing data
    for further use. This layer consists of various communication protocols such as
    HTTP, MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, and XMPP. The application layer monitors the agricultural
    environment and suggests actions to be performed to get better throughput using
    Ag-IoT. Various Ag-IoT applications are available to manage smart farm, such as
    FarmOS, Agriinfo, and others mentioned in Table 1. 4.5. Cloud layer The cloud
    layer works as a centralized data storage for the Ag-IoT system. It receives data
    through the application layer from the fog layer and stores it for long-term usage.
    It provides greater scalability and computing resources on demand, such as storage,
    networking, and processing [64]. Data is uploaded to the cloud for data storage
    through these applications. Some cloud-based Ag-IoT platforms are AgroCloud, AT
    and M2X cloud, AWS, Azure IoT hub, Blynk, Cropinfra, Dropbox, ERMES, FIWARE, freeboard,
    Google, GroveStream MACQU, Mobius, NETPIE, Rural IoT, self-developed, SmartFarmNET,
    ThingSpeak, Ubidots, Nimbits, ThingWorx and Phytech [43], [74]. 5. Existing and
    emerging cyber attacks and cyber crime (CACC) in Ag-IoT IoT was proposed in 1990’s
    with the idea of interconnecting different electronic devices through various
    technologies. However, during the past decade, the IoT has developed rapidly without
    considering the profound security goals and challenges involved in it. Consequently,
    Ag-IoT may probably face various emerging Cyber Attacks and Cyber Crimes. According
    to Statista, by 2025 there will be 75 billion devices connected to the Internet
    of Things [75]. Due to rapid development, it implies that checking the security
    and vulnerability assessment in these devices is practically impossible. As a
    result, the absence of a complete trust zone can be detected in the microcontrollers
    used for Ag-IoT devices. Cyber attack (CA) is an attack on digital devices and
    its network to disrupt, manipulate, or destroy the services of the system. The
    intention of an attacker can be to perform data theft or malicious operations
    on the target. Cyber crime is an unlawful activity against the user’s digital
    device, network, or connected to a networked system, or its data to perform information
    theft, sabotage, disrupt, or harm. The interconnectivity of Ag-IoT devices with
    the Internet creates a risk of various CACCs in the Ag-IoT ecosystem. A senior
    vice president, Corey Reed with Deere, admitted that cyber criminals have been
    looking for farming information for their personal gain. The Ag-IoT system can
    be targeted by different means. The attackers could push sprout into a ditch or
    hedge or prevent it from working of Ag-IoT. In [76], [77], the cyber attack taxonomy
    included vectors, viruses, malware, worms, trojans, ransomware, adware, zero-day
    vulnerability, stuxnet, exploit toolkit, botnet, Man In The Middle (MITM), phishing
    and spoofing, side channel, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS/DoS), and RFID
    attacks. According to the ForeScout IoT Enterprise Risk Report by De Cesare and
    Michael [78] by 2018, two-thirds of enterprises will experience IoT security breaches.
    It has captured a broader spectrum of security vulnerabilities and attacks in
    IoT systems. Their classification is unique compared to the other classifications
    as it divides the different attacks into four distinct classes; Physical, Network,
    Software, and Encryption attacks. The same statement is true for an Ag-IoT system,
    where Ag-IoT devices can be attacked physically, in its network or in the applications.
    Similarly, attacks can be tested on encryption schemes, as Ag-IoT is implemented
    using various existing network technologies. Sinha et al. [79] discussed various
    emerging cyber attacks (CA) in Ag-IoT, respectively, to each Ag-IoT layer. Possible
    attacks on the physical layer could be autonomous system hijacking/disruption,
    irregular measurement, node capturing, and sleep deprivation. Edge-layer attacks
    for control actuator, booting, flooding, and signature wrapping attack. Network
    layer attacks could be DoS, DDoS, data transit attacks, routing attacks, signal
    disruption, Radio frequency (RF) Jamming attacks, side-channel attacks, malware
    injection, and Botnet attacks. An application layer-based CA could be phishing,
    malicious scripts, DoS/DDoS, cloud computing attacks, and cyber terrorism. Sontowski
    et al. [80] covered CA based on the network layer in Ag-IoT. These attacks are
    replay attacks on the Zigbee protocol that can create difficulties in implementing
    other protocols. The smart farm, which uses IEEE 802.11 protocol, can face attacks
    like password cracking and evil twin access point, which allows attackers to get
    credentials by creating a rogue access point, a Key reinstallation attack, which
    exploits 4-way handshake in WPA2, an ARP spoofing attack where an attacker fakes
    the MAC address of the gateway and convinces the victims to send frames to the
    fake address except the destination address and DNS spoofing attack where the
    traffic is directed to the fake website. Kumar et al. [81] discussed UAV-oriented
    cyber attacks and their consequences. UAV is an Ag-IoT automated aerial vehicle
    system used for crop monitoring, pesticides, chemical sprinkling, etc. Cyber attacks
    on UAV could be related to the integrity exploitation of UAV or Ag-IoT devices.
    The consequences of this attack can vandalize the whole standing crop in the field,
    flood the crop, and spray the pesticides in an excess quantity. If such attacks
    are widely coordinated, they can replace agroterrorism. The authors discussed
    other UAV based attacks, such as radio frequency jamming, malicious code injection,
    MITM, DoS/DDOS, ransomware attacks, etc. These attacks can manipulate communication
    devices and disturb or disrupt the functioning of Ag-IoT. Some of the other emerging
    threats include endpoint attacks, phishing, third-party attacks, supply chain
    attacks, ransomware, state-sponsored IoT attacks, threats in smart devices, and
    others. The authors also specified risks or dangers in terms of data breaches,
    data integrity, business secrets privacy breaches, risk of cryptojacking, cyberphysical
    attacks, state-sponsored attacks, hijacking, or threats to autonomous drones or
    tractors [47], [82], [83], [84]. Araujo et al. [85] described several issues in
    Ag-IoT caused by Internet connectivity for data processing and covered parameters
    based on CA in Ag-IoT. In an Ag-IoT system, at the physical layer, the emerging
    Cyber Attacks could be an unintentional physical modification in hardwired, temporary
    or permanent damage, autonomous system hijacking, autonomous system disruption,
    optical deformation, rough treatment, power depletion of battery, sensor weakening
    as per the sensor aging, node capture, adding a malicious node, and sleep deprivation.
    Some network layer-based emerging attacks could be DoS/DDoS, data transit attacks,
    and routing attacks. Emerging attacks at the edge layer can be forged controls
    for actuators, gateway cloud request forgery, forged measure injection, booting,
    unauthorized access, MITM, signature wrapping, and flooding. Similarly, cyber
    attacks on the application layer are phishing, malicious scripts, DoS, and DDoS
    attacks. Manufacturers of IoT devices often design IoTs to make them imperceptible
    to security measures, validation procedures, collection, transfer, or storage
    stages, or failure tests in the interest of production cost further elucidate
    these hidden parameters for invisible security features. The authors also proposed
    a future improvement in the outlook of enhanced security in smart agriculture
    and agriculture applications. Abdul-Ghani et al. [86] presented a literature survey
    on cyber attacks in different components of Ag-IoT. They have discussed attacks
    based on hardware such as sensors, controllers, and RFID tags. The authors also
    discussed some attacks based on protocols such as RFID, NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi,
    Zigbee, 6LoWPAN and protocols on the application layer. Yazdinejad et al. [87]
    classified cyber attacks on Ag-IoT based on the physical layer, the network layer,
    the middleware layer and the application layer. Attacks on the physical layer
    are like RF jamming, side-channel attack, etc. It aims to gather unauthorized
    information about the description of the implementation of the Ag-IoT system using
    hardware monitoring parameters such as an electric current or voltage [88]. Attacks
    on the network layer are mostly DoS, MITM, and cloud computing attacks. Data breach
    attacks are data leakage, ransomware, cloud data leakage, and misconfiguration.
    Application layer based attacks are software update-based attacks such as malware
    injection, buffer overflow, and SQL injection. Other attacks they have covered
    are cyber terrorism and invalidation, which refers to false data fabrication.
    Barreto et al. [89] are concerned that exposure of personnel’s private information,
    social engineering, cyber espionage, and agro-terrorism to any attack is a potentially
    severe threat that should be seriously and carefully considered. The possibility
    of cyber-terrorism in agriculture is known as agro-terrorism. Tzachor et al. [90]
    warn of the risk of cyber threats in Ag IoT, for automated devices based on the
    Internet, such as smart crop sprayers, drones, and UAVs in agriculture. They further
    mentioned that cybercriminals are looking to ruin the particular revenue business,
    where agriculture plays a very important role in revenue generation for the individual
    and the country. According to Boghossian et al. [91], the US Department of Homeland
    Security expressed concern about potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities in
    Ag-IoT. Their published report discussed different technologies in Ag-IoT, such
    as farm devices, location or remote sensing technologies, and machine learning.
    This report highlights hypothetical scenarios related to CACC. Similarly, Ag-IoT-based
    sensors could be the significant cause of CACC issues. The UK government and FBI
    have issued a warning that cyber criminals may take advantage of vulnerabilities
    in Agricultural Internet of Things (Ag-IoT) hardware, which is used to plant and
    harvest crops, such as automatic crop sprayers, drones and robotic harvesters,
    to disrupt the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and food production [97].
    According to an FBI report, cyber attacks in Ag IoT have slowed the agriculture
    processing system and also interrupted email communication and website-based administration.
    A cyber crime that disrupts dairy processing facilities can quickly spoil the
    result. In Michigan, there was a ransomware attack that encrypted farm computer
    systems and prevented them from accessing data on milk production and cow health.
    Where the means of cyber crime was a ransomware attack, where data was stolen
    and encrypted, and criminals demanded a ransom in exchange for the decryption
    key. Cyber criminals may view cooperatives as attractive targets due to their
    time-sensitive role in agricultural production, which can disrupt the supply of
    seeds and fertilizers if not addressed in a timely manner. Table 3. Emerging CACC

    cyber attacks have already been observed, and stakeholders faced severe consequences.
    The Mirai botnet in 2016 is an example of a DDoS attack that was launched on large-scale
    IoT devices in the smart home [98]. A malware that turns networked devices running
    Linux into remotely controlled and infects consumer electronics that are connected
    to the Internet, like IP cameras and residential routers. Similar attacks are
    possible in the context of Ag-IoT. The consequences of such attacks can disrupt
    the normal functionality of different modules of an individual Ag-IoT farm and
    can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate cyber services in other areas. The Ag-IoT
    system can be compromised and controlled using a central malicious system known
    as the Botnet of Things [99]. An attack named Night Dragon could steal a large
    amount of information from various petrochemical companies [100]. Another incidence
    of destruction was attempted using a phishing attack at a German steel mill to
    gain access to the plant production system of the mill office [101]. The vulnerabilities
    in the software of John Deere tractors could be exploited to take control of the
    tractors remotely. These vulnerabilities could be used to steal data, damage crops,
    or cause other disruptions [102], [103], [104]. In 2016, a team of researchers
    discovered vulnerabilities in the software used to monitor greenhouse gas emissions
    in the United States. Vulnerabilities could be used to falsify data or disrupt
    the monitoring system, potentially leading to inaccurate readings and decisions
    [105]. In New Zealand (2019), an attack involved the use of malware to disable
    the pest control system, allowing fruit flies to enter the country undetected,
    which took the form of a fruit fly infestation. In a Brazilian soybean farm (2020),
    attackers used malware to take control of the irrigation system of the farm, preventing
    farmers from watering their crops and causing them to die [106]. A Russian hacking
    group is involved in the use of malware to gain control of the industrial control
    systems of the power grid. This incident highlights the potential risks associated
    with Ag-IoT systems that are connected to critical infrastructure. In 2020, JBS,
    one of the world’s largest meat processing companies, paid $11 million as a ransom;
    similarly, a malware attack was able to shut down Australian and New Zealand wool
    sales [107]. AGCO, the US agricultural firm, was affected by a ransomware attack.
    President Greg Gatzke of ZAG Technical Services Inc. observed losses between $40,000
    to $200,000 caused by cybercriminals [108]. The co-founders of agricultural firm
    Muddy Machines and Chris Chavasse states that the Ag-IoT based devices can be
    attacked and hacked. Their study says that Ag-IoT is at risk [109]. In industrial
    espionage, revenge-minded employees can damage farmers by having a contract farming
    agreement with that particular company. In the case of Ag-IoT, the farmer/contractor
    may face severe loss due to linked cyber security breaches or attacks on the contract
    provider company. Subsequently, severe data loss/breaches or sabotage might be
    found in Ag-IoT. Various emerging cyber attacks, their consequences on Ag-IoT
    and their unfavorable effects on agriculture are summarized in Table 3. Classified
    attacks based on various layers of the IoT architecture are also represented in
    Table 4. Agribusiness is also suspected for possible attacks and disruptions due
    to its fragility in nature, as Ag-IoT is a hackable and crackable system. Consequently,
    as it is impossible to prevent cyber attacks on the system, including Ag-IoT,
    it is necessary to discuss various aspects related to the digital forensics of
    Ag-IoT and its challenges. In the next section, a detailed review of articles
    and work done in the field of digital forensics of Ag-IoT and challenges related
    to it are discussed. These cyber attacks have included case studies for IoT smart
    devices. In [74], the authors covered the simulation tools for the vulnerability
    assessment of holistic IoT devices, that is, Bevywise IoT Simulator, IoTIFY, CupCarbon
    U-One, Simple IoT Simulator, Mimic IoT Simulator, Cooja. To prevent cyber attacks,
    the authors suggested security measures, readiness and incident response model
    specific to Ag-IoT. 6. Digital forensics challenges in Ag-IoT Digital Forensics
    is a systematic and scientifically proven approach to the identification digital
    evidence, and its preservation, examination, analysis, and presentation [110].
    Digital Forensics is the practice of examining digital devices such as computers,
    mobile phones, PDAs, palmtops, storage devices, gaming consoles, recording devices,
    digital cameras, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices for the purpose of uncovering
    evidence. The law enforcement agencies acknowledge that modern day life includes
    a distinct of devices where the IoT is at the top of the list of digital devices
    due to easy target for the criminal activity [111]. Ag-IoT is a branch of the
    Internet of Things (IoT) that encompasses a sensor, gateway, network, the web,
    and the cloud. It inherits almost similar challenges in Digital Forensics (DF)
    to IoT. This paper reviews several articles to explore various DF challenges and
    issues in Ag-IoT. 6.1. IoT forensics challenges Stoyanova et al. [112] classified
    the most challenging aspects of IoT forensics into six categories: identification,
    collection, preservation, analysis, correlation, attack attribution, and presentation.
    These challenges are further divided into subclasses. The authors discussed DF
    challenges for generalized to IoT applications. The article discussed various
    research challenges in IoT forensics [113]. The major challenges observed by them
    are the complexity and versatility of IoT devices, lack of standard IoT architecture,
    evidence contamination due to data overwriting, and use of conventional tools
    and forensic tools. These challenges respective to each DF phases is discussed
    in the next subsection. 6.1.1. Jurisdiction Hegarty et al. [114] identified the
    challenge presented when devices cross the borderline of jurisdictions. Data from
    Ag-IoT devices and globally distributed cloud system across these borders are
    more frequently. It is unclear under which law the case should be prosecuted,
    i.e. the device jurisdiction, the attacker jurisdiction, or the data storage jurisdiction.
    For this reason, it is necessary to create an international commission that updates
    the current legislation and can define uniform procedures in IoT DF [112], [115].
    DF is an interdisciplinary investigation process where cooperation and coordination
    between nations are indeed required for transnational law enforcement [116], [117].
    The Council of Europe’s Convention on cyber crime formed a committee, “Council
    of Europe, 2001”, for harmonizing procedural and substantive laws related to digital
    crime and evidence among its signatories. The treaty commissions states to create
    standard systems of substantive and procedural laws prohibiting cyber-criminal
    conduct and investigating criminal conduct with computer devices with respect
    to each country. This treaty includes 63 signatories countries; some of these
    63 counties are USA, Canada, Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Hungary, Israel,
    and Japan. The other high-tech nations have not signed the treaty at the convention.
    Those countries include the Russian Federation, People’s Republic of China, India,
    the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mexico, Pakistan, and South Africa [114]. 6.1.2.
    Search and seizure Search and seizure is a preliminary step in any forensic investigation.
    With the help of a warrant, the digital devices present on the crime scene is
    prohibited for further use. However, detecting the presence of IoT evidence is
    quite challenging as IoT devices are designed to work passively and autonomously.
    In most cases, when an IoT device is identified, there is no documented method
    or reliable tool to collect residual evidence in a forensically sound way from
    the device [118]. The IoT stores logs and evidence on cloud too. The volatile
    nature of cloud storage is another challenge for search and seizure. Taylor et
    al. [119] suggested a standards evidence collection method should be there to
    avoid data evaporation in cloud environment. We believe that this analogous statement
    holds true for Ag-IoT DF investigations too. Beyond technical challenges, privacy
    is a significant issue to consider when analyzing and correlating collected data,
    mainly as most IoT sensors collect innate personal information [118]. 6.1.3. Identification
    Identifying evidence is a challenging task in IoT system due to its heterogeneous
    nature. A conventional devices (such as computer, laptop, mobile, or embedded
    system) stores data on a local hard disk drive, thumb drive, server, or network.
    The data might not be stored on local machines due to the very small size of memory.
    Instead, it is stored on a cloud-based system or remote server. Subsequently,
    one has to decide the types of acquisition methods can such as manual, physical,
    logical, file system, chip-off, or micro-read be utilized [117]. The complexity
    of storage media, there is a need to search for data beyond traditional extraction
    methods [120]. In the term of IoT based DF investigation, the question arises
    of whether to investigate devices or data in the case of cloud or else the devices
    may be viewed as a metadata aspect of the data or if vice-versa is also true.
    Cloud computing architectures (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) allow data fragmentation and
    distribution among different countries and continents [117]. As Ag-IoT is one
    of the applications, Ag-IoT may face the same challenge in the identification
    phase of the investigation. Lutta et al. [121] reviewed various limitations and
    challenges in IoT forensics. Those limitations include impracticability of cloning
    of all data by a service provider, requirement of excess time in data acquisition,
    and other challenges. 6.1.4. Preservation The acquisition process should maintain
    the integrity of the evidence collected. For preservation, hashing and write-blocking
    technique are frequently used for conventional devices. Prevention and hashing
    appears as problem in the context of IoT system. The problem here is the lack
    of available tools that can prevent accidental changes in IoT evidence [114].
    According to best practices, the evidence identified and collected must be protected
    from logical data damage. Logical data damage includes data modification, corruption,
    and erasing, whether done deliberately or by mistake. However, with limited storage,
    the useful life of the data is short in IoT devices. In IoT devices, the logical
    data can easily be lost due to its fragile nature. Overwritten data can result
    in the loss of evidence. It may raise the challenge of non admissible evidence
    in the court of law [117]. Looking at the challenges involved, it becomes important
    to decide whether to create an image of an endpoint or to acquire it physically.
    In the case of computer crimes, the standard practice is to create a working copy/image
    of the storage media and seal the actual media to avoid accidental alteration
    in the actual evidence. Since the endpoints in IoT crime scenes, excluding computers
    and smartphones, may store minimal or no information, creating an image of those
    IoT nodes is complicated. If a component stores some information, then it should
    be technically possible to create an image of that device. There are suggested
    a way is to create images from available sources [118]. 6.1.5. Examination After
    the data collection, the task of finding the information from the collected evidence
    is known as the examination. This phase deals with the data profiling and the
    encryption or decryption process. Various tools such as encase, Cellebrite, FTK,
    UFED, OSForensics, Prodiscover and others are available for the analysis of digital
    evidence. Traditional digital devices adopt standard operating systems (OS) and
    file systems, and these tools are capable of translating different file formats
    from known file systems. However, IoT device manufacturers do not use any standard
    file format, OS, and hardware [117]. If the data are not in the standard file
    format, these tools can also search for ASCII and Unicode. These tools are designed
    to speed up the examination process if the data is in a standard file format [120]
    but the lack of a standard file format in IoT makes the examination process challenging.
    6.1.6. Analysis This phase includes the analysis of the extracted data and reconstruction
    of the incident. This phase helps to interpret the finding that results conclude
    the investigation process. It includes clear identification about the person,
    place, event, etc. with respect to the case. The huge amount of data collected
    in various types of IoT devices makes it nearly impossible to provide an end-to-end
    analysis of residual evidence. It is an everchanging technology that is constantly
    evolving. This cause may not support a complete analysis of the data extracted
    from emerging Ag-IoT devices by utilizing existing digital forensic tools.[112].
    6.1.7. Presentation The final report is designed to present it in the court of
    law or to the admin of the investigation team to conclude the forensic incident.
    It includes chain of custody which helps to write about every phase chronologically.
    This report is the abstract form of the whole investigation process. This report
    is to be presented to the incident response administration and the bench of judges.

    Low 6.2. Ag-IoT forensics A few IoT forensic frameworks have already been defined
    and developed to collect and analyze IoT evidence. A framework called the Forensic
    Edge Management System (FEMS) framework is used for the gateway of the smart home
    [122]. Almolhis et al. [123] address the dynamic nature of IoT environments such
    as elasticity, virtualization, volatility, multitenancy, and multijurisdiction,
    many researchers have proposed an IoT forensics model. This review article has
    presented issues and challenges in IoT forensics and comparative analysis on its
    different models. Sadineni et al. [113] presented a holistic forensic model for
    IoT based on ISO/IEC 27043. This model is based on three aspects — forensic readiness,
    initialization, investigation (proactive, incident, and reactive). This model
    advises different IoT applications, which can be developed in this comprehensive
    framework. Saleh et al. [124] addressed the key challenges of complexity and ambiguity
    of forensics in IoT due to the heterogeneity of IoT infrastructures. They have
    compared different IoT forensic models and frameworks that include different areas
    of applications of IoT and IoT forensic phases. The authors proposed a standard
    IoT forensic model by employing the meta-modeling method is called Investigation
    Process Model (IPM). The proposed CIPM consists of four common investigation processes
    namely, preparation, collection, analysis, and report. Kim et al. [125] proposed
    an IoT forensic model to classify interconnectivity between things. This helps
    in identifying every interconnected thing of IoT nodes. Garba et al. [126] suggested
    a new low-cost fuzzy genetic blockchain-enabled network forensics framework to
    address the preservation of digital provenance, examination, and analysis challenges
    of IoT forensics. The proposed work was intended to perform examination and analysis
    using the genetic fuzzy expert system. The main concern of the authors was to
    maintain the privacy and chain of custody to achieve integrity using hyperledger
    fabric and private-permissioned blockchain. Sadineni et al. [127] emphasized the
    challenges of identifying and comparing significant artifacts from network packets
    to reconstruct attack scenarios at the time of forensic IoT. They addressed this
    challenge and proposed a novel provenance-based forensic model ProvNet-IoT for
    investigating network-level attacks in an IoT environment. In a similar work [128],
    Sadineni et al. proposed ProvLink-IoT, a novel provenance based model for evidence
    collection and forensic analysis in IoT networks. They have conducted a case study
    on 6TiSCH networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed model. Liu
    et al. [129] expressed concern that holistic forensics of IoT may not be useful
    in all IoT applications and there is a need for a specific forensic framework
    for each area of the IoT application. They presented a digital forensics model
    which deals with IoT devices, network, and cloud storage for the source of evidence.
    For digital forensics, a specific model should be developed for a particular type
    of IoT application. Due to the diversity of sensors, storage, and various SBCs,
    no universal architecture or file format is employed in the IoT environment. To
    address this gap, We devised a Digital Forensics Model (DFM) specifically for
    Ag-IoT. In this DFM, there are five phases, namely identification, collection,
    examination, analysis, and presentation. Chronologically, these forensic phases
    are applied on each layer of the Ag-IoT architecture in an asynchronous manner.
    Each layer needed to apply protocols of different branches of digital forensics.
    The different branches of digital forensics used here are device forensics, network
    forensics, memory forensics, application forensics, and cloud forensics. Once
    each layer has finished its DF process, the results are synchronized with the
    corresponding layer and presented in the form of a report.A graphical representation
    of a systematic digital forensic model for Ag-IoT is shown in Fig. 3. 7. Discussion
    Ag-IoT is the highest trending technology in human life to make life much easier,
    faster, and more comfortable. According to Cisco Internet Business Solution Group
    (IBSG), IoT was born between 2008 and 2009, with an average of 1.84 IoTs per person;
    the propositional logic can be derived from these IBSG statistics that people
    will possess 10 IoTs per person on average, in the coming age. Thus, this field
    requires the most potential to research in the Ag-IoT domain to improve its characteristics
    and work on its challenges. A major obstacle to the acceptance of Ag-IoT is the
    instruction and preparation of agriculturalists. Uninformed farmers may cause
    severe damage to the system by clicking on any wrong button in Ag-IoT based software
    or hardware. Farmers and workers in the industry must spread knowledge about the
    more effective use of Ag-IoT and guarantee that these technologies are used securely.
    There is also a scarcity of youth who choose the agriculture business as a career
    because they want bright and white-collar jobs. About 55% of farmers are over
    55 years old in the agriculture business in the UK, which poses a huge risk of
    cyber threats due to lack of knowledge and activeness. Internet speed in rural
    areas is also another challenge for the wider adoption of Ag-IoT. The harsh nature
    of the environmental condition can affect the Ag-IoT system as it has to be implemented
    in an open field most of the time. In addition to monitoring and controlling sensors,
    the wireless networks used in the agri-sector, which are mainly low power such
    as LoRaWAN, Zigbee, etc., can be affected by harsh environmental conditions, such
    as temperature, humidity, obstacles, and human presence as well, an impact that
    leads in turn to communication and data loss. This may create false data reading
    and wrong functioning of the smart agriculture system. The cyber security and
    related risks in Ag-IoT need to be taken seriously and significant work is required
    to make it more secure and robust for users relying on it. Security can be exploited
    and inevitable in hardware and digital parameters. These vulnerabilities are quite
    similar to other areas of IoT applications or industries. Ag-IoT uses additional
    hardware such as autonomous vehicles, RFID tags, smart trespass detectors, and
    others. Agricultural businesses are vulnerable to conventional Cyber Attacks like
    ransomware, malware, technology corruption, spearfishing, data breaches for economic
    manipulation or intellectual property theft. It is also a lurking focus of activist
    groups (animal rights, anti-GMO) to cause serious economic or political disruption.
    There is a need for proactive actions for cyber security and digital forensics
    agencies to take measures to reduce their vulnerabilities and attack surfaces
    and protect against financial and legal penalties incurred as a result of these
    attacks. Hardware related to Ag-IoT or state-of-the-art sensors used in Agriculture
    IoT can be vulnerable. The main reasons behind these vulnerabilities are mostly
    outdated or not updated firmware or default passwords, and the network. The best
    encryption technique could be used to make data communication secure, but limited
    memory and computational resources in IoT raise the problem of implementing a
    complex cryptographic algorithm. The other vulnerabilities in communication technology
    (such as RFID, GPS, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), ZigBee, and Bluetooth) and its
    protocols could inherit the vulnerabilities in Ag-IoT system. Mobile applications
    and web-based Ag-IoT applications can be targeted through passive vulnerability
    detection. There is a potential risk of creating a massive botnet by scanning
    networks or the web to locate a vulnerable list of millions of Ag-IoT devices.
    The usual lack of attention to the security of Ag-IoT is a concerning challenge
    [82]. The Ag-IoT is a new area of application of the IoT. Therefore, there is
    a scarcity of articles related to vulnerabilities in Ag-IoT hardware such as sensors,
    actuators, and others. This can lead to zero-day attacks in Ag-IoT. It is highly
    recommended that security issues are addressed before Ag-IoT components are deployed.
    In terms of networking, there are multi-perspective challenges that can affect
    the manipulation of agricultural data as network components and technologies like
    Wi-Fi devices can easily be hacked using easy and known tactics. If the Wi-Fi
    of Ag-IoT is hacked, the smart agriculture system is severely compromised. Consequently,
    the agribusiness person will face loss of crops, labor, and economy. The Ag-IoT
    system is prone to malfunction, which can lead to a decrease in yield without
    the farmer being aware of it. The implementation of inadequate user access control
    can provide attackers with easy access to Ag-IoT systems through unauthorized
    access to mobile apps or websites [130], [131]. In this study, we reviewed 132
    research articles to understand the work done in the areas of Ag IoT, its security,
    and digital forensics. A detailed study was carried out on these articles and
    it has been found that a scarcity of articles discusses Ag-IoT based cyber attacks
    and digital forensics. Thus, researchers working in this domain can further explore
    emerging CACC and DF investigations based on Ag-IoT. Furthermore, there is an
    urgent need for preparedness towards CACC and DF in Ag-IoT. It is also observed
    that most of the experiments were not conducted in a practical environment and
    were based on assumptions. To solve more real-time problems, researchers should
    also experiment with these techniques in real-world solutions for Ag-IoT. 8. Conclusion
    According to SDG 2030 goal 2, the world is looking to promote sustainable agriculture
    to achieve zero hunger. Ag-IoT can become a major contribution in this direction
    and can be used in a variety of agricultural fields, such as farm monitoring,
    irrigation, pest monitoring, livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses, and smart
    poultry farms. This study reviewed 132 articles related to Ag-IoT and IoT in general,
    covering topics such as Ag-IoT architectures, applications, security, and forensic
    issues. The findings of the study indicate that while much work has been done
    to create high-level Ag-IoT platforms, manufacturers and developers have not paid
    enough attention to security. Some researchers have also investigated the potential
    damage that a hacked or vulnerable Ag-IoT system can cause. Often, it is not possible
    to prevent crimes and attacks, so forensic investigation of crimes is essential,
    yet very little work has been done in this area. The main conclusion of this study
    is that secure Ag-IoT components are needed to ensure uninterrupted services in
    the emerging agricultural era. Additionally, a digital forensic model or framework
    is necessary to trace Ag-IoT to effectively track perpetrators and support law
    enforcement agencies. Ethics statement None. Funding We declare that no funding

    Machinery (CSAM), in charged of China Association for Science and Technology (CAST),
    sponsored by CSAM and Chinese Academy of Agricultural Mechanization Science(CAAMS),
    started publication in 1957. It is the earliest interdisciplinary journal in Chinese
    which combines agricultural and engineering. It always closely grasps the development
    direction of agriculture engineering disciplines and the published papers represent
    the highest academic level of agriculture engineering in China. Currently, nearly
    8,000 papers have been already published. There are around 3,000 papers contributed
    to the journal each year, but only around 600 of them will be accepted. Transactions
    of CSAM focuses on a wide range of agricultural machinery, irrigation, electronics,
    robotics, agro-products engineering, biological energy, agricultural structures
    and environment and more. Subjects in Transactions of the CSAM have been embodied
    by many internationally well-known index systems, such as: EI Compendex, CA, CSA,

  description: 'The internet of things (IoT) is rapidly expanding and improving operations
    in a wide range of real-world applications, from consumer IoT and enterprise IoT
    to manufacturing and industrial IoT (IIoT). Consumer markets, wearable devices,
    healthcare, smart buildings, agriculture, and smart cities are just a few examples.
    This paper discusses the current state of the IoT ecosystem, its primary applications
    and benefits, important architectural stages, some of the problems and challenges
    it faces, and its future. This paper explains how an appropriate IoT architecture
    that saves data, analyzes it, and recommends corrective action improves the process’s
    ground reality. The IoT system architecture is divided into three layers: device,
    gateway, and platform. This then cascades into the four stages of the IoT architectural
    layout: sensors and actuators; gateways and data acquisition systems; edge IT
    data processing; and datacenter and cloud, which use high-end apps to collect
    data, evaluate it, process it, and provide remedial solutions. This elegant combination
    provides excellent value in automatic action. In the future, IoT will continue
    to serve as the foundation for many technologies. Machine learning will become
    more popular in the coming years as IoT networks take center stage in a variety
    of industries.'

  description: Availability and applications of open-source data for disaster risk
    reductions are increasing. Flood hazards are a constant threat to local communities
    and infrastructures (e.g., built-up environment and agricultural areas) in Nepal.
    Due to its negative consequences on societies and economic aspects, it is critical
    to monitor and map those risks. This study presents the open access earth observation
    (EO) data, geospatial products, and different analytical models available for
    flood risk assessment (FRA) and monitoring in Nepal. The status of flood risk
    knowledge and open-source data was reviewed through a systematic literature review.
    Multispectral optical data are widely used, but use of microwave data is extremely
    low. With the recent developments in this field, especially optical and microwave
    data, the monitoring, mapping, and modeling of flood hazards and risk have been
    more rapid and precise and are published in several scientific articles. This
    study shows that the choice of appropriate measurements and data for a flood risk
    assessment and management involves an understanding of the flood risk mechanism,
    flood plain dynamics, and primary parameter that should be addressed in order
    to minimize the risk. At the catchments, floodplains, and basin level, a variety
    of open data sources and models may be used under different socioeconomic and
    environmental limitations. If combined and analyzed further, multi-source data
    from different models and platforms could produce a new result to better understand
    the risks and mitigation measures related to various disasters. The finding of
    this study helps to select and apply appropriate data and models for flood risk
    assessment and management in the countries like Nepal where the proprietary data
    and models are not easily accessible.

    to minimize the risk. At the catchments, floodplains, and basin level, a variety
    of open data sources and models may be used under different socioeconomic and
    environmental limitations. If combined and analyzed further, multi-source data
    from different models and platforms could produce a new result to better understand
    the risks and mitigation measures related to various disasters. The finding of
    this study helps to select and apply appropriate data and models for flood risk
    assessment and management in the countries like Nepal where the proprietary data
    and models are not easily accessible. Keywords: open access data; disaster risk
    reduction; geospatial data; remote sensing; modelling 1. Introduction Evidence-based
    decision-making on flood hazards and risk management is possible through factual
    data and detailed assessment [1,2,3]. The lack of adequate data affects the ability
    to model, predict, and plan for hazards and risk, which can have obvious negative
    consequences on human health and socio-economic aspects [4,5]. Natural phenomena
    become hazards when they have the potential of inflicting damage on people’s lives
    along with causing economic and social losses [6,7]. All such disasters are challenging
    to eliminate, but with advancements in science and technology, the hazards’ frequency
    and intensity can be estimated [5,8,9]. These estimations are backed by data and
    scientific evidence, which can significantly help alleviate the negative consequences
    of employing effective risk assessment measures [10,11,12]. The nature and extent
    of any risk can be determined by evaluating the existing vulnerability conditions
    that could potentially harm the people at risk, their livelihoods, and the environment
    [13,14]. Nepal is highly prone to various natural disasters due to its diverse
    and rugged topography coupled with active tectonic plates [15]. The country’s
    typical north-south extension is about 140 km, while its east-west extent is around
    800 km, nearly parallel to the Himalayan axis. The elevation varies across this
    short span from 60 m in Terai to 8848.5 m in the High Himalaya, with five separate
    physiographic zones (Terai, Siwalik, Middle Mountain, High Mountain, and High
    Himalaya). It is highly flood-prone (mainly Terai) and ranks 20th worldwide in
    terms of flood-affected populations. For example, in August 2017, floods triggered
    by heavy rainfall affected up to 1.7 million people across 35 of 75 districts
    of Nepal [16]. The flooding and inundation displaced approximately 461,000 people
    and destroyed 65,000 houses. In 2012, 40 people were killed and 32 went missing
    when water surged down the Seti River due to a landslide [15]. In addition to
    the natural factors, Nepal’s disaster-induced damages increase due to human activities,
    such as deforestation, unplanned settlements, and inadequate proactive legislation.
    Common types of floods in Nepal includes fluvial/inland, flash floods, dam burst
    floods, and urban floods. Data deficiencies on disaster risk assessment and planning
    leads to a massive loss of human lives and economic assets [17,18,19]. The Government
    of Nepal has been trying its best to strengthen the institutional setup and improve
    the data system, data availability, and accessibility in its federal structure
    [20]. A responsible national authority has recently been established to look after
    overall Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures and management-related issues in
    Nepal [21]. At provincial and local levels, disaster management committees are
    responsible for working on these issues. Moreover, these authorities are mandated
    to continuously work in a complete disaster management cycle to prepare and act
    in case of any natural disaster; however, these authorities are having difficulty
    making proper decisions due to the constant lack of evidence and reliable data.
    Many studies are available in Nepal on the study of floods using high-resolution
    remote sensing imagery, Google Earth, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to identify
    the flood susceptible area. For this, hydraulic and hydrological modelling are
    commonly used approaches. Sharma and others [22] summarized the basin-wide flood
    hazard studies in Nepal and discussed the remote sensing approaches. Further,
    they indicated that both the commercial and open data are used but did not extensively
    consider the potential and extent of the open data and analytical tools. Open
    data are unrestricted, freely available data that anyone can access, use, and
    redistribute, and exist in digital, machine-readable format [23,24]. Such data
    are accessed by users usually through web-based interfaces called open data portals.
    For example, (a) USGS provides open access earth observation mission products
    such as Landsat, Sentinel, and DEMs from different sources; (b) web-portal hosted
    by the government and international organizations provides disaster incident and
    magnitude data; and (c) open-source analytical models and tools such as HECRAS,
    GIS, Integrated Flood Analysis System (IFAS), and machine learning algorithms
    facilitate the assessment and management of flood risk. The demand for open data
    is increasing rapidly in developing countries, such as Nepal, where there is a
    critical knowledge gap regarding the use, potential and challenges associated
    with the use of data [25]. Open data helps increase data accessibility, enhances
    community involvement, promotes transparency of research results, increases effectiveness,
    decreases costs of data, and promotes advancement and innovation [26]. The use
    of these available data could provide an efficient, cost-effective, and timely
    assessment of the risk and support in taking preparedness actions. Analytical
    models are mathematical models with a closed form solution, meaning that a mathematical
    analytic function may be utilized to define the solution to the equations used
    to describe changes in a system. Using such models, the mechanisms underlying
    complex physical processes can be simulated, elucidated, and predictions can be
    made. These models have been used mainly for predicting system behavior and understanding
    various hydrological and hydrodynamics processes in terms of assessing floods
    and landslides. Studies that examine flood risk analysis and assessment evaluations
    often focus on methodological and scale-related difficulties, uncertainty, mapping,
    or economic damage issues; however, the majority of these studies offer a glimpse
    of the scientific state of the art for risk assessment that is just a partial
    overview, centered on a small proportion of chosen data sources and methodologies.
    A comprehensive literature analysis to assess the application of data and models
    for flood risk assessment and management is lacking in Nepal. This study aims
    to exploit recent advances in Earth Observation (EO), open-source data from various
    sources, and high-performance analytical models to innovate an approach for flood
    risk and impact assessment through a systematic literature review and analysis.
    This study also aims at setting a recommendation to develop a risk assessment
    platform that could be significantly helpful for the Disaster Risk Assessment
    (DRA) and preparedness strategies at the local government units in Nepal. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Data Collection The existing literature was reviewed for the
    available open data sources, analytical models, and computational resources including
    an open-source web-based risk assessment platform, which can be potentially used
    for flood hazards and risk mapping and assessment, and modelling. The data and
    information available at different spatial scales (global, regional, federal,
    and local) were considered for the review with a specific focus on the Nepalese
    context. A systematic literature review [27,28,29] was used following the PRISMA
    Protocol [30] for this study. In this process, the review was completed in two
    phases. The first phase includes: (a) definition of the scope of the analysis
    to draw the boundary of the study; (b) locating studies by keywords, time, type
    of documents, and language; and (c) selection and evaluation of relevant papers.
    The second phase constitutes the extraction and presentation of relevant information
    from the screened and selected studies in the first phase. The conceptual framework
    of the study is presented in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, vulnerability to
    flood hazard is the function of exposure to hazards, sensitivity, and adaptive
    capacity. Whether it be identifying risk and vulnerabilities or planning for resilience,
    all require hazard mapping and modeling. Open data alternatives and models would
    help to perform such tasks with greater efficiency and transparency. Figure 1.
    Flood risk assessment methods and conceptual framework of the study. The data
    for this study were collected from the Web of Science and Scopus database using
    keywords. In addition, the data for this study were included published official
    reports of the government and non-government organizations and other documentation.
    The date range for the selected literature was from 1 January 1983 to 31 December
    2021. The review first focused on risk assessment, then narrowed down to open
    data and most importantly on methods in analyzing the available data in producing
    meaningful information. The keywords and the number of articles selected for this
    study are presented in Table 1. Both the citation and keyword network analyses
    were performed. For example, the number of articles listed using the keywords
    on the Web of Science was 4948 during the first phase. A total of 2403 relevant
    articles were identified among which 256 were from Nepal and 2147 from various
    parts of the globe as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. PRISMA flow diagram of
    the study. Table 1. Details of the key words and articles screened for the analysis.
    2.2. Data Analysis and Validation The data are presented in graphical and tabular
    formats. Both descriptive and quantitative analyses were used. Strengths, weaknesses,
    and future scope of open-source data and analytical models for flood hazards and
    risk assessments are discussed. The review was further refined and validated through
    an online expert consultation meeting, organized in Kathmandu, Nepal. The participants
    in the meeting were experts, researchers, practitioners, and planners from various
    research fields in the DRRM sector. Based on the result of primary review, the
    participants were consulted on the available data types, data sources, data collection
    methods, and analytical models and their usefulness and applicability in the context
    of Nepal. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Earth Observation Data Satellite products
    are invaluable for flood hazards and risk analysis as they provide the basis for
    the extraction of different earth feature data [31]. Different GIS layers can
    be derived from Earth observation data (Optical, LiDAR, and microwave radar data)
    for a large-scale flood-related functional evaluation [32,33]. These include maps
    of hydrogeomorphic units, ditches, vegetation, biomass, and wetland boundaries.
    Mapping of different impacts and functions over large areas can serve as an efficient
    tool for policymakers and other stakeholders [33]. Specifically, this earth observation
    satellite has the potential for mapping of flood hazards and their impacts. The
    open-source satellite products are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Some open access
    earth observation mission and products. Landsat imagery archive, ESA Sentinel
    data, and ASTER in 2015 are open access EO products. Declassified historic satellite
    imagery since the 1960s can provide high-resolution information related to the
    earth’s surface [44]. Landsat mission began in the early 1970s and it provided
    its data openly in January 2008 [45]. It now has the longest time-series data
    on earth observation [46]. Copernicus Sentinel mission was another EO mission
    to provide high-resolution data open access [47]. Advanced Space-borne Thermal
    Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) was initially a commercial product,
    but in 2015, made all their data publicly available [48]. Unlike, Landsat, data
    of ASTER are not acquired at a regular time interval for the same location. Data
    are acquired as per the demand of the authorized personnel. Similarly, data of
    Corona, Argon and Lanyard were declassified in 1995, and Gambit and Hexagon satellite
    imagery in 2002. Some of these data sources are older and may not be available
    for future use, yet they are important to generate and reconstruct historical
    hazards and disaster events. Currently, the DEMs that have nearly global coverage
    and free access are SRTM and ASTER GDEM [49]. In addition, recently, ALOS PALSAR
    L-band SAR based DEM of 12.5 m resolution was released (Table 3). Various flood
    and other hazard risk applications have already been implemented using these products
    [50,51]. Table 3. List of open Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Open-source multi-resolution
    data from the latest EO technologies (Figure 3) is used for flood risk assessment
    and simulation of flood hydrodynamics to provide spatial and temporal flood characteristics
    [57]. A study on flood early warning system in the Karnali shows that the benefit-cost
    ratio is between 24 and 73% [58]. The benefit-cost ratio of the flood Early Warning
    System (EWS) can be increased by using open-source data and tools. Microwave data,
    such as Sentinel-1 SAR, can be very useful data for monitoring the floodwaters
    [59,60]. These data have a certain benefit over the optical data [61]. Precipitation
    is one of the key data required for flood hazards assessment. Sun and others [62]
    reviewed 30 different global precipitation products including regular gridded
    station-based, satellite-based, and reanalysis precipitation data. Some satellite-derived
    precipitation products are now available, including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring
    Mission (TRMM) [63], the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information
    using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) [64], and the Climate Prediction Center
    (CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH) [65] products. These are widely used in flood
    simulation and forecasting. An example of flood extent mapping using open-source
    data (Sentinel) is given in Figure 4. Figure 3. Different remote sensing data
    necessary for risk assessment (left) and thematic layers used to store the specific
    spatial information in the GIS database (e.g., Dudh Koshi River basin in Nepal)
    (right). Figure 4. Mapping of flood extent using open source Optical and Radar
    data, prepared by Authors as examples in this study: (a) Flood extent and land
    use mapping of the lower Karnali River using Optical imagery of Sentinel 2A of
    12 October 2019 and (b) Flood mapping of the Koshi River of Nepal using Sentinel-1
    SAR data of 12 July 2020 (summer monsoon) as an example. Background represents
    the hillshade from the ASTER GDEM. The optical data during the monsoon are rarely
    usable as they are affected by the cloud cover; the SAR data can be the best choice
    to overcome such issues. 3.2. Geospatial Data Many open data repositories at different
    scales are available that provide different geographic data, statistics including
    socio-economic and scientific data, that can potentially be used for understanding
    the disaster risks in Nepal (Table 4). Detailed information on communities and
    infrastructure systems can be collected and processed from multiple sources including
    OpenStreetMap, Google Earth, and global data products to support impact analysis.
    Usually, the data generated and shared by the public organizations are considered
    as open-source. Data sharing policy and copyright information does not exist in
    the data generated by the national institutions/organization; however, over the
    past five years, there has been progressing in sharing of the government data
    online [66]. Apart from the national institutions and private sectors, international
    organizations provide information on different development indicators. Table 4.
    Geographic open and public data sources in Nepal and their characteristics. 3.3.
    Analytical Models for Flood Hazard and Risk Assessment Analytical models use advanced
    statistical techniques and approaches in the modeling of extreme events and making
    predictions about the mechanisms involved in complex physical processes. These
    models have mainly been used for predicting system behavior and understanding
    various hydrological and hydrodynamics processes in terms of assessing hazards
    and risk. Hydrological models are developed and used for both river and floodplain
    modelling to analyze the behavior of flooding and to identify the causes and effects
    of flooding [99]. These models help to assess the flood frequency for the quantitative
    assessment of flood problems in the area and prepare flood risk, vulnerability,
    and hazard maps. Many models are available for flood hazard mapping and assessment
    and are applied in the Nepalese context [1]. Both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional
    (2D) dynamic flood models are used [100]. A basic probabilistic model can be used
    to assess flood risk in addition to complex deterministic models. Depending on
    the context, these models have their own advantage and shortcomings [101,102].
    The integrated assessment of flood hazards in flood-prone locations, the cost-benefit
    analysis, and the risk-based design of flood protection systems could all benefit
    from the adoption of such models [102]. The techniques utilized in modeling range
    from very simple approaches with many simplifying assumptions to quite complex
    applications that involve a lot of data and computation time for both the hazard
    and vulnerability components of the risk. Studies have shown that combinations
    of different models (e.g., 1D/2D) would offer optimum balance between the amount
    of data needed for the simulation and the accuracy of the result [103]. The detailed
    list of the flood analytical models with their temporal and spatial scale and
    outputs are given in Table 5. Some of the common models used in Nepal are described
    below: 3.3.1. Hydrodynamic Model HEC-GeoRAS is used for interfacing between the
    HEC-RAS and GIS used for flood inundation mapping based on the flow rates for
    different return periods using the HEC-RAS model, and GIS for spatial data processing
    [104]. 3.3.2. Hydraulic Models HEC-RAS is a commonly used hydraulic modelling
    software in Nepal that is used for flood hazard mapping [1,105]. HEC-RAS can perform
    steady and unsteady flow hydraulics, sediment transport/mobile bed computations,
    and water temperature modelling [99]. 3.3.3. Hydrological Models To evaluate the
    hydrology of watersheds, spatially dispersed hydrological models are employed,
    including HEC-HMS [106,107], InVEST [108,109], VIC [110], and SWAT [111,112,113].
    The SWAT has been most widely implemented in hydrological studies and is applicable
    under limited data availability [114,115]. Table 5. List of analytical models
    used for flood studies in Nepal.              3.4. Analytical Platforms, GIS Software
    and Programming Languages The integration of available data and outputs from the
    model is supported by a risk assessment platform which helps in interactive risk
    assessment and further support in decision-making [132]. Some commonly available
    open-source web-based flood risk assessment platforms along with their main characteristics
    are given in Table 6. Table 6. Open-source online platform for the flood risk
    assessment. Several open-source software programs provide support in modelling
    and analyzing hazard and risk data, and visualizing and exploring the data. Concerning
    disaster management applications, the most important software is the Geographic
    Information Systems (GIS) software, which is used to create, manage, store, analyze,
    and visualize geographic data. Chen and others [158] reviewed and summarized the
    open-source GIS software intending to apply it in water resource management. Table
    7 presents open-source desktop GIS, whose functionalities are comparable to that
    of proprietary software. Table 7. Open-source GIS program/software application
    for flood risk assessment. Programming languages are used to develop programs
    and models. There is an increase in the use of programming languages by scientists
    because of the ease with which they can derive insights from large and complex
    datasets [189]. The general purpose of programming languages like Python and R
    is for data analysis and to develop modelling applications. Table 8 explains the
    common and useful programming languages and notebook environments used for different
    computing results. Notebooks are a computing environment where one can freely
    combine human-readable narrative with computer-readable code. In this environment,
    one can document the code, run it, visualize data, and see the results without
    leaving the environment. This makes it a useful tool for performing end to end
    data science workflows–data cleaning, statistical modeling, visualizing data,
    and many other uses. Table 8. Programming languages used for computing. 3.5. Machine
    Learning Models Artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM),
    and decision trees (DT) are just a few examples of machine learning techniques
    that have been used to detect and analyze flood-prone zones in flood hazard assessments
    [160,197,198]. The machine learning models circumvent the subjective calculation
    of weights by learning the link between flooding incidence and the explanatory
    variables from the historical flooding records [199]. Global flood models frequently
    need many model parameters, frequent model debugging, and lengthy computation
    times due to the complexities of global floods. For quicker access to worldwide
    flood risk assessments, machine learning techniques could be a useful option [200].
    EO products can be used to map and simulate the flood and provide flood characteristics;
    however, there is a problem of obtaining cloud-free images during the summer monsoon
    flooding season through the optical sensors (Sentinel 2a/2b, Landsat). Most optical
    imagery is full of cloud cover and cannot map the flooding. Even the microwave
    is absorbed by the water and thus may not be suitable for mapping the monsoon
    flood. To overcome this issue, the only option is to use the modelling of the
    flood extents or field survey using high-resolution drone mapping. Disasters are
    the key barriers to achieving sustainable development targets with huge economic
    and societal impacts. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030
    has set four main priorities for governments to focus on: (a) understanding disaster
    risk, (b) strengthening disaster risk governance to manage risks, (c) investing
    on DRR for resilience building, and (d) enhancing disaster preparedness for effective
    response and ‘building back better’ in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction
    [201]. The developing countries are on the frontline to bear such negative impacts
    due to having the inadequate capacity to mitigate, adapt, and bounce back to normal
    condition after the crisis. Natural hazards are often hard to control, but with
    the proper understanding of their underlying risks and required planning to address
    those risks, losses could be minimized to a great extent; however, any plan for
    effective intervention to minimize the associated risks should be backed up by
    data and scientific evidence. Amongst other factors, the lack of data and reliable
    information sources are major hindrances in effective decision making especially
    in terms of a development initiative. Previous works proposed and discussed the
    models for effective use of the open data [202,203]. Open data policies at various
    institutional and government levels are much less systematic [204]. Charalabidis
    and others [23] summarize the benefits of open data. Some previous documents evaluated
    the availability of open data in Nepal [65]. The lack of official mechanisms for
    the public sharing of data produced by the government is the major hindrance in
    open data initiatives. Despite this challenge, civil society organizations and
    the private sectors are taking steps to share both their data and the data from
    the government [65]. The review of open-access software packages by the World
    Bank provides a detailed evaluation of 31 models in disaster applications at the
    global level [12]. The report facilitates the choice of open access hazard and
    risk modelling tools in disaster risk management. Validation and application of
    the open data are undergoing with cases in different countries, e.g., flooding
    in Bangladesh using recent technologies, such as SAR [5], geographic data for
    flood disaster [22]. Previous studies also present the limitations of the remote
    sensing data [205]. 4. Conclusions The literature on the use of EO products, open
    data, and analytical models in flood hazards and risks, shows a growing interest
    in the field; however, the main focus of the contemporary literature is on the
    technology-specific applications for hazard mapping and disaster management. Despite
    the availability of the open data, (a) a situation of an extremely low usage of
    such data are observed for most of the floods in Nepal, and (b) hazard mapping
    and impact evaluations in the country are limited and the capability of the available
    data are not explored in the country. Except for the case of study-based approaches,
    the disintegrated data by the local, provincial, and federal level was not found
    in Nepal. This might be related to the lack of efficient infrastructure (super
    computing device for the processing of big data), availability of human resources,
    and low priority of the country. Cloud computing resources, such as Google Earth
    Engine, can be the best alternative for filling the gap in the lack of efficient
    infrastructure in the country. The latest EO products and technologies, open data
    and analytical tools, have the potential to ensure efficient flood risk assessment,
    reduce the impacts of flood hazards, and flood risk reduction through the prior
    mitigation actions. Producing intermediate data and indicators through the open
    satellite imagery, online platform (e.g., GoogleEarth Engine), and DEMs will be
    inputs for flood risk assessment. Multiple sources of data from different models
    and platforms, if combined and analyzed further, could produce a new result to
    better understand the risks and mitigation measures related to various kinds of
    disasters. Such datasets can be organized, managed, and analyzed using a digital,
    web-based analytical platform, which uses readily available open data sources
    from different flood models and produces user tailored information. Such outputs
    could be more understandable and guide evidence-based decision making and planning
    processes in the target areas. This study documents the available open data, analytical
    models, and tools for flood risk assessment and underlines the potential of utilizing
    open data and tools for disaster risk reduction. Flood risk management requires
    an understanding of risk mechanism including hazard, impacts, susceptibility,
    and selection of management interventions. However, this study is focused mostly
    on the data and model for risk assessment including vulnerability and susceptibility
    analysis. Other models and data sources for flood control technical designs, cost–benefits
    analysis, and possible flood management options can be considered in similar future
    studies. Author Contributions Conceptualization, S.T. and B.P.P.; methodology,

  description: 'Surface soil moisture (MSS) is a key factor governing environmental
    interactions in any catchment. Energy flux between soil and atmosphere, soil temperature,
    and heat diffusion in soil are examples of impressible interactions. Consequently,
    the agriculture sector and its many dependent industries are influenced by this
    element. Hence, investigating new optimized preprocessing and input selection
    methods for processing, interpretation, modeling, and prediction of MSS is necessary
    to ensure sustainable agriculture. To this end, satellite products were studied
    for the province of Quebec, Canada. Two overall deep learning (DL) approaches
    are proposed in this study. The first and most efficient one is extracting meaningful
    modeling parameters by the time-series structural-analysis-based method, and the
    second one is using the combination of optimization algorithms and the DL method.
    The structure of the extracted time series from satellite data was assessed by
    several tests and an intense periodic pattern was detected. Therefore, additive
    Holt–Winter’s (SHW), seasonal standardization (Sstd), and spectral analysis (SA)
    were chosen as preprocessing methods for the structural analysis preprocessing.
    The long short-term memory (LSTM) model was utilized for short-term forecasting
    of un-preprocessed and preprocessed MSS datasets. Along with structural-analysis-based
    methodology, genetic and teacher–learner-based algorithms (GA and TLA) were coupled
    with LSTM to assess the coupled models’ performance for MSS forecasting for the
    first time. Based on the structural analysis of data, limited hidden states (ht)
    were selected for modeling {1, 2, 7, 9, 52}: network training and forecasts were
    undertaken according to these hidden states. Since the long-term characteristics
    of the time series like trend and level are not significant in short-term modeling,
    the LSTM (Sstd, 9), correlation coefficient (R) = 0.970, root-mean-square error
    (RMSE) = 1.339 outperformed other models, followed closely by LSTM (SHW, 1), R
    = 0.922, RMSE = 1.958. Conversely, for long-term forecast, as these attributes
    impact the structure, LSTM (SHW, 2), R = 0.922, RMSE = 0.1961 was more successful
    in the prediction of patterns and fluctuations, followed by LSTM (Sstd, 52), R
    = 0.920, RMSE = 2.064, which was more complicated than the model developed for
    short-term modeling. GA-LSTM (ht = 32, R = 0.930, RMSE = 1.852) and TLA-LSTM (ht
    = 37, R = 0.934, RMSE = 1.781) also enhanced the long-term forecasting results.
    Integration of these two optimization methods had two benefits. First, due to
    the stochastic nature of optimization algorithms and DL methods, the search space
    for the optimized parameter (ht) was greatly increased and many possibilities
    were investigated. Second, the LSTM could perform a long-term forecast of the
    MSS without preprocessing, which was not possible by structural analysis. On the
    other hand, these methods were much computationally expensive and the combination
    of their controlling parameters with other controlling parameters of LSTM created
    numerous possibilities. However, as TLA is parameter free and much less sophisticated
    than GA, it is a more computational-effective method, and subsequently a better
    option than GA.'

    A critical element for preserving vegetation in an environment is the surface
    soil moisture (MSS). MSS, which is defined as the soil’s unsaturated upper layer
    water content, has a vast impact on the characteristics of the environment. The
    MSS influences the interactions between soil and atmosphere, controlling the exchange
    of energy at the interface between these two components of the environment [1,
    2]. Diffusion of heat at different depths of soil is altered by changes in the
    MSS as well [3, 4], and as a consequence, the alteration of the carbon dioxide
    and nitrous oxide exchange between earth and air occurs [5, 6]. Furthermore, on
    a large scale, changes in the MSS and its associated effects can escalate global
    warming. Moreover, absorption of rainfall and run-off is impacted by MSS levels
    in the root zone [7]. Less rainfall absorption leads to more erosion at the ground
    surface leading to more damage to both the environment and humans. Fluctuations
    in MSS and soil temperature also can affect the chemical contents of soil, leading
    to deterioration in micro-organism function and vegetation quality [8]. In the
    farming industry, the required volume of irrigation water, the rate of crop growth,
    and the yield time forecast are impacted by MSS. Managing these important farming
    factors is vital to the success of the agricultural industry and relies on the
    study of MSS fluctuation using novel measurement and prediction methods [7, 9].
    The exchange of MSS between soil and atmosphere and its fluctuations are affected
    by three main factors [10, 11]: Land topography, climatological parameters, and
    soil attributes that are the involved predominant factors. Vegetation, land usage,
    and the degree of vegetative coverage are some other factors influencing MSS [10,
    12], while other authors suggested that slope and land aspect are important impacting
    factors, as well [13,14,15]. Lands receiving higher amounts of solar radiation
    preserve less moisture due to elevated levels of evaporation. Highly sloped terrains
    are also known to absorb less surface water. Furthermore, the drainage in these
    regions is varying and changes as the pace of flow increases down the slopes.
    All these mentioned factors have been the subject of research by many scholars
    investigating MSS; however, the importance of MSS in science and industry has
    motivated many others to study and scrutinize different methods of MSS collection,
    forecasting, and analysis, e.g., using remotely sensed data and many different
    numerical algorithms with MSS correlated variables inputs [16,17,18,19,20,21,22].
    The collection and use of satellite data have been of great help to humans in
    understanding and controlling their environment. These data have a vast application;
    hydrological sciences and the agricultural sector are a few examples of many [23,24,25,26].
    Water balance investigation in different zones [25], glacial lake outburst flood
    study, production of crops [27, 28], monitoring and analysis of surface water
    [29], and soil moisture studies [18, 19, 30] are a select few instances where
    satellite data have been utilized studying natural phenomena. The Soil Moisture
    Active Passive satellite (SMAP) is the most recent soil moisture collection tool
    launched by NASA in January 2015. This satellite orbits the earth in synchrony
    with the sun at a distance of 685 km from the earth’s surface. The satellite’s
    ascending and descending paths are at 6 AM and 6 PM, collecting MSS data at a
    maximum depth of 5 cm as well as the freeze/thaw condition of the ground [30].
    The SMAP satellite has an L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer and radar, of which only
    the radiometer is functional [31]. The accuracy of the collected MSS data is 0.04
    m3/ m3 [32]. A set of moisture data including surface and subsurface soil moisture,
    their anomalies, and soil moisture profile, which are generally termed NASA-USDA
    enhanced SMAP, is produced using the SMAP satellite data and are available in
    the Google Earth Engines (GEE) catalog. The satellites produce large amounts of
    data, so, for analysis of extremely large-scale spatial information, the GEE platform
    is introduced. This platform stores vast quantities of geospatial data and information
    including, vegetation, deforestation, water management studies, droughts, and
    many others related to environmental protection [33]. This platform is user-friendly
    and easily accessed. The cloud space in the GEE environment provides the opportunity
    for a wide range of users who do not have access to appropriate computing tools
    and data [34]. Developments in technology and artificial intelligence techniques
    have widened their applications to virtually every field of science [35,36,37,38,39].
    LSTM is a form of DL method that is noted amongst scholars for its capabilities
    in modeling sequential data [40]. This model can use unlimited historical inputs
    for model training and forecasts the future states dynamically or statically.
    Its applications span from the social sciences in the detection of emotion primitives
    during a lecture [41], to the prediction of rainfall and runoff [42,43,44] and
    soil moisture [18, 19]. Abbes, Magagi, Goita [18] used three inputs to train their
    model and obtain the MSS. The brightness temperature of the SMAP, the water content
    of the vegetation, and the soil temperature are their LSTM training input variables,
    and in situ soil moisture data are the target variable. They took a variable-based
    approach to obtain the desired parameter. This form of modeling is a common approach
    in AI modeling methods as some relevant inputs are fed to the network, and the
    target information is extracted from the model [45,46,47]. There are some drawbacks
    to taking this approach [48]. First, there are errors associated with the measurement
    of each parameter, which increases the uncertainty of the model’s results. Second,
    there are uncertainties in choosing the input parameters; some researchers chose
    two to nine input parameters, e.g., Nahvi, Habibi, Mohammadi, Shamshirband, Al
    Razgan [46] chose nine inputs for soil moisture modeling. Last but not least,
    associated expenditures are another negative aspect of this approach. In the mentioned
    study, there is no information on the investigation of the data structure they
    used, model version, hyperparameter adjustments, and data preprocessing, which
    indicates they used classic LSTM. Finally, they obtained a good correlation with
    low errors in modeling MSS time series with this approach. Fang, Pan, Shen [19]
    used the same variable-based approach with 19 inputs categorized into three classes
    to prolong the soil moisture of SMAP data for several periods, and this was also
    compared and combined with the Noah land-surface model. The only data characteristics
    they sought were the trends occurring over multiple years. They used the classic
    LSTM structure with added rectified unit. There is no information on the hyperparameters,
    and other structural data preprocessing. They reported that the LSTM model was
    able to extract information from the inputs to model the soil moisture, without
    model structural errors and distinctive assumptions, but it could not amend the
    forcing of meteorological errors as the other method could, which implies the
    impact of exogenous variables on the results. Since the LSTM model is data-driven,
    the quality of the input series highly impacts the model learning and forecasting
    capability. In addition, the model produced better results in some cases when
    it was combined with the other method: Noah. Shin, Mohanty, Ines [49] developed
    a hidden Markov model optimized by GA for the temporal and spatial forecasting
    of weekly soil moisture dynamics and rainfall incidents. They used precipitation,
    temperature, and historical data of in situ soil moisture as their inputs. The
    GA aided them in boosting their model’s performance and allowed them to achieve
    viable results in forecasting weekly soil moisture dynamics in contrast to their
    rainfall predictions. However, their model was accompanied with uncertainties,
    and was impacted by land-surface states. The other limitations of their methodology
    are the model structure which corresponds to the configuration of model parameters
    and structure determination, uncertainties of the input parameters, and involved
    gauging errors, as they stated. Zhang, Wu, Liu, Wang, Guo, Xu, Pan, Pan [50] predicted
    soil moisture content measured in the laboratory under different covering conditions.
    They modeled their laboratory data with LSTM, convolutional neural network (CNN),
    and partial least square regression (PLSR). Both DL methods outperformed the PLSR
    model in large samples (more than 2000 samples), but in relatively small samples
    (around 500 samples) and covered conditions, they achieved relatively low accuracy
    or equal to PLSR. They indicated that the DL methods are highly dependent on sample
    size and soil condition, and they did not recommend them in small datasets, although
    their model had a more complicated structure than the classic LSTMs. They used
    a stacked LSTM with two layers of LSTM, which ended in a specific hidden state
    and other similar adjustments. They also did not perform any specific data preprocessing
    or structural assessment on data based on reported parameters. They did not report
    on any optimization utilization, which could probably also enhance small dataset
    prediction problems. Ma, Mei, Piccialli [51] performed a relatively thorough survey
    on AI methods, e.g., LSTM, artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine
    (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and many other supervised and unsupervised
    models for land-slide (displacement) time-series modeling. They identified several
    drawbacks of machine learning and variable-based data methods, namely the sensitivity
    of these methods to the data size and condition, instability function and overfitting
    problem, data quality, and structural characteristics including target data and
    other input variables, in their case, rainfall high non-stationarity as exogenous
    input, reservoir water level noise and outliers, etc. They also highlighted the
    impact of data preprocessing on the process of modeling and indicated that decomposing
    displacement and other time-series inputs into deterministic trends and periodic
    components efficiently impacts the results of data-driven methods. Kumar, Singh,
    Samui, Jha [40] used RNN and LSTM to model rainfall data. The model input selection
    in their study was based on the precedent studies [52, 53] on the same data conditions
    and data resolution, and as they had monthly data, they could use 12–13 lags as
    the model input data. Although both methods produced good results, and in some
    conditions, the LSTM model outperformed RNN, they emphasized that model performance
    could be improved by integrating the optimization. They also used a simple classic
    LSTM as the base model to keep the model as simple as possible. In a recent study,
    Li, Zhu, Shangguan, Wang, Li, Yu [17] developed an attention-aware LSTM (A_LSTM)
    model to perform a multi-step (1 and 7 days ahead) forecast of soil moisture.
    In a later study [16], they improved another LSTM method by complicating the structure
    and adding encoder–decoder layers to the LSTM (ED_LSTM) and forecasted the MSS
    data for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days leading. They used a variable-based approach with
    lagged MSS, soil and air temperature, precipitation for the former, and the same
    variables plus time indices, such as the month of the year, etc., as inputs of
    the later study. The performance of both studies was compared with other AI methods,
    including classic LSTM, SVM, random forest, etc. The results of both studies showed
    that the developed model enhanced the accuracy of forecasts by a minimum of 0.079
    to a maximum of 0.1971 in terms of average correlation, and improvements were
    noticeable in long-term predictions, compared to their base DL method, i.e., classic
    LSTM. Their research highlighted several points: first, the impact of the historical
    MSS data on the series was remarkable. They reported that the absence of the lagged
    MSS or so-called “memory inputs” decreased the model’s accuracy, which indicates
    the importance of implementing the historical characteristics and related structural
    features in the modeling procedure. However, the question arises as to how many
    lags are important, and how the lag combination should be considered as the inputs.
    Second, the size of data affected the results as in previous studies and models.
    Third, the model controlling parameters were highly influential in the developed
    model. Fourth, the noise and linked errors of forcing input variables like precipitation
    affected their results. Fifth, the complications were successful to some extent.
    They emphasized that both ED_LSTM and A_LSTM produced the same results. These
    results indicate that classic LSTM was almost as successful as the other two DL
    methods. For instance, the LSTM achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.881, while
    the ED_LSTM obtained 0.883, and with a further complication and involving residuals
    in the ED_LSTM, they enhanced the results to 0.889. Similar to any other AI method,
    LSTM requires parameter tuning. The most important parameter for time-series problems
    is the number of hidden states and the amount of data to be delivered to the forward
    phase in the structure. To solve this problem, optimization algorithms can be
    used to create hybrid models capable of finding the optimum values of these parameters.
    The renowned genetic algorithm (GA) and the recently developed teacher–leaner-based
    algorithms (TLA) are the two optimization methods that can perform optimization
    on the desired parameters. The GA optimizer is lauded by researchers in different
    scientific fields for optimization due to its high accuracy [47]. For example,
    Stajkowski et al. [54] combined the GA and LSTM model to develop a reliable forecasting
    tool for the prediction of the urban water temperature near Mississauga, Ontario.
    Their study showed that the GA-LSTM was successful in forecasting the water temperature
    and outperformed the recurrent neural network (RNN). Shin et al. [49] proposed
    a GA-based hidden Markov model for long-term estimation of MSS at different soil
    depths across the USA. They reported that the model forecasted the weekly MSS
    well under different land-surface and atmospheric conditions found in two different
    states. Bouktif et al. [55] used the GA to optimize the lags and number of hidden
    layers for LSTM and a series of wrapper and feature selection techniques used
    to forecast the aggregate electric load. Their LSTM model with optimized lag was
    to acquire the expected precision and improved the modeling accuracy. Maroufi
    and Mehdinejadiani [56] performed a comparative study on four optimization algorithms,
    including TLA, chicken-swarm optimization, particle-swarm optimization, and bees
    algorithm for optimizing parameters of the fractional-dispersion-advection equation
    in soil. They reported that TLA optimization was more reliable, less complicated,
    and had better convergence compared to other methods, though, it needed more run-time.
    Bozorg–Haddad et al. [57] considered the same algorithm for parameter optimization
    of a nonlinear Muskingum routing model, which used the Nash–Sutcliffe index as
    the cost function. The results showed that satisfactory performance was achieved
    through the use of the coupled process. In all instances above, the DL methods
    could extract useful information from the datasets and forecast the future successfully.
    However, some common limitations and drawbacks existed amongst them: (a) all studies
    lacked the proper scrutinizing of data structure. In some cases, they even highlighted
    the issue of data preprocessing in relation to the positive impact of this step
    on the modeling procedure, and in complicated AI data-driven methods; (b) all
    results suffered from the model input selection and data size impact. Data-driven
    methods produced less accurate results in small datasets, which is a major defect
    in such models and brings up the question of whether achieving acceptable results
    in small datasets is not possible at all; (c) the majority of studies faced the
    problem of uncertainties in exogenous variable selection and measuring errors;
    (d) in the above examples and other studies, no one investigated if the model
    inputs were defined based on the time series structural analysis, or how it would
    impact the results in comparison with random selection and optimization-based
    DL modeling. Keeping these problems in mind, the improvements in data measuring
    tools and the availability of both data and new AI methods increase the importance
    of having an appropriate methodology for modeling the current condition, forecasting
    different future scenarios, planning for it, and continuously monitoring. Therefore,
    in this study, we decided to seek the answers to these questions: (a) What are
    the impacts of defining model parameters based on the preprocessing and structural
    analysis of the data? (b) Are the determined parameters sufficient for that modeling
    purpose or is there a possibility of finding a more effective parameter? (c) In
    the case of following the conventional AI modeling procedure and combining it
    with optimization methods, how much do the results differ from the proposed methodology?
    (d) How do the different optimization methods compare? To achieve the answers,
    four major steps will be followed in this article: (i) To decrease the input associated
    uncertainties and cost of data acquisition, the soil moisture datasets obtained
    from the SMAP satellites, which are pre-analyzed and enhanced in the GEE environment,
    will be used as the sole model input variable to remove or lessen the problems
    of variable-based studies; (ii) A series of consecutive preprocessing and structural
    assessments will be applied to the dataset to establish and introduce the structural-analysis-based
    model input selection and performance. This step consists of utilizing auto-correlation
    function (ACF) plots, Mann–Kendall, Mann–Whitney, and KPSS tests, and then three
    distinct preprocessing methods, i.e., Holt–Winter’s advanced exponential method,
    spectral analysis, and seasonal standardization to generate preprocessed time
    series; (iii) The performance of the GA and TLA optimization methods coupled with
    LSTM will be assessed, and a comparison and performance analysis of the methods
    will be presented, which based on the structure of TLA, it is assumed that TLA-LSTM
    outperforms GA; (iv) Finally, the performance of the selected procedure in different
    forecasting horizons will be assessed and analyzed. This assessment will be undertaken
    on small datasets, which helps to determine whether implementing data-driven methods
    will be useful or not. The classic LSTM structure will be used in this study because:
    (a) it is the most utilized model structure in earlier studies, (b) the nature
    of datasets, which will be scrutinized, does not have the sophistication of the
    natural language datasets, image complications, etc., and the required information
    can be extracted by some practices, and (c) to respect the parsimony principle
    in the modeling procedure. Moreover, the most influential and often addressed
    model parameter that was reported in the aforementioned studies was the number
    of hidden states. Therefore, this parameter will be optimized in this step of
    our research, and the rest of the hyperparameters will be determined based on
    the ranges found in other studies. 1.1 Our contribution, concerning the presented
    introduction, can be summarized as follows (i) The ultimate objective of this
    study is to introduce instructions for an intelligent and efficient selection
    of modeling methods/inputs based on different conditions. Thus, the introduced
    method that minimizes the correlations between the historical data and time series
    lags, modeling costs and produces the best modeling results will be chosen as
    the superior methodology in each modeling condition. (ii) Structural-analysis-based
    LSTM modeling, coupling of TLA and LSTM, and comparison with GA for forecasting
    soil moisture have not been reported by any earlier studies. (iii) Last but not
    least, this paper addresses a novel aspect of DL modeling in soil parameter forecasting
    methodologies and discusses different alternatives for efficient modeling. In
    previous studies, we observed that the classic LSTM model was able to extract
    useful information from the data by using several inputs. Here, we aim to show
    that even with a time-series-based approach and using a single time series, the
    information and accuracy can be obtained, while the method’s structure is kept
    as simple as possible, and the uncertainties are lowered to a minimum level. This
    procedure will be undertaken on the condition that we have small datasets. 2 Methodology
    Based on the explanations provided at the end of the Introduction section, the
    workflow followed in this study is shown in Fig. 1. The following method descriptions
    are provided accordingly. Fig. 1 Flowchart of the proposed methodology Full size
    image 2.1 Collection and processing of MSS satellite data Many factors impact
    the quality of the radiation recorded by the sensors of the SMAP satellite, including
    surface light emissions and atmospheric emissions [58]. Vegetation coverage, up
    and downwelling emissions, and background cosmic emissions also affect the ability
    of the light to reach the sensors. Vegetation coverage and upwelling atmospheric
    emissions are also known to possibly have enfeebling effects on radiation detected
    [59]. As a result of these factors, the L band with a frequency of 1.4 GHz (1
    ≈ τatm) is used to collect data. At this frequency, the atmosphere is proportionally
    transparent and more efficiently penetrates the vegetation coverage [60]. Moreover,
    this frequency penetrates the soil up to 5 cm which prioritizes it to shorter
    wavelengths like X and C. [61]. Thus, this wavelength is used in the SMAP satellite
    to estimate the moisture in the surface layer of the soil [59]. 2.2 Soil moisture
    extraction methods The SMAP satellite obtains observations of the surface brightness
    temperature (TB), which relates to the soil moisture using an approximation of
    the radiative transfer equation known as the Tau-Omega model. The vegetative layer
    on top of the soil surface should not be neglected and can be treated as an absorbing
    layer. Its weakening impact on waves as well as its emission component is accounted
    for in the following model for the brightness temperature of the weakened scattering
    layer [62,63,64]. $$ T_{Bp} = T_{S} e_{p} \\exp ( - \\tau_{p} \\sec \\theta )
    + T_{C} (1 - \\omega_{p} )[1 - \\exp ( - \\tau_{p} \\sec \\theta )][1 + r_{p}
    \\exp ( - \\tau_{p} \\sec \\theta )] $$ (1) where p is vertical or horizontal
    polarization, TS, effective soil temperature, TC, plant temperature, pt, nadir
    vegetation opacity, pm, albedo vegetation, rp rough soil reflection, ep emissivity,
    \\(\\exp ( - \\tau_{p} \\sec \\theta )\\) surface coating penetration ability,
    and ϴ, the SMAP viewing angle which is 40 degrees. While the satellite passes
    the area, a thermal balance exists between the surface soil, plants, and air.
    This means TC and TS are equal. The MSS values can be estimated from rp using
    the Fresnel and dielectric-soil moisture relationships, rp = rH or rV as follows:
    $$ r_{H} (\\theta ) = \\left| {\\frac{{\\cos \\theta - \\sqrt {\\varepsilon -
    \\sin^{2} \\theta } }}{{\\cos \\theta + \\sqrt {\\varepsilon - \\sin^{2} \\theta
    } }}} \\right|^{2} $$ (2) $$ r_{V} (\\theta ) = \\left| {\\frac{{\\varepsilon
    \\cos \\theta - \\sqrt {\\varepsilon - \\sin^{2} \\theta } }}{{\\varepsilon \\cos
    \\theta + \\sqrt {\\varepsilon - \\sin^{2} \\theta } }}} \\right|^{2} $$ (3) where
    ϴ, the incidence angle of the SMAP satellite, is equal to 40 degrees, and ε is
    the dielectric constant of the composition of the soil. To create the GEE soil
    moisture catalog, based on the above equations and measurement methods, the productions
    of SMAP are combined with the adjusted soil moisture Palmer model with two layers
    of accuracy and Kalman filter assimilation approaches. The process decreases the
    noise in satellite datasets and increases the accuracy of the products [34, 65,
    66]. 2.3 MSS time series assessment and preprocessing Any data recorded on a time
    sequence basis constitutes a time series. These sequences are composed of two
    components: systematic patterns and random ones. The former is known as the deterministic
    term and includes periodicity, trend, and jump, while the latter is known as stochastic.
    All systematic patterns in a time series can be removed from the series, leaving
    only a stationary time series. These patterns can critically affect the modeling
    results, causing correlations in data points and consequently growth in modeling
    parameters and errors. Therefore, to decompose the time series into its constitutional
    parts, extract the meaningful components and to obtain the random part, several
    tests should be applied to the series, which are known as analyzing methods [67].
    The KPSS test is used to assess the general stationarity in time series. Based
    on this test, it can be understood whether there is a significant deviation from
    the stationarity condition or not. In the case of having meaningful non-stationarity,
    other tests can be applied to find the cause. Some conventional analytical methods
    for finding the significance of the components that cause non-stationarity are
    the ACF plot, Mann–Kendall test, and Mann–Whitney test for analyzing periodicity,
    trends, and jumps, respectively [68]. Periodicity emerges in time series as sinusoidal
    patterns in an ACF plot or can even be detected directly from the time series
    plot in cases of intense seasonality. The significance of the periodicity and
    the corresponding seasonal lag is considered to be the peaks of the sinusoidal
    fluctuations in the ACF plots. Gradual ascending or descending patterns can also
    be detected by Mann-Kendal (SMKT and MKT) tests, both seasonally and non-seasonally
    [69]. Jumps in the MSS time series can have both human and natural roots. A method
    of detecting this phenomenon and its significance in the structure of the time
    series is the Mann–Whitney (MWJ) test [70]. Each one of the above tests assesses
    one of the non-stationary factors’ significances. To determine the overall stationarity,
    the KPSS test can be used by fitting a regression line to the MSS data [71]. In
    the case of detecting a null variance for the independent variables of the regression
    equation, the stationarity assumption is approved. The significance of a parameter
    can be expressed using the corresponding probability to the test statistic. A
    test statistic’s probability (p-values) greater than a significance level of 1%
    for MWJ and 5% for SMKT and MKT and KPSS is considered a preferable condition,
    and the series is assumed to be jump-less, trend-less, or stationary. A quick
    decline in ACF values also declares the stationarity of the time series. If the
    ACF plot of the MSS time series is located in between the 95% significance intervals
    in the first few lags or n/4 of the total data, the MSS series is recognized as
    stationary, as well. The n denotes the number of the data [72]. Rejection of the
    stationarity assumption means serial correlations between time series data points.
    These correlations may occur seasonally or non-seasonally. Finding the most effective
    components in the series structure and the influential lags such as seasonal lags
    and combining them can help find model parameters and inputs more efficiently
    and promptly. This process leads to a decrease in modeling costs and errors. For
    instance, Yaseen, Ebtehaj, Bonakdari, Deo, Danandeh Mehr, Mohtar, Diop, El-shafie,
    Singh [73] studied streamflow forecasting. They used adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
    systems (ANFIS) and hybridization of ANFIS with the firefly algorithm. They chose
    their model input combination based on the information that could be extracted
    from the ACF plots, and significant lags were detected. Finally, they achieved
    the best results by structure assessment, and even more accurate results were
    obtained by implementing important seasonal lags and some of the non-seasonal
    correlated data. In a later study [74], they obtained the same level of accuracy
    in their AI models by following the same approach with greater emphasis on periodical
    temporal patterns found in the highly stochastic rainfall data. Based on these
    studies, it can be inferred that involving the structural information in choosing
    the model parameters and input selections can enhance the results of the research,
    even for DL methods. Some of the methods that are used to dampen the temporal
    patterns in periodical time series are Holt–Winters advanced exponential method,
    spectral analysis, and seasonal standardization, which are described as follows.
    Smoothing methods provide approximations of data that observe systematic patterns
    in time series. Holt–Winters is an advanced method that can omit periodicity and
    level in seasonal time series simultaneously and efficiently. This method uses
    additive and multiplicative formulas based on the condition of the time series’
    seasonality [75]. If periodicity is not constant, the multiplicative equations
    are used. Otherwise, the additive equations are utilized as follows: $$ l_{t}
    \\, = \\,\\alpha \\,(M_{SS} - S_{t - \\omega } )\\, + \\,(1 - \\alpha )(l_{t -
    1} + b_{t - 1} ) $$ (4) $$ b_{t} \\, = \\beta \\,(l_{t} - l_{t - 1} )\\, + \\,(1
    - \\,\\beta )b_{t - 1} $$ (5) $$ S_{t} \\, = \\,\\gamma \\,(M_{SS} - l_{t - 1}
    - b_{t - 1} )\\, + \\,(1 - \\gamma )S_{t - \\omega } $$ (6) $$ S_{HW} \\, = \\,M_{SS}
    + \\,\\,b_{t} + \\,S_{t - \\omega } $$ (7) where lt is level smoothing, bt, trend,
    and St, seasonal components smoothing. α, β, and γ are smoothing parameters. ω
    is the periodicity lag. SHW is the smoothed data. A second method of removing
    periodic patterns in MSS time series is spectral analysis. This method omits seasonal
    correlations by transferring time series to a frequency domain based on Fourier
    series expansion. $$ S_{A} = M_{SS} (t) - \\left[ {\\overline{{M_{SS} }} \\left(
    t \\right) + \\sum\\limits_{u = 1}^{k} {\\left( {\\alpha_{u} \\cos \\left( {2\\pi
    f_{u} t} \\right) + \\beta_{u} \\sin \\left( {2\\pi f_{u} t} \\right)} \\right)}
    + \\varepsilon \\left( t \\right)\\,} \\right],\\,\\,t = 1,2,3,...,N $$ (8) $$
    \\alpha_{u} = \\left[ {2\\sum\\limits_{t = 1}^{N} {M_{SS} (t)\\cos \\left( {2\\pi
    f_{u} t} \\right)} \\,} \\right]\\,\\,\\,/N,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,u = 1,2,...,k $$ (9)
    $$ \\beta_{u} = \\left[ {2\\sum\\limits_{t = 1}^{N} {M_{SS} (t)\\sin \\left( {2\\pi
    f_{u} t} \\right)} } \\right]/N\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,u = 1,2,...,k
    $$ (10) $$ f_{u} = \\frac{u}{N} $$ (11) where \\(\\overline{{M_{SS} }}\\) is the
    average of data points, uth is the based frequency harmony, fu, Fourier exponential
    residuals ε (t), αu and βu Fourier coefficients, k is the maximum of the harmonic
    value assumed to be 2u and 2u-1 for even and odd data, respectively. In many modeling
    methods, including AI methods, standardization of data is one of the preferred
    methods of lowering correlations in time series. This method of rescaling stationarizes
    data by using the average and standard deviation of the time series. For time
    series with seasonal patterns, average and standard deviation of lags in each
    season are utilized to obtain seasonally standardized data as follows [76]: $$
    S_{std} = (M_{SS} (\\omega ) - \\overline{{M_{SS} }} (\\omega ))/\\sigma (\\omega
    ) $$ (12) MSS(ω) is ωth data at time t, \\(\\overline{{M_{SS} }} (\\omega )\\)
    average of ωth data and the standard deviation of ωth data is \\(\\sigma (\\omega
    )\\). 2.4 Long-short term memory modeling concepts The long short-term memory
    (LSTM) model is a recent AI modeling method, renowned for modeling nonlinear sequences.
    This method is an enhanced recurrent neural network (RNN), improved for learning
    long-term dependencies in sequential data and forecasting the future steps. Historical
    information in the RNN cells is estimated in a loop-wise calculation. Hence, RNNs
    have been successful in learning sequences. The major problem of the RNN method,
    as reported by Kratzert [43], is its short memory as it can barely remember the
    information of more than ten sequences. Thus, the LSTM was introduced to overcome
    this drawback [77]. The structure of a LSTM block contains three gates that control
    the information flux and determine the output results. These gates are termed
    the input, forget, and output gates, with each one responsible for a particular
    task. For the ct memory block in LSTM, the gates control the inputs amounts that
    are permitted to enter, which inputs should not be forgotten in the estimation
    process, and finally, those outputs that are allowed to continue for further processing.
    The mapping in the LSTM block is performed by calculation of the network unit
    activations from t = 1 to t = τ with initial values C0 = 0 and h0 = 0, iteratively,
    as follows [40]: $$ f_{t} = \\sigma \\, (W_{f} M_{SS} + \\, U_{f} h_{t - 1} +
    \\, b_{f} ) $$ (13) $$ \\tilde{C}_{t} = \\, tanh \\, (M_{SS} + h_{t - 1} + ) $$
    (14) where MSS is the input vector at time t and ht−1 is the hidden state at time
    t − 1. The weight matrices are denoted by U and W for input-to-hidden, hidden-to-hidden
    connections, respectively. ft is the produced vector with values in the range
    (0–1), σ(·) depicts the logistic sigmoid function and Wf, Uf, bf, \\(W_{{\\tilde{C}_{t}
    }}\\), \\(U_{{\\tilde{C}_{t} }}\\) and \\(b_{{\\tilde{C}_{t} }}\\) represent the
    set of learnable parameters for the forget gate. The update vector is denoted
    by \\(\\tilde{C}_{t}\\) with an interval of (− 1,1). tanh (*) is the hyperbolic
    tangent. The forget gate is denoted by it with range (0,1) and is defined as follows:
    $$ i_{t} = \\sigma \\, \\left( {W_{i} x_{t} + U_{i} h_{t} - 1 + b_{i} } \\right)
    $$ (15) Wi, Ui and bi are a set of learnable parameters, defined for the input
    gate. By considering Eqs. 13–15, the cell state update can be computed as follows:
    $$ c_{t} = \\, f_{t} \\odot \\, c_{t - 1} + \\, i_{t} \\odot \\tilde{C}_{t} $$
    (16) where \\(\\odot \\) represents the element-wise multiplication. In the above
    equation, for ct values approximately equal to zero, the information should be
    forgotten, while for values close to one, they should be preserved. The definition
    of the above equation covers which stored/new information in ct−1 will be forgotten
    (values of ft of approx. 0) and which will be kept (values of ft of approx. 1).
    The last gate, which is the output gate, controls the cell state ct as follows:
    $$ o_{t} = \\sigma \\, \\left( {W_{o} x_{t} + U_{o} h_{t - 1} + b_{o} } \\right)
    $$ (17) where ot varies from (0–1), and Wo, Uo and bo are a set of learnable parameters,
    defined for the output gate. Equations 16 and 17 can be combined to form ht as
    follows: $$ h_{t} = \\, tanh\\left( {c_{t} } \\right) \\odot o_{t} $$ (18) The
    occurrence of a vanishing gradient in RNNs can exponentially decay the influence
    of the inputs on the hidden layer and the consequent output is drastically altered
    [78]. The LSTM model was developed to provide a solution for this fault in RNNs
    by considering an additive gradient structure which frequently updates the gates
    [79, 80]. Updating gates require changing the weights and model parameters. RNNs
    can keep past information in the cells for a period of time that depends on the
    weights and the past data [81] and therefore LSTM models, which were developed
    from RNNs, likewise transfer past information by changing weights and optimizing
    them. For this purpose, the LSTM needs optimization algorithms to tune its parameters
    and find the optimum results for the problem. The classic LSTM structure will
    be used in this study to ensure the parsimony principle in the modeling procedure.
    Moreover, the most influential and addressed model parameter that was reported
    in the aforementioned studies was the number of the hidden states. Therefore,
    this parameter will be optimized in this step of our research. Based on the result
    of Bouktif, Fiaz, Ouni, Serhani [55] on the impact of several built-in LSTM optimizers,
    namely root-mean-square propagation, gradient descent, and adaptive moment estimation
    (ADAM), the “Adam” optimizer is chosen. This optimizer had better and faster convergence
    than others. The maximum epochs ∈ Z = {[40, 1000]}, learn rates of ∈ R = {[0.001,
    0.1]}, dropout factor of ∈ R = {[0, 0.5]} are the conventional ranges in LSTM
    studies [17, 50, 55, 82, 83]. Therefore, the range considered for the number of
    hidden states is 1 to the number of training data, which is 198, and for the other
    specification for LSTM structure, the following values are determined based on
    the introduced ranges and trial and error in that range: Training Options (Optimizer,
    “adam,” Maximum Epochs, 1000, Initial Learn Rate, 0.005, Learn Rate Schedule,
    “piecewise,” Learn Rate Drop Factor, 0.2). In addition, the arrangement of the
    layers is: sequence Input Layer, LSTM Layer, dropout Layer, fully Connected Layer,
    and regression Layer as shown in Fig. 1, respectively. 2.5 Genetic algorithm concepts
    Finding the optimal model parameters requires a long process of trial and error
    or can be accomplished using conventional optimization methods. Optimization methods
    are used to maximize or minimize a target and find a solution to a problem that
    fits it the most. The genetic algorithm (GA) is a nature-inspired search approach
    which is derived from evolution concepts and principles and is appropriate for
    problems with a stochastic nature. The GA considers a population space of solutions
    [84] and uses the mutation and crossover of chromosomes as its basis. Following
    the random selection of two parents (chromosomes), a new population of solutions
    is generated through reproduction and attribute sharing of the parents. The performance
    of this new solution population is assessed based on their objective function.
    Those who produce the best results (best fitted to the problem) are ranked for
    selection of next parents and reproduction of the new generation. Naturally, best-fitted
    results have a higher chance of being selected as parent chromosomes. This process
    of crossover, mutation, generation of offspring, and selection of the best ones
    is repeated until the optimal solution is attained. The process is governed by
    a maximum number of iterations or convergence of the results [54, 84, 85]. While
    the GA is used to find the optimum set of parameters for a problem, the GA itself
    has several parameters that must be adjusted including the number of populations,
    the crossover rate, the mutation rate, fitness function, etc. Normally, the GA’s
    hyperparameters are set based on trial and error. According to determined values
    of the GA parameter in earlier studies, the values ranged from: population size ∈ Z = {[4,
    50]}, maximum iterations ∈ Z = {[11, 99]}, crossover percentage ∈ R = {[0.7, 0.85]},
    mutation rate ∈ R = {[0.1, 0.15]} [54, 55, 86,87,88,89]. Therefore, based on the
    reported values and some trial and error in this span, the following values are
    chosen. For the GA adjustment, the crossover rate is set to 0.8, the mutation
    rate is set to 0.1, the population size is 10, and the maximum number of iterations
    is 100. The survival method for the selection of parents and obtaining the next
    chromosomes is set as the single binary method, since the problem requires discrete
    positive integer values. The fitness criterion is also set to RMSE [55, 88, 89].
    The following pseudo-code demonstrates the whole process: As mentioned earlier,
    through random selection of the initial chromosome population, the following adjustments
    are defined for solving the problem for this study, which is finding the optimum
    number of hidden cell states. The LSTM model highly depends on historical data
    and the number of hidden states (which defines the quantity of information to
    be remembered between time steps). 2.6 Teacher-learner optimization algorithm
    concepts The teacher–learner-based optimization algorithm (TLA) is another real-life
    inspired algorithm used to optimize problem solutions. This human-inspired method
    is based on the knowledge transfer from a well-learned person in the environment
    (the best models) to a group of learners (the subsequent models) and subsequently
    choosing the next well-educated learner as the teacher for the next generation
    of learners. In this swarm-intelligence-based algorithm, the optimal solutions
    are obtained by the increase in the pupils’ grades and their interactions in the
    learner section, then passing the best results to the next generation [57, 90,
    91]. Though, this optimization method is population-based and requires the adjustment
    of a few input parameters (i.e., the population and generation (iteration) sizes),
    as a meta-heuristic algorithm it does not require any additional adjusting parameters.
    This feature makes it the most desirable optimization method for solving problems
    that have some controlling parameters themselves, e.g., LSTM. It should be noted
    that such a low-parameter method increases the efficiency and reduces modeling
    costs, therefore dominating computationally expensive optimization methods like
    GA. The TL algorithm consists of three main sections, (a) initialization, (b)
    teaching phase and (c) learning phase. In the initialization section, the algorithm
    generates random values for the parameters of the problem to obtain grades of
    the first n students in the first exam (first values of the fitness function will
    be generated). After assessment of the objective function and selection of the
    best student as the first teacher, the teaching phase starts. As expected, the
    teacher is the most highly educated person in the environment and tries to spread
    the knowledge among the pupils to rise both their individual and mean grades toward
    the teachers’ level. However, this process is limited to pupils’ capabilities
    and teaching quality. Therefore, the teacher is solely able to move the average
    of grades (fitness values) forward relying on pupils learning capacity. The improvement
    in the pupils’ mean average can be summarized as follows: the teacher in each
    iteration (Ti) tries to change the average (avgi) by updating the solution and
    subtracting it from the new average (avgn). $$ \\nabla avg_{i} = \\, Rand_{i}
    \\left( {avg_{n} {-} \\, F_{T} avg_{i} } \\right) $$ (19) where ∇avgi is the differenced
    average and Randi is a random number in the range of 0–1. The average of the current
    iteration changes with a random heuristic controlling factor related to teacher,
    (FT) equal to 1 or 2, which is relevant to the quality of teaching. Finally, the
    new solution (S) is obtained by adding the differenced average as \\(S^{\\prime}_{i}
    = \\, S_{i} + \\nabla avg_{i}\\), where S’ and S are the new and existing solutions,
    respectively. The last section, named the learning phase, is where the knowledge
    is transferred to the students. In the learners’ phase, the knowledge is disseminated
    by random interactions of the pupils. Each student learns from their peers who
    have greater knowledge, e.g., for random students of Si, Sj and grades as g(S):
    $$ \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} &IF\\;g(S_{i} ) < g(S_{j})\\;then\\;{S^{\\prime
    _{i}}} = S_{i} + rand_{i} (S_{i} {-}S_{j} )\\hfill \\\\ & Else\\;{S^{\\prime}_{i}
    } = S_{i} + rand_{i} (S_{j}{-}S_{i} ) \\hfill \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\right\\} $$
    (20) The new student will be assigned as the new teacher if they have the highest
    grade among all students. Similar to the GA method, the following pseudo-code
    shows the whole process of the model optimization: The values of the maximum number
    of students and exams corresponding to the population and generation in the GA
    method are set to the same amount to provide a comparison opportunity: maximum
    student = 10 and maximum exams = 100. 2.7 Evaluation criteria To evaluate the
    performance of the LSTM models in MSS forecasting, the correlation coefficient
    (R), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) are utilized.
    Furthermore, the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency (EN-S) is also used to assess
    the power of the LSTM model [92]. The higher the value of the EN-S, the more precise
    and powerful the model is. $$ R = \\frac{{\\left( {\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n}
    {\\left( {Mss_{O,i} - \\overline{Mss}_{O,i} } \\right)\\left( {Mss_{f,i} - \\overline{Mss}_{f,i}
    } \\right)} } \\right)}}{{\\sqrt {\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\left( {Mss_{O,i}
    - \\overline{Mss}_{O,i} } \\right)^{2} } \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\left(

    Region The study area is located in the south of the province of Quebec, Canada,
    between latitude 46° 04′ N and 46° 59′ N and longitude 70° 23′ W and 72° 30′ W.
    The area includes the end parts of the Jacques-Cartier South River, the Chaudière
    River, and the Sainte-Anne River. The catchment area covers 9325.94 km2 of land
    with a 192 m mean height above sea level and has a mean annual rainfall of 94
    mm. Situated in the northeastern part of the catchment near the Saint Lawrence
    River, Quebec City is the most important city in this zone. Based on the International
    Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) categorization scheme, vegetation in this region
    is mostly deciduous broadleaf forests, evergreen broadleaf forests [93], and woody
    Savanna. Quebec City is a census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada, and most of
    the farm headquarters and organic farms are centered around CMAs. The rising population
    in Canadian coastal regions has made the study of this zone of great importance.
    The SMAP satellite was launched in 2015; therefore, the data were collected from
    April 2015 to December 2019, every 3 days. The MSS time series used in this study
    is obtained by averaging the MSS time series measured in 32 locations. The location
    of the studied area is shown in Fig. 2. The averaged single MSS time series is
    divided into test and training intervals with a 20:80 ratio. Table 1 presents
    the statistical characteristics of the studied time series. Fig. 2 The location
    of the studied area chosen for extracting soil moisture datasets along with measuring
    locations Full size image Table 1 Statistical attributes of meteorological datasets
    (mm) Full size table 2.9 Satellite data extraction The Fishnet tool, the most
    common tool in ArcGIS software, was used to generate a grid network. The studied
    area was divided by fishnet into 20 km by 27.5 km, and 32 points were selected.
    The dimensions of the fishnet were determined according to the pixel size of the
    data, used to ensure complete coverage of the study area and that non-duplicate
    data was obtained. In the peripheral areas of the study area, points were selected
    to prevent data loss. After downloading the data in the GEE environment, the SMAP
    level 3 brightness temperature was processed to obtain the MSS values. In order
    to achieve the highest resolution while a thermal equilibrium exists between the
    earth’s phenomena in that region, an analysis of data was performed in the descending
    path (6 AM) [94]. Subsequently, the mean MSS values in each pixel were calculated.
    Then, by using the radial basis function (RBF) interpolation method, a long-term
    average of soil moisture maps was generated using ARC GIS 10.3 software (Fig.
    3a). Finally, a single time series for MSS data was extracted, shown in Fig. 3b
    from 2015 to 2019 considering all 32 stations. Interestingly, the distribution
    map of MSS shows the impact of urban development on the MSS content compared to
    rural regions. The south part of the study area preserves more soil moisture compared
    to the center and north, where population centers are located. The average time
    series generated for all stations also shows severe fluctuation in the MSS content,
    with a decreasing trend observed at extreme peaks. The average series represents
    all the locations and inherited all the structural characteristics that were found
    in these locations. Fig. 3 Distribution Map of long-term average MSS and single

    3 Results and discussions 3.1 MSS data preprocessing The conventional approach
    in determining the parameters of AI models is to use trial-and-error or optimization
    methods. In this section, based on what was described in the introduction and
    methodology, the steps of implementing the alternative method—structural-analysis-based
    methodology—are explained, alongside the achieved results. This method is more
    purposeful than trial and error, and faster and more efficient than the optimization
    methods. These results can be very useful depending on the application and the
    desired accuracy. Another feature is the ability to generalize the results of
    this method and use it in optimization methods that will be examined in future
    studies. Given the above explanations, a prerequisite to any preprocessing and
    modeling exercise is the identification of the structure of the time series and
    detecting significantly influencing components. The KPSS test is initially applied
    to assess the overall stationarity condition, and then the MKT and SMKT tests
    are used for detecting non-seasonal and seasonal trends in time series, respectively.
    The MWJ test is also used to detect the significance of the jump factor. The results
    are provided in Table 2. As the results indicate, the original surface soil moisture
    time series (MoistureSS) is jump-less as P(MWJ) = 68.78%, much higher than the
    1% significance level. A non-seasonal trend cannot be detected in the MSS time
    series (PMKT = 32.32% > 5%), while the seasonal trend is negligible (PSMK = 5.90 > 5%)
    on account of being slightly higher than the confidence level. The MSS series
    is stationary but with a low percentage (PKPSS = 9.30%). This low stationarity
    can be the result of the last non-stationary factor, the period term. A periodic
    pattern can be observed in the time series plot, and to assess the significance
    of this term, the ACF plot is presented. The ACF values were calculated and plotted
    for one-fourth of the MSS data (Fig. 3a). A significant periodicity with lag 52
    is distinctly observed in the graph. Moreover, non-seasonal correlations in time
    series exist for 9 lags. From this figure, it is concluded that the dominant factor
    in the MSS time series structure is the periodic term followed by a negligible
    seasonal trend. These two factors can increase the number of required model inputs
    up to 52 parameters when considering sole DL LSTM modeling. The characteristics
    and periodic pattern of the original MSS time series measured over a 3-day interval,
    in each location, can also be seen in weekly mean MSS data. Hence, as determined
    from the time series structural analysis, it is required to use seasonal preprocessing
    methods to decompose the series into constitutional terms. Table 2 Evaluation
    of surface soil moisture time series stationarity Full size table As the trend
    in the MSS time series is negligible, the additive Holt–Winter’s advanced exponential
    method (SHW), seasonal standardization (Sstd), and spectral analysis (SA) were
    applied to standardize the MSS time series. The resulting generated series by
    the preprocessing methods were retested, with more emphasis on removing the periodic
    pattern in their structure. The results of tests applied to the preprocessed time
    series by these preprocessing methods are also presented in Table 2. In addition,
    the ACF plots for preprocessed series are shown in Fig. 4b–d. It can be observed
    that the only method that was able to enhance the stationarity and remove periodicity
    in the MSS time series was SHW. This method improved the stationarity by 87.55%
    and, generated a complete white noise series (Fig. 4b). A 14.52%, 39.37% and 45.55%
    growth in MWJ, MKT and SMKT results were also observed. The Sstd managed to remove
    periodicity in time series and reduce the non-seasonal correlations up to 2 lags,
    as intended in the first place, but lowered the other tests’ p-value (Fig. 4c).
    The spectral analysis, on the other hand, was only able to reduce the periodicity
    to lower than the 95% significance level (Fig. 4d). The SA method, by transferring
    data to the time domain and decomposing the periodic patterns, reduced non-seasonal
    correlations to a maximum of seven non-seasonal lags but deteriorated other test
    results. The SHW preprocessing method, therefore, obtained the best results with
    the Sstd and SA methods in second and third place, respectively. In the next section,
    the process of determining the influential lags and possible influential parameters
    is addressed. Then, the results of the DL models using these parameters are presented
    and discussed for the structural-based method in two forecast horizons. Fig. 4

    by Holt–Winter’s; Sstd, seasonally standardized; SA, spectral analyzed Full size
    image 3.2 Deep learning LSTM dynamic model Based on the results obtained from
    the time-series preprocessing in the previous section, only one hidden cell state
    is expected to be required to model the SHW series as all correlations had been
    removed and the data points are all independent. Therefore, by using only the
    previous lag the next step in the time series can be forecasted. For the Sstd
    and the SA preprocessed data series, 2 and up to 7 inputs must be remembered between
    the LSTM layers during the modeling process, respectively. Since modeling noisy
    data is an inherent feature of the LSTM approach, the MSS time series without
    any preprocessing can also be modeled by LSTM, however, to model this data up
    to 9 non-seasonal lags and 52 hidden states (for seasonal lags) are required to
    be remembered. Therefore, for short-term 1-step forward LSTM modeling, the ht
    is considered equal to {1, 2, 7, 9, 52} for preprocessed series, to provide a
    comparison opportunity. To perform the modeling analysis, all AI and preprocessing
    methods were coded in MATLAB software. The results of the developed models are
    provided in Table 3. Though the LSTM (MSS, 52) produced the best results (R = 0.995,
    RMSE = 0.823, MAE = 0.744, and EN-S = 0.972), it needed 52 hts to achieve these
    results and therefore has a significantly greater computational expense than the
    other models. The results of the other developed models with fewer inputs were
    different from the LSTM model (MSS, 52), which demonstrated the importance of
    using preprocessing methods. The LSTM (SHW, 1) model, as expected, achieved R = 0.922,
    RMSE = 1.958, MAE = 1.283, EN-S = 0.844 with merely 1 hidden state. The results
    of other models using Holt–Winter with different numbers of hidden states (h = 2,
    7, 9, 52) were found to be slightly lower than LSTM (SHW, 1), which shows the
    capability of the SHW method in removing dependencies. The LSTM modeled the Sstd
    data better and more precisely as the number of hidden cell states increased up
    to 9, after which the precision significantly dropped in LSTM (Sstd, 52). Though
    it was assumed that a maximum of 2 inputs were needed (as only 2 non-seasonal
    correlations were observed in the ACF plots), because of the other non-stationary
    factors that the Sstd method created (see Table 2), the LSTM model required more
    hidden states to achieve satisfactory results. Compared to the other models investigated
    to this point, the LSTM (Sstd, 9), LSTM (Sstd, 7), LSTM (Sstd, 2), and LSTM (Sstd,
    1) produced better results than the optimal LSTM (SHW, 1) but weaker results than
    LSTM (MSS, 52). Finally, the LSTM model forecasted data using the SA series achieved
    optimal results with 9 hidden states, with a maximum R = 0.964 and minimum RMSE = 1.442.
    Similar to LSTM (Sstd) results, the LSTM (SA) required more hidden state numbers
    than those expected to achieve the best results (max. h = 7 based on ACF). The
    result of both models also dropped at h = 52. So, this method of determining the
    number of hidden states is fast and accurate, since by testing a few hts, an R > 0.90
    and RMSE < 1.9 mm precision was obtained. The gap between the different hidden
    states in LSTM (MSS), LSTM (Sstd) and LSTM (SA) was also noticeable. The only
    data preprocessing method that resulted in low precision differences amongst the
    models was the SHW method. Consequently, this question arises whether with another
    parameter a higher accuracy can be achieved or not? Table 3 Short-term deep learning
    modeling results for Surface Soil Moisture (MSS) data Full size table For a better
    comparison of optimal models, the forecasts’ scatter plots and violin plots are
    shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. It can be observed that LSTM (MSS, 52) forecasts
    are less scattered than the other three methods (all within 10% intervals) and
    the minimum values are better modeled. Correlation analysis indicated that the
    LSTM (Sstd, 9) and LSTM (SA, 9) models had a better fit and were less scattered
    than LSTM (SHW, 1); however, from Fig. 5, it is seen that they were not successful
    in forecasting the minimum values. Other models for each method considering different
    numbers of hidden states performed quite similarly to LSTM (Sstd, 9) and LSTM
    (SA, 9), respectively. None of the methods were able to forecast the minimum values
    of the MSS data, which, along with its periodicity, are considered to be the most
    significant part of the data. Consistently, models using generated pre-processed
    time series overestimated the minimum values of the MSS data. Fig. 5 The scatter
    and time series plots of the short-term forecasts (preprocessing method, h) for
    the superior models of each method Full size image Fig. 6 Violin plots of the
    top 10 LSTM forecasts vs. the observed surface soil moisture Full size image Violin
    plots [54, 95] provide the opportunity of visually comparing the statistical characteristics
    of the modeled data with observed ones. This plot combines the Box-Whiskers plot
    and probability density function of data and presents graphical information for
    data comparison more comprehensively than charts and tables. These plots are presented,
    since, in addition to model structure parsimony, it should be able to regenerate
    the core features, like mean, interquartile regions, and distribution of the original
    data [48, 96]. Figure 6 shows the violin plots of the top 10 models, as determined
    from the indices given in Table 3. As demonstrated, LSTM (Sstd, h) and LSTM (SHW,
    h) models were able to forecast the average and maximum values better than the
    LSTM (SA, h) models. The probability distribution functions of the forecasted
    data by these models are also much more similar to the original MSS data comparing
    to the LSTM (SA, h) models. With the exception of the LSTM (SA, h) models (numbers
    5 and 6 in the graph) which were distributed more uniformly compared to the original
    data, the rest of the dynamic models had a very similar distribution to the MSS
    data. This corresponds well to the observed time series plot of the LSTM (SA,
    h) in Fig. 5, where it is seen that the results were more smoothed and none of
    the fluctuations of the MSS were modeled. Although, the LSTM (MSS, 52) model obtained
    higher accuracy in terms of error indices, the statistical characteristics of
    the data were not properly estimated, as seen in the violin plot. None of the
    models were able to forecast the interquartile area or the minimum value with
    a proper degree of accuracy. Only, the LSTM (Sstd, h) and LSTM (SHW, h) models
    forecasted the maximum value and third quartiles with reasonable accuracy compared
    to the original data. In conclusion, the overall performance of LSTM (Sstd, h)
    was better than the other two in dynamic modeling, and the Sstd method was almost
    as powerful as the SHW method in removing correlations of MSS data. 3.3 Deep learning
    LSTM long-term modeling Dynamic models provide an opportunity to update the state
    of a variable and to achieve precise projection of the variable for the next step
    by using new data. This feature of dynamic models makes them ideal for making
    short-term decisions, allowing users to identify solutions to current problems
    in a timely manner. However, decision-makers are also required to undertake long-term
    planning and management, for which there is a need to obtain projections of variables
    of interest further into the future, even if such projections are accompanied
    by slightly increased error margins. For this purpose and to assess the capability
    of the LSTM model, long-term forecasting was performed using the same test period
    length with the un-preprocessed and preprocessed time series. The results of the
    developed models are presented in Table 4. Unlike the dynamic model, the LSTM
    model was not able to estimate the long-term dependencies of the un-preprocessed
    MSS data with the accuracy of the forecasted data (quantified in terms of the
    correlation coefficient) being less than 1%. As a result, this model was not considered
    further, and the corresponding indices are not presented in Table 4. The inability
    to forecast using un-preprocessed data is likely due to the intense correlation
    that was observed between the lags and the incapability of the LSTM model to transfer
    information between the layers. Also, the sole input MSS time series and its very
    small size are the other factors that failed the model to infer meaningful information
    from the data points and create future projections—the same problem that was seen
    in other studies which had small size data [16, 17, 50]. Furthermore, the predictions
    of each state are made based on those of the previous state, leading to cumulative
    errors which can increase the errors in the results. Table 4 Long-term deep learning
    modeling results for Surface Soil Moisture (MSS) data Full size table The LSTM
    model was more successful in long-term predictions when preprocessed data was
    considered. Though, it was expected to have a decrease in the correlation and
    accuracy of the model, this gap was not considerable. The LSTM (SHW, 2), LSTM
    (Sstd, 52), and LSTM (SA, 52) models were observed to produce the best results.
    The overall results (i.e., all performance metrics) of the LSTM model using the
    preprocessed data by the HW method were better than all other preprocessing methods.
    The most salient point of the results with the LSTM (SHW, h) is that the model
    achieved this precision with only h = 2, and the difference between [h = 1: h = 9]
    is negligible. A further increase in the number of hidden states from h = 9 to
    h = 52 led to a considerable decrease in the accuracy of the model. It was therefore
    concluded that using more hidden states in the LSTM block for modeling white noise
    series not only increases the computation costs, but also can decrease the accuracy
    in some cases. Figure 7 shows the scatter plots of the forecasted data compared
    to the observed data. The capability of the LSTM model in estimating the fluctuations
    and generating forecasts with a high correlation for long-term forecasts of different
    preprocessing methods is visible. The LSTM (SA, h) modeling method generated a
    rough smoothed-wise estimation of the MSS data, similar to short-term models.
    This means transferring the MSS data to the sole time domain for preprocessing
    and modeling does not produce precise results, neither for the short-term nor
    for the long-term modeling. From the plots of the LSTM (Sstd, h) and LSTM (SHW,
    h), it is clearly seen that they were more successful in modeling the fluctuations
    in time of the MSS compared to the LSTM (SA, h) models. Although all models present
    some degree of scattering in the critical low ranges of MSS, the LSTM (SHW, h)
    model forecasted the fluctuations and low values of MSS more accurately than the
    other methods. Fig. 7 The scatter and time series plots of the long-term forecasts
    (preprocessing method, ht) for the superior models of each method Full size image
    The ability of the LSTM (SHW, h) method to accurately reproduce the attributes
    of the original data can also be seen from the violin plots shown in Fig. 8. This
    method estimated the distribution shape, mean, median, and extremes with acceptable
    precision. Furthermore, the bimodal shape of the original data is properly preserved.
    Remarkably, this accuracy was achieved by using only 1 to 9 hidden states, which
    is much less costly than other methods studied. The LSTM (Sstd, h) and LSTM (SA,
    h) models were not successful in preserving the distribution of the data, with
    the results uniformly distributed even with the highest possible number of hidden
    states. Fig. 8 Violin plots of the long-term and optimized LSTM forecasts vs.
    the observed surface soil moisture Full size image 3.4 Optimization algorithms
    integrated with LSTM In this section, the results of the combination of optimization
    methods with DL LSTM are presented. The optimization methods are developed to
    skip the exhaustive process of trial and error, and in this study, they are used
    to answer the questions presented in previous sections. To optimize the ht parameter,
    the renowned GA and the relatively new TLA methods are utilized. The GA method
    is one of the most conventional and widely used methods employed for accurately
    optimizing a wide variety of problems in science and industry. The TLA is also
    selected for comparison as it is a more recent approach than GA and importantly
    has fewer controlling parameters. A significant issue with the use of optimization
    methods is that they have several controlling parameters and when they are integrated
    with algorithms like the LSTM model, which have similar parameters themselves,
    they create numerous possibilities and sophistications. Therefore, for such problems,
    a method is required with reduced complexity and consequently, lower computational
    cost. The computational system that was used to carry out the modeling methods
    had the following configurations: CPU: core i7, 4710HQ, GPU: GeForce 840 m, and
    8 Gigabytes RAM. The run-time for GA-LSTM was ~ 8 h and ~ 4.4 h for the TLA-LSTM
    method. To prepare the data for optimization algorithms, the data were standardized.
    The results of the long-term forecast of MSS data and ht optimization by the introduced
    methods are presented in Table 4. As the results show, both optimization methods
    found relatively close values for ht. The optimal ht values were found to be 32
    and 37 for the GA and TLA methods, respectively, which enhanced the results approximately
    by + 0.01 in correlation, − 0.1 in RMSE, − 0.01 in MAE and 0.02 in EN-S. The plots
    of the fitness values per iteration for both algorithms are provided in Fig. 9,
    from where it can be seen that both models reached an optimum value by using less
    than 100 iterations. Fig. 9 The graph of fitness values changes per iteration
    for both optimization algorithms Full size image Figures 8 and 10 show the violin
    and scatter plots, respectively, of the GA-LSTM and TLA-LSTM models. The violin
    plots of the two optimized models show that except for the median and mean of
    forecasts, which are almost identical to the original values, the rest of the
    characteristics of the data are not properly estimated by the model. From Fig.
    10, it is seen that although the forecasts were well-correlated to the data, with
    the majority falling between the 10% intervals, the overall shapes of the forecasts
    are smoothed and the fluctuations in MSS are not properly forecasted. The optimization
    algorithms were successful in finding a model more accurate than the models created
    by the structural analysis methodology, but they required more computational recourses
    for modeling. Fig. 10 The scatter and time series plots of the long-term forecasts
    with optimization methods Full size image 4 Discussion There are a variety of
    optimization methods that have been developed and are available for use. The LSTM
    uses the most recent Adam optimization algorithm to tune its parameters. This
    algorithm is a stochastic optimization algorithm that is a developed form of stochastic
    gradient descent. It is more efficient in computations, needs less memory, and
    works well with non-stationary and big data, and therefore, overcomes limitations
    found in some other methods [55, 97]. By using stochastic algorithms as powerful
    as Adam, the network weights are iteratively updated and are considered suitable
    even for problems that are stochastic in nature or have high levels of noise.
    This feature helps the learning algorithm choose weights randomly with a varying
    amount of data that are kept or forgotten in the cells. Therefore, the optimizer
    can converge fast, obtain global optima, and avoid getting stuck in local optima.
    However, using optimization methods for tuning weights can cause the model to
    generate a new result that differs from the previous one every time the code is
    executed. This stochastic behavior was observed in the structural-analysis-based,
    GA and TLA-LSTM modeling. During the modeling exercise with the GA-LSTM and TLA-LSTM
    algorithms, it was observed that the optimizers continued with only one ht (Gene)
    for several iterations as the objective function produced different cost function
    values. So, which result should be considered as the final result? Is averaging
    the measured indices, a solution to this problem? Should we remove the stochastic
    nature of the model? As mentioned earlier, the stochastic nature of the LSTM helps
    the model to look for optimum parameters in a vast search space with a rapid rate
    of convergence. This helps the model to find optimum results with a considerably
    reduced run time, as the LSTM was able to model the non-stationary MSS with good
    precision in less than 200 s even though this model used 52 hidden states. Likewise,
    the rest of the structural-analysis-based LSTM models achieved their best performance
    within ~ 200 s of run-time, each. By using the GA and TLA, the search space for
    finding the optimum ht was extended and instead of testing only a few hidden states’
    numbers (which were obtained by structural analysis), many hts were evaluated
    and even the best hts were tested for several time, until they were passed to
    the next generation or next population of the student. Finally, the optimum-LSTM
    models came up with a result containing the best network parameters for the problem.
    Since, the codes were developed in a way to preserve the trained network and its
    corresponding parameters, these optimal results could be replicated again. So,
    developing codes in a way that preserves the parameters of the best network for
    modeling solves the problem of random results generation. By using such an approach,
    the stochastic nature of the model will be preserved and consequently, all beneficial
    features of the stochastic algorithms will be utilized. AI has been developed
    to model the patterns in the data by imitating natural intelligence. The prevailing
    approach taken in AI modeling is that there is no need for structural analysis
    of time series because, by default, these models are considered suitable for any
    structure, especially DL methods that are powerful in modeling noisy historical
    data. By comparing the results of the models considered in this study, it was
    observed that the greater the reduction of the deterministic terms, the better
    the results are. Subsequently, models will have a greater ability to follow the
    patterns in the original data. The SHW and Sstd were powerful methods in removing
    these deterministic terms, and both short-term and long-term forecasts on the
    pre-processed series generated by these methods produced acceptable results. In
    short-term forecasting, the Sstd method was successful. This was because the forecast
    period was short and the impact of terms like trend and level were not significant.
    Furthermore, the long-term dependencies were not considerable, so the model was
    able to update states and decrease the errors. However, in long-term forecasting,
    the SHW outperformed the Sstd method as it was able to reconstruct those long-term
    characteristics of the data. Therefore, structural analysis and combining different
    preprocessing methods that fit the data structure, enhance the modeling outcomes.
    The number of controlling parameters for LSTM, GA, and TLA is another matter which
    should be considered. The LSTM model has several controlling parameters related
    to model adjustments and the Adam optimizer, which makes numerous possibilities
    when they are combined with algorithms like GA and TLA. Both optimization algorithms
    performed well and produced good results with negligible differences in performance
    metrics. It should be noted that this function is provided in conditions where
    the length of the time series is very short, and in most data-driven methods it
    is not possible to extract useful information under these conditions, as mentioned
    in the introduction [16, 17, 50]. Also, only an input time series has been used,
    in which no temporal fluctuation patterns have been extracted. For these reasons,
    it is obvious that the model was only able to predict the overall pattern of the
    data well. As a result, it is hoped that by integrating structural analysis with
    optimization models, this performance can be further improved. The TLA has much
    fewer parameters and not only has a more comprehensible structure, but also it
    can be readily tuned. As a result, compared to the GA, it is a much better option
    for use in combination with LSTM. To cover the problem of temporal pattern estimation,
    it is suggested to combine the SHW method with the TLA algorithm to find the optimum
    results. Moreover, using multi-objective optimization algorithms can also be a
    good solution to evaluate models based on several criteria and find those who
    generate the most optimum results, e.g., non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm
    II (NSGA-II) which is fast and reliable. The trained DL network parameters are
    provided for the superior methods in the “Appendix” section. Finally, it must
    be understood that soil moisture is a key component in soil studies and has a
    vast application in other study domains: to provide projections of future flood-drought
    cycles, management of water resources, irrigation planning, and hydrological earth-atmospheric
    studies [98,99,100]. This element has a complex interaction with other soil and
    atmosphere parameters, especially the air and soil temperature. The soil temperature
    and MSS influence soil properties heavily and impact attributes like the respiration
    of the soil. The significance of the MSS has even motivated researchers to estimate
    it by other parameters and different relationships [101,102,103]. Therefore, studies
    concerning novel methodologies and approaches for estimating and forecasting MSS
    are necessary. 5 Conclusions MSS is a key factor in soil and atmosphere interactions.
    Broadly, this parameter has a direct impact on the agriculture sector as well
    as its many dependent industries. To this end, in the current study, a novel structural-analysis-based
    methodology and a metaheuristic optimization algorithm are introduced to be implemented
    based on the resources, required precision and management strategies. The satellite
    products for the province of Quebec, Canada, were studied from April 2015 to December
    2019. The collected SMAP satellite data was processed in the GEE environment and
    ARC GIS software. Subsequently, a single small-size time series was extracted
    from the satellite data. In the structural-based method, the extracted time series
    was surveyed by ACF plots, Mann-Kendal, Mann–Whitney, and KPSS tests for temporal
    structural patterns. The additive Holt–Winter’s (SHW) method, seasonal standardization
    (Sstd), and spectral analysis (SA) methods were also used to generate preprocessed
    series, based on the detected temporal patterns. Reassessment of the generated
    preprocessed series revealed that all methods were able to reduce or remove the
    target periodical temporal pattern and only the SHW method was able to produce
    complete white noise. The DL LSTM model can produce desirable results in sequence
    data better than other AI methods. Thus, this model was used for short-term one-step-forward
    and long-term MSS forecasting. Based on the assessments in the first methodology,
    the amounts of hidden cell states were considered to be ht ∈ {1, 2, 7, 9, 52}.
    The preprocessed data and the original MSS data were modeled with these inputs.
    The results of short-term forecasting indicated that although achieving precise
    model results without preprocessing is possible (LSTM (MSS, 52): R = 0.995, RMSE = 0.823),
    this accuracy is dependent on a large number of model parameter inputs and is
    too computationally costly. On the other hand, with proper preprocessing the correlations
    in the MSS time series are minimized and acceptable results can be achieved with
    minimum inputs (LSTM (Sstd, 9) R = 0.970 and LSTM (SHW, 1) R = 0.922). Moreover,
    the only method that produced the best results with the expected inputs based
    on the ACF plots (LSTM(SHW,1)) was the SHW method, compared to other input numbers
    (ht = 2, 7, 9, 52). For instance, based on the ACF plots the LSTM (Sstd, h) model
    was anticipated to require only ht = 2 to produce desirable results, however,
    optimal results were only obtained by considering ht = 9. Consequently, it was
    observed that the Sstd preprocessing method and LSTM modeling produced better
    results in terms of accuracy and reproduction of statistical characteristics for
    short-term prediction followed closely by SHW. This was because in a dynamic model,
    the impacts of long-term characteristics like trend and level are not significant.
    The LSTM (SHW, h) was more capable of regenerating the long-term dependencies
    and time series attributes, and it, therefore, produced better results in long-term
    forecasting, followed by LSTM (Sstd, h). For the second method of input selection,
    the GA and TLA methods were integrated with the LSTM. The results showed that
    both methods were able to produce slightly better indices than the LSTM (SHW,
    h) and LSTM (Sstd, h) models (in terms of correlations) for long-term predictions.
    Integration of these two methods has two benefits. First, the search space for
    the optimized parameter (ht) increases greatly with many possibilities being investigated.
    Second, the LSTM was able to perform a long-term forecast of the MSS without preprocessing,
    which was not possible by structural analysis. Since TLA is parameter-free and
    less sophisticated than GA, it is much less computationally expensive and subsequently
    a better option than GA. It is suggested that other methods of preprocessing be
    investigated in LSTM modeling. Furthermore, the possibility of hybridization of
    this method with stochastic models, particularly models with exogenous inputs,
    needs to be assessed. A combination of new optimization algorithms like NSGA-II
    with LSTM should be assessed to be able to choose a better model that follows
    data patterns and statistical attributes. References Vereecken H, Huisman JA,

  description: Determining evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for water accounting
    and for the management of irrigated agriculture from farm to region. We describe
    here a collaborative initiative aimed at establishing a prototype ET network in
    six countries of North Africa and the Near East (NENA region). The network utilizes
    a low-cost and open-source system, termed the CORDOVA-ET, consisting of a base
    station and sensing nodes to collect the weather data needed to determine the
    reference and actual ET (ETo and ETa). Here, we describe the network-deployment
    processes, system architecture, data-collection methodology, quality-control procedures,
    and some of the ET results obtained so far during a four-year period, starting
    in 2018. The network has been developed as an iterative and collaborative process,
    where training and capacity building have been the main drivers. The feedback
    and experiences gathered from the users have helped improve the different versions
    of the prototypes and enhance their assembly, deployment, reliability, and ease
    of operation. At the same time, the involvement in the construction, maintenance,
    and data analysis has also provided valuable insight into calculating ET from
    energy-balance methods. The network operated during six cropping seasons and the
    results were mixed, while data integrity (hourly and daily) varied from 95 to
    23% depending on the country and season. Validation of the ET estimates was performed
    using the ECMWF ERA5 dataset as an independent reference. The energy-balance algorithm
    implemented in the system to determine the ETa was validated using the OpenCropLib
    Python library. While the results of the data validation demonstrated the reliability
    and accuracy of the CORDOVA-ET system, network operations required significant
    support and special motivation on the part of the users. It is concluded that
    collaboration among users, together with the support services and participation
    of different stakeholders interested in agricultural water management, would be
    essential elements to ensure the sustainability of the ET network.

    essential elements to ensure the sustainability of the ET network. Keywords: evapotranspiration;
    CORDOVA-ET; ET network; irrigation management; agrometeorology 1. Introduction
    Given the current situation of rising temperatures and the changes in precipitation
    patterns influenced by climate change together with the occurrence of more intense
    droughts, the optimization of water use is becoming a central issue, particularly
    in countries with chronic water scarcity. Regarding agricultural water resource
    usage, the focus should be on obtaining the maximum yield with the minimum amount
    of water via optimal irrigation practices. Knowledge of crop water consumption
    or evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to determine the adequate amount and frequency
    of irrigation water applications. The two ET components, evaporation from soil
    and crop transpiration, which are difficult to separate in practice, constitute
    the crop water requirements and, after deducting the effective rainfall, the net
    irrigation needs. The California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS)
    in the USA, for instance, is a network of over 145 automated weather stations
    in California that began in 1982 [1]. These stations collect agrometeorological
    variables to provide reference evapotranspiration information for different regions
    [2]. The data are free and available online to farmers, water managers, and the
    public. CIMIS network is extensively used in California for irrigation scheduling,
    water management, and weather forecasting [3]. Similarly, the “Red de Información
    Agroclimática de Andalucía” (RIAA) [4] in Andalusia, Spain, operational since
    1999, has about one hundred automatic weather stations distributed throughout
    all irrigable areas, that offer essential meteorological data and ETo information,
    especially crucial for irrigation scheduling in a drought-prone region [5]. In
    Texas, there have been substantial efforts in utilizing ET data for irrigation
    management, though it has faced challenges in sustaining its ET networks over
    extended periods [6]. These efforts emphasize the need for network coordination
    and integration to avoid errors from lack of standardization and varying ET computation
    methods. Moreover, these networks require extensive maintenance of equipment,
    data collection, and quality assessment for their expansion to other countries
    and regions. To establish a successful regional ET information network, several
    requisites must be met. Firstly, the network must be able to provide accurate
    ET data that can be effectively used by policymakers, water managers, and other
    end-users. Secondly, the network must have a cost-effective and sustainable operational
    model. Thirdly, the network must be able to provide timely data to potential users
    and must be properly maintained over the long run. The FAO project “Water efficiency,
    productivity and sustainability in the NENA regions” (Project GCP/RNE/009/SWE)
    funded the establishment of a regional ET network in countries of the Near East
    and North Africa region. The project aimed to provide experts and water users
    with accurate ET data to enable them to make informed decisions about water accounting
    and water productivity. The deployment of the ET network involved several steps,
    starting with the development of a novel, cost-effective ET measuring device which
    is fully described in Jimenez-Berni et al. [7]. The next steps included identifying
    suitable partners and locations, station deployment, equipment calibration, adequate
    team training, and, finally, collecting, analyzing, and disseminating the ET data.
    Ideally, the network should be integrated into the existing water-management information
    systems to provide timely and accurate data to potential users. Regional ET networks
    can provide a platform for collecting and sharing data, identifying best practices,
    and developing applications to assist in regional water-management strategies.
    The establishment of regional networks, however, can be challenging, requiring
    high upfront costs and regular maintenance for their sustainability. Regarding
    agrometeorological information, the standard is a weather station with research-grade
    sensors typically used in scientific applications, which are costly. An alternative,
    tested in this work, is an inexpensive device which uses industrial-grade and
    commercial off-the-shelf sensors. Jimenez-Berni et al. [7] presents the description
    and test of the CORDOVA-ET station, a cost-effective and easy-to-maintain unit
    which has been used in the ET regional network described herein. An important
    advantage of this system is that it permits collecting crop ET (ETa) data in addition
    to determining the ETo [7]. The objectives of this work are to describe the deployment
    of such stations in different countries and institutions of the NENA region, to
    assess their performance in determining the ETa and ETo, to describe the major
    issues associated with network development, and to evaluate the suitability of
    the CORDOVA-ET for use in an ET network in the NENA region. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Network Components 2.1.1. The CORDOVA-ET System The COnductance Recording
    Device for Observation and Validation of EvapoTranspiration (CORDOVA-ET) system
    [7] is a device designed for measuring the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) using
    the energy-balance approach. The system consists of hardware components to measure
    primary meteorological variables, a communication infrastructure based on wireless
    protocols, and data-handling devices and algorithms to generate ETa estimates.
    A standard deployment of the CORDOVA-ET consists of four sensing nodes, a pyranometer
    node, and a base station. The following is a brief description which summarizes
    the system components: The sensing node consists of various sensors for measuring
    different variables: Air temperature and humidity, canopy temperature, and soil
    temperature. These sensors are connected to a low power operation microcontroller
    that allow network communication and programming capabilities. The base station
    includes a commercial weather station and a gateway that receives nodes data and
    transmits them to the cloud. The pyranometer node consists of a commercial pyranometer
    and a microcontroller that transmits the data the same way as the sensing nodes
    do. The system is solar and battery powered. The system operates wirelessly using
    LoRaWAN, a low-power communication protocol. The data are encrypted and managed
    by The Things Network (TTN), a LoRaWAN infrastructure. They are then retrieved
    using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol and stored in InfluxDB,
    a time-series database. Real-time visualization is achieved through Grafana, an
    open-source monitoring tool. All components can be deployed on physical or cloud
    servers, utilizing Docker containers for easy replication. Table 1 summarizes
    the main components of the system hardware Full description and details can be
    found in [7]. Table 1. Summary of the main components of the CORDOVA-ET system.
    The device was conceived as an open-source and hardware alternative to commercial
    equipment, and using a collaborative approach that would allow a community of
    users to build their own system. All the details regarding the CORDOVA-ET device
    and its field validation tests can be found in Jimenez-Berni et al. 2023 [7].
    This study is focused on the data obtained during the six study seasons from 2020
    to 2022 in various crops in different areas of countries in the NENA region. 2.1.2.
    Participant Countries Institutions of seven participant countries (Algeria, Egypt,
    Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, and Palestine) of the FAO “Water efficiency,
    productivity and sustainability in the NENA region” project joined the development
    of a regional network for the field measurements of evapotranspiration. At least
    two sites were established in each country, except in the case of Algeria, where
    the efforts to deploy the stations encountered diverse problems, making it difficult
    to correctly operate them. Therefore, we report here the data collection in six
    countries. Table 2 presents the list of locations, institutions, and the CORDOVA-ET
    versions deployed. Table 2. Locations where the CORDOVA-ET equipment was deployed
    in every country. The CORDOVA-ET systems were delivered at different times to
    the participating countries. Egypt was the earliest adopter of the system. The
    first version of the prototype was deployed in February 2019 in Egypt, while Palestine
    installed its first station in 2022. The rest of the countries deployed their
    systems between December 2019 and February 2020 (Table 3). One major reason for
    the variations of delivery times among countries of the different versions of
    the CORDOVA-ET was related to the custom requirements, which differed among countries,
    with the consequent delays in the deliveries to the different countries. Table
    3. Growing seasons or campaigns in each country, showing the crops, start and
    end dates, and location for each season. For each location, available ETa data
    were retrieved for six different cropping seasons, starting in December 2019 and
    ending in December 2022. Table 3 summarizes the crops and their sowing and harvest
    dates for every season in each country. 2.1.3. Data Collection The data from the
    different deployments are uploaded to a central server in real time using the
    LoRaWAN infrastructure of The Things Networks. The data are stored in a database
    (InfluxDB) and available for quick visualization using Grafana as the front-end.
    This is a very dynamic way to visualize the real-time data, and identify gaps
    and issues (e.g., faulty sensors). The data can be downloaded directly from Grafana
    or, easier, from a web-based tool called “CORDOVA-ET Data Download” (current version:
    2.2.0), either from the main menu in Grafana or directly accessed from a direct
    link. In the tool, users have the option to choose the CORDOVA-ET deployment they
    want based on factors such as the country, season, and crop. They can specify
    the start and end dates for the deployment, and also select the preferred data
    format from the available drop-down menu. A small graph for visualizing the data
    status presents the air temperature from the weather station as a quick way to
    identify potential data gaps. When the user presses Download, the data are generated
    in the server and prepared for download as an Excel file. The meaning of each
    of the column headers is detailed in Appendix A (Table A2). The application is
    built using Python and leveraging the power of Plotly-Dash, https://plotly.com/dash/
    (accessed on 20 October 2023) and the OpenCropLib library [8] for the ET calculations
    using energy balance. At present, the web-based application is running successfully
    on Heroku, a popular cloud platform. The metadata required for the application
    of the different algorithms (e.g., deployment location, sensor height, calibration
    coefficients for pyranometers) are hosted in GitHub, https://github.com/OpenAgriTech/CORDOVA-ET-metadata
    (accessed on 20 October 2023) and publicly available to ensure traceability and
    repeatability of the data. Different formats are available for download at different
    timesteps and information levels; for example, raw data from weather station and
    nodes can be downloaded in 10 and 30 min timesteps. Energy-balance calculations
    of the ETo and ETa can be downloaded at 30, 60 m, and daily. This includes not
    just the ETa calculated at each node, but also the intermediate calculations of
    the energy components: sensible heat, aerodynamic resistance, net radiation, and
    latent heat. The application also allows exporting to standard data formats, such
    as comma-separated values (CSVs) and Excel. 2.1.4. Participant Involvement For
    the correct implementation of the CORDOVA-ET station network, close communication
    with the core developers from the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture (IAS-CSIC)
    and the Universidad of Cordoba was crucial, named here as the Network Development
    Team (ND team). The ND team oversaw the logistics of the delivery of the stations,
    inspected the correct deployment of the equipment, either through field missions
    in the different countries or remotely, and carried out the data and sensor measurements’
    quality control. Additionally, there was a local expert responsible that belonged
    to the institution to which the station was assigned by the FAO, as well as a
    group of technicians and engineers who participated in the data collection, management,
    and maintenance. This group interacts directly with the person in charge at the
    country level, since there is more than one station in different institutions
    in each country; this hierarchy in communications was established to accelerate
    the speed of response and to optimize resources. 2.2. Methodology for Data Validation
    To validate the data collected by the CORDOVA-ET at the different locations and
    field seasons, a standard dataset for gridded weather variables was needed in
    the absence of high-quality weather station datasets. We have used the ERA5 from
    the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for this purpose.
    The ERA5 provides a range of meteorological variables, such as temperature, humidity,
    wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation, at various
    spatial and temporal resolutions. The data are produced using a combination of
    observations from various sources, such as satellites, ground-based stations,
    aircraft, and a numerical weather-prediction model. ERA5 is the fifth generation
    of ECMWF’s atmospheric reanalysis dataset, which spans the period from 1979 to
    the present. It is widely used for a range of applications, including climate
    research, meteorology, and weather forecasting. The data are available to the
    public through ECMWF’s data servers and can be accessed using various software
    tools and programming languages. The validation methodology used here is similar
    to the one followed by other researchers who were investigating the feasibility
    of using ERA5 in crop modeling to complement, or even replace, the observations
    of local weather stations [9,10,11,12]. Hourly data for the main weather variables
    (air temperature and humidity at 2 m, wind speed at 10 m and solar radiation)
    were downloaded from ERA5 using Python scripts. Daily aggregates of the weather
    variables required for the calculation of the ETo using FAO56 were downloaded
    using the local time zone for each site. The raw data from the weather station
    and nodes were downloaded from the CORDOVA-ET server and aggregated into hourly
    and daily intervals. The ETo was calculated on an hourly basis, as well as daily,
    following FAO56 and ASCE using the refET library https://github.com/WSWUP/RefET
    (accessed on 20 October 2023). In cases where the height for the weather station
    was not standard (2 m), a correction for the wind speed was performed according
    to FAO56. For each country, the data for each season were calculated and plotted
    showing the ETo estimates of the CORDOVA-ET and the ETo extracted from ERA5 for
    the coordinates of each site. Daily ETa was calculated as described in Jimenez-Berni
    et al. [7], where the sum of the latent heat (LE) was converted to mm/day. For
    cases where daily data were incomplete, an estimate of the daily ETa was calculated
    based on the partial observations of hourly instantaneous calculations (ETa alt).
    The algorithm is similar to the approach followed by algorithms used with remote
    sensing, where the observations are instantaneous (taken at the time of satellite
    flights over the area). The evaporative fraction, EF, (hourly ETa/ETo) is then
    extrapolated to the rest of the day: ET a alt= ET o EF hourly c (1) where ETa
    and ETo are daily estimates, and EF is the average of ETa/ETo values calculated
    from the hourly data when solar radiation is above 400 W/m2. 3. Results and Discussion
    3.1. Training, Communication, and Support 3.1.1. Training and Coaching The initial
    philosophy behind the network was to fully empower all the participants with the
    knowledge required to assemble, deploy, and run the CORDOVA-ET instrument, and
    also to analyze the collected data and maintain the equipment. Therefore, users’
    training was considered a crucial step in the development of the network. It was
    considered important to ensure that all users would understand well how to assemble,
    use, and maintain the equipment correctly. Training took many forms, such as instructional
    videos, user manuals, and in-person or online training sessions. The ND team trained
    all personnel from the participant countries in the use, assembly, deployment,
    and maintenance of the CORDOVA-ET system. Several in-person workshops were conducted
    in Cordoba and in the NENA region, as well as online. This training targeted technical
    specialists in the field of agrometeorology to provide them with the knowledge
    needed to adopt the CORDOVA-ET system. Participants received the materials and
    instruction necessary to assemble and operate a complete CORDOVA-ET system. Upon
    completion of the program, country representatives took ownership of their CORDOVA-ET
    systems, transporting and installing them at the agreed-upon sites within their
    countries. Once operative, they were responsible for operation and maintenance.
    Under this framework, the training had the following specific objectives: To give
    participants a deeper understanding of the various ways to determine evapotranspiration,
    focusing on the calculation method behind the CORDOVA-ET system; To provide an
    overview of the system components and the manufacturing process, from procurement
    to assembly; To review the critical steps in the set-up of the equipment, data
    retrieval, and quality checks; To develop the autonomy of the participant to monitor,
    update, and maintain the equipment; To devise the ET measurement plans according
    to the project objectives in each of the countries involved. As the system evolved,
    several online workshops were conducted to provide training to the members of
    the network on the new features and advancements made. These workshops served
    as a platform to educate participants about the latest updates, enhancements,
    and improvements which were incorporated into the system over time. The combination
    of in situ training and local problem-solving through backstopping missions strengthened
    the capacity of the participating countries to effectively utilize and maintain
    the technology. It also fostered a closer relationship between the ND team and
    the local stakeholders, promoting collaboration and knowledge exchange. Overall,
    the backstopping missions played a crucial role in ensuring the successful adoption
    and sustainable use of the technology within the participating countries. 3.1.2.
    Establishing a Support Network At the early stages of the network, there were
    two main ways for communication among the users and developers of the ET network:
    By video conferencing using a collaboration platform that unifies chat, voice,
    video, and file sharing (e.g., Zoom). It is designed to be used by local, remote,
    and distributed work groups. It was mainly used to carry out e-training and webinars;
    Multiple chat groups (WhatsApp) were established for the ET network participants,
    serving distinct purposes facilitating real-time communication, enabling active
    engagement, and quick problem-solving for the community. Separate chat groups
    were created for each specific country, allowing participants to address country-specific
    concerns, exchange localized ideas, and address unique challenges efficiently.
    The dynamic nature of these chat groups promoted effective and seamless communication.
    Although there were multiple communication channels, the community involved in
    the training courses, the deployment of the stations, and data collection and
    manipulation did not have a single platform established where the users could
    interact among them and with the ND team. Therefore, in December 2020, it was
    proposed to create a web-based portal for discussion and exchange between CORDOVA-ET
    users and the ND team to facilitate effective online communication, feedback,
    and collaboration. To enable every person working on the CORDOVA-ET system to
    exchange experiences, ideas, problems found, and possible solutions, the platform
    was required to meet the following requisites: Accessible meeting place with a
    graphical interface; Ease of use; Effective and affordable; Permanent access;
    Longevity; Easy file storage and exchange. The best platform that meets the requirements
    listed above is Dgroups. In terms of formal organization, the Dgroups Partnership
    is a cofunded project of Bellanet/IDRC, financed by the partners and members,
    comprising a diverse group, including international or intergovernmental organizations,
    such as the World Bank, UNAIDS, FAO, CTA; government agencies, such as Danida,
    DFID, IDRC, Sida, SDC; national and international NGOs, like ICCO, Hivos, OneWorld,
    KIT, SNV; ICT- and knowledge-focused institutes/projects, such as IICD and Bellanet
    [13]. The Dgroups platform was selected for the following reasons: All the groups
    participating in the project were already members of it; There was already an
    active community created on Water Productivity and Agriculture https://dgroups.org/fao/waterproductivity
    (accessed on 3 October 2023); There was the possibility to create a subgroup under
    the Water Productivity group, so that the CORDOVA-ET users would have access to
    all the documentation, not only related to the CORDOVA-ET, but also other topics
    related to water productivity; The users did not need to change platforms to organize
    their knowledge and files; Files were easily accessible; While WhatsApp is fast
    and easy, it is very difficult to have all conversations organized and accessible
    to everyone. Dgroups allows you to access the organized conversations and files
    easily at any time. The use of the Dgroups platform did not exclude the use of
    the WhatsApp chat, but complemented it. However, a forum tends to be asynchronous
    and visitors can catch up the conversations at any time reading previous posts.
    This is not viable in WhatsApp, where a conversation or topic could be easily
    missed. 3.2. CORDOVA-ET System Upgrades These prototypes evolved over time through
    a trial-and-error process based on our own experience, and more importantly, thanks
    to the feedback received from the early adopters and initial users. The expansion
    and adoption of the system therefore followed a collaborative approach. Since
    the original system development, several components have been upgraded, as described
    below. 3.2.1. Sensor Upgrades The sensors integrated in the nodes are a fundamental
    component of the CORDOVA-ET, as they sense the infrared temperature and air temperature
    and humidity required for the calculation of the sensible heat used in the energy-balance
    approach followed to estimate the actual evapotranspiration. Figure A1 of Appendix
    A depicts pictures of both the original and the improved sensors used in the CORDOVA-ET
    station. Below is a description of the issues found and the implemented solutions:
    The initial prototypes of the air-temperature sensor used the BME280 (Bosch, Gerlingen,
    Germany) sensor, integrated into a completely 3D-printed radiation shield and
    sensor holder. The large size of the electronic board provides large thermal mass
    and makes it not really suitable for precise applications; therefore, the second
    prototype, based on the SHT35 (Sensirion, Stäfa, Switzerland) manufactured by
    ClosedCube (London, UK), was used and integrated into the 3D-printed radiation
    shield. This new sensor provided a thermal design based on the manufacturer’s
    specifications and included a protective cap to avoid water and dust to enter
    in the sensor. A newly upgraded sensor, also based on the SHT35, was tested (Hunan
    Rika Electronic Tech Co.,Ltd., Changsha, Hunan, China). The new sensor is completely
    encapsulated and isolated from direct water and dust due to a PTFE membrane. Also,
    this new sensor does not require soldering to connect it to the system, as the
    connector comes already integrated according to our specifications. The sensor
    comes as a kit with a commercial radiation shield with a stainless-steel mounting
    bracket. This represents a quantum leap from the original 3D-printed sensors;
    The original Canopy Infrared Temperature sensors have undergone a modification
    to include connector and preassembled cables, which provide plug-and-play without
    need of any soldering. On the other hand, the 3D-printed enclosure for the canopy-temperature
    sensor remains unchanged; designs and 3D printer files are available in GitHub:
    https://github.com/OpenAgriTech/CORDOVA-ET-Hardware (accessed on 20 October 2023).
    The removal of soldering steps and the shipment of preprinted sensors improved
    the efficiency and ensured the availability of spare parts at all times; A soil-temperature
    sensor was also included in the initial prototypes, with the goal of measuring
    soil temperature for crop simulation purposes and potentially calculating soil
    heat flux. The sensor is relatively simple, uses the One-Wire protocol, and has
    not been problematic. The main issues were due to damaged cables by tillage or
    animals, as well as incorrect assembly. The initial version used field-replaceable
    connectors, which required certain experience to ensure proper assembly. A plug-and-play
    solution was provided by substituting an unassembled sensor for a soil sensor
    that had the connector integrated; The initial pyranometer sensor prototypes included
    a custom design based on a multispectral sensor (AS7262, AMS-Osram, Premstaetten,
    Austria) and a 3D-printed housing. The idea behind using multispectral sensors
    is that it could help to estimate shortwave radiation as well as the PAR component.
    Also, a version in the red–NIR region (AS7263) could be potentially used to estimate
    NDVI and other spectral indices when combined with a downward-looking sensor.
    However, because of the importance of solar radiation in the energy balance, a
    new commercial pyranometer, SP-110-SS, (Apogee Instruments, Inc., North Logan,
    UT, USA) was incorporated into the upgraded CORDOVA-ET. It was decided to have
    only one high-quality pyranometer for the whole system to keep down the costs
    and to remove the original pyranometers from the four nodes, assuming that radiation
    does not vary within the distances among the nodes. The new pyranometer node consists
    of the pyranometer itself, the data logger based on the original node and an accurate
    18-bit analog-to-digital converter, and a solar panel, as described in detail
    in Jimenez-Berni et al. [7]. The node provides a rugged circular connector for
    easy connection to data loggers and controllers, and it simplifies sensor removal
    and replacement for maintenance and recalibration. 3.2.2. Data Logger Users also
    found some difficulties building the initial versions of the data logger. Therefore,
    there has been some evolution in this component as well. Baseboard. A custom-designed
    printed circuit board (PCB) is used to hold the LoPy4 microcontroller and interface
    the different sensors. The board evolved from using through-hole components to
    the surface-mount to avoid any soldering. Also, the board has been designed to
    fit the specific enclosure without the need of any mounting plate. All the connections
    are clearly marked and are aligned with the circular connectors for the sensors
    that are unique for each sensor to avoid confusion. Additionally, two switches
    were incorporated on the baseboard for power and selecting between the different
    operating modes: run, firmware upgrade, or setup. This facilitates easy management
    and configuration of the node as needed. Another upgrade requested by the users
    was the possibility of providing offline data recording to avoid data loss when
    the LoRaWAN network was offline. A microSD card slot was added and the software
    adapted to provide local storage into comma-separated values (CSV). Since the
    LoPy4 does not have a battery-backed real-time clock (RTC) that allows it to hold
    the time during power cycle or reset, it has a connector for an external RTC device.
    The software was modified to provide a way to synchronize the internal clock and
    RTC with the LoRaWAN server regularly. Solar-regulator connectors. The original
    solar regulator required soldering and screw terminals for the power output and
    inputs, respectively. The new power supply components were modified to make it
    plug-and-play without any need for soldering. This eliminated several issues of
    damaged cables or solder joints in this component, resulting in improved reliability.
    Data-logging software. The software that reads the sensor data and transmits the
    measurements over LoRaWAN has undergone several iterations, which can be summarized
    as follows o The LoRaWAN keys are unique for each board and generated from the
    hardware address of the LoRa and SigFox radios. In the initial versions, users
    generated the LoRaWAN keys from The Things Network (TTN) console, which required
    programming each node individually with the specific keys. This could have led
    to mistakes and duplicated keys in different nodes. Now, the software will show
    the keys in a serial terminal, and users can copy these keys when registering
    the nodes in the TTN, avoiding potential issues with the key generation; o The
    code is unique for all the node types (different hardware revisions, normal nodes,
    and pyranometers). The user can select the operating mode using the serial console
    or remotely using LoRaWAN downlink messages. This prevents configuration issues,
    and nodes can be programmed only once; o An interactive mode is available on the
    serial console for configuration and debugging. When the mode switch is moved
    to the setup position, the board enters into an interactive mode that can be accessed
    when connected with the serial console or by WiFi. This allows users to read the
    LoRaWAN keys, test the sensors, or change the type of the node from standard to
    pyranometer. This was very effective during the setup process; o A time-synchronization
    routine is executed twice a day for time synchronization from the LoRaWAN server.
    The routine determines the offset between the internal LoPy4 clock and the server,
    which upgrades the clock accordingly and provides actual time for data storage
    in the microSD card; o The nodes can upgrade the software and firmware using WiFi
    if they are close enough to the WiFi provided by the base station. This over-the-air
    (OTA) upgrade can be triggered manually in the setup mode or remotely using a
    LoRaWAN downlink command. 3.2.3. Base Station The solar-powered base station includes
    the LoRaWAN gateway and a 4G modem. The initial solar capacity was insufficient
    and was upgraded from 25 W to 50 W, with larger panels or double the number of
    smaller panels. The battery was also upgraded using two 9 Ah standard batteries
    or one 14 Ah that fit in the standard enclosure. Gateway and modem improvements.
    The initial version of the base station consisted of separated components for
    the LoRaWAN gateway (TTN Indoor Gateway, The Thing Industries, Amsterdam, Netherlands)
    and the 4G modem (RUT 240, Teltonika, Vilnius, Lithuania). These components were
    rated for indoor use; therefore, they were put in an enclosure to provide ingress
    protection. Having only an internal antenna could limit the range of the LoRaWAN
    communications. A second version of the base station used a single device that
    included the LoRaWAN module and 4G communications (DLOS8, Dragino, China) in an
    outdoor-rated device. This simplified installation and configuration, as there
    is only one device. Commercial weather station. The original weather station (WH4000
    SE, Froggit, Brandenburg, Germany) included an interactive display that showed
    the weather variables while providing WiFi data upload to a custom server. In
    a second hardware iteration, the station was upgraded to the model WH3000SE, that
    used a small WiFi receiver for WiFi transmission, reducing the size and power
    consumption. This receiver supports other instruments from Froggit, such as the
    soil-moisture sensors. 3.3. Communication Issues and Data Integrity An analysis
    of data completeness was performed by calculating the ratio of actual observations
    over the theoretical number of observations for every season, taking into account
    the duration of each crop cycle. The general analysis of data integrity shows
    a strong variation in performance across the different countries (Egypt, eg; Jordan,
    jo; Lebanon, le; Morocco, ma; Palestine, ps; Tunisia, tn) and seasons (season
    1 = 1UTC; season 2 = 2UTC; …). The analysis at the daily scale (Figure 1), using
    complete days where the ETo can be estimated, shows that Lebanon has almost 100%
    of data availability for the ETo calculation. In this particular case, the gaps
    in the weather data from the CORDOVA-ET were filled with backup data from the
    weather station deployed in the field owned by the Lebanese Agricultural Research
    Institute (LARI), providing seamless integration with the data-processing algorithms.
    In other countries, data integrity ranged from 23 to 93% depending on the country
    and season. Figure 1. Data integrity analysis of daily data, considering the complete
    days with ETo calculations. The hourly data integrity (Figure 2), calculated as
    the number of hours when the ETa can be calculated, shows less completeness, mostly
    due to problems in the communication or power issues in the base station. If the
    base station stops, all the communication from the nodes and the weather station
    stops. Some other times, the weather station stopped transmitting data while the
    nodes still transmitted. However, in that case, it was not possible to compute
    the ETa because some weather variable collected by the base station was missing.
    Figure 2. Data integrity analysis of the hourly data, calculated as the ratio
    of the number of hourly calculated ETa estimations over the theoretical number
    of observations. Having a completely open-source and flexible system like the
    CORDOVA-ET also allows it to incorporate other data sources, such as local weather
    station data or online datasets, that could be used to fill the gaps in case of
    any failure. The data discussed below are strictly those recorded by the CORDOVA-ET
    systems in each country during the six campaigns of this study, from the winter
    of 2019–2020 until the end of 2022. 3.3.1. Egypt The two first deployments of
    the network were in two locations in Egypt: Zankaloun and Sakha. In Zankaloun,
    it was not possible to record data until the second season due to the SIM card
    not working. In Sakha, data were recorded from the first season, despite receiving
    the CORDOVA-ET system later than in Zankaloun. Both stations had minor data gaps
    in the first two seasons of 2020, which unfortunately were the only campaigns
    where data for validation were available. This is attributed to the fact that
    an early version of the system was deployed and suffered from the problems mentioned
    above. For instance, nodes progressively failed due to electronic issues caused
    by water and dust. These data gaps made it impossible to conduct the energy-balance
    calculations. Once the new version was upgraded, replacement sensors and connectors
    were sent, but issues with the communication between the weather station and the
    base station resulted in a lack of weather data for these two sites in the subsequent
    growing periods. This was caused by the lack of a functional SIM card, and the
    lack of adequate maintenance and the proper replacement of the faulty sensors.
    3.3.2. Jordan The station was installed halfway through the crop cycle in the
    first season. Season 1 worked well with minor gaps until the end of season 2 (November
    2020). To carry out maintenance work, the station was removed after harvesting
    the season 2 crop. In January 2021, the station was reinstalled again for season
    3, gathering a very good dataset with 93% data integrity. In season 4, the importance
    of correctly placing sensors was highlighted, as the recorded canopy temperature
    reached 55 degrees Celsius, which indicates that the sensors were probably detecting
    soil rather than plant temperatures. When the ground cover increased as the crop
    developed, canopy temperatures decreased markedly, being similar to air temperatures.
    This suggests that the canopy-temperature sensor was oriented along the crop rows
    in a way that it measured the temperature of the soil surface rather than the
    crop. Consequently, the data integrity for calculating the ETo was 88%, while
    the ETa could only be calculated for 30% of the data due to the canopy temperature
    errors. During season 5, there was a lack of data from the nodes due to communication
    failure with the base station, reducing the integrity of the hourly ETa data.
    3.3.3. Lebanon The CORDOVA-ET system was installed in Tal al Amara (Lebanon) in
    2020. Its Froggit weather station experienced some port blocking issues by the
    mobile phone operator that prevented its communication with the server. In this
    case, we have used the data from the weather station operated by LARI for comparisons.
    The data were uploaded to the server using custom scripts to make it available
    to the data processing. Due to power failures, only two of the four nodes for
    ETa determination worked properly over the years. 3.3.4. Morocco The initial seasons
    in Morocco provided very irregular datasets due to continuous communication and
    power issues in the base station. Moreover, one of the main problems found in
    this deployment was that the sensors were installed below the crop canopy, so
    reliable measurements were drastically reduced. 3.3.5. Tunisia During the first
    season, the nodes for measuring ETa experienced battery issues (except for one
    node), causing intermittent data gaps. The data from season 2 correlated very
    well with a comparative dataset, with some small data gaps. There were communication
    and sensor issues that resulted in incomplete datasets and missing seasons (from
    the end of season 3 until midseason 5). There were also some known issues with
    the precipitation data due to a bug in the firmware of the weather station. The
    daily rainfall values were not reset correctly, resulting in repeated values,
    even when there was no precipitation. This was fixed in the firmware later in
    season 5. Finally, in the last season, the issues were solved, and a good dataset
    was obtained with minor gaps. In addition, a new deployment system was added to
    Tunisia, which has been working correctly since the end of June 2022 with good
    data integrity. 3.3.6. Palestine Palestine was the last country that was incorporated
    to the NENA ET network, so there are only two seasons of data. In both cases,
    there were data gaps due to issues with the SIM card and communication issues
    with the CORDOVA-ET server. In the case of season 6, the data were very limited
    and the observations of the ETo and ETa are scarce, as discussed below. 3.4. Validation
    of Individual Meteorological Variables and Estimates of ET Throughout the season
    and across different countries, the primary weather variables, as well as the
    calculations of reference evapotranspiration, were compared with the ERA5 data.
    By conducting these comparisons, we aimed to validate the reliability and robustness
    of the ET calculations, further enhancing the integrity and confidence in the
    dataset obtained. This comparison involved a comprehensive analysis of ETa values,
    ensuring a thorough evaluation of the accuracy and consistency of the estimated
    evapotranspiration values in relation to the reference data provided by ERA5.
    3.4.1. Primary Weather Variables Comparing the data of a new device is of utmost
    importance to assess its reliability and accuracy. When introducing a novel device
    into a system or study, it is essential to evaluate its performance against established
    standards or reference devices. This comparative analysis allows for the identification
    of potential discrepancies, biases, or limitations in the new device’s measurements.
    By comparing data, researchers and practitioners can determine the device’s level
    of accuracy and reliability, enabling informed decision-making and ensuring the
    validity of subsequent analyses and interpretations. Furthermore, this process
    helps establish confidence in the new device’s capabilities and builds trust in
    the collected data. It enables users to identify any potential variations or deviations
    from expected results and implement appropriate adjustments or calibrations as
    needed. Ultimately, the act of comparing data from a new device is crucial for
    ensuring data quality, facilitating meaningful comparisons, and enhancing the
    overall robustness of scientific and technical investigations. The comparison
    of the data obtained from the variables of the CORDOVA-ET with ERA5 reveals crucial
    information about the studied meteorological variables. These results provide
    a statistical understanding of the analyzed variables (Table 4) and their relationship
    with the predictors used in the study. Detailed analysis for each variable is
    available in Appendix A (Figure A2, Figure A3, Figure A4 and Figure A5). Table
    4. Validation of weather variables comparing the ERA5 data. Average metrics across
    all the seasons and sites. Air temperature showed a very good agreement between
    the field measurements and ERA5 (R2 = 0.92 and slope = 0.9). Likewise, shortwave
    solar radiation also showed good correlation and slope (R2 = 0.89 and slope =
    0.92). However, the relative humidity showed poorer performance, with an R2 of
    0.77 and a slope of 0.87. The large dispersion observed in the dataset shows very
    different behaviors across the different sites, which suggests local effects that
    may be missed by the ERA5 (Figure A3). Wind speed exhibited the widest differences
    between the two datasets, also reflecting the impact of local variations. The
    CORDOVA-ET measurements strongly underestimated the ERA5 wind speed values, with
    an average slope of 0.52 and R2 of 0.46 for all the seasons (Figure A5). 3.4.2.
    Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) An overall comparison for each country and
    season was performed comparing the hourly estimates of the ETo from the CORDOVA-ET
    and the ETo calculated from ERA5. The results showed a very strong linear correlation
    between both variables, with a slope of 0.90, RMSE = 0.08, and MBE = −0.01 mm/h.
    Figure 3 show the correlations through the six campaigns in each country. Figure
    3. Comparisons, correlations, and accuracies of the hourly ETo estimated with
    the CORDOVA-ET and obtained from ERA5. From top left to bottom right: Egypt, Jordan,
    Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, and Tunisia. Each dot color represents different
    seasons. For daily calculations, only complete days with 24 h of hourly calculations
    were taken into account. The results showed very strong linear correlation between
    the observed CORDOVA-ET ETo and the estimates from ERA-5. Except in two seasons,
    Jordan in season 3 and Morocco in season 5, the R2 ranged from 0.72 to 0.58. This
    issue was identified as an incorrect height of the weather station that allowed
    the crop to overgrow the station, resulting in incorrect wind and radiation measurements.
    Most slopes were close to 1 and coincident across the years, except for Egypt,
    with slopes of 1.27 and 0.75 for wheat and rice, respectively, and Palestine in
    season 5, with 1.35. The root mean square error ranged from 0.43 to 1.46 mm/s
    for all the other seasons (see Figure 4). Figure 4. Comparisons, correlations,
    and accuracies of the daily ETo estimated with the CORDOVA-ET and obtained from
    ERA5. From top left to bottom right: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine,
    and Tunisia. Each dot color represents different seasons. The detailed comparison
    of the CORDOVA-ET with ERA5 estimates at daily and hourly intervals showed good
    correlation, but a consistent underestimation of the ETo (a slope of 0.89 as the
    average for all sites and seasons of the daily data), suggesting that there may
    have been some calibration issues with the pyranometer used in the CORDOVA-ET
    station, causing an underestimation of solar radiation. The new pyranometer chosen
    to replace the original one and other improvements in the weather station should
    correct this problem. However, it should be pointed out that future comparative
    studies are needed using a more accurate check than the ERA5 dataset to determine
    whether the ETo is underestimated by the CORDOVA-ET, or whether the ERA5 method
    overestimated this variable. For that purpose, comparisons between the CORDOVA-ET
    system and well-calibrated, research-grade agrometeorological stations seem desirable.
    Network issues and proposed solutions. 3.4.3. Estimates of Actual Evapotranspiration
    (ETa) Throughout the six seasons, we acquired a dataset of different crops in
    each country, including wheat in all of them due to its significance in food production
    in the region. This allowed us to obtain diverse and detailed ET and crop information
    from various regions. In the first season, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Tunisia
    focused on measuring the evapotranspiration (ETa) of wheat. As these were the
    initial stages of the network, we were able to obtain approximately 50% of the
    hourly ETa data. Building upon this progress, in the fifth season, the wheat ETa
    was measured again, with Palestine joining the effort. In this season, Lebanon
    emerged with the largest dataset, achieving a remarkable 73% data coverage. As
    a result of the dataset obtained, it was shown that the winter wheat ETa increased
    until the grain-filling stage, and then the ETa fell, as is common for the wheat
    crop. The ETa tracked closely the ETo variations caused by fluctuations in the
    evaporative demand until the onset of senescence, when there is a strong decline
    in transpiration. The fast senescence around May resulted in ETa values that went
    sharply from less than the ETo to a very low fraction of the ETo as the wheat
    dried up (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Figure 5. Evolution of reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) calculated from the CORDOVA-ET (blue) and extracted from ERA5 (orange),
    and comparison with the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) calculated as the sum
    of the latent-heat energy-balance component (green) and the alternative method
    using the evaporative fraction (red). Data from the first season in Lebanon over
    wheat. Note that there was no ETa because of the lack of complete days due to
    power outages at night time. Figure 6. Evolution of reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) calculated from the CORDOVA-ET (blue) and extracted from ERA5 (orange),
    and comparison with the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) calculated as the sum
    of latent-heat energy-balance component (green) and the alternative method using
    the evaporative fraction (red). Data from the fifth season in Palestine over wheat.
    A valuable dataset of crops other than wheat was also obtained throughout the
    six seasons in the participating countries. The data-collection process included
    other cereals, vegetables, rice, and other crops of interest, such as maize, faba
    bean, sorghum, fodder vetch, onion, and soybean. This comprehensive dataset for
    various crops provides a solid foundation for analyzing and understanding the
    specific characteristics and requirements of each crop in different geographic
    regions. Figure 7 shows the example of onion in Jordan, a very important crop
    in the region with very limited information on water productivity. Figure 7. Evolution
    of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) calculated from the CORDOVA-ET (blue) and
    extracted from ERA5 (orange), and comparison with the actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa) calculated as the sum of latent-heat energy-balance component (green) and
    the alternative method using the evaporative fraction (red). Data from the fifth
    season in Jordan over onion. The results of the validation using reanalysis data
    showed that the use of a cost-effective commercial-grade weather station with
    the calibrations and data-handling algorithms developed in this project can provide
    consistent ETo estimations comparable to established agrometeorological weather
    station networks. The combination of canopy-temperature sensors and the modeling
    of variables, such as the net radiation, also proved to provide accurate estimations
    of parameters that would be needed to apply the energy balance to determine the
    ETa [7]. 3.5. General Issues and Proposed Solutions Over more than two years of
    operation, multiple issues related to operation and maintenance were identified,
    all resulting in improvements in the different iterations of the prototypes supplied
    to the countries. 3.5.1. Power Consumption Power issues affecting the base station
    were the primary cause of communication issues and data gaps. The initial power
    requirements were underestimated and limited by shipping logistics. It worked
    well during the summer months, but the solar power and energy storage were limited
    during the winter months or following several cloudy days. After testing, it became
    clear that 50 W solar panels are a minimum requirement for the stable operation
    of all the components of the base station. In some countries, they are using main
    power, which is a great option, if available. In addition, short circuits and
    excessive power consumption could be due to corrosion and water intrusion. The
    canopy-temperature sensors have occasionally experienced these issues as well.
    Corrosion and water ingress have led to sensor malfunctions, along with short
    circuits and excessive power consumption. The early version of the air-temperature
    sensor proved to have serious problems with corrosion due to the lack of enclosure
    thickness and the electronic components of the original board (BME280, Adafruit,
    New York, NY, USA). To solve these problems, for countries that already had old-version
    stations installed, extra 25 W solar panels were provided to connect them in parallel.
    The dimensions of the solar panel and batteries were increased. Also, new hardware
    for the gateway and modem were selected to integrate in a single device the 4G
    modem and the LoRaWAN gateway, resulting in more efficient power usage. 3.5.2.
    Device Assembly and Programming During the assembly process, which required certain
    experience to ensure proper assembly, a variety of issues were faced, including:
    Cables on the screw terminals breaking down and bad soldering. This damage was
    caused by inappropriate and incorrect assembly; Despite the attempts to apply
    conformal coating to the exposed electronics, the early version of the air-temperature
    and solar-radiation sensors still showed poor endurance under extreme climatic
    conditions; Limited spare-parts production capacity for 3D-printed parts. These
    problems arose during deployments and were addressed by providing an integrated
    set, assuring quality, optimizing the accuracy and reliability of measurements,
    and increasing the degree of sealing to improve protection against harsh conditions.
    Additionally, nodes were also improved in each iteration, and there was no solder
    involved in the newer version or the 3D-printed parts, resulting in more reliable
    hardware. The last sensor upgrades enhanced the approach, ensuring a faster and
    more efficient installation of sensors, enabling swift deployment in various environments.
    3.5.3. Maintenance Excess dirt (spider nets, bird droppings, dust, and mud) on
    sensors distorted the measurements. This was especially critical for the pyranometer
    and canopy-temperature sensors and solar panels. The lack of maintenance of the
    solar panels resulted in the gradual loss of battery capacity, resulting in battery
    degradation. A monthly check, or even weekly in extreme conditions, of the infrared
    thermometer, and a cleaning of the solar panels and the pyranometer, is required.
    Every six months, or monthly in extreme conditions, the tightness of the boxes
    should be checked and the air-temperature sensor and the infrared sensor cleaned.
    Finally, annually, it is recommended to check the status of all the batteries
    that make up the station. A checklist with the task and frequency was written
    and can be consulted for more detail in the annex of Appendix A (Table A1). 3.5.4.
    Data Management The initial web-based interface provided real-time data visualization,
    basic analysis capabilities, and a way to download data directly from the graphs.
    However, it was clear from the initial feedback that it was not very practical,
    and downloading data from different sensors required several download actions
    and the merging the data. The alternative of using Python code was not very practical
    for many users without programming experience, or in cases where one wants to
    quickly download the data for analysis. Therefore, based on the feedback received,
    a simplified solution for downloading the data easily in flexible formats was
    developed. This web-based tool, called “CORDOVA-ET Data Download”, can be accessed
    from the main menu in the web-based application. It bundles up all the calculations
    for ETo, ETa, and data aggregation for the raw measurements. 3.5.5. Solar-Radiation
    Measurement Measurements of solar radiation. This variable is critical for the
    energy balance. However, this has been the most challenging sensor of the whole
    system. The hardware issues with the selected sensor have prevented any useful
    measurement of radiation on the nodes. Moreover, having the pyranometer on top
    of the air-temperature radiation shield makes its leveled installation and routine
    maintenance (cleaning for dust) almost impossible. The concept of self-contained
    nodes with all the measurements included is attractive, but in this case, it did
    not prove to be practical. Also, the radiation should not be variable across the
    standard extension of the trial and range of the base station (~2 km). The CORDOVA-ET
    v.3 only includes one pyranometer per base station, installed at a practical height
    to allow maintenance and correct leveling. The single sensor would also allow
    for using a higher-grade instrument that would ensure standard and robust factory
    calibration into energy units, described in Berni et al. [7]. In addition, the
    solar radiation from the commercial weather stations was affected by the fact
    that the radiation sensor sees through a clear glass instead of using a cosine
    diffuser, as discussed in Jimenez-Berni et al. (2023) [7]. An optical diffuser
    was installed, and weather station sensors were calibrated against a standard
    pyranometer. The calibration coefficients are stored in a CSV file that can be
    accessed by the data-processing scripts https://github.com/OpenAgriTech/CORDOVA-ET-metadata
    (accessed on 16 October 2023). 3.5.6. Communications The main problems faced were
    with the 4G modem/LoRaWAN gateway, due to expired credit in SIM cards or mobile
    carrier firewall issues, and communication issues in the server side due to power
    loss, firewall, and internet connectivity problems. The new version of the data
    logger baseboard allows local data storage in the nodes for back-up and data retrieval,
    even in the case of no LoRaWAN connectivity. Also, the newer model of the gateway
    allows local storage of the LoRa packages for offline data processing. Programming
    problems and configuration of gateway and modem was reduced by using a single
    device, the 4G modem, which integrates the gateway and modem; this means fewer
    parts prone to errors or the wrong configuration, and more space inside the baseboard
    enclosure. This simplifies installation and configuration, as there is only one
    device. Also, this reduces power consumption and the space inside the base station
    enclosure, providing extra space for batteries. 3.5.7. Other Issues Several challenges
    have been encountered due to the idiosyncrasies of each team and the institutions
    operating in the different countries in which the CORDOVA-ET station was deployed.
    Among the difficulties, it is worth mentioning the limitations for the assembly
    and/or updating of the devices in some locations, despite providing all the necessary
    information, offering technical support, and sending the required elements properly
    packaged. This omission appears to have been caused by the insufficient commitment
    of some recipients, possibly influenced by a lack of alignment with the goals
    of both parties. Consequently, it resulted in the slowing down of the progress
    and development of the CORDOVA-ET device deployment. 3.5.8. Upgrades Discussion
    The primary function of ET networks is to produce ET information for various users
    over the long-term. A recurring concern in projects developed through external
    funding is the uncertainty in the continuity once the funding ends. Additionally,
    ET networks still have a major R&D component, which is not normally addressed
    in most public institutions devoted to agricultural water management, such as
    the ministries of agriculture and of water and irrigation. It would seem that
    academic institutions should be the preferred recipients of the prototype network
    described here, but the long-term funding concerns may be even higher in that
    case. This risk poses a serious threat to the sustainability and continuity of
    an ET network. As the end of the funding approaches, there is a need to establish
    appropriate strategies to ensure the preservation and long-term utilization of
    the network. This entails not only the consolidation of acquired knowledge and
    best practices, but also the transfer of responsibilities and the pursuit of sustainable
    financing mechanisms. A clear example took place in Egypt during the national
    WEPS-NENA workshop in September 2022, where the upgraded device was exhibited.
    This event saw the participation of renowned institutions in the country [14].
    Additionally, in Tunisia, pilot projects have been initiated to measure the ETa
    with the CORDOVA-ET system in two important tree crops, namely olive and date
    palm. 4. Conclusions Regarding the CORDOVA-ET equipment, adequate weather protection
    of its sensors and electronics is a critical issue under the harsh environmental
    conditions of the countries where the system was deployed. Many upgrades were
    made to ensure the robust and long-term operation of the system with minimum data
    gaps. The goals of the CORDOVA-ET were to initiate technical personnel in the
    measurement of ET based on an inexpensive, user-friendly instrument that can deliver
    acceptable estimates of the ETo and ETa. Furthermore, the aim of the CORDOVA-ET
    system is to provide a cost-effective system (less than EUR 4000) that can be
    adopted beyond the scientific community and provide open-access and real-time
    information about the ETo and actual crop water status to facilitate irrigation
    scheduling and improve the water productivity of the adopting users. Most ET networks
    are focused on providing only the reference ET (ETo), but this network offered
    two features that are advantageous and may be valuable in agronomy. On one hand,
    it provides the actual ET when the system is placed over a crop different than
    grass, in addition to the ETo. On the other hand, each station captures the spatial
    variability of the ETa, as four nodes are provided to assess some of the components
    of the ETa in four different locations, which might be several km apart. The insufficient
    time devoted to network operations by part of the personnel responsible for the
    stations resulted in inadequate attention to some sensors. To address this issue,
    a sequentially executed script, that consists of a set of instructions and commands
    in the data download process to correct this problem, was implemented. This solution
    has proven to be effective in correcting the deficiencies caused by the lack of
    attention, ensuring the quality and reliability of the data collected currently.
    For supporting the network over the long-term, it is essential to establish strategic
    alliances with key stakeholders, such as water authorities, academic institutions,
    research and farmers organizations, or other interested partners, in order to
    promote effective continuity and safeguard the project’s outcomes beyond the initial
    external-funding stage. Additionally, detailed documentation of processes, methodologies,
    and results, along with training and capacity-building at the local level, can
    significantly contribute to the preservation and successful transfer of the achieved
    advancements, ensuring a lasting legacy and the potential for a continuous impact
    within the project’s sphere of operation. Despite the numerous challenges encountered,
    the overall response to the development of the ET network has been extremely positive.
    These results highlight the potential and impact that technology can have on agriculture,
    particularly in the measurement and optimization of water usage in specific crops.
    The commitment and collaboration of local institutions and experts are crucial
    elements in ensuring the ongoing success of these type of projects and their potential
    expansion to other regions in the future. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    and content Highlights • Participatory approaches demand adaptability, as problem
    scope and definition vary dynamically. • A co-learning guided approach leads to
    context inclusive solutions. • Involvement of regulators in a co-learning process
    provides legitimacy to the solutions evolved. • Co-learning could lead to multi-user,
    multi-outcome solutions that enhance uptake. Abstract Inefficient use of irrigation
    in New Zealand pastoral farms is widespread and the uptake of irrigation scheduling

    IrrigationParticipatory processDrainageCo-learningScheduling 1. Introduction Poor
    to modest adoption of tools and practices by New Zealand (NZ) pastoral farmers
    to manage on-farm natural resources such as water has commonly resulted in inefficient
    resource use and unrealised economic potential (Turner et al., 2013; Ministry
    for Primary Industries (MPI), 2011; Van Housen, 2015). Based on an investigation
    of water use in three pastoral farms in Canterbury (NZ) for an irrigation season
    (2014–15), Van Housen (2015) reported that 47–64% of irrigations were unnecessary
    and could have been avoided, had appropriate irrigation scheduling practices been
    in place. The NZ Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) (2012) had estimated that
    if the bottom three quarters of least efficient pastoral farmers adopted the management
    practices currently used by the most efficient, the country could have achieved
    an additional NZ$3 billion revenue annually from increased exports, without a
    need for new technology. However, Hornbuckle et al. (2009), Lea-Cox (2012) and
    others indicated that the technological complexity of irrigation scheduling tools
    often inhibit their adoption by farmers. More often, end-users perceive such technologies
    as a burdensome layer of management and thus ignore (Lea-Cox, 2012). Several studies
    in NZ and elsewhere have associated the lack of user engagement in the process
    of developing tools and practices to their poor uptake (e.g. Nguyen et al., 2007;
    Bruges and Smith, 2009; Reid and Brazendale, 2014; Payne et al., 2018; Small et
    al., 2021 and others). Payne et al. (2018) investigated the impact of NZ Government
    funded on-farm science and technology transfer projects over the last decade,
    and concluded that those projects that generated realistic, immediate, take-home
    outcomes, that were affordable (time, money), acceptable (social license), available
    (timeliness), practical (use of existing infrastructure) and convenient (ease
    of implementation), achieved the desired impact. To develop such options, MPI
    (2012) concluded that there needs to be increased direct interaction between technology
    developers and users. With approaches such as transfer-of-technology, there is
    an absence of direct interaction between developers and receptors (Rogers, 2002
    and others). A lack of interaction could otherwise lead to mismatch in the understanding
    of the problem among stakeholders and end-users (hereafter, in this paper, the
    term stakeholder includes both stakeholders and end-users), resulting in tools
    and practices that are either irrelevant, ill-informed, or both, thus becoming
    a burden to the users (Nguyen et al., 2007, Lea-Cox, 2012). Developing tools and
    practices that are relevant, usable and translate science into practice requires
    engagement methods that accommodate multiple stakeholders with diverse perspectives,
    and that utilise the skills and knowledge of those stakeholders in the design
    process (Forester, 1999, Klerkx and Nettle, 2013, Payne et al., 2018). Participatory
    approaches that promote a closer and direct interaction between technology developers
    and users, right from the genesis of an idea to its design, development and implementation,
    substantially enhance uptake (e.g. Röling, 2009; Turner et al., 2013; Vereijssen
    et al., 2017; and others). In this paper, using a chronologically-structured analysis
    of a case study, we describe how a co-learning based participatory process guided
    the cognitive and operational evolution of an on-farm irrigation scheduling tool.
    Using the case study, we track the starting conditions, and the emergence of a
    context and relevance as enabled by the co-learning process. The case study employed
    in this paper has previously been used to investigate various aspects of participatory
    process. Srinivasan et al. (2017) who published the original case study, indicated
    that its primary objective was to improve irrigation water use, by combining high-resolution
    weather forecast and on-farm irrigation demand monitoring. Srinivasan et al. (2017)
    and Verejissen et al. (2017) studied the evolution and refinement of the case
    study objectives when the researchers opted for a participatory co-learning approach
    instead of a transfer-of-technology-model. Once a participatory approach was adopted,
    Srinivasan et al. (2019) examined the case study activities and delineated the
    phases of the case study development, from initiation to implementation. Fielke
    and Srinivasan (2017) and Srinivasan and Elley (2018) examined the case study
    to understand the evolution of non-tangible outcomes such as community resilience
    and trust among stakeholders, respectively, as instigated by the participatory
    process. In this paper, we address the eventual objective of the case study, improved
    water use through improved information use. Here, the improved water use is examined
    within the context of adoption of improved irrigation scheduling practices. We
    examine the development of a tangible output, an irrigation management tool, that
    emerged from the co-learning process. We track the participatory process as it
    was informed and influenced by the stakeholders, and the eventual shape and structure
    of the output. The paper is targeted at researchers and resource managers who
    are considering employing a participatory approach in translating their science
    findings into usable tools and practices for end-users. 2. Case study description
    The case study was initiated as a pilot project in 2013/14 under the Endeavour
    Fund managed by the NZ Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE),
    to enhance the uptake of improved irrigation practices by pastoral farmers and
    to improve on-farm water use. The case study researchers sought to combine real-time
    soil water monitoring with short-term weather (rainfall) forecasting, to inform
    irrigation scheduling. Soil water monitoring has long been used as a proxy for
    irrigation demand – the question being “is the soil dry enough to trigger an irrigation
    today?” The case study researchers explored the use of rainfall forecasts as a
    proxy for the next two to six-days of irrigation supply. The question was phrased
    as “could the forecast rainfall be used to either delay a scheduled irrigation
    event or adjust the amount of irrigation applied today?” At the start of the case
    study, the researchers described the improvement in water use by counting the
    number of irrigation events that were delayed, altered, or completely skipped,
    based on current demand and forecast supply. A total of 10 irrigated pastoral
    farms in the Canterbury region (NZ) was chosen for the case study. The Canterbury
    region is the home of approximately two thirds of irrigated lands in NZ (StatsNZ,
    2017), and irrigation allocation in this region accounts for approximately 80%
    of nationally consented irrigation water use (Booker and Henderson, 2019). Each
    case study farm was instrumented with a rain gauge and soil moisture sensor under
    one irrigator. The rain gauge measured both rainfall and irrigation, and the soil
    moisture sensor measured soil water and soil temperature at 200 mm depth below
    soil surface at one location. This depth of soil water measurement and the number
    of monitoring sites per irrigator are typical of pastoral farms in the region.
    A schematic of the instrumentation is shown in Fig. 1a. Data were collected every
    10 min and telemetered every hour. The forecast data included two- and six-day
    weather predictions. The two day weather forecast was updated every six hours,
    and the six-day forecast updated every day. The weather forecasts included rainfall,
    relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed and direction. The data format,
    frequency, synthesis, display and sharing protocols, and instrumentation evolved
    during the case study, principally informed by the co-learning process. These
    are discussed in subsequent sections. Download : Download high-res image (378KB)

    Phase one instrumentation is shown in a and phase two instrumentation is shown
    in b. 3. Case study participatory approach Participatory approaches are commonly
    neither prescriptive nor pre-defined (Bruges and Smith, 2009). Instead of adhering
    to a singular, regimented tech-transfer pathway, these approaches are focused
    on enabling active participation of stakeholders right from the early stages of
    the research (Kloppenburg, 1991, Massey et al., 2006, Jakku and Thorburn, 2010).
    Botha et al. (2017) described that participatory approach as organically evolving
    in response to stakeholder engagement. In the case study described here, a co-learning
    based participatory approach that focused on fostering learning among stakeholders
    was employed. The participatory process employed operating principles described
    in Nederlof et al. (2011) and Coutts et al. (2017) as a guide to engagement. The
    key principles used were: taking time to view and understand the problem from
    multiple (stakeholder) perspectives; applying equal value to all sources of knowledge;
    providing an atmosphere that fosters learning among stakeholders (co-learning)
    by actively listening and understanding; staying aware of wider (problem) context
    to balance between short-term outcomes and long-term vision; and remaining flexible
    and adaptable as the co-learning process requires. The co-learning process employed
    in the case study did not seek to confirm, validate or establish a perspective,
    preference, knowledge source or value held by any one group (e.g. researchers
    or farmers). Instead, it sought ways to contextualise water-use practices by encompassing
    stakeholder perspectives and evolving a relevant, legitimate and adaptable set
    of practices and tools. In the case study, co-learning between case study researchers
    and pilot farmers occurred through several one-on-one and group interactions at
    various stages. These interactions, engagement phases and evidence collected during
    each phase are described in detail in Srinivasan et al. (2019). Initially (2014–15),
    the researchers sought farmers’ interest and consent in participating in the case
    study. Interactions then moved to setting up instruments on farms and training
    the farmers to access data, and finally transitioning into end-of-the-season workshops
    that included all case study stakeholders. Co-learning between other stakeholders
    (regulators, government representatives, industry professionals, irrigation scheme
    managers and other non-participant farmers in the study region), researchers and
    pilot farmers occurred routinely at the end-of-the-season workshops (referred
    to as workshop(s) hereafter), where the group discussed the irrigation practices
    and outcomes from the previous irrigation season, and periodically during day-to-day
    operational interactions. Additionally, the researchers used the workshop as an
    opportunity to gather feedback on the data provided to the pilot farmers (more
    on this in subsequent sections) and their ease of use in supporting irrigation
    decisions. The workshop also focused on dissecting specific irrigation events
    to learn from them - understanding the accuracy of weather forecasts provided;
    incorporating weather forecast uncertainty into decision-making; discussing the
    usefulness and timeliness of data provided; assessing the need for additional
    data collection and sharing to support irrigation decisions; and considering other
    farm-specific challenges to managing irrigation such as availability of water
    supply, irrigation infrastructure limitations, staff capacities and capabilities,
    and others. At the workshop, the group discussed changes (on-farm operational
    as well as data collection, syntheses and presentation procedures) that could
    be implemented in the subsequent irrigation season to support more efficient irrigation
    practices. For example, for farmers, this could be a change in irrigation frequency
    or amount. For researchers, this adaption could be considering options for additional
    data collection, processing and sharing. The majority of co-learning happened
    at these workshops as all key stakeholders were present, enriching the discussions
    by sharing their perspectives and understanding others’. Co-learning emerged from
    the participatory process and the evolution of the irrigation scheduling tool
    was captured in three distinct, sequential phases. Each phase represented approximately
    two irrigation seasons. This much time was needed for the operation of the instrumentation
    to stabilise (in this case, it is the time for the soil moisture sensors to settle
    in the soil and provide reliable data), and for the stakeholders to become familiar
    with the newly available information and provide meaningful feedback. Phase one
    (alignment with existing practices) describes the early stages of the engagement
    process with stakeholders. The co-learning from this phase led to phase two, deviation
    from existing practices, where the understanding of irrigation water use broadened
    and the need for non-conventional data collection protocols emerged. Phase three,
    making the invisible visible, represents the emergence of a matured product, an
    irrigation scheduling tool, that culminated from co-learning process. The tool
    though existed in one form or other across all three phases, evolved and matured,
    guided by the co-learning process. 4. Phase 1: Alignment with existing practices
    At the time of the case study initiation (2014–15), those pastoral farmers that
    monitored soil water to schedule irrigation, monitored at a depth of 200 mm below
    surface. For pasture, generally a rootzone of 400–500 mm is assumed (Porteous
    et al., 1994) and the 200 mm depth is assumed to represent the midpoint. In accordance
    with the existing convention, at the start of the case study, soil moisture sensors
    were installed at 200 mm depth (see Fig. 1a). Also, unless there are distinct
    spatial differences in soil drainage properties or crop types, farmers generally
    monitored soil water at one location under each irrigator and scheduled irrigations
    accordingly. Generally, farmers are advised by irrigation consultants to schedule
    irrigation when soil water is at or close to stress point, and not to irrigate
    when soil water is at, near, or above full point. Stress point is crop-specific,
    and is an empirical representation of a condition below which a crop would exhibit
    water stress and thus a decline in growth. For pasture, stress point is typically
    50% of plant available water (PAW), a soil physical property that can be readily
    obtained from published soil databases such as S-Map (Lilburne et al., 2012).
    Full point is soil specific. It represents a condition when PAW is at 100% and
    the available soil storage is zero. Any addition of water to a soil at or above
    full point results in drainage or overland flow. Brown (2007), KC et al. (2018)
    and others had examined irrigation scheduling practices in Canterbury pastoral
    farms and reported that farmers seldom wait until stress point to trigger an irrigation,
    to avoid the risk of production loss from water stress. During phase one of the
    case study, the current irrigation demand (soil water observations) and forecast
    irrigation supply (rainfall) data were collated into a report and shared with
    the pilot farmers every day via email. The daily report included: • Last seven
    days of observed rainfall, irrigation, soil water, and soil temperature (both
    soil water and soil temperature were derived from the same soil moisture sensor
    buried at 200 mm depth); • Last seven days of estimated evapotranspiration based
    on weather observations from the nearest weather station; • Next two days of three-hourly
    rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed and direction; and
    • Next six days of daily rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind
    speed and direction A sample of the daily report is shown in Fig. 2. Even though
    the two-day forecast was updated every six hours, emails were sent out only once
    a day, the pilot farmers received only one forecast per day, the last updated
    forecast. Download : Download high-res image (382KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Daily update of (a) current demand and (b) forecast supply conditions
    at the case study farms. Phase one version of demand and supply data shared with
    the case study farmers. To increase the co-learning opportunities, irrigation
    and soil water data from all case study farms were collated in the daily report
    and shared with all recipients. This was to allow the pilot farmers see others’
    irrigation practices and soil water conditions with the aim of instigating moments
    of reflection and learning, which are discussed in detail in Srinivasan and Elley
    (2018). During this phase, and over the entire case study, the researchers neither
    advised the pilot farmers on making irrigation decisions, nor interfered with
    the ones they made. This was done deliberately as the wider goal of the case study
    was to co-produce a tool that was easy-to understand and use without the need
    for any expert input and guidance. Thus, the researchers confined their role to
    collecting and presenting the data. Also, the researchers did not have specific
    knowledge of on-farm conditions, such as a broken irrigator, non-availability
    of irrigation supply, staff availability, or stock movement, so were not ideally
    placed to provide farm-specific irrigation advice. However, at the workshops,
    the stakeholders talked about reasons behind specific irrigation decisions and
    practices during the previous season and the learnings that occurred from observing
    peers (see, Srinivasan and Elley, 2018). 5. Co-learning from existing practices
    (phase one) 5.1. Description of water use After the first two complete irrigation
    seasons (2015–16 and 2016–17), as the stakeholders had become familiar with the
    aim of the case study and the co-learning approach employed, the operational definition
    of water use as a metric of improved irrigation practice began to evolve. This
    is captured in Table 1, along with a description of drivers, perspectives and
    aims of specific stakeholder group. Table 1. Evolution of the description of improved
    water use by stakeholders and end-users through the participatory co-learning
    process. Empty Cell Driver Constraint Aim Changes to irrigation scheduling questiona
    Researcher An opportunity to combine real-time soil water monitoring and short-term
    rainfall forecast to improve water use Poor uptake of tools and practices Use
    of a co-learning based participatory approach to develop a tool for operational
    irrigation scheduling (technological efficiency) Would an irrigation event today
    be justified based on current soil water conditions and forecast rainfall? Farmer
    An opportunity to maintain or maximise production using improved irrigation scheduling
    and saving money by reducing the number of irrigation events using weather forecast
    Availability of timely, accessible and accurate irrigation demand and weather
    forecast information to support irrigation decisions Schedule irrigation that
    supports pasture productivity (production efficiency) Would missing an irrigation
    event today impact pasture growth? Regulator An opportunity to minimise leaching
    by minimising drainage Absence of farm-specific field evidence on drainage from
    irrigation practices Schedule irrigation that minimises the loss of water from
    the rootzone, thereby minimising leaching potential (environmental efficiency)
    Would an irrigation event today cause drainage and leaching? a The original irrigation
    scheduling question was, “is irrigation needed today based on soil water conditions?”
    As the researchers regularly interact with state-of-the-art technologies such
    as high-resolution weather forecasting models and soil moisture sensors, and diverse
    climate, soils and hydrology datasets, they described improved water use as a
    way of scheduling irrigation using real-time soil water monitoring in the rootzone
    and short-term rainfall forecast. In other words, by combining data from multiple
    sources (specific on-farm observations and localised, high-resolution weather
    model forecasts) and time scales (current and future). The researchers sought
    to extend the conventional irrigation scheduling question from “is irrigation
    needed today based on current demand?” to “is irrigation justified today based
    on current demand and forecast supply?”. Relevant local government representatives
    (regional council regulators) were also invited to the workshops. They are the
    custodians and administrators of water resources in the region, responsible for
    both quantity and quality, water allocation and water use monitoring, and are
    focused on responsible resource use. Regulators are increasingly concerned that
    drainage from irrigation and rainfall leach nutrients below the rootzone into
    groundwater; thus, it is important to control drainage to contain the possibility
    of leaching (Robson et al., 2015). Although rainfall-drainage may not be able
    to be controlled, regulators focused on minimising irrigation-drainage. This phase
    of the case study coincided with the emergence of the Regional Council’s Matrix
    of Good Management (MGM) initiative. MGM represented the compilation of recommended
    irrigation practices to reduce nutrient leaching (Robson et al., 2015, MGM., 2015).
    Thus, the regulators defined improved water use as irrigation scheduling that
    minimises drainage. They framed their question as “would an irrigation today result
    in drainage and leaching?” as opposed to the conventional question, “is irrigation
    needed today based on current demand?”. For farmers, irrigation is one of the
    key inputs to agricultural production; they were therefore focused on a scheduling
    approach that supported the productivity objective. Often farmers erred on the
    side of scheduling an irrigation event rather than skipping one, as they perceive
    that the production repercussions were less damaging from irrigating than by skipping
    (Brown, 2007, KC et al., 2018). Thus, farmers’ definition of improved water use
    revolved around maintaining soil water conditions that did not impede production.
    Instead of asking “is irrigation needed today based on demand?” they asked, “would
    not irrigating today compromise the production?”. 5.2. Evidence for good irrigation
    scheduling The existing soil moisture sensor configuration (deployment at 200 mm
    depth) helped farmers to trigger irrigation events before the soil dropped to
    stress point but did not provide evidence to the regulator on irrigation-drainage.
    At one of the workshops during phase one, the researchers, using a simple water
    balance model, presented an estimate of seasonal drainage that would have occurred
    in the case study farms based on actual irrigation and rainfall data. This estimation
    was done by summarising daily rainfall, irrigation and evaporation data for each
    soil PAW, assuming any water in excess of PAW would have been lost from the rootzone
    through drainage. Even though the modelled estimates were useful in evaluating
    how well the farms performed with drainage, the timing (after the irrigation season)
    and time resolution (seasonal as opposed to individual irrigation event scale)
    of these drainage estimates did not help the farmers to learn about individual
    drainage events and alter their irrigation practices operationally. Nor could
    the seasonal drainage estimates categorically identified which irrigation events
    had resulted in drainage and what practices could have minimised those drainage
    events. The need for timely evidence of drainage for operational irrigation scheduling
    was a co-learning moment for researchers as it highlighted the absence of a dataset
    (real-time drainage) sought by stakeholders. 5.3. Data presentation During phase
    one of the case study, the meaningfulness of data collected, and their syntheses
    and presentation became a frequent discussion point among the stakeholders. A
    summary of these discussion points is captured below: • The soil moisture sensor
    at 200 mm depth did not provide conclusive evidence on drainage to the regulator
    and actionable intelligence for the pilot farmers to evaluate individual irrigation
    events; • Each daily email update only contained the last seven days of data which
    meant that the pilot farmers had to go through their previous daily email updates
    to get a historical view of the season; • The presentation format of the weather
    forecast was perceived complex (expert user focused; see Fig. 2b), which meant
    that the pilot farmers had to spend time in reading and understanding the data
    to make a decision; and • The presentation of historical (last seven days) soil
    water and forecast weather data (specifically rainfall) separately within the
    same update and in different formats (compare Fig. 2a and b) meant that the pilot
    farmers had to work to bridge the two data streams, and surmise the likely impact
    of forecast rainfall on soil water conditions to make an irrigation scheduling
    decision. 6. Phase 2: Deviation from existing practices Srinivasan and Elley (2018)
    recorded that the focus of case study towards the end of phase 1 shifted from
    when to start the irrigation to maintain productivity (farmer focused), to when
    to start the irrigation to maintain productivity and stop the irrigation to prevent
    drainage (farmer and regulator focused). This meant that the farmers needed near
    real-time evidence of drainage, or absence of it, following each irrigation event.
    With the existing soil moisture sensor at 200 mm depth, it was possible to say
    when the full point was exceeded in the mid-section of the rootzone, but it was
    not possible to categorically conclude that the excess water drained below the
    rootzone (~400–500 mm). The possibility of the excess water being redistributed
    within the rootzone, between 200 and 500 mm depth, could not be discounted. To
    gather evidence about drainage, during 2017–18 irrigation season, the researchers
    introduced a multi-level soil moisture sensor (“profile sensor”). The profile
    sensor, buried vertically, measured soil water and soil temperature at every 100 mm
    interval at eight successive depths (see Fig. 1b for the profile sensor set up).
    The top 4/5 levels (0–400/500 mm) of the profile sensor measured soil water conditions
    within the rootzone (“irrigation trigger zone”) and the bottom 3/4 levels (400/500–800 mm),
    measured soil water conditions immediately below the rootzone (“drainage signal
    zone”). Once the profile sensor was installed, the case study farmers were presented
    with data from all eight depths. These new data showed the transit of water within
    and between irrigation and drainage zones (see an example in Fig. 3). The case
    study farmers were trained to manage their irrigation scheduling based on soil
    water conditions within the irrigation zone, and assess the movement of water
    below the rootzone by following the changes (increases) in soil water in the drainage
    zone immediately following irrigation events. The profile sensor did not quantify
    the amount of water drained below the rootzone but signalled the occurrence and
    timing of drainage. This was enough for the farmers and regulators to understand
    the impact of individual irrigation event in near real-time. Download : Download

    Phase two version of near-real time update of demand and supply information provided
    to the farmers. 6.1. Enabling learning from accessing historical practices Co-learning
    from phase one helped to advance phase two in several aspects. This included the
    adoption of a new multi-depth soil water and soil temperature data collection
    scheme to address the evolving needs of farmers and regulators, a data sharing
    platform (website) to allow 24/7 data access, and access to historical data at
    ease. During irrigation seasons 2017–18 and 2018–19, following the installation
    of profile sensors, to enable farmers view historical data, the demand and forecast
    data were presented through a generic telemetry website built and operated by
    the host research agency (NIWA). The daily email update was discontinued, and
    all data sharing occurred via this website. The option of allowing each pilot
    farmer to view others’ data was retained. The website was not exclusively developed
    for the case study; it collates and displays a wide range of environmental data
    collected by the host research agency. Farmers were trained in using the website
    to access the data. On-farm measurements were made available in near-real time
    (less than 60-min delay). No changes were made to the forecast data presentation
    from phase one. The demand and forecast data streams were still maintained separately
    as they arrive from two different sources – demand data from on-farm monitoring
    and forecast data from numerical weather models run every six hours by the host
    research agency (NIWA). However, as the website was active 24/7, the two-day forecast
    was updated every six hours as new forecasts became available. Because of the
    number of soil water time-series data to be displayed (eight, one from each depth),
    the line plot visual became busier than before and reading the soil water trends
    at various depths became a challenge (compare Figs. 2a and 3). While farmers were
    advised to read the soil water traces selectively – say, a trace each from the
    irrigation and drainage zones - it became evident that there was a need to develop
    a more meaningful data display system to fully realise the potential of profile
    sensor data. The complexity of displaying multiple soil water traces and the format
    mismatches in the presentation of current demand and forecast supply data made
    the tool less accessible for easy decision-making. These challenges provided the
    researchers with a new set of co-learning moments. Phase three began with a search
    for a better data integration and presentation scheme. 7. Phase 3: making the
    invisible visible During irrigation seasons 2017–18 and thereafter, following
    the introduction of profile sensor and provision of soil water and forecast data
    via a generic website, the researchers turned their attention to combining current
    demand and forecast supply data into a seamless product. An exclusive web portal
    (IrriMate™; https://i2.niwa.co.nz/) was designed to display the data from 2018
    to 19 season. The web portal included the following: • Display of current daily
    rainfall, irrigation, and potential evapotranspiration conditions and forecast
    rainfall and potential evapotranspiration conditions; • Current and forecast soil
    water conditions; • Updated weather forecast every six hours and current conditions
    every hour; • Ability for users to scroll back to view all available historical
    data, and zooming in and out of any specific periods of interest; • Daily minimum
    and maximum soil temperature data at 100 mm depth; • Daily modelled pasture production
    data; and • Provision of a water balance by summarising daily rainfall, irrigation
    and evapotranspiration data to estimate soil water excess, or deficit The IrriMate
    design allowed inclusion of other data such as measured on-farm water use, although
    that was not measured as a direct component of the case study. One of the co-learnings
    that occurred early during the case study was that farmers’ preferred to access
    all irrigation related data (demand, supply and use) from one portal (even if
    not from one source), hence IrriMate was designed to be adaptable and flexible
    to bring external data steams other than those collected in the case study. Following
    the installation of profile sensors, the farmers saw an opportunity to access
    soil temperature data at 100 mm depth. Based on field observations and analysis
    of pasture growth and soil temperature data from various pasture growing regions
    of NZ, Charlton et al. (1986) concluded that soil temperature at 100 mm depth
    is a good indicator of pasture growth potential, and, thus, nutrient and water
    use. So, generally farmers are advised to monitor soil temperature at 100 mm depth
    before starting (or ending) an irrigation season as soil temperature dips below
    optimal growing conditions during these shoulder seasons. With the profile sensor,
    the case study farmers saw an opportunity to objectively begin and end an irrigation
    season based on soil temperature measurements at 100 mm depth. Access to soil
    temperature was not possible before the installation of profile sensor. This data
    stream was added to the IrriMate portal on the farmers’ initiative. Similarly,
    daily water use data, which was not measured as a part of the case study, was
    added to the IrriMate portal based on the researchers’ initiative. The core component
    of IrriMate was the insight plot, an integrated visual representation of soil
    water data both spatially and temporally (see Fig. 4). It visually revealed the
    soil drying and wetting patterns, soil water transfer within and between irrigation
    and drainage zones, and changes in soil water based on historical and forecast
    weather conditions. The insight plot enabled stakeholders to visualise the relationship
    between inputs (rainfall, irrigation and evapotranspiration) and output (soil
    water conditions) in near-real time as well as in a forecast mode. This cause-and-effect
    relationship was previously invisible, and the insight plot has made it visible.

    Phase three version of the multi-faceted portal co-designed through a co-learning
    process. The IrriMate portal and insight plot were designed to show the timing
    and duration of drainage events. The rainfall, irrigation, water use and evapotranspiration
    data were summarised as daily data and soil water and soil temperature data were
    summarised as hourly to 2-hourly data. By zooming in, users could identify the
    start and end of a drainage event (daily resolution) and link that back to the
    irrigation or rainfall event that had caused it. In case of irrigation events
    that had resulted in drainage, farmers were encouraged to explore options such
    as varying irrigation amounts and/or frequency, and trigger times. For example,
    if drainage was recorded after an irrigation event, and if the irrigation infrastructure
    does not allow altering the amount of irrigation applied, subsequent irrigation
    events could be started at a drier soil water condition. If irrigation amount
    could be altered, then the irrigation could be triggered at the same or similar
    soil water condition, but less water could be applied. The implementation of these
    options relies on the availability of irrigation supply on-demand if irrigations
    are delayed to a drier condition, and the capability of the irrigation infrastructure
    if irrigation amounts are to be varied. The IrriMate portal and insight plot served
    multiple purposes as described below: (1) Spatially (within the soil profile,
    0–800 mm depth), it reduced the complexity of reading multiple soil water traces
    from individual depths into a continuous and intuitive colour plot (compare Fig.
    3, Fig. 4 for changes in soil water representation in phases two and three, respectively).
    This was achieved by standardising the soil water data at each depth using depth-specific
    full point estimated from historical data. (2) Temporally, it integrated current
    soil water and forecast supply data into one seamless product. This was achieved
    by deriving forecast soil water data using current soil water, and forecast rainfall
    and evapotranspiration data. This eliminated the guesswork by the farmer in combining
    demand and supply data streams. (3) Historically, farmers could retrace and see
    their irrigation practices over a period to understand the dynamic relationship
    between cause (rainfall, irrigation, evapotranspiration) and effect (soil water
    changes and drainage) and any observable changes in their irrigation behaviour
    (4) Educationally, the combined spatial and temporal plot provided farmers with
    a knowledge of wetting (from rainfall and irrigation) and drying (from evapotranspiration)
    patterns of their soils and their variability over the season. The insight plot
    also highlighted the differences in wetting patterns and water redistribution
    within the soil profile resulting from rainfall and irrigation events as they
    differ in their intensities (5) For compliance purposes, the occurrence and timing
    of drainage provided regulators the needed evidence of good irrigation practices.
    Regulators could temporally align drainage events to irrigation and rainfall events.
    In a few cases, the insight plot captured the rise of water table, or lateral
    flow, which was by picked up by increases in soil water without any addition of
    rainfall or irrigation (6) Operationally, the insight plot allowed farmers to
    evaluate the response of their paddock to irrigation scheduling practices. This
    meant they could identify the optimal soil water conditions to start an irrigation
    event, or optimal irrigation amount that could be applied at an existing soil
    water condition without causing a drainage. The farmers could begin and end an
    irrigation season based on soil temperature measured at 100 mm depth. (7) From
    a production perspective, the insight plot further evolved to include modelled
    daily pasture production data based on available soil water, sunshine hours and
    solar radiation. As farmers control soil water through irrigation practices, they
    could visualise variations in pasture production. More details on the formulations
    used in developing various components of insight plot and methods used for standardising
    and forecasting soil water data are available in Srinivasan et al. (in preparation).
    7.1. An example of self-learning using the insight plot One of the aims of the
    case study was to develop a tool that is self-explanatory and easy to use, a requirement
    highlighted in many previous studies (e.g. Nguyen et al., 2007; Payne et al.,
    2018, and others). One of the pilot farms was moderately limited by irrigation
    infrastructure. The travelling irrigator on that farm was on a rotation between
    paddocks and had a return period of eight to nine days. Within each paddock, the
    irrigator speed could be varied to apply anywhere between 21 and 39 mm. These
    limitations led to relatively large and infrequent irrigation applications which
    presented two risks. From the regulator’s perspective, a large application of
    irrigation per event could potentially result in drainage if soils could not retain
    it. From farmer’s perspective, the long gap between irrigation applications could
    result in soil drying below the stress point and impacting pasture growth. Based
    on the insight plot, using a trial and error approach, the pilot farmer learned
    to devise a routine that would ensure continued productivity while limiting drainage,
    without having to invest in a new irrigation infrastructure. The pilot-farmer’s
    self-learning is captured in the insight plot shown in Fig. 5. To start with,
    the pilot farmer was not sure how much irrigation to apply per event (21 or 39 mm,
    or somewhere in between) to balance between production and drainage outcomes.
    But using a trial-and-error method and by following the insight plot after each
    irrigation event, the pilot farmer was able to find an optimal irrigation amount
    that would fit an eight to nine-day return period without causing any drainage.
    Between irrigation events, the soil water within the top 200 mm dropped to stress
    point, but there still was enough water within the root zone between 200 and 400/500 mm
    depth to support pasture growth. The availability of additional water would not
    have been picked by the soil moisture sensor at one depth as done in phase one
    and would have convinced the pilot farmer that they were losing production. However,
    a complete knowledge of soil water conditions within the rootzone gave the pilot
    farmer the confidence that they were not losing out on potential production. During
    this period, the pilot farmer independently measured pasture growth to have additional,
    independent evidence. The initial few irrigation events resulted in drainage,
    but over the six-week period shown Fig. 5, the pilot farmer had settled on an
    optimal irrigation amount and frequency based on infrastructure limitation. Through
    this self-learning exercise, the pilot farmer was able to avoid investing in a
    new irrigation infrastructure that would allow them to apply less water more frequently.
    According to Fazey and Schultz (2009) such experimentation by the farmer is a
    hallmark of adaptive management – a means of actively seeking new ways of doing
    things to influence outcomes and learning about the system being managed. Download

    plot to balance between irrigation amount and frequency, drainage and pasture
    growth. 8. Discussion 8.1. Roles of context, relevancy and legitimacy Many studies
    have concluded that the uptake of tools and practices among farmers would increase
    if they (farmers) perceive the information provided is beneficial and relevant
    (Daberkow and McBride, 2003, Adrian et al., 2005, Pierpaoli et al., 2013, Reid
    and Brazendale, 2014, Payne et al., 2018). In this study, the stakeholders helped
    to describe the context (“improved water use”) and the legitimacy and relevancy
    of the irrigation scheduling tool developed within that context. Cash et al. (2003)
    presented comprehensive definitions of relevancy and legitimacy. Relevancy is
    the usefulness of the information provided to the needs of the decision makers
    and legitimacy refers to the perception that the information respectful of stakeholders’
    divergent values and beliefs (Cash et al., 2003; pg 8086). Here, we describe legitimacy
    as the acceptability of IrriMate as a tool to schedule irrigation by the farmer
    and the insight plot as an evidence of irrigation practice. When the case study
    was launched, the researchers hypothesised that adoption of soil water monitoring
    and weather forecasting for irrigation scheduling would improve water use. However,
    the co-learning process revealed additional layers that refined the context of
    improved water use. Such an evolution of perspective is central to a co-learning
    process, which happens when researchers seek a wider perspective to the problem
    and start including values and knowledge from all sources (Coutts et al., 2017).
    The establishment of context (e.g. Table 1) strengthened the relevancy of the
    tool as it encompassed multiple perspectives to improved water use. When the first
    version of the tool was developed (phase one), it was designed to specifically
    fit the existing landscape (soil moisture sensor @ 200 mm as well as presenting
    soil water data as a line trace; Fig. 2a). When the co-learning process enabled
    the stakeholders to voice their expectation of data needs to improve water use
    (see Table 1), it became evident that the current (then) technology needed to
    be revisited to meet the expectations. Operationally, both regulators and farmers
    needed irrigation-event based, (near) real-time evidence to know the impact of
    irrigation practices, which the then technology did not offer. This provided an
    impetus to look for other options such as the profile sensor. The introduction
    of profile sensor, IrriMate portal and insight plot challenged the conventional
    practice, an outcome of participatory process reported in many other studies (e.g.
    Burges and Smith 2009; McEntee, 2016). A visual representation of cause-and-effect
    (drainage followed by irrigation or rainfall) provided a compelling evidence and
    learning opportunity for the pilot farmers to alter their practices. The inclusion
    of modelled pasture production data linked to on-farm soil water conditions helped
    farmers to understand the relationship between the two. Burges and Smith (2009)
    concluded that such cause-and-effect evidence is an important component of a decision
    support tool. The participatory process induced a similar change in the way researchers
    presented forecast data during the first two phases. The co-learning process enabled
    them to redesign the forecast data presentation (compare Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig.
    4 for an evolution of data presentation). According to Cox (1996), this represents
    an analytical phase of a tool development process where the professional models
    are deconstructed to suit the intended purpose. The inclusion of regulators in
    the participatory process assisted with its context and legitimacy. The regulators
    were able to gain a first-hand account of data collected on farm and their limits
    and use in making irrigation decisions that are directly linked to resource use.
    When they identified a gap in the data collected (evidence for drainage and impending
    drainage controls through MGM process), they provided a context for the researchers
    to introduce the profile sensor. Roth et al. (2010) highlighted the importance
    of contextualising practices to allow end-users to understand their impacts. Regulators
    presented the imminent context that the farmers would need to provide evidence
    of good management practices, and this allowed the launch of the profile sensor
    technology. The importance of such an alignment of technology and context has
    been reported by Lindblom et al. (2017), Rose et al. (2018), and others. By acknowledging
    the value of data provided by the profile sensors, the regulators legitimised
    their (profile sensors’) application. The profile sensor did not quantify the
    drainage, but signalled its timing and occurrence, which the regulators considered
    a sufficiently defensible evidence of irrigation practice. Through their interaction
    with the researchers and farmers during the engagement process, the regulators
    understood the financial challenges and technical feasibility in quantifying drainage
    in every farm. 8.2. Experimentation and learning by doing In the case study, co-learning
    led to the development of IrriMate portal and insight plot that enabled experimentation.
    Insight plot led to an environment that allowed learning-by-doing and doing-by-learning
    through experimentation, the two key learning methods described in Bos et al.
    (2013) and others. The example of self-learning described earlier highlights the
    experimentation process. Such experimentation is a key enquiry step that leads
    to adapting new practices (Van der Brugge and Rotmans, 2007; Raven et al., 2010;
    Loorbach, 2010; Rotmans and Loorbach, 2010; Bos et al., 2013, and others). Even
    though the researchers consciously decided not to provide any irrigation decision
    advice, the insight plot provided the opportunity for experimentation on farm.
    As the researchers shared the data in near-real time, the pilot farmers were able
    to experiment and practice various options to arrive at a desired outcome(s).
    Such experimentation included a cycle of plan-do-observe-reflect. This learning
    cycle has been reported by Boyce et al. (2016) and others. Experimentation using
    the insight plot triggered three levels of knowledge as described in Kaiser and
    Fuhrer (2003), Garmendia and Stagl (2010), Bos et al. (2013) and others. Firstly,
    the plot provided an insight into the problem. The pilot farmers got the first-hand
    knowledge of the magnitude of irrigation impact on soil water conditions, drainage
    and pasture production. This knowledge was termed as declarative knowledge. Equipped
    with this declarative knowledge, through experimentation, the pilot farmers altered
    their irrigation practices to achieve multiple outcomes such as reduced drainage
    and unimpeded pasture growth. This procedural knowledge enabled farmers to understand
    multiplicity of options available to achieve the same outcomes. In the case study,
    these options could have been anywhere from altering the irrigation frequency
    to the amount of irrigation applied. According to Kaiser and Fuhrer (2003), Garmendia
    and Stagl (2010) and Bos et al. (2013), this procedural knowledge leads to an
    effectiveness knowledge where the pilot farmers were able to compare the effectiveness
    of various options investigated. In the case of self-learning example described
    earlier, the pilot farmer was able to alter the amount of irrigation applied and
    to some extent frequency (between 8 or 9 days) to identify the most suitable option
    to achieve drainage mitigation and production maximisation outcomes. 8.3. Roles
    of researchers in a participatory process Participatory process demands stakeholders,
    specifically researchers, to perform a variety of roles during a project. Fisher
    (2011), Harvey et al. (2012) and Hammill et al. (2013) have broadly classified
    these diverse roles under four general categories – information intermediary,
    knowledge intermediary, knowledge broker and innovation broker. At the start of
    the case study, during the early engagement process (phase one), the researchers
    performed the role of an information intermediary, by bringing together a range
    of data and information to help pilot farmers make an informed irrigation scheduling
    decision to improve water use. As the case study progressed towards the end of
    phase one, when the regulators required evidence for drainage, the researchers
    processed the daily rainfall, evapotranspiration, and irrigation data to estimate
    seasonal drainage for the case study farms. While the pilot farmers had access
    to these data over the entire time, they lacked the skill and/or time to process
    them to come up with such meaningful performance indicators. As a knowledge intermediary,
    the researchers synthesised these data into usable information (seasonal drainage)
    for the pilot farmers. The researchers continued to play the role of knowledge
    intermediary as they developed IrriMate portal that integrated multiple streams
    of data. During phase three, with the introduction of insight plot, the researchers
    performed the role of a knowledge broker. As a knowledge broker, they worked on
    presenting current and forecast data in a format that could help pilot farmers
    make informed decisions. The insight plot also led to the pilot farmers upskilling
    themselves in managing their irrigation within on-farm infrastructural limits.
    This is clearly illustrated by the self-learning example presented earlier. In
    the case of self-learning, the researchers’ role was limited to presenting the
    information in such a way that the pilot farmers could make their own decision.
    Such an evolution of the decision support tool from an analytical phase into usable
    information has been widely reported in the literature (e.g. Cox, 1996; Armstrong
    et al., 2003 and Cox et al., 2004). The researchers acted as innovation brokers
    by including the regulator as one of the stakeholders. The regulators alerted
    the group to the impending arrival of good management irrigation practices (e.g.
    MGM) and forewarned the pilot farmers and researchers to start exploring ways
    of gathering evidence to ground-truth their practices. The inclusion of regulator
    to the co-learning group introduced the challenge of drainage management, leading
    to the introduction of profile sensor, which eventually led to the insight plot.
    9. Conclusions A co-learning based participatory approach was employed in developing
    an operational irrigation scheduling tool for NZ pastoral farms. The participatory
    approach included researchers, farmers, regulators and industry professionals.
    Including multiple perspectives throughout the tool development process revealed
    unexpected insights and resulted in improved outcomes for all stakeholders. The
    co-learning process resulted in three overlapping yet distinct descriptions of
    improved water use. Researchers provided a technology-based definition (irrigation
    scheduling using soil water monitoring and weather forecast), regulators provided
    an environmental-based definition (irrigation scheduling that minimises drainage
    and nutrient leaching) and the case study farmers provided an economic definition
    (irrigation scheduling that supports pasture growth and productivity). The co-produced
    irrigation scheduling tool evolved to include all three perspectives to improved
    water use, thereby enhancing the relevancy and legitimacy of the tool, and potentially
    its uptake. The co-learning-based irrigation tool development process led to a
    number of self-learning opportunities. Researchers evolved their data collection
    (profile soil moisture sensor) and information presentation (insight plot) processes;
    and the pilot farmers learned to use the insight plot to maximise the use of their
    irrigation infrastructure to balance mitigating drainage and maximising pasture
    growth. While the initial phases of the co-learning process enabled definition
    of case study context (multiple descriptions of improved water use), the phases
    that followed resulted in an operational tool that internalised that context,
    thereby providing relevancy. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

  description: Irrigation management practices that reduce water use with acceptable
    impacts on yield are important strategies to cope with diminished water supplies
    and generate new sources of water to transfer for other agricultural uses, and
    urban and environmental demands. This study was intended to assess the effects
    of moderate water deficits, with the goal of maintaining robust alfalfa (Medicago
    sativa L.) yields, while conserving on-farm water. Data collection and analysis
    were conducted at four commercial fields over an 18-month period in the Palo Verde
    Valley, California, from 2018–2020. A range of deficit irrigation strategies,
    applying 12.5–33% less irrigation water than farmers’ normal irrigation practices
    was evaluated, by eliminating one to three irrigation events during selected summer
    periods. The cumulative actual evapotranspiration measured using the residual
    of energy balance method across the experimental sites, ranged between 2,031 mm
    and 2.202 mm, over a 517-day period. An average of 1.7 and 1.0 Mg ha−1 dry matter
    yield reduction was observed under 33% and 22% less applied water, respectively,
    when compared to the farmers’ normal irrigation practice in silty loam soils.
    The mean dry matter yield decline varied from 0.4 to 0.9 Mg ha−1 in a clay soil
    and from 0.3 to 1.0 Mg ha−1 in a sandy loam soil, when irrigation water supply
    was reduced to 12.5% and 25% of normal irrigation levels, respectively. A wide
    range of conserved water (83 to 314 mm) was achieved following the deficit irrigation
    strategies. Salinity assessment indicated that salt buildup could be managed with
    subsequent normal irrigation practices, following deficit irrigations. Continuous
    soil moisture sensing verified that soil moisture was moderately depleted under
    deficit irrigation regimes, suggesting that farmers might confidently refill the
    soil profile following normal practices. Stand density was not affected by these
    moderate water deficits. The proposed deficit irrigation strategies could provide
    a reliable amount of water and sustain the economic viability of alfalfa production.
    However, data from multiple seasons are required to fully understand the effectiveness
    as a water conservation tool and the long-term impacts on the resilience of agricultural
    systems.

    However, data from multiple seasons are required to fully understand the effectiveness
    as a water conservation tool and the long-term impacts on the resilience of agricultural
    systems. Keywords: Colorado River Basin; drought; irrigation management strategy;
    water deficit; water productivity 1. Introduction Due to recurring droughts and
    altered weather patterns, the Colorado River Basin is facing increasing uncertainty
    concerning water supplies. Hence, implementing impactful agricultural water conservation
    tools and strategies might have a significant value to the resiliency and profitability
    of agricultural systems in the low desert region of California and Arizona. It
    is likely that water deficits will be the reality for agriculture in the future,
    mostly affecting agronomic crops such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), which accounts
    for about 28% of the crops grown in the area [1] and is the dominant water user
    in the region. Currently, efficient use of irrigation water and improved irrigation
    management strategies are the most cost-effective tools to address water conservation
    issues. While more than 95% of California’s low desert alfalfa (nearly 80,000
    hectares) is currently irrigated by surface irrigation systems [2], one strategy
    to enhance water-use efficiency and on-farm water conservation in alfalfa fields
    is through improved technology of water delivery. Improved systems, such as subsurface
    drip irrigation, overhead linear move sprinkler irrigation, automated surface
    irrigation, and tailwater recovery systems might enable more precise control of
    irrigation water. Many of these technologies were already adopted by local farmers,
    although the process of adoption is continuing. Another strategy is deficit irrigation
    of alfalfa, applying less water than the full crop water requirements for a season.
    Deficit irrigation was investigated as a valuable and sustainable crop production
    strategy over a wide variety of crops, including alfalfa, to maximize water productivity
    and to stabilize—rather than maximize—yields while conserving irrigation water
    [3,4,5,6,7]. The overall effect of deficit irrigation highly depends on the type
    of crop and adopted irrigation strategy. Although alfalfa is frequently criticized
    for its high seasonal water requirements, it has positive biological features,
    environmental benefits, and greater yield potential than many other crops under
    water stressed conditions [8], such as deep-rootedness, high yield and harvest
    index, contribution to wildlife habitat, and ability to survive a drought. If
    water allotments to alfalfa are significantly curtailed, it will result in reduced
    evapotranspiration (ET), CO2 exchange, symbiotic N2 fixation, and dry matter yield
    [9]. There is a positive relationship between alfalfa yield and its ET [10,11],
    but alfalfa yields are not always reduced in direct proportion to the reduction
    in applied water during droughts [12,13]. Non-stressed total season ET values
    are greater than most crops because of long periods of effective ground cover.
    Alfalfa, being a herbaceous crop, exhibits rapid growth characteristics and its
    yield is linearly related to ET [3,14], under optimum growing conditions. Dry
    matter per unit of water used in alfalfa is compared favorably with other C3 plants.
    Several studies investigated the effect of mid-summer irrigation cut-off (no irrigation
    after June until the following spring) on alfalfa yield. Ottman et al. [15] found
    that alfalfa yield under mid-summer deficit irrigation in Arizona was very low
    and did not recover in sandy soil, but summer irrigation termination had less
    effect on sandy-loam soils. At a site in the San Joaquin Valley of California,
    yields of a mid-summer irrigation treatment were 65% to 71% of that of a fully
    irrigated alfalfa, over a 2-year period [16]. Mid-summer deficit irrigation in
    the Imperial and Palo Verde Valleys of California reduced yields to 53–64% [17]
    and 46% [18], relative to a fully irrigated alfalfa. Studies in multiple environments
    of California showed reductions in alfalfa yield, significant conservation of
    water, and the consistent ability of the crop to recover after drought [3]. In
    long-term studies conducted on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado,
    researchers determined that late-season deficits impacted yields in some cases,
    but not all, and that full recovery in the year following re-watering occurred
    in most cases [19]. In a study conducted in Nevada, significant yield reductions
    occurred from deficit irrigation over a three-year period, but yields were recovered
    under adequate irrigation during the fourth year [20]. Another study conducted
    in Kansas [21] showed no yield reductions in alfalfa hay yields, under 20% and
    30% sustained deficit subsurface drip irrigation over the season. The researchers
    suggested that rainfall had a major contribution to the crop water use, with precipitation
    contributing to about 25% of seasonal crop water use between June and October,
    for the Kansas experiment. The main purpose of this study was to identify and
    optimize moderate summer deficit irrigation strategies with profitable and sustainable
    alfalfa forage production, while conserving water under limited water conditions.
    The study intended to develop a dataset that could serve as a reference for further
    studies and an opportunity to better understand this underutilized water conservation
    strategy in the desert environment. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Field Experiments
    Studies were conducted at four commercial alfalfa fields (designated “sites A1”
    through “A4”) in the desert environment of the Palo Verde Valley, CA, USA. The
    study area had a true desert climate with an annual average air temperature, total
    annual precipitation, and ETo of 21.4 °C, 78.2 mm, and 1782 mm, respectively (Table
    1). Soil characteristics for all experimental sites pertaining to four generic
    horizons are provided in Table 2. Dominant soil type ranged from loams at sites
    A1 and A2, to clay at site A3, and sandy loam at site A4. Soil cation exchange
    capacity (CEC) ranged between 7.9 and 12.7 meq/100 g at site A4 to between 9.2
    and 22.4 meq/100 g at site A3. The Colorado River was the source of irrigation
    water with an average pH of 8.1 and an average electrical conductivity (ECw) of
    1.1 dS m−1 for all fields. Table 1. Monthly mean long-term (10-year, 2009–2018)

    Information System) station NE #135. Table 2. Physical and chemical properties
    of the soil of the four experimental sites. CEC represents the cation exchange
    capacity (meq/100 g). A1, A2, A3, and A4 represent alfalfa experimental sites.
    All four fields were planted in October 2018. Low desert alfalfa fields are typically
    harvested in a 28-day to 33-day cycle during spring and summer, while a total
    of 8–10 harvests per year is common in the region. Eleven harvest cycles were
    investigated in this study. The experimental fields represent soil types (a wide
    range from sandy loam to clay) and irrigation management practices in the low
    desert region of California. The surface irrigation practices consisted of straight
    border irrigation (sites A3 and A4) and graded furrow irrigation (sites A1 and
    A2). An average of 75% may be assumed as the irrigation efficiency of the irrigation
    systems [22]. Sites A2 and A4 were divided into three individual sections (large
    plots) and sites A1 and A3 were divided into six individual plots. Five irrigation
    strategies were studied within the experimental plots, including normal farmer
    irrigation practice (NI, as control strategy) and four summer deficit irrigations
    (DI1, DI2, DI3, DI4; Table 3). The deficit irrigation strategies were implemented
    by eliminating irrigation events during summer harvest cycles. For the harvest
    cycles of July–September, three irrigation events per cycle is common irrigation
    practice in the Palo Verde Valley. Three plots were accommodated for each of the
    deficit irrigation strategies. Table 3. Description of irrigation management strategies
    imposed at the experimental sites over the study period (18-month). 2.2. ET Monitoring
    and Data Processing The actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was measured using the
    residual of energy balance (REB) method with a combination of surface renewal
    (SR) and eddy covariance (ECov) techniques. The SR and ECov are well-recognized
    methods to estimate the sensible heat flux density (H) and to calculate the latent
    heat flux density (LE), using the REB approach [23,24,25,26,27,28]. A full flux
    density tower was set up in the plots under normal farmers’ irrigation practice
    at each of the experimental site, totaling four towers (Figure 1). In each tower,
    several sensors were set up. An NR LITE 2 net radiometer (Kipp & Zonen, Ltd.,
    Delft, The Netherlands) was used to measure net radiation (Rn). Two 76.2 µm diameter,
    type-E, chromel-constantan thermocouples model FW3 (Campbell Scientific, Inc.,
    Logan, UT, USA) were used to measure high frequency temperature data for computing
    uncalibrated sensible heat flux (H0), using the SR technique. An RM Young Model
    81000RE sonic anemometer (RM Young Inc., Traverse City, MI, USA) was used to collect
    high frequency wind velocities in three orthogonal directions at 10 Hz, to estimate
    H for the latent heat flux density calculations using the ECov technique. Figure
    1. A fully automated surface renewal and eddy covariance evapotranspiration (ET)
    tower in the plot under normal farmer irrigation practice (NI) at site A3. Each
    tower also consisted of three HFT3 heat flux plates (REBS Inc., Bellevue, WA,
    USA) inserted at a 0.05 m depth below the soil surface, to measure soil heat storage
    at three different locations; three 107 thermistor probes (Campbell Scientific,
    Inc., Logan, UT, USA) to measure soil temperature at three depths in the soil
    layer above the heat flux plates; three EC5 soil moisture sensors (METER Groups
    Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) to measure soil volumetric water content at soil depths
    and locations near the heat flux plate and the thermistor probes; EE181 temperature
    and RH sensor (Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) to measure air temperature
    and relative humidity; an SP LITE 2 Pyranometer (Kipp & Zonen, Ltd., Delft, The
    Netherlands) to measure solar radiation; and a TE525MM tipping-bucket rain gauge
    with magnetic reed switch to measure precipitation. Except for the soil sensors,
    all other sensors were set up at 1.8 m above the ground surface. The data were
    recorded using a combination of a Campbell Scientific CR1000X data logger and
    a CDM-A116 analog input module. Direct two-way communication with each monitoring
    flux tower was possible using a cellular phone modem model CELL210 (Campbell Scientific,
    Inc., Logan, UT, USA). The data of the sonic anemometer and fine wire thermocouples
    were collected at a 10 Hz sampling rate and the data of the other sensors were
    sampled once per minute. Half-hourly data were archived for later analysis. Both
    the EC and SR techniques were individually employed to determine sensible heat
    flux density. The available energy components, Rn and G (ground heat flux density)
    were also measured throughout the study period. After acquiring the half-hourly
    H0 data, a calibration factor (α) was established by determining the slope through
    the origin H values from the ECov technique versus H0 from the SR technique, separately
    for the positive and negative values of H0. The calibrated SR H value was finally
    estimated as H = α∙H0. The SR H and the ECov H were used to determine the LE values.
    The advantage from using both the ECov and SR methods was that they are independent
    and similar results provide a high level of confidence in the data used [26,28,29].
    Latent heat flux density was calculated using the Residual of Energy Balance equation,
    as follows: LE = Rn − G − H (1) where LE, G, H are positive away from the surface,
    and Rn is positive towards the surface. G is the ground heat flux density at the
    soil surface. It is assumed that Rn, G, and H are measured accurately. While use
    of the full eddy covariance method often does not demonstrate closure, Twine et
    al. [30] recommended that ECov results could be forced to have closure by holding
    the measured Bowen ratio (H/LE) constant, and increasing the H and LE values until
    Rn − G = H + LE. Twine et al. [30] also reported that using the REB method provides
    nearly the same accuracy as using the Bowen ratio correction. After determining
    LE, ETa in mm d−1 was calculated by dividing the LE in MJ m−2 d−1 by 2.45 MJ kg−1,
    to obtain the ET values in kg m−2 d−1, which was equivalent to mm d−1. A Tule
    sensor (Tule technologies, Inc., Oakland, CA, USA) was used in each of the deficit
    irrigation plots at the experimental sites, to estimate ETa using a surface renewal
    technique. The estimated daily ETa from the Tule sensors at each site was verified
    by comparing with the ETa measured from the full flux density towers. Using the
    daily ETa determined in each experimental site and the daily reference ET (ETo)
    retrieved from the spatial CIMIS (California Irrigation Management Information
    System) data [31] for the coordinates of the monitoring station, the daily actual
    crop coefficient Ka (=Ks × Kc) was calculated using Equation (2): Ka = ETa/ETo
    (2) The daily stress coefficient (Ks) represents water and salt stresses, management,
    and environmental multipliers. To obtain the actual ET, Ks is needed to adjust
    crop coefficient (Kc). Spatial CIMIS combines remotely sensed satellite data with
    traditional CIMIS stations data, to produce site-specific ETo on a 2-km grid,
    which provides a better estimate of ETo for the individual sites. 2.3. Canopy
    Temperature and Soil Moisture Monitoring Two SI-411fixed view-angle infrared thermometers
    (IRTs, Apogee Instruments, Logan, UT, USA) were used to measure canopy temperature
    in each experimental plot. The IRTs were installed on a pole with a 47.5° angle
    below horizon, in opposite direction, viewing north and south to match for consistency.
    The IRTs were installed 1.8 m from the ground surface. The average temperatures
    of IRTs viewing north and south were considered to be the canopy temperatures.
    Canopy temperature was scanned with the IRTs units every minute and readings were
    averaged over a 30-min interval, using ZL6 cellular data logger (METER Groups
    Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) was estimated using the
    difference between measured canopy and air temperatures (dTm), using Equation
    (3): 𝐶𝑊𝑆𝐼= (𝑑 𝑇 𝑚 −𝑑 𝑇 𝐿𝐿 ) (𝑑 𝑇 𝑈𝐿 −𝑑 𝑇 𝐿𝐿) (3) The dTm was compared against
    lower (dTLL) and upper (dTUL) limits of the canopy–air temperature differential,
    which could be reached under non-water-stressed and non-transpiring crop conditions.
    The Idso et al. approach [32] was used for estimating dTLL and dTUL. Watermark
    Granular Matrix Sensor (Irrometer company, Inc., Riverside, CA, USA) was used
    to measure soil water tension at multiple depths of 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120
    cm, on a continuous basis. The data of Watermark sensors were recorded by a 900M
    Monitor data logger (Irrometer company, Inc., Riverside, CA, USA), on a 30-min
    basis. 2.4. Soil Salinity Assessment Soil properties were surveyed and characterized
    within an approximate footprint area of 200 m × 200 m, around the ET monitoring
    stations in each plot, to assess soil salinity following deficit irrigation regimes.
    Surveys of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) were conducted in October
    2019 (right after the alfalfa harvest), using mobile electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) equipment, following the guidelines developed by the U.S. Salinity Laboratory
    of the United States Department of Agriculture, for field-scale salinity assessment
    [33,34,35,36]. ECa measurements were taken with a dual-dipole EM38 sensor (Geonics
    Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada), in horizontal (EMh) and vertical (EMv) dipole
    modes, to provide shallow (0 to 0.75 m) and deep (0 to 1.5 m) measurements of
    ECa, respectively. At each of the plots, soil cores at four distinct depth ranges
    (0–0.3, 0.3–0.6, 0.6–0.9, and 0.9–1.2 m) were taken from 6 sampling locations,
    which were selected using the ESAP software to reflect the spatial variability
    of root zone soil salinity. A comprehensive laboratory analysis was conducted
    on all soil samples. 2.5. Yield Measurements and Plant Stand Evaluation Yield
    sampling from the sub-plots was conducted on the same day or the day before, when
    the participating growers scheduled to harvest the entire experimental fields.
    In each irrigation plot, yield samples were taken from 12 sub-plots with a dimension
    of 1.5 m wide and 2.0 m long (Figure 1). The sub-plots were harvested using a
    hand cutter. A portable PVC quadrate was used to accurately sample uniform sub-plot
    sizes. Plant cutting height was 6–8 cm. Fresh weights of plants harvested within
    the quadrate was recorded, after which samples were dried for three days in conventional
    oven at 60 °C and recorded for alfalfa dry matter (DM). The significance of deficit
    irrigation strategies on mean dry matter yields was evaluated using a t-test.
    Forage quality test for each collected sample was conducted using the Near Infrared
    Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) method [37], to determine Crude Protein (CP),
    Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF), and Lignin percentage. All irrigation plots were evaluated
    for plant stand density in February 2020, four months after switching the deficit
    irrigated plots back to normal irrigation practices. A portable PVC quadrate of
    0.6 m wide and 0.6 m long was used to count the number of plants from the center
    of the 12 sub-plots that were used for yield measurements. Mean plant numbers
    per hectare were compared to the plots under normal farmers’ irrigation practices.
    2.6. Water Productivity Two water productivity indices were calculated to compare
    the efficiency of irrigation water use and actual ET, using Equations (4) and
    (5): Irrigation water productivity (IWP) =  𝐴𝑙𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑓𝑎 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟
    𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑑 (4) Evapotranspiration water productivity (ETWP) =  𝐴𝑙𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑓𝑎 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝐸𝑇𝑎
    (5) where the unit of alfalfa dry matter is kg ha−1, and the units of irrigation
    water applied and ETa are mm. 2.7. Statistical Analysis The statistical significances
    of mean dry matter alfalfa yield and mean forage quality indices were performed
    using t-tests. 3. Results 3.1. Weather Parameters There was higher than normal
    rainfall between November 2019 and March 2020 (Figure 2 and Table 1). Total precipitation
    was 105 mm over these five months. This precipitation amount was more than a long-term
    annual rainfall of the study area. The average daily air temperature, dew point
    temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed for the 2019 season (January 2019–December
    2019) were approximately 21.0 °C, 234.8 W m−2, 7.5 °C, and 2.3 m s−1, respectively.
    However, peak daily temperatures of 30 °C to 42 °C during the late summer months
    when deficit treatments were imposed were common for this desert environment (Figure
    2). More windy days were observed during the first half of the 2019 season, when
    compared with the 2020 season. The average daily wind speed was nearly 9% higher
    from January–June 2019 than the same season in 2020, although maximum average
    wind speed for the 2020 season, as recorded on 4th of February 2020 was 6.7 m
    s−1. During the 2019 season, the month of June had the highest average daily solar
    radiation of 334.1 W m−2, followed by May (324 W m−2) and July (310 W m−2). Figure
    2. Daily weather data of the study area over the 18-month period of this experiment
    (January 2019 to June 2020). 3.2. Applied Water The cumulative applied water (irrigation
    water + rainfall) for the different irrigation strategies at each site is shown
    in Figure 3. The total applied water was 3006, 2933, 2783, and 3125 mm in irrigation
    strategy NI for sites A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively, over the 2019 season.
    These amounts were 788, 897, 716, and 1007 for sites A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively,
    during the study period of the 2020 season. Although, most water amounts were
    provided by the irrigation events, the number of irrigation events were slightly
    different among the study sites. A total of 23 irrigation events occurred at sites
    A1 and A2 during the 2019 season, in irrigation strategy NI. The number of irrigation
    events was 22 at site A3 and 21 in at site A4. Figure 3. Cumulative applied water
    in each of the experimental irrigation strategies (NI, DI1–DI4) and sites (A1–A4)
    over the study period. The total reduction in the water used in the deficit irrigation
    strategies (DI1 to DI4) when compared with strategy NI was different at each of
    the experimental fields. For example, it was 314 mm in strategy DI1 and was 203
    mm in strategy DI2 at site A1. The reduction in applied water was 310 mm in strategy
    DI1 at site A2, 185 mm in strategy DI3 at site A3, and 239 mm in strategy DI3
    at site A4. The results demonstrated that the greatest amount of water conservation
    with the proposed deficit irrigation strategies was achieved under irrigation
    strategy DI1 at site A1, and the least amount was conserved in strategy DI4 at
    site A3. 3.3. Soil Moisture Status and Crop Water Stress The soil moisture sensors
    placed within the effective root zone (15–120 cm) provided a representative condition
    of the soil water status. Figure 3 depicts the half-hourly soil water tension
    for irrigation strategy NI at sites A2 and A4, from March 2019 to June 2020. Due
    to the necessity of drying soils during and after alfalfa harvest, and to allow
    equipment to be used on alfalfa fields and for drying of hay, irrigation events
    typically stopped approximately 4–5 days before cuttings and resumed 4–5 days
    after cuttings. Therefore, changes in soil water tension could be observed before
    and after these dry-down periods (Figure 4). Soil water tension responded most
    within the top 60 cm depth, while some responses were also observed at deeper
    soil depths over time. For example, water tension values at site A4 sharply increased
    to more than 200 kPa at the topsoil (15–45 cm), before the first irrigation events,
    right after the alfalfa harvests. Soil water tension readings below 60 cm indicated
    that soil moisture was effectively maintained at a relatively uniform and desirable
    level during the study period, even at site A4, with a sandy loam soil where soil
    water tension values were less than 25 kPa. Figure 4. Half-hourly soil water tension
    (kPa) measured at multiple depths of 15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm, 60 cm, 90 cm, and 120
    cm in plots under normal farmer irrigation practice (NI) at—(a) site A4 and (b)
    site A2, from March 2019 to June 2020. Cutting dates are demonstrated with circles
    on the x-axes. Soil moisture data indicated that the soil at site A2, which had
    a silty loam soil, was generally not within the stressed range. However, alfalfa
    at site A4 might occasionally experience moderate water stress around cuttings.
    The recommended average soil water tension levels within the effective alfalfa
    root zone at which irrigation was triggered on loamy and sandy loam soil was at
    60–90 kPa and 40–50 kPa ranges, respectively [12]. The insufficient soil moisture
    levels at site A4 during summer harvest cycles, from July through September (Figure
    4) might have caused some mild alfalfa water stress. Soil moisture was clearly
    impacted by irrigation strategy DI3 at this site (Figure 5). However, additional
    potential mild water stress could have occurred in the middle of the harvest cycles
    due to halted irrigation water. For instance, soil water tension values increased
    to 134 and 93 kPa on 24 July 2019, at 30 and 60 cm of soil depth, as a result
    of eliminating the irrigation event on 19 July 2019 (Figure 5). Similarly, soil
    moisture readings for the same soil depths and dates at this site was less than
    28 kPa for irrigation strategy NI. Figure 5. Half-hourly soil water tension (kPa)
    measured at multiple depths of 15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm, 60 cm, 90 cm, 120 cm in plots
    under (a) irrigation strategy DI3 at site A4 and (b) irrigation strategy DI4 at
    site A4, from March 2019 to mid-October 2019. Alfalfa CWSI was estimated for different
    irrigation strategies at each site, based on canopy temperature and air temperature
    measurements for three consecutive hourly periods of 1100–1200, 1200–1300, and
    1300–1400 PST. The seasonal trend of midday CWSI estimated for the period of early-June
    2019 through mid-October 2019 for different irrigation strategies at site A4,
    is shown in Figure 6. Average midday CWSI at site A4 for the period was estimated
    to be 0.13, 0.15, and 0.14 for irrigation strategies NI, DI3, and DI4, respectively,
    suggesting a similar, but relatively lower CWSI responses within the normal farmers
    irrigation practices. The CWSI values illustrated that moderate short-term midday
    water stress occurred around the alfalfa cuttings (and mid-harvest cycles) of
    July and August, thus, there was a good match between the findings obtained from
    the soil moisture data and the CWSI analysis. Figure 6. Daily crop water stress
    index (CWSI) values for the plots under different irrigation strategies (NI, DI3,
    and DI4) at site A4. NI, DI3, and DI4 represent normal farmer irrigation practice,
    applying 25% less water than NI, and applying 12.5% less water than NI, respectively.
    3.4. Actual Evapotranspiration and Crop Coefficients ETa was determined by calculating
    half-hourly latent heat flux density, using the REB approach with the SR and EC
    techniques. The daily ETo, ETa from the SR calculations, and Ka values for the
    irrigation strategy NI, at sites A1 and A4 are shown in Figure 7. The ETa varied
    widely for each crop harvest cycle and throughout the experimentation seasons
    at both sites. For example, the ETa at site A4 ranged between 3.4 mm d−1 after
    alfalfa cutting and 9.3 mm d−1 at midseason full crop canopy, from June through
    August. The maximum and minimum ETa at site A1 were 2.6 mm d−1 and 0.3 mm d−1
    during three-months of the study period, November 2019 to January 2020. Figure
    7. Daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo), daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa),
    and daily actual crop coefficient (Ka) at sites (A1) and (A4), from March 2019
    to June 2020. The cumulative ETa (CETa) in irrigation strategy NI at sites A1–A4,
    for a 517-day period (1 January 2019 to 31 May 2020) was 2202, 2187, 2031, and
    2175 mm, respectively (Figure 8). For a one-season 12-month irrigation period
    (2019) for the same irrigation strategy, the cumulative ETa was 1596 mm at site
    A1, 1582 mm at site A2, 1423 mm at site A3, and 1558 mm at site A4. Comparing
    the total applied water and the cumulative ETa under normal farmer irrigation
    strategies indicated that the plots under NI irrigation strategy remained over-irrigated
    during the whole study period. However, moderate water stress was occasionally
    observed for the NI irrigation strategy, particularly at sites A3 and A4, because
    of the dry-down around alfalfa harvests or the unprecedented delays in irrigation
    schedules. Figure 8. Cumulative reference evapotranspiration (Spatial CIMIS ETo)
    and cumulative actual evapotranspiration (ETa) at each of the experimental sites
    (A1–A4). The cumulative ETa are provided for the plots under normal farmer irrigation
    practices at each site. The average spatial CIMIS ETo of the four sites is provided
    as ETo. The daily Ka values for the sites A1 and A4 (irrigation strategy NI) over
    the study period are shown in Figure 7. The Ka value depended on alfalfa growth
    stages, ranging from smallest during initial growth stage, just after each harvest,
    and reaching the maximum when the crop height was at mid and full canopy development
    stages, attained prior to each harvest cycle. Large Ka values were attained at
    both sites during March and April (ranging from 0.47 after harvest to 1.24 at
    full canopy). Growth of alfalfa in early season (January) and late season (November
    to December) was slower due to cooler weather and lower solar radiation, in which
    lower Ka values were observed. The average Ka values of alfalfa sites over the
    study period varied from 0.8 at site A3 to 0.87 at site A1 (Figure 8 and Table
    4). Table 4. Mean (±standard deviation) Ka values of harvest cycles for each experimental
    site (A1–A4) determined from surface renewal measurements. The values are reported
    for the normal farmer irrigation practices over eight cuts in the season 2019
    (Year 1) and three cuts in the season 2020 (Year 2). Average Ka values at harvest
    cycles (eight cuttings in 2019 and three cuttings in 2020) for each experimental
    site are provided in Table 4. The results demonstrated seasonal variabilities
    in the harvest cycle Ka values. With an average seasonal Ka value of 0.87 for
    the 2019 season at the site A1, the average cutting cycle Ka values varied from
    0.72 (cutting cycle 8) to 1.0 (cutting cycle 2). Average seasonal Ka values for
    the 2019 season at sites A2, A3, and A4 were 0.86, 0.79, and 0.84, respectively.
    There was a considerable increase in average Ka value (12.5%) at site A3 from
    the 2020 cropping season compared to 2019. Lower Ka values in the first three
    harvest cycles of the 2019 season might have been due to poor irrigation management.
    Site A3 received 424 mm water during the first three months of 2019, which was
    the lowest amount of water applied amongst the experimental sites (Figure 3).
    While trivial differences (an average of 5%) were found in the average Ka values
    at sites A1 and A2 during harvest cycles of June–August (cutting cycles 4 to 6)
    at site A1 and A2, substantial differences (average of 20%) were obtained in the
    mean Ka values of cutting cycles at sites A3 and A4. The observed average Ka value
    from this study was lower than the value (0.95) suggested by Doorenbos and Kassam
    [38] for dry climate and 0.99 reported by Hanson et al. [3] for the Sacramento
    Valley. However, the average Ka value was about the same as what was found by
    Kuslu et al. [39]. 3.5. Soil Salinity and Water Availability Features It is well-known
    that salinity associated problems are a major challenge for global food production,
    with particularly critical impact in the low desert region. Applications of excess
    water to control soil root zone salinity is an important agricultural practice
    for these regions and considered a ‘beneficial use’ of water, since soils and
    crop production can only be sustained by controlling salinity. Buildup of salinity
    might be considered a serious concern and likely a key limitation for any reduced
    water demand strategies in the region. Therefore, it is important to understand
    the impact of deficit irrigation on potential soil salinity buildup and soil water
    balances, vis-à-vis evapotranspiration and devising optimal irrigation management.
    Spatially interpolated map of EMv at sites A1, A2, and A4 in late October of 2019,
    just before all deficit irrigated plots were switched to normal farmer irrigation
    practice after the 1.5-year study, is shown in Figure 9. The entire surveyed areas
    that were affected by the different irrigation strategies at these sites exhibited
    small EMv measurements (11.13–174.57 mS m−1 or 0.11–1.17 dS m−1). These measurements
    approximate the differences in EM values (which is affected by salinity, texture,
    and moisture) in approximately the top 1.2 m of soil. Inconsequential differences
    were observed among EMv values of the plots treated with different irrigation
    strategies. However, we should point out that these were moderate deficit treatments,
    and more severe deficits might cause greater excess salinity buildup. Figure 9.
    Spatial distribution of ancillary variable EMv (electromagnetic induction measurement
    in the vertical coil orientation) at sites (A1), (A2), and (A4). 100 m S m−1 is
    equal 1 dS m−1. In this study, the mean ECe at the effective crop root zone (30–120
    cm), across the experimental sites in late October 2019, demonstrated that deficit
    irrigation strategies had some impacts on the soil salinity (Figure 10), however,
    these values were always in the ‘acceptable’ range for alfalfa. A higher level
    of ECe values were observed in plots under irrigation strategy DI1, in comparison
    to plots under irrigation strategies NI and DI2, at sites A1 and A2 (furrow irrigated
    alfalfa fields). For instance, the mean ECe at site A2 was 2.2 dS m−1 and 4.2
    dS m−1 at 60 and 90 cm soil depths, respectively, in irrigation strategy DI1.
    However, the values were 1.47 and 1.76 dS m−1 in irrigation strategy NI, and were
    1.45 and 2.2 dS m−1 in irrigation strategy DI2, at the corresponding depths, respectively.

    of the saturation extract) distribution of observed values in different irrigation
    strategies at four experimental sites. The complete data (collected in late October
    2019) from the six soil core sampling locations in plots under different irrigation
    strategies at each site were used to plot ECe. 3.6. Alfalfa Yield Responses Alfalfa
    dry matter values for eight seasonal cuttings 2019 (Y1) and the first three cuttings
    for 2020 (Y2) under each irrigation strategies of all experimental sites are illustrated
    in Figure 11. The results indicated that the first four cuttings were the most
    productive for all sites in 2019. For instance, mean DM yield at site A2 from
    irrigation strategy NI were 4.7, 4.0, 4.7, and 3.9 Mg ha−1 for first, second,
    third, and fourth cuttings, respectively. For sites A1, A2, and A4, mean DM values
    for the first three cuttings in 2020 were lower than the corresponding DM values
    in 2019. At site A3, alfalfa DM yields were relatively lower than the other sites
    over the first three cuttings of the 2019 season. Figure 11. Mean dry matter (DM)
    yields of each irrigation strategy (NI, DI1–DI4) at the experimental sites (A1–A4)
    for eight cuttings in the season 2019 (Cu1-Y1 to Cut8-Y1) and three cuttings in
    the season 2020 (Cut1-Y2 to Cut3-Y2). The bars demonstrate the standard deviation
    of DM values. Alfalfa mean DM yields from the 5th to 7th cuttings in 2019 were
    much lower than the first four cuttings even under full irrigation practices.
    Yields in late summer were moderately affected by deficit irrigation strategies.
    For example, yield reduction at site A1 from cuttings 5, 6, and 7 in irrigation
    strategy DI1, compared to irrigation strategy NI were 0.3, 0.8, and 0.6 Mg ha−1,
    respectively (Figure 11). The reduction in DM yield was 0.5 Mg ha−1 for cutting
    6 and was 0.4 Mg ha−1 for cutting 7 in irrigation strategy DI2. Yields summed
    over the 11 cuttings, over 1.5 years, were reduced from 0.7% to 4.6% (0.3 to 1.7
    Mg ha−1) by the deficit irrigation practices at the four sites. 3.7. Forage Quality
    There was a trend for a small improvement in forage quality due to the deficit
    irrigation strategies, but not at all sites (Table 5). A significant reduction
    in acid detergent fiber was observed in deficit irrigation strategies DI1 at site
    A2 and DI2 at site A1, compared to normal irrigation practice (p values of 0.001
    for DI1 at site A2, 0.02 for DI2 at site A1). Significant crude protein increase
    was also found from implementing deficit irrigation regimes DI1 at site A2 (p
    value of 0.04) and DI3 at site A4 (p value of 0.01), but not at other sites. No
    significant impact was observed on lignin percentage. The improved forage quality
    might be attributed to a reduction in stem growth (increase % leaf) under such
    irrigation practices. Small improvements in alfalfa forage quality under deficit
    irrigation regimes was also reported by other researchers [5,40,41]. Table 5.
    Mean forage quality indices (Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF), Crude Protein (CP), and
    Lignin) of normal farmer irrigation practices against deficit irrigation strategies.
    The forage quality data of June through September 2019 was used for this analysis
    (t-test). 3.8. Water Conservation Versus Yield Reduction Deficit strategies with
    alfalfa are primarily feasible due to the seasonal yield patterns of the crop,
    with heavy yields during early season, and very light yields in late summer. Approximately
    73–74% of total alfalfa seasonal yield productivity at the experimental sites
    occurred by mid-July (20 July 2019), right before starting summer deficit irrigation
    strategies (Figure 12). This finding is similar to results from research reported
    for the Sacramento Valley of California [5,39]. The deficit irrigation strategies
    could affect the 5th through 7th cuttings, while only 21–22% of the annual DM
    yield was produced during this period. Figure 12. Cumulative alfalfa yield percentage
    over the growing season 2019 at the experimental sites (A1–A4). Results are provided
    for the normal irrigation practices at each site. A significant DM reduction was
    observed in deficit irrigation strategies DI1 and DI2, compared to normal irrigation
    practice at site A2 (p value of 0.0004 for DI1 and 0.002 for DI2). There was also
    a significant yield reduction in deficit irrigation DI1 at site A1 (p value of
    0.0005) (Table 6). No significant DM reduction was affected by deficit irrigation
    regimes DI3 and DI4 at sites A3 and A4; and deficit irrigation DI2 at site A2.
    The findings suggest an average of 1.7 Mg ha−1 and 1.0 Mg ha−1 dry matter yield
    reduction in deficit irrigation strategies DI1 and DI2 at sites A1 and A2, respectively
    (Table 6). The average DM yield reduction at sites A3 and A4 was nearly 1.0 Mg
    ha−1 in deficit irrigation strategy DI3 and 0.4 Mg ha−1 in deficit irrigation
    strategy DI4. Table 6. The total mean dry matter yield (Mg ha−1) for different
    irrigation management strategies and total mean dry matter yield in normal irrigation

    t-tests is provided. The total amount of conserved water across the experimental
    sites varied from 83 mm (3.0%) at site A3 to 314 mm (10.5%) at site A1, relative
    to what was used under seasonal water applied in normal irrigation practice. Summer
    deficit irrigation strategies enhanced the IWP values, but not the ETWP values
    (Table 7). For instance, irrigation strategies DI1 and DI2 at site A2 improved
    the IWP value by 0.5 and 0.4 kg ha−1 mm−1, respectively, compared to the irrigation
    strategy NI (with an IWP of 8.9 kg ha−1 mm−1). Table 7. The irrigation water productivity

    4. Discussion Alfalfa was historically reported to be a moderately sensitive crop
    to salinity, with estimated yield declines above a saturated soil extract (ECe)
    of 2.0 dS m−1 [42]. However, more recent reports and experiments in California
    confirmed that alfalfa has a much higher tolerance of salinity. Field and greenhouse
    experiments estimated tolerance of alfalfa varieties up to approximately 6.0 ECe
    or higher [43]. The findings from this study suggest that the proposed deficit
    irrigation strategies might cause salt accumulation at the crop root zone (particularly
    for furrow irrigated alfalfa fields) and this practice might elevate soil salinity
    class from a non-saline soil (0–2 dS m−1) to slightly saline (2–4 dS m−1) condition.
    Soil salinity can be managed by switching to farmer irrigation practices in early
    fall (mid- to late-October), with no need for the excessive water to leach salts.
    The deliberate re-filling of the soil profile with irrigation water after implementing
    summer deficits should be considered, both in terms of water availability, salinity
    management, and water-use policy. The continuous soil moisture readings in this
    study verified that there was insignificant soil moisture depletion from deficit
    irrigations to require some recharge (Figure 4 and Figure 5). As can be seen from
    the soil water tension data plots, the average soil water tension was kept constant
    at about 88 kPa, at the top 30 cm, and maintained at about 15 kPa, for the 45–120
    cm soil depth. Consequently, farmers might confidently refill the soil profile
    after implementing summer deficit irrigation strategies and switching to their
    normal irrigation practices with little excessive water needs in the fall. At
    sites A1–A4, the total mean annual DM yield in irrigation strategy NI for 2019
    was 26.2, 26.5, 23.2, and 25.0 Mg ha−1, respectively (Figure 11). These alfalfa
    yield values from the long-seasoned low desert sites are generally higher than
    the average alfalfa yield in California, which ranges from 14.6 to 16.1 Mg ha−1,
    and a thirty-year (1984–2013) statewide average yield of 15.3 Mg ha−1 [44]. Dry
    matter yields of 11.2 Mg ha−1 was reported in an earlier deficit study that imposed
    severe water deficits, restricting applications to 1,249 mm seasonal water use
    in the Imperial Valley [3]. Alfalfa plant stand evaluation conducted on 18 February
    2020 showed no significant differences in the plant population between the deficit
    irrigation strategies and normal irrigation practices, suggesting that there is
    no evidence of losing the alfalfa plant density from the implemented deficit irrigation
    strategies. For instance, plant population per hectare at site A1 was estimated
    to be 103 × 106, 105 × 106, and 102 × 106 in the plots under irrigation strategies
    NI, DI1, and DI2, respectively. Additionally, no yield reduction was observed
    from the summer deficit irrigation strategies within the first three harvest cuttings
    of the 2020 season (Figure 10), indicating a full recovery of the crop upon re-watering.
    None of the deficit irrigation strategies produced severe water or salinity stress
    at the experimental sites. Soil water availability in non-sandy soils (sites A1–A3)
    was retained at a desired level during and after summer irrigation strategies.
    At site A4 (sandy loam soil), the residual soil moisture below the depth of 45
    cm was consistent at a non-stressed level, and supplied enough water for alfalfa,
    suggesting that this might be a primary reason why there was only a small reduction
    in total ETa of deficit irrigated plots. The maximum ETa reduction (54 mm) was
    observed in irrigation strategy DI1 at site A2, when compared with strategy NI.
    The findings revealed that ETa was not directly reduced in relation to the level
    of reduction in applied water. This might be part of the reason why no improvement
    was gained in the ETWP values from moderate deficit irrigation strategies. Further
    measurement is necessary to provide a more solid conclusion on the impact of the
    deficit irrigation strategies on ETa. Overall, the ETWP values computed for the
    normal farmer irrigation practices and deficit irrigation trials at the experimental
    sites (an average of 16.1 kg ha−1 mm−1) were as high as the values predicted by
    Montazar et al. [45] for alfalfa fields, under subsurface drip irrigation in the
    low desert of California. Imposition of summer water deficits is likely to result
    in yield reductions, a finding that was similar to other researches [3,4,5,6,7,17].
    The findings suggest that conserving 0.083–0.314 (ha.m) ha−1 water through summer
    deficit irrigation strategies might result in 0.3–1.7 Mg ha−1 yield loss in California’s
    low desert alfalfa production system. Therefore, while insignificant yield reduction
    is unpreventable, the proposed management strategies could serve as an effective
    water conservation tool. The hay yield reduction might be a consequence of reduced
    water distribution uniformity caused by the deficit irrigation regimes. Large-scale
    farming systems in the low desert, along with the use of surface irrigation methods,
    resulted in lower water distribution uniformity values (over time and space) with
    deficit irrigation strategies. Results expected from these deficit irrigation
    strategies would likely be more favorable in more efficient irrigation systems
    such as subsurface drip irrigation systems or advanced overhead sprinkler systems.
    The practice of filling the soil profile so that it holds as much water as possible
    would be an effective early-season alfalfa irrigation strategy. Such practice
    might allow alfalfa to take full advantage of the available water and promote
    its rapid, early season growth, when the yield potential was highest, and when
    soil and water temperatures were not likely to be high enough to stress the crop
    and limit crop productivity. Consequently, combining full irrigation in winter-spring
    with moderate deficit irrigation during summer could be an efficient approach
    in conserving water than continuously irrigating (or over irrigating) for the
    entire season. 5. Conclusions This study aimed at assessing the effectiveness
    of moderate deficit irrigation strategies during summer harvest cycles (less applied
    water than normal farmers’ irrigation practices) on conserving water and maintaining
    a robust hay production. The proposed deficit irrigation strategies conducted
    showed a promising and decent amount of water conservation and simultaneously
    generated desirable hay yields and quality. However, yield penalties of this practice
    must be considered. These moderate deficit irrigation practices resulted in an
    average of 1.47 Mg ha−1 and 0.31 Mg ha−1 hay yield reduction, but used 33% (≈0.31
    (ha.m) ha−1) and 12.5% less applied-water than normal farmer practice over the
    summer (≈0.10 (ha.m) ha−1), respectively. Several cautionary notes need to be
    considered with the data reported and the analysis provided in this study: The
    ET and crop coefficient values reported herein are referred to as observed or
    actual values, which are limited by water deficits and salinity, and the ‘dry
    down’ required for frequent harvests. The maximum crop ET (ETc) is limited only
    by energy availability to vaporize water and not soil hydrology or salinity, or
    droughts imposed by harvest scheduling. Imposed stress, such as this, is common
    to almost all alfalfa growing regions. Although stand density under desert conditions
    decays more rapidly than other locations, there were negligible differences between
    different deficit irrigation strategies and normal farmers’ irrigation practices
    in this study after one year of water deficits. However, it is uncertain whether
    multiple years of summer irrigation strategies might threaten the long-term viability
    of the crop stand and yields. Although, it might be unlikely to prevent salinity
    buildup due to summer water deficits, salinity issues are likely to be managed
    through irrigation practices that flush salts in the months after implementing
    deficit irrigations. Continuous monitoring of soil salinity is recommended to
    ensure flushing/leaching salts out of root zone over multiple deficit irrigation
    seasons. The importance of re-filling of the soil profile with water, in the year
    after implementing summer irrigation strategies, need to be considered both in
    terms of water availability, crop production, and policy. Such practices might
    enable shifting water demand to water-rich time periods in early spring. This
    practice would benefit both early season growth and salinity management in subsequent
    years. In this study, continuous soil moisture readings verified that soil moisture
    was insignificantly depleted in the deficit irrigation fields. However, data from
    multiple irrigation seasons are required to fully certify this conclusion. Implementation
    of the proposed summer deficit irrigation strategies on alfalfa could provide
    a reliable source of seasonally available water as well as sustain the economic
    viability of agriculture in the region. These strategies might be sustainable
    as an effective water conservation tool if such measures provide adequate economic
    incentives to the participating farmers. Incentive programs to farmers must offset
    the risk of implementing the proposed practices (even trivial production loss),
    as a tool for adopting water conservation practices. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: 'Agriculture accounts for more than 50% of freshwater withdrawal in
    the Mediterranean. Data-enabled technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT),
    can play an important role in boosting water and energy use efficiency and improving
    crop productivity, by increasing the reliability and accuracy of real-time information.
    Advances in IoT have seen the proliferation of standards, open source software/hardware
    and low-cost devices as enablers for improving real-time data collection. Open
    source and low-cost technologies are important in rural environments, such as
    those dedicated to agriculture activities, in order to promote a wide adoption
    by farmers. Designing and deploying open, cost-effective and standardized smart
    solutions for irrigation management based on IoT requires the integration of different
    components: Devices, communication and data transport, databases and data analytics,
    cloud computing and data visualization. This paper discusses the design, implementation
    and deployment of an IoT-based solution that provides a cost-effective service
    for irrigation management, integrating open source, low cost and open standard
    technologies. The service has been deployed in Sicily (Catania plain) in order
    to provide farmers with tools for reducing water footprints and improving crop
    productivity in citrus farming.'

    Agriculture accounts for more than 50% of freshwater withdrawal in the Mediterranean.
    Data-enabled technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), can play an important
    role in boosting water and energy use efficiency and improving crop productivity,
    by increasing the reliability and accuracy of real-time information. Advances
    in IoT have seen the proliferation of standards, open source software/hardware
    and low-cost devices as enablers for improving real-time data collection. Open
    source and low-cost technologies are important in rural environments, such as
    those dedicated to agriculture activities, in order to promote a wide adoption
    by farmers. Designing and deploying open, cost-effective and standardized smart
    solutions for irrigation management based on IoT requires the integration of different
    components: devices, communication and data transport, databases and data analytics,
    cloud computing and data visualization. This paper discusses the design, implementation
    and deployment of an IoT-based solution that provides a cost-effective service
    for irrigation management, integrating open source, low cost and open standard
    technologies. The service has been deployed in Sicily (Catania plain) in order
    to provide farmers with tools for reducing water footprints and improving crop
    productivity in citrus farming. Published in: 2019 IEEE International Conference

    I. Introduction In the Mediterranean region, agriculture is the sector that contributes
    the most to overall water abstractions, accounting for 50% of total water withdrawals
    on average, up to more than 80% in some countries such as Morocco, Greece and
    Syria [1]. These figures are associated with an unsustainable over-exploitation
    of water resources, further characterized by water scarcity and degradation limiting
    the expansion of the agricultural sector with consequences on food and environmental
    security [2]. The efficient use of water for irrigation is a key component in
    solving water scarcity issues at regional scales, but it is also vital for optimizing
    crop yield and quality, which are the main and direct concerns of farmers. The
    goal of optimal irrigation is to maintain soil extractable water in the rooting
    zone within defined values, that vary between crop types and during the season,
    in order to improve both crop yields and fruit quality. The most diffused irrigation
    management procedure consists in manually applying water at a fixed frequency
    based on farmers knowledge on a scheduled basis. In reality, the fixed frequency
    and amounts may vary depending on farmers perception of weather conditions and
    plant water status [3]. Data-enabled technologies can enhance irrigation management
    by monitoring soil and weather spatial and temporal variability with in-situ sensors
    and providing accurate and reliable real-time information to farmers that can
    define better irrigation scheduling – i.e. when and where to apply water and in
    what amount. In particular, those technologies can enable i) feedback-based irrigation,
    i.e. manually applying water based on the weather and soil information provided
    by sensors, and ii) automated irrigation, i.e. automatically opening or closing
    valves fully confiding in the information provided by the sensors. As a data enabler
    technology, Internet of Things (IoT) is going to play an increasingly central
    role in farming. However, there are still some challenges that needs to be addressed
    in order to promote a wide adoption of IoT technologies for irrigation management
    practices in real-life scenarios. Indeed, while there is a plethora of open source
    IoT platforms [4], to the best of our knowledge, there are no open and low-cost
    IoT-based solutions that focus on real-time services for irrigation. There have
    been different approaches based on IoT to help farmers apply the correct amounts
    of water at the proper time but they are limited to collection and visualization
    of real-time data coming from sensors [5] [6], experimental frameworks for smart
    water management [7], batch analysis of crop performance to provide recommendations
    on agriculture practices [8] and evaluation of open IoT solutions for precision
    agriculture in testbed-like scenarios [9]. The main aim of the paper is to present
    and discuss the design, implementation and deployment of an IoT-based solution
    in real-life scenarios, based on low-cost devices, low-power wireless technologies
    and open source platforms in order to foster innovation in irrigation management
    practices through real-time computation of crop water demand based on soil and
    weather information. SECTION II. A Prototype Iot-Based Service For Irrigation
    Management An important step in designing an IoT-based service is the deployment
    of the wireless communication network between the devices that gather real-time
    data from the environment (e.g. weather, soil and water applied for irrigation)
    and the backend IT system (usually cloud-based) that provides data storage, analysis
    and visualization. An emerging open standard for wireless communication, such
    as LoRaWAN [10] appears very appropriate for agricultural use cases: i) rural
    environments are often characterized by a good line of sight over long distances;
    ii) the temporal variability of the measured physical variables is relatively
    low and partially predictable, thus a low frequency monitoring, in the order of
    few messages per hour, is more than adequate; iii) battery powered devices in
    rural environments are preferred and sometimes are the only possible choice, if
    power sources are missing, thus requiring a network deployment that is adequate
    for low power consumption. LoRaWAN has been developed to create low-power and
    wide-area networks (LPWANs) and designed for sensors and applications that need
    to send small amounts of data over long distances a few times per hour, offering
    a mix of long range, low power consumption and secure data transmission. A network
    based on the LoRa wireless technology can provide coverage that is greater in
    range compared with other wireless networks. Other communication networks such
    as WiFi or cellular technology are great for applications that need high data
    throughput and have a power source. Moreover, LoRAWAN is a low-cost and open source
    technology requiring minimal infrastructure and based on open specification [11].
    The architecture of the prototype service with its main components and the LoRaWAN
    topology, compliant with the LoRa alliance specification, is shown in Fig. 1,
    where it consists of several elements described in the following. End-Node. End-Nodes
    are elements such as remote sensors and actuators. Contrary to other wireless
    networks, such as cellular, that require energy consumption for synchronization,
    the end-nodes in a LoRaWAN network are asynchronous and communicate when they
    have data ready to send, increasing the battery lifetime. LoRaWAN utilizes different
    device classes (A, B and C) according to the application requirements, with a
    trade-off between network downlink communication latency and battery lifetime.
    Class A devices (e.g. battery powered sensors) are the most energy efficient ones,
    with downlink communication available shortly after the end-device has sent an
    uplink transmission. Class B devices (e.g. battery powered actuators), in addition
    to the Class A random receive windows, open extra receive windows at scheduled
    times, when it receives a time-synchronized beacon from the gateway, allowing
    the server to know when the end-device is listening. End-devices of Class C (e.g.
    main powered actuators) have no latency for downlink communication; they can almost
    continuously listen, except when transmitting. Gateway. Gateways are access points
    for end nodes, that aggregate the received data and forward it to the network
    server via some standard IP connection (cellular, WiFi, Ethernet or satellite);
    they also emit radio frequency (RF) packets (i.e. downlink communications) that
    are sent by the network server. In a LoRaWAN network, end-nodes are not associated
    with a specific gateway; several gateways can be co-located in an area and can
    transparently share a single connection to the network server, thus data transmitted
    by a node is typically received by multiple gateways. Gateways can use multichannel
    and multi-modem transceivers so that simultaneous messages on multiple channels
    can be received, increasing the LoRaWAN network capacity. Network Server. The
    Network Server manages the networks by filtering duplicate/redundant uplink frames
    received by the gateway(s), scheduling downlink data transmissions and performing
    adaptive data rates. Figure 1. Architecture of the prototype service. Show All
    Application Server. Application Servers are responsible for the management of
    a LoRaWAN infrastructure end-devices, as well as the handling of join-request
    during the Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) protocol and the handling and encryption
    of application payloads. Application Servers can be enhanced/integrated with IoT
    backend (cloud-based) systems that can perform data analysis and visualization.
    According to the LoRaWAN architecture portrayed above, we will describe, in the
    following paragraphs, the components of the prototype service developed for irrigation
    management, by integrating low-cost and open source solutions available in the
    IoT ecosystem. A. End Nodes Rapid advances in electronic technologies and efforts
    similar to open source software initiatives to enable free and open sharing of
    hardware design have resulted in a variety of new and inexpensive sensing, monitoring,
    and control capabilities which offer opportunities for implementation in agricultural
    and natural-resource research applications [12]. Open solutions such as Arduino
    [13], Raspberry [14], Pycom [15] have contributed to the innovation, improvement
    and rapid and wide adoption of low cost-devices for monitoring applications. In
    our prototype service for irrigation management, we have considered two station
    types: i) Weather Station for meteorological variables monitoring and ii) Field
    Station for soil moisture and applied water monitoring. The sensors connected
    to each station type are listed in Table I. Table I Weather and Field Station
    Sensors The weather and field stations share the same data logger for reading
    and communicating sensor values. The data logger is based on three open and low-cost
    microcontrollers (see Fig. 2), each one providing a specific purpose, which are
    described in the following. Sensor Board. The sensor board, based on the ATMEGA
    328p microcontroller (Arduino-like), is physically connected to the sensors and
    can be programmed in C/C++ language to read values from sensor measurements. The
    Cayenne Low Power Payload (LPP) library [16] has been used to encode the sensors
    values, which will be sent with the LoRaWAN module. Management Board. The management
    board, based on AriettaG25 [17], an ARM9 CPU Microchip AT91SAMG25, provides the
    communication bus, power supply and battery charge regulation, USB expansion and
    communication ports. The board contains a custom Linux distro that allows process
    synchronization, input/output management and remote controlling (via a 3G module),
    allowing operations such as firmware updates and reboots when needed. Figure 2.
    Data logger of Weather and Field Stations. Show All LoRaWAN Module. The LoRaWAN
    module is based on Pycom LoPy 1.0 [18]. It can be programmed in MicroPython and
    it is responsible for sending data to the LoRaWAN gateways. It has been programmed
    in order to use the OTAA protocol: the module performs a join procedure with the
    network server, during which a dynamic device address is assigned, and security
    keys are negotiated. B. Gateway As a prototype for the LoRaWAN Gateway, the Lite
    Gateway by IMST GmbH [19] has been used to develop and test the private LoRaWAN
    network. The gateway platform consists of a concentrator iC880A [20], a Raspberry
    PI, a pre-configured SD-card and an aluminum housing. A LoRa packet forwarder
    program [21], running on the Raspberry Pi, ensures forwarding of RF packets received
    by the concentrator to a server through an IP/UDP link and emits RF packets (downlink
    communications) that are sent by the server. C. Network Server For our prototype
    service, we have considered the lorawan-server [22] open source solution that
    includes all functions required to run a private LoRaWAN network and provides
    the integration with external applications using backend handlers and connectors.
    Moreover, the lorawan-server automatically parses Cayenne payload formats, that
    were chosen as the encoding for the messages sent by weather and field stations.
    The lorawan-server provides connectors that define transport of data fields to/from
    external IoT platforms. Each connector is linked with one handler and specifies
    the communication protocol, target endpoint (i.e. server address and message topics)
    and encoding of the data fields (i.e. json, raw data and web form). Figure 3.

    Chain to compute the crop evapotranspiration and the suggested water for irrigation.
    Show All D. Application Server The lorawan-server provides both the possibility
    of developing internal applications (running on the same server) and the integration
    of external IoT middleware/platforms through MQTT protocol configurations (see
    [23] for a complete list of supported platforms). For our prototype, we have considered
    the ThingsBoard IoT platform [24], an open source solution allowing rapid development,
    management and scaling of IoT projects and that can be easily integrated within
    the LoRaWAN deployment. In particular, ThingsBoard allows provisioning and managing
    devices, assets and customers and defining relations between them; collecting,
    storing and visualizing data from devices and assets; analyzing incoming telemetry
    in real-time and triggering alarms using customizable rule chains; controlling
    devices using remote procedure calls (RPC); designing dynamic and responsive dashboards
    for presenting device telemetry to end-users. ThingsBoard architecture consists
    of different components (see Fig. 1), that are described in the following. Transport
    provides MQTT, HTTP and CoAP based APIs that are available for receiving telemetry
    data from devices/gateways. Each transport component communicates with the main
    ThingsBoard Core Service using Kafka [25]. In our prototype service, the MQTT
    transport has been selected by appropriately configuring the lorawan-server connector.
    Rule Engine is a framework for building event-based workflows (i.e. Rule Chains),
    that allows filtering, enriching and transforming incoming messages generated
    by IoT devices. In our prototype service, the Rule Engine has been used to develop
    custom Rule Chains to compute in real-time the reference and crop evapotranspiration
    [26] (see Fig. 3 and 4) and the suggested water for irrigation (see Fig. 4). A
    Rule Chain is composed of different Rule Nodes connected with each other with
    relations, so the outbound message from a Rule Node is sent to the next connected
    Rule Nodes. ThingsBoard provides different types of Rule Nodes (filter, enrichment,
    transformation, action and external nodes) and allows to build custom JavaScript
    functions to parse, filter and transform messages (see Fig. 5 for a custom JavaScript
    function to compute the reference evapotranspiration). Storage/Database is used
    to store entities (devices, assets, customers, dashboards, etc.) and telemetry
    data (attributes, time series sensor readings, statistics, events). ThingsBoard
    supports three database options at the moment: SQL - Stores all entities and telemetry
    in SQL database (PostgreSQL [27] for production and HSQLDB [28] for local development
    purposes); NoSQL - Stores all entities and telemetry in NoSQL database (Cassandra
    [29] is the only NoSQL database supported by ThingsBoard); Hybrid - Stores all
    entities in SQL database and all telemetry in NoSQL database. For our prototype
    service, the entities are stored in PostgreSQL database and the time series, related
    to the telemetry data coming from all stations, are stored considering the PostgreSQL
    extension TimescaleDB [30] (by creating an hypertable for the ThingsBoard table
    ts_kv). TimescaleDB is an open-source time-series database optimized for fast
    ingest and complex queries. TimescaleDB provides faster operations on time series
    such as 2000x faster deletes with respect to PostgreSQL [31] that are critical
    for implementing data retention policies; also, the comparison with Cassandra
    shows faster operations on the time series - for complex analysis queries TimescaleDB
    is 3100x-5800x faster with respect to Cassandra [32]. Figure 5. JavaScript function
    to compute the reference evapotranspiration. Show All Figure 6. Real-time dashboard.
    Show All Web UI allows the configuration of customizable IoT dashboards. Each
    IoT dashboard may contain multiple widgets that visualize data from multiple devices.
    ThingsBoard provides the developer with a rich library composed of a number of
    predefined widgets divided into macro categories: time series, latest values,
    control, alarm and static widgets. For each category, different kinds of graphical
    solutions are available, such as charts or tables, maps, simple HTML cards, GPIO
    (General Purpose Input/Output) controls, analog and digital gauges and so on.
    The platform also allows the developer to customize a widget in order to make
    it more suitable for its purpose; a very simple page allows specifying the logical
    behavior (HTML/JavaScript) and the graphical aspect (CSS) of the widget. In our
    prototype service, a dashboard composed of library and custom widgets allows farmers
    to access and visualize real-time raw and derived (rule-chain based) data. The
    web user interface has been designed with the aim of providing the farmer with
    a comprehensive and immediate view of the weather, soil and water parameters,
    in order to reduce water consumption, increase crop productivity, and allow real-time
    verification and understanding of soil moisture dynamics in response to irrigation
    events and weather conditions. For the irrigation management service, the user
    interface consists of three views: an interactive map, a real time dashboard and
    a historical dashboard. The interactive map (based on the open source map service
    OpenStreetMap [33]) shows the geographical distribution of the irrigated fields
    through the use of markers; the user can select one field to view its status in
    detail (i.e. changing the dashboard state to the real-time section). In the real-time
    dashboard (see Fig. 6), the farmer can visualize and monitor raw and derived data
    (i.e. computed by the rule chains) related to weather, soil moisture and applied
    water for irrigation. In the left section of the dashboard, the following information
    is reported in real-time: the total applied water from the beginning of the irrigation
    season; suggested water volumes for irrigation; hourly cumulative applied water
    in the last week; surface and deep soil water potential values in the last week.
    The right side of the view shows the current status of raw and derived meteorological
    variables, i.e. air temperature and humidity, wind intensity and direction, solar
    radiation, pressure and the reference evapotranspiration (ET0). The chart at the
    bottom correlates, in the last week, the hourly amount of precipitation with the
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc) to give an insight to the farmers how these two
    physical phenomena concur to change the amount of water in the soil. Finally,
    the third view (the historical dashboard) shows the trend over time, average or
    cumulative, according to the type of variable, of all weather, soil and applied
    water metrics. The dashboard has also been configured to fit the mobile viewing
    of the visualization widgets, allowing farmers to have easy access to the irrigation
    management information via iPad/tablets and/or smartphones. SECTION III. A Pilot
    Application: Citrus Farming In Sicily The prototype service described in the previous
    section, has been deployed in the plain around Catania (Sicily, Italy), that is
    famous for its citrus production, in particular orange. Ten farms have been selected
    based on multiple criteria, such as irrigation systems, orange varieties, root
    stocks, plant spacing, water management practices used. A total of eleven end-nodes
    have been deployed in the Catania plain, consisting of ten field stations and
    one weather station, alongside with two gateways covering all the end-nodes (within
    10km max range). The lorawan-server and the application backend system have been
    deployed on Scaleway [34] public cloud, and the irrigation management service
    can be accessed by the farmers connecting to the web application https://citrus.cmccos.it.
    The service will be tested in the next three years starting from April 2019 (beginning
    of the irrigation season). During this time frame, the service will be monitored
    to assess the performance and to improve the accuracy of real-time information
    provided, based on the farmers’ feedback in using the system. SECTION IV. Conclusions
    and Future Works The paper has discussed the design and implementation of an IoT-based
    service for irrigation management by integrating low-cost, open source hardware/software
    and open standard. A complete end-to-end solution for citrus farming has been
    developed considering low-cost weather and field stations, the deployment of a
    private LoRaWAN network and an application backend, based on ThingsBoard platform,
    for the visualization and analysis of real-time information. Future works will
    focus on the improvement of irrigation management along two main directions: i)
    integration of open source solutions for big data analytics and AI/machine learning
    (such as Spark [35], Tensorflow [36]), providing even more accurate farm specific
    management rules by merging weather and soil moisture real-time information as
    well as remote sensing of plant water status; ii) integration of weather and climate
    seasonal forecast (i.e. Copernicus Climate Change Service [37]), to plan water
    applications accounting for future climate events and to identify in advance agronomic
    practices that can cope with droughts. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank all
    the farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs for their kind hospitality and collaboration

  description: 'Precision agriculture offers the technologies to manage for infield
    variability and incorporate variability into irrigation management decisions.
    The major limitation of this technology often lies in the reconciliation of disparate

    18 April 2023 Introduction Water scarcity is predicted to be the major limitation
    to increasing agronomic outputs to meet future food and fiber demands (UNDP 2007).
    With the agricultural sector accounting for 80–90% of all consumptive water use
    and an average water use efficiency of less than 45% (Hezarjaribi and Sourell
    2007; Molden 2007), major advances must be made in irrigation water management.
    Currently, irrigation is a key component of global food security, accounting for ~ 40%
    of global food production and ~ 20% of all arable land (Molden 2007; Schultz et
    al. 2005). Precision agriculture offers the technologies to address and manage
    for infield variability and incorporate that variability into management decisions
    (Howell et al. 2012). According to a 2012 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    Census of Agriculture report, Nebraska ranks first nationally in irrigated area
    approximately 3.4 million irrigated hectares, and about 70% of that area has center
    pivot irrigation (USDA 2012). Conventional center pivot systems manage a field
    as a uniform unit, thus ignoring the heterogeneity across the field, and often
    management decisions are based on average field conditions (i.e. average soil
    hydraulic properties, average soil water content (SWC); McCarthy et al. 2014).
    Consequently, expected crop yield may differ in sub-regions of a field due to
    variations in SWC and physical properties. Variable-rate irrigation (VRI) and
    variable-speed irrigation (VSI) systems can vary application depth in relation
    to the spatial variability of soil properties (Hezarjaribi and Sourell 2007).
    VSI varies the speed of the pivot to adjust application depth in sectors and VRI
    uses nozzle control to vary application depth in irregularly shaped management
    zones. Additionally, fertigation inputs can be managed for site-specific field
    conditions and soil properties to ensure minimal chemical loss in the runoff (Hedley
    2015). Due to the high temporal variability in SWC, the incorporation of VRI has
    the potential to increase crop water use efficiency and yield (Haghverdi et al.
    2015b). The major limitation to implementing this technology often lies in the
    management of spatial datasets and the writing of irrigation prescription maps
    that address variables impacting yield and SWC (Evans et al. 1996; Howell et al.
    2012). This requires efficient and accurate methods for measuring the subfield
    scale spatial variability of soil properties including porosity, saturated hydraulic
    conductivity, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, available water, texture and
    depth (Hezarjaribi and Sourell 2007; Pan et al. 2013; Ranney et al. 2015). Managing
    irrigation rates and times based on hydraulic properties allows for irrigators
    to prescribe application depths based on the SWC below field capacity and above
    maximum allowable depletion. Land managers use several methods to address and
    manage for in-field variability and to delineate irrigation management zones (IMZs)
    including available soil spatial datasets, yield maps, electrical resistivity/conductivity
    (EC) surveys, and commercially available instruments. Unfortunately, soil spatial
    datasets are often not at resolutions appropriate for field-scale management (Bobryk
    et al. 2016). One strategy land managers use is the delineation of IMZs within
    a field based on EC surveys. High resolution spatiotemporal modeling using EC
    surveys has been used to characterize dynamic SWC patterns in relation to crop
    needs (Hedley et al. 2013). Unfortunately, EC is sensitive to temperature, SWC,
    texture, clay content and salinity (Haghverdi et al. 2015a; Rodriguez-Perez et
    al. 2011), thus making exact boundary determination challenging. Most EC systems
    are used to delineate management zones only after harvest and before planting
    in nonfrozen soils, thus limiting mapping opportunities in cold climates. While
    changes in SWC do account for over 50% of variability in soil EC readings (Brevik
    et al. 2006), the dynamic nature of SWC causes EC and clay measurements to vary
    temporally (McCutcheon et al. 2006) making the use of a single EC survey problematic.
    Martini et al. (2016) investigated this temporal variability and emphasized the
    importance of multiple surveys to capture the dynamic SWC patterns represented
    by EC surveys. Other impacting factors, beyond SWC, include groundwater levels
    and the concentration of the pore water solution, which influence the electrical
    conductance pathway (Martini et al. 2016). Additional commercially available methodologies
    are available for measuring soil physical variability, however they were not explored
    in this study [e.g. Trimble Soil Information System (SIS) (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale,
    CA)]. Beyond EC surveys, other hydrogeophysical instruments (see e.g. Binley et
    al. 2015; Coopersmith et al. 2014; Franz et al. 2016; Villarreyes et al. 2011)
    offer promising opportunities in precision agriculture. One such instrument to
    be explored in this work is the cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP), which has been
    used within agricultural systems to approximate SWC at the field- to small-watershed-scale
    (Franz et al. 2015). The CRNP detects epithermal neutron energies reflected from
    the soil, which are inversely related to SWC (Zreda et al. 2012). For this study,
    the CRNP was used to measure SWC at high spatial and temporal resolutions to characterize
    its dynamic nature over the growing season. One key advantage to using the passive,
    non-invasive, and soil-temperature-invariant CRNP method is that SWC data can
    be collected using a wide variety of commercially available vehicles from harvest
    until the following season when the crop is too tall for the vehicle (~ 0.20 m
    for this work). While not performed here, CRNP surveys, mobile CRNP measurements,
    with taller crop heights can easily be collected from taller-bodied farm equipment
    (e.g. tractor, sprayer, etc.). For this work, a standard multivariate analysis,
    Empirical Orthogonal Functions [EOF, (Perry and Niemann 2006)], was used to characterize
    the spatial variability of SWC across the study site using CRNP surveys collected
    between 2015 and 2016. EOF analyses have been proven to be an accurate method
    for large sample sizes or more than 5 days of SWC monitoring (Werbylo and Niemann
    2014). Within intensely monitored agricultural systems, EOF analysis has also
    been used to identify dominant parameters controlling spatial and temporal patterns
    of surface SWC without being affected by a single random process (Korres et al.
    2010). Furthermore, EOF analysis provides a framework to estimate underlying SWC
    variations constructed using historical SWC observations to forecast SWC patterns
    for unobserved times. The objectives of this study were to: (1) improve the delineation
    of management zones within a field and (2) estimate the relevant spatially-distributed
    soil hydraulic properties (i.e. field capacity and wilting point) to inform irrigation
    prescriptions. Laboratory measured hydraulic parameters were compared to values
    from the USDA soil survey dataset, then correlated with an EC map, and then to
    the CRNP-derived EOF surface. Lastly, a cross validation bootstrapping analysis
    was performed to compare and contrast the various candidate environmental covariates.
    The CRNP surveys, when combined with the EOF analysis, were hypothesized to be
    the best predictor of soil hydraulic property spatial variability compared to
    traditional and widely-used methods. It was also hypothesized that the EOF surface
    would be a good candidate for more accurately delineating IMZs. To illustrate
    the potential increase in water use efficiency versus effort (i.e. time, energy,
    and cost) of the various strategies discussed, Fig. 1 presents a conceptual diagram
    with a set of existing technologies/methodologies. The figure serves as a guide
    to the reader and will be further discussed later in this paper with respect to
    the specific findings from this field site. Fig. 1 Conceptual diagram of potential
    increase in water use efficiency versus effort for various soil hydraulic datasets/techniques

    53-ha field (circle with ~ 400 m radius) irrigated with a variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) pivot near Sutherland, NE (41.065393°, − 101.102663°) (Fig. 2). The field
    contains significant topo-edaphic gradients, i.e. soil and topographic properties,
    making it an ideal candidate for VRI. Figure 2 illustrates the elevation (provided
    by a local crop consultant using a Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning
    System (GPS)) and topographic wetness index (TWI) of the study site. The TWI calculates
    SWC spatial patterns based on the up-slope contribution area and slope (Sorensen
    et al. 2006). The field was planted with soybean (Glycine max L.) in 2014 and
    popcorn maize (Zea Mays var. everta) from 2015 to 2016. The soybean yield averaged ~ 3.8
    Mg/ha and the popcorn yields averaged ~ 5.3 Mg/ha. Using data from an Automated
    Weather Data Network (AWDN) site located near North Platte, NE (~ 40 km from study
    site), the authors estimated annual temperature highs to be around 18 °C and lows
    to be about 2 °C (http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/awdn.php, Accessed 25 January 2017).
    The authors used the AWDN dataset to estimate decadal annual average precipitation
    at 445 mm year−1 with 325 mm falling between May and September. Additionally,
    the authors estimated potential annual evapotranspiration to be at 1475 mm year−1
    with 925 mm occurring between May and September. According to the local producer,
    applied irrigation varies between 150 and 300 mm year−1 depending on the year.
    Soil classifications from the available USDA SSURGO (Soil Survey Staff 2016) spatial
    and tabular dataset were used to estimate texture and soil hydraulic properties
    at the study site. SWC at field capacity (cm3 cm−3), correlating to a soil water
    pressure of − 33 kPa, and wilting point (cm3 cm−3), correlating to a soil water
    pressure of − 1500 kPa, were averaged for each of the map units from 0 to 0.3
    m (Fig. 3). The USDA SSURGO database delineated contiguous areas with similar
    soils as a single map unit. In general, the eastern region of the field has sandier
    soils and the western region is a mixture of sandy and silt loams. The field has
    a wide gradient in field capacity (0.090–0.307 cm3 cm−3) and wilting point (0.027–0.164
    cm3 cm−3) values depending on soil classification. The TWI product (Fig. 2) correlates
    well with the classifications from the SSURGO dataset with wetter regions of the
    field relating to finer soil textures. Fig. 2 Field site located near Sutherland,

    electrical conductivity (EC) survey measuring bulk apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa, mS m−1) was collected on 24 February 2016 using a DUALEM-21S sensor (DUALEM,
    Milton, Canada). The DUALEM sensor has dual-geometry receivers at separations
    of 1 and 2.1 m from the transmitter, which provided four simultaneous depth estimates
    of ECa every second (Dualem Inc. 2013). The ~ 2.1 m horizontal co-planar sensor
    estimated ECa values for this study (see DUALEM manual for approximate depth of
    exploration curves for each sensor configuration). The DUALEM was towed behind
    an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) on a plastic sled at speeds of 8–15 km h−1 with ~ 7–9
    m spacing, taking about 75 min to complete the survey. A Hemisphere GPS XF101
    DGPS (Juniper Systems, Inc., Logan, UT) unit recorded the location of each measurement.
    Following basic quality assurance and quality control of the raw ECa data (Franz
    et al. 2011), a spatial map with 5 by 5 m resolution was created using an inverse-distance
    weighting procedure. Ten mobile cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) surveys to estimate
    soil water content (SWC) were completed at the site from March 2015–June 2016
    using an ATV driven in a similar pattern and rate as the previously described
    EC survey. The mobile CRNP records epithermal neutron intensity integrated over
    one-minute counting intervals. The change in epithermal neutron intensity is inversely
    correlated to the mass of hydrogen in the measurement volume (Zreda et al. 2012).
    A main advantage of the CRNP survey, when compared to the EC survey, is the temperature-invariance.
    The CRNP method has no interaction with the electromagnetic atom shells and the
    neutrons interact with the atomic nuclei instead. The soil’s atomic energy variation
    due to ambient temperature changes is negligible compared to the epithermal neutron
    intensities (see Glasstone and Edlund 1952 for a description of neutron scattering
    cross section temperature dependence and Campbell et al. 1948 for a description
    of electrical conductivity temperature dependence). Depending on local conditions
    (i.e. elevation, water vapor, AWC, etc.), the CRNP measurement volume is roughly
    a disk, with a 130–250 m radius circle and penetration depth of 0.15–0.40 m (Köhli
    et al. 2015). For simplicity, a constant penetration depth of 0.3 m was assumed
    for all surveys. Atmospheric hydrogen pools within the CRNP footprint were accounted
    for by a relative humidity and temperature sensor mounted on the ATV. Lattice
    water, soil organic carbon equivalent and bulk density were measured at 0.015,
    0.0083, and 1.62 g cm−3, respectively. Interference of the biomass in the total
    CRNP measurement volume was considered negligible because the surveys were collected
    over bare soil or when the crop height was less than 0.20 m. The authors note
    that SWC changes are by far the largest change in hydrogen mass within the measurement
    footprint (McJannet et al. 2014). Numerous validation studies across the globe
    (see e.g. Bogena et al. 2013; Hawdon et al. 2014; Franz et al. 2015, 2016; Iwema
    et al. 2017, among others) have shown the CRNP to have area-average measurement
    accuracies of less than 0.03 cm3 cm−3 against a variety of industry standard SWC
    point scale probes. The calculated SWC within the measurement volume in a non-linearly
    weighed average with increased sensitivity near the CRNP (Schrön et al. 2017).
    In order to provide a SWC map, first a spatial map of neutron intensity was estimated,
    then a calibration function was applied following details in Franz et al. (2015)
    for agricultural fields. The neutron intensity map is created in two steps. First,
    a drop-in-the-bucket preprocessing step is applied, where a dense grid is generated
    (here 20 by 20 m) and all raw data points are found within a certain radius (here
    50 m). The size of the processing grid and average radius where varied in order
    to minimize any spatial interpolation artifacts (i.e. bulls eyes around observations
    points). Note, that future work should investigate how the size of the CRNP measurement
    disk, non-linear weighting of neutron intensity, and underlying length scale of
    soil heterogeneity affect the spatial interpolation algorithm. However, this was
    beyond the scope of the current study. Following the selection of grid size and
    search radius, the average of all raw data found within the search radius is assigned
    to the grid center. This oversampling approach is necessary for sharpening the
    image quality and is a common strategy used in remote sensing analyses (see Chan
    and Njoku 2014) when overlapping area average observations are collected, like
    the CRNP in this study. Next, an inverse-distance-weighted approach is used on
    the resampled 20 m grid to provide the 5-m neutron intensity estimate. Finally,
    the neutron intensity gridded estimate is converted to SWC following Franz et
    al. (2015). The authors refer the reader to the rapidly growing CRNP literature
    (see Zreda et al. 2012) instead of providing full details of the methodology here.
    Soil sampling and laboratory analysis Thirty-one sample locations (Fig. 2) were
    chosen based on the SSURGO database soil classifications, EC map and EOF analysis
    in a stratified random sampling scheme. Undisturbed soil cores (250 cm3) were
    collected inside stainless steel cylinders at ~ 0.2 m depth at each sample location.
    The soil cores were placed in a cooler and transported back to the laboratory
    where they were stored in a 4 °C refrigerator for later analysis. Soil water retention
    curves were estimated for each of the soil cores using a Decagon HYPROP (Decagon
    Devices, Pullman, WA, USA). Saturated soil samples were exposed to evaporation
    in the laboratory and weighed throughout the experiment. Evaporation methods are
    proven to be a fast and reliable method for determining soil hydraulic properties
    within the saturated to moderate SWC range (Peters and Durner 2008; Schindler
    et al. 2010). The matric potential was continuously monitored by two tensiometers
    inserted at the base of the soil cores at two different lengths within the core.
    The tensiometers and instrument bases were degassed using a vacuum pump. The HYPROP
    software (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) calculated data points along the
    retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve. An average measured
    bulk density of 1.62 g cm−3 and porosity of 38.9% were assigned for each of the
    undisturbed samples to generate soil water retention curves. Following the HYPROP
    analysis, a WP4C Dewpoint PotentiaMeter (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) was
    used to approximate tension for the moderate to dry SWC ranges. The soil cores
    were dried at 105 °C for 24 h before collecting 1–9 sub-samples per sample. Varying
    volumes of water were added to the sub-samples to obtain SWC near wilting point
    and to further characterize the soil water retention curves. The sub-samples were
    sealed for 24 h after water was added to allow for the water to disperse evenly
    throughout the sub-sample. Inside the measurement chamber of the WP4C, the dew
    point temperature of the moist air was measured by a chilled mirror and the sample
    temperature was measured by an infrared thermometer. Those two values were then
    used to calculate relative humidity and thus, potential of the soil water. The
    WP4C has an accuracy of ± 0.05 MPa from 0 to − 5 MPa and 1% from − 5 to − 300
    MPa (Decagon Devices, Inc. 2015). Statistical analysis In order to illuminate
    the underlying spatial variability of the SWC maps, an empirical orthogonal function
    (EOF) analysis was used on the ten CRNP SWC maps. Full details on the multivariate
    statistical EOF analysis are provided elsewhere (Korres et al. 2010; Perry and
    Niemann 2006) and only a brief summary is provided here. The EOF analysis decomposes
    the observed SWC variability measured by the CRNP surveys into a set of orthogonal
    spatial patterns (EOFs), which are invariant in time, and a set of time series
    called expansion coefficients, which are invariant in space (Perry and Niemann
    2006). Multiplication of the EOFs and expansion coefficients will exactly reconstruct
    the original pattern. Often the number of needed coefficients (i.e. eigenvectors)
    to reconstruct most of the data is less than the original dataset (i.e. determined
    by the ranked eigenvalues), thus the procedure can be used as a way to reduce
    the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the key information. The authors
    note that EOF is nearly identical to Principal Component Analysis save the splitting
    of axis of variation into spatial and temporal coefficients instead of arbitrary
    linear combinations. A bootstrap validation analysis was used to: (1) determine
    the accuracy of the regressed hydraulic parameter to the measured hydraulic parameter
    and (2) determine how many soil samples and their corresponding hydraulic parameters
    were required for the root mean square error (RMSE) to converge. The hydrogeophysical
    datasets explored for this analysis were the CRNP EOF surface derived from the
    SWC surveys, the CRNP EOF surface derived from the corrected neutron counts (i.e.
    pressure, intensity, and water vapor corrections), ECa survey and elevation. Each
    hydrogeophysical dataset was randomly divided into a training set, ranging in
    size from 3 to 30, and a testing set for 1000 random iterations. The training
    sets and their corresponding laboratory measured soil hydraulic properties (i.e.
    field capacity, wilting point, available water content (AWC)) were used to build
    a simple linear model to predict the remaining laboratory measured soil hydraulic
    property values. The mean RMSE and standard deviation of the RMSE for the 1000
    simulations were calculated for the predicted hydraulic property values and the
    laboratory measured soil hydraulic property values. This analysis followed similar
    methods from Gibson and Franz (2018). Results and discussion Hydrogeophysical
    mapping and EOF analysis The apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) map for the
    field is illustrated in Fig. 4 and provides additional spatial information on
    soil texture variability as compared to the USDA SSURGO map (Fig. 3). This type
    of information has been used for the delineation of irrigation management zones
    (IMZs; Pan et al. 2013). As noted previously, the ECa map is subject to field
    conditions at the time of the sampling (Martini et al. 2016). Therefore, areas
    of high EC measurements in the southwest quadrant of the field may be due to increased
    soil cations, soil water content (SWC), and/or temperature anomalies at the time
    of sampling. At a first glance, the delineated soil boundary by the USDA SSURGO
    database displays some spatial correlation to the ECa map. However, there is high
    variability of ECa values within each USDA SSURGO soil classification, which has
    been observed in other research (Brevik et al. 2006). Thus, the soil classification
    from the SSURGO dataset may or may not be the appropriate boundaries for irrigation
    management zones (IMZs) within the field. This uncertainty of exact IMZ boundaries
    and questionable repeatability of ECa makes this method problematic, particularly
    given the high initial capital for precision agricultural equipment. The result
    here suggests the use of soil survey datasets and ECa be used in tandem to delineate
    IMZs for precision agriculture, which is supported by the results of Brevik et
    al. (2006). Fig. 4 Apparent bulk electrical conductivity map (ECa) collected on
    24 February 2016 using a Dualem-21S sensor Full size image Figure 5 illustrates
    the large spatiotemporal variation in SWC over the ten dates observed using the
    CRNP rover. Despite regions of the field with finer soil textures and higher ECa
    generally having a higher SWC in each of the soil moisture maps, there is inconsistency
    in the spatial distribution of the SWC. For example, compare the SWC spatial distribution
    for the survey dates of June 10, 2015 and May 11, 2016. Table 1 summarizes the
    SWC minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation for each CRNP survey date in
    Fig. 5. The ten CRNP rover surveys were used to perform Empirical Orthogonal Function
    (EOF) analysis. Figure 6 illustrates the first and second EOF coefficients at
    the study site. The EOF analysis contextualizes the behavior of the SWC (and thus
    underlying soil hydraulic properties) at any given point in the field relative
    to the mean SWC as a whole. Therefore, points in the field that are relatively
    wet persistently will have positive coefficients and points in the field that
    are relatively dry will have negative coefficients. Here the first EOF coefficients
    explained 79.6% of the spatial SWC variability followed by 5.6% explained by the
    second EOF. Therefore, only the first EOF was considered in the subsequent analyses.
    Statistical bootstrapping of the SWC indicated that five CRNP surveys at different
    SWC conditions were sufficient to estimate the first EOF coefficients to within
    5% of the values using data from all ten surveys. This reduction in required number
    of CRNP surveys is critical for economic considerations beyond a research study
    (see “Recommendations for future soil hydraulic property sampling”). The first
    EOF map provides detailed information for the delineation of IMZs. Given the removal
    of the time-varying component of the signal the authors argue that the map is
    a superior method to delineate IMZs as compared to the USDA SSURGO dataset and
    ECa mapping. The first EOF map is a continuous surface; thus, it can be applied
    at a variety of spatial scales and used within existing agricultural management
    software (such as a shapefile input). The remaining questions are: (1) is the
    EOF map a better predictor of soil hydraulic property spatial variation compared
    to the SSURGO database and ECa maps and (2) is the information provided by an
    EOF map economical for a producer to implement into current agricultural practices?

    Soil hydraulic properties from sampling analysis Using each of the thirty-one
    undisturbed soil cores, soil hydraulic properties were estimated from soil water
    retention curves generated using the Hyprop software. To illustrate the type of
    data generated, three of the soil cores from different soil textures and their
    respective field capacity and wilting point values are shown in Fig. 7. Table
    2 summarizes the SWC at field capacity (− 33 kPa), SWC at wilting point (− 1500
    kPa) and calculated available water content (AWC, cm3 cm−3) for each of the thirty-one
    soil cores. AWC was calculated by subtracting the SWC at − 1500 kPa from the SWC
    at − 33 kPa. In general, areas of the field with lower EOF values also have lower
    SWC at field capacity and wilting point. The EOF values are representative of
    the orthogonality of the SWC spatial patterns, therefore assumptions regarding
    in-field heterogeneity can be based off of the new EOF surfaces. Additionally,
    SWC at field capacity and wilting point is higher for finer soils and lower in
    coarser texture classes. AWC is higher for areas of the field with finer textured
    soils. Fig. 7 Soil water retention functions from three undisturbed soil cores.

    using the Hyprop and WP4C instruments. Table 3 summarizes the linear correlation
    coefficient (r2) and root mean square error (RMSE) for the graphs illustrated
    in Fig. 8. The first EOF coefficients have the largest linear correlation coefficient
    (r2) with calculated AWC, laboratory measured SWC at field capacity and laboratory
    measured SWC at wilting point (Table 3). Compared to ECa, the CRNP and EOF analysis
    increased the linear correlation r2 by 0.218 and reduced the RMSE by 0.012 cm3
    cm−3 for measured SWC at field capacity. Table 3 exemplifies the weak relationship
    between laboratory measured SWC at field capacity and elevation, laboratory measured
    SWC at wilting point and elevation, calculated AWC and elevation, laboratory measured
    SWC at field capacity and TWI, laboratory measured SWC at wilting point and TWI,
    and calculated AWC and TWI. Therefore, the hypothesis that the first EOF provides
    superior spatial information correlating to the accurate prediction of three key
    soil hydraulic parameters (i.e. field capacity, wilting point, available water
    content) is justified for this field. Fig. 8 Laboratory measured SWC at field

    hydraulic property spatial datasets, EOFs can be used to generate new data products
    for use with variable-rate irrigation (VRI), variable-speed irrigation (VSI),
    and other commercial field equipment. As an illustration here, new field capacity,
    wilting point and AWC products were generated for this field using the relationships
    between the first EOF surface, elevation, and the laboratory measured hydraulic
    parameters (Fig. 9, Table 3). The authors note that additional single or multivariate
    linear/nonlinear functions could be explored to better characterize the observed
    trends in the data. Fig. 9 Resulting spatial estimates of a SWC at field capacity

    products are located in Table 3. See Table 4 for bootstrap analysis quantifying
    statistical fit and number of training and validation samples Full size image
    In the interest of exploring the feasibility of implementing CRNP and EOF analysis
    for the delineation of IMZs, a statistical bootstrapping analysis was performed
    (Table 4) to predict the number of soil samples needed to accurately estimate
    field capacity, wilting point and AWC following a similar analysis by Gibson and
    Franz (2018). Each of the hydrogeophyscial datasets (elevation, ECa survey, CRNP
    neutron count EOF, CRNP SWC EOF) was randomly divided into training and testing
    sets, with training set sizes ranging from 3 to 30, for 1000 iterations. The results
    from Table 4 suggest with fewer soil samples the neutron and SWC EOF surfaces
    are a more accurate predictor of soil hydraulic properties. When linearly correlating
    the CRNP SWC EOF to estimates of SWC at field capacity and AWC, RMSE is reduced
    approximately 20–25% compared to evaluations with ECa and elevation datasets.
    Wilting point estimates saw reductions in RMSE of 5–9% when comparing the CRNP
    SWC EOF to ECa and elevation datasets. Here, 6–8 sample locations for laboratory
    analysis were sufficient to describe the spatial distribution of soil hydraulic
    properties for this field. After eight soil samples, relatively small reductions
    in RMSE and standard deviation occurred for this particular field. Similar soil
    sampling sizes and results were found by Gibson and Franz (2018). Table 4 Results
    from the bootstrapping analysis Full size table Recommendations for future soil
    hydraulic property sampling Given the results of this work the authors propose
    a sampling strategy for better quantifying soil hydraulic properties that can
    be implemented in practice. (1) Complete a minimum of five CRNP rover surveys
    for the area of interest, with survey datasets selected to capture a range of
    SWC, to accurately estimate spatial SWC using the first one or two sets of EOF
    coefficients. As previously stated, the presented work used a bootstrapping analysis
    to indicate five CRNP surveys at different SWC conditions were sufficient to estimate
    the first EOF coefficients to within 5% of the values using data from all ten
    surveys. The five CRNP surveys and EOF correlations from this work are further
    supported by Gibson and Franz (2018). EOF coefficients could be calculated based
    on the neutron intensity measurements (Table 4), saving processing time and eliminating
    the need for terrestrial hydrogen pool datasets. However, the authors suggest
    using the CRNP SWC product as it has a greater physical meaning to soil hydraulic
    properties. Based on additional data (Gibson and Franz 2018) from fields across
    the Midwest, the authors found similar relationships and recommendations for the
    required minimal number of CRNP surveys. An example of real-world implementation
    might involve a service provider investing in CRNP technology and cooperating
    with multiple producers to perform the CRNP rover surveys. Additionally, the CRNP
    surveys could be completed simultaneously with other field operations (i.e. ATV,
    tractor, sprayer) and over several growing seasons. (2) Using the EOF coefficients
    from the CRNP SWC maps, 6–8 soil sample locations (Table 4) should be selected
    across a range of EOF values. The collection and analysis of soil cores to determine
    their soil retention curves and hydraulic parameters can be time consuming, laborious
    and expensive. Therefore, using the EOF surface to minimize the number of and
    placement of extracted soil cores is critical. The bootstrap analyses indicated
    a diminishing return of information beyond 6–8 samples for this 53 ha field. Similar
    sample sizes were reported in Gibson and Franz (2018). (3) Next, measure the soil
    hydraulic properties of interest (e.g. field capacity, wilting point, AWC) for
    the collected soil samples. Soil samples can be sent to a soil laboratory or analyzed
    in one’s lab using the Hyprop/WP4C combination for this work. (4) New data products
    can be generated using the relationship between EOF and the observed hydraulic
    parameters from the soil cores. These new data products can be produced at a variety
    of scales and different file types to operate within existing agricultural software
    and machinery. (5) In addition, the EOF surface can be used to delineate management
    zones. Here the authors suggest using a 1st order polynomial relationship describing
    the relationship between the first SWC EOF surface, elevation, and the laboratory
    measured SWC at field capacity (r2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.05 cm3 cm−3) and wilting point
    (r2 = 0.21, RMSE = 0.02 cm3 cm−3) to delineate IMZs (Table 3). This should be
    done in conjunction with the USDA SSURGO data to better refine key boundaries.
    IMZs can be based on the EOF surface, the field capacity surface or the AWC surface.
    This research is of increasing importance for agricultural regions with ever-increasing
    water restrictions where small changes in water allocation rates and times may
    greatly impact crop yields. For example, at the current depletion rate, 35% of
    the Southern High Plains Aquifer is expected to be unable to support irrigation
    in the next 30 years (Scanlon et al. 2012). Consequently, there will be an increased
    effort to accurately map soil hydraulic properties and delineate high spatial
    and temporal irrigation prescription maps. Referring to Fig. 1, the feasibility
    of the CRNP and EOF analyses for management practice may soon be economically
    viable for many regions where maximizing water use for obtaining higher yields
    is paramount. The authors have shown here that the strong correlation with observed
    soil hydraulic parameters to the first EOF surface provides additional spatial
    variability information compared to EC mapping alone. If a land manager only used
    an EC map for estimating soil hydraulic properties, areas of a field may be biased
    depending on conditions at the time of sampling. In order to minimize error and
    improve IMZs, CRNP and EOF analysis should be used to increase the correlation
    between soil hydraulic properties and irrigation application rates (Fig. 8, Table
    3), which will subsequently improve irrigation prescription maps. CRNP and EOF
    analysis also provides irrigators with datasets they can use to generate dynamic
    prescription irrigation maps. Future research could investigate how increases
    in r2 and reductions is RMSE using the CRNP and EOF analysis could translate into
    increased water use efficiency with precision agricultural technologies. Additionally,
    studies could investigate whether high spatial resolution datasets of soil hydraulic
    properties increase water use efficiency while maintaining or increasing crop
    yields. Summary and conclusions Irrigation constitutes the largest component in
    global water use, yet within agricultural systems there is low water use efficiency.
    Therefore, improvements can be made in how irrigation application rates and times
    are managed. Traditional methods include the use of available soil property datasets,
    EC mapping, or commercially available instruments to delineate irrigation and
    land management zones. This research explored the utility of a hydrogeophysical
    sensor, called the CRNP, which measures near-surface soil water content (SWC)
    (top ~ 30 cm). In addition, when combining the CRNP SWC maps with the multivariate
    EOF analysis the authors found a better covariate for laboratory measured soil
    hydraulic properties for a field in west-central Nebraska, USA. The measured soil
    hydraulic properties were also compared to other readily available landscape and
    geophysical datasets including elevation, TWI and ECa maps. Based on this work
    the authors present a future sampling strategy to better understand spatially
    varying hydraulic properties within a field, as well as the delineation of IMZs.
    The new data products could be used within current irrigation management practice
    to improve water use efficiency by providing soil spatial datasets for the management
    of irrigation rates and times in relation to depletion below field capacity and
    above wilting point. Having an accurate quantification of field capacity and wilting
    point is especially important when volumetric SWC sensors are used for irrigation
    management. The authors do note that the strategy presented here constitutes a
    significant increase in effort as compared to more traditional and widely used
    techniques. However, as irrigation allocations become more stringent, there will
    likely be an increased rate of adoption of precision techniques that require more
    accurate mapping of soil hydraulic properties. The technology and framework presented
    here provides one potential strategy to better utilize precision agricultural
    technologies to increase water use efficiency while maintaining crop yields in
    varying topo-edaphic landscapes. Data availability The datasets and data products

  description: 'Over the last few years, multispectral and thermal remote sensing
    imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has found application in agriculture
    and has been regarded as a means of field data collection and crop condition monitoring
    source. The integration of information derived from the analysis of these remotely
    sensed data into agricultural management applications facilitates and aids the
    stakeholder''s decision making. Whereas agricultural decision support systems
    (DSS) have long been utilised in farming applications, there are still critical
    gaps to be addressed; as the current approach often neglects the plant''s level
    information and lacks the robustness to account for the spatial and temporal variability
    of environmental parameters within agricultural systems. In this paper, we demonstrate
    the use of a custom built autonomous UAV platform in providing critical information
    for an agricultural DSS. This hexacopter UAV bears two cameras which can be triggered
    simultaneously and can capture both the visible, near-infrared (VNIR) and the
    thermal infrared (TIR) wavelengths. The platform was employed for the rapid extraction
    of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the crop water stress
    index (CWSI) of three different plantations, namely a kiwi, a pomegranate, and
    a vine field. The simultaneous recording of these two complementary indices and
    the creation of maps was advantageous for the accurate assessment of the plantation''s
    status. Fusion of UAV and soil scanner system products pinpointed the necessity
    for adjustment of the irrigation management applied. It is concluded that timely
    CWSI and NDVI measures retrieved for different crop growing stages can provide
    additional information and can serve as a tool to support the existing irrigation
    DSS that had so far been exclusively based on telemetry data from soil and agrometeorological
    sensors. Additionally, the use of the multi-sensor UAV was found to be beneficial
    in collecting timely, spatio-temporal information for the fusion with ground-based
    proximal sensing data. This research work was designed and deployed in the frame
    of the project "AGRO-LESS: Joint reference strategies for rural activities of
    reduced inputs".'

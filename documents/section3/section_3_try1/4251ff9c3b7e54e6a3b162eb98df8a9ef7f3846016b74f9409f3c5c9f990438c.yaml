    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;
    Positives / (True\\; Positives + False\\; Positives)$$ (15) $$Recall = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    recommendation. Full size image A confusion matrix is an illustrative format that
    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

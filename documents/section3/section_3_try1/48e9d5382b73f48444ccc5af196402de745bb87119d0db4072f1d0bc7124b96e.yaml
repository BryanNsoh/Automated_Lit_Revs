  description: Current agricultural practices fail to feed everyone correctly while
    being harmful to the environment and highly sensitive to climate change. Therefore,
    new and modern agriculture needs to be developed and overcome numerous challenges.
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the tools widely used in this new type
    of Agriculture called Precision Agriculture (PA) or Smart Farming (SF). Thanks
    to the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, AI algorithms are fed with a vast
    amount of data to provide valuable insights for farmers, such as weather prediction,
    pest development detection, irrigation management, etc. AI algorithms are often
    executed in cloud servers, thus requiring IoT devices to offload their data to
    process. This creates privacy, latency, and security issues, but mostly, it requires
    a large quantity of energy for transmission. To overcome those issues, recent
    research brought new tools like Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) to perform AI directly
    on the IoT devices and break free from the cloud. Despite promising results, such
    Smart devices cannot train new models on their constrained hardware and therefore
    need frequent updating to increase the model's accuracy over time, regarding the
    specific environment where the sensor is deployed. In the Agricultural domain,
    sensor devices are numerous and usually spread over vast geographical areas while
    running on battery. For this reason, Farms Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) use mostly
    Low Power Wide Area Network like LoRaWAN to communicate. Therefore Firmware Update
    Over the Air (FUOTA) is required. In this context, this paper proposes a study
    of the FUOTA process for a TinyML model using LoRaWAN in a specific agricultural
    scenario. A TinyML sensor prototype was built to evaluate the feasibility of FUOTA
    for tinyML devices using LoRaWAN. The system's energy consumption and Packet delivery
    ratio are then analyzed in a simulator with different network scenarios.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Wellington, New Zealand SECTION I. Introduction
    The Food and Agricultural Organization estimates that food production must increase
    by 60 % to feed the 9.8 Billion humans on the globe by 2050 [1]. However, agricultural
    land is already covering 38 % of the overall emerged land world-wide, and modern
    agriculture uses harmful environmental methods [2]. For example: the intense usage
    of chemicals resources that are present in low quantity on earth and pollute the
    soil and water stocks while destroying the biodiversity [3]; the usage of oil
    hungry heavy machinery that accelerates soil compaction [4]; the massive needs
    for irrigation water that dry up groundwater supply [5]. To change how humanity
    produces food, researchers have brought numerous new tools using Information and
    Communication Technologies (ICT) to the farm fields, creating a new research domain
    called Smart Farming (SF). SF, also called Precision Agriculture (PA), uses data
    produced by wireless sensor networks (WSN) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to
    understand better the environment and its interaction with crops and livestock
    to make food more efficient with fewer resources [6]. In this domain, Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) powered Computer Vision algorithms are of particular interest
    as they can, for example, identify a plant''s different stages of growth to detect
    specific situations such as disease development, pest attack, or fruit maturity.
    This knowledge is crucial as it allows the farmers to take the necessary actions
    in time (Crop thinning, fertilizer application, call for harvest, etc.) [7]. Unfortunately,
    such algorithms require significant processing power. Thus such programs are usually
    performed in the cloud and not directly on the device taking the picture [8].
    However, sensors in the Agricultural domain mainly use Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) to transmit data to save battery lifetime [9]. Those type of network allows
    transmission over long distances at minimal energy cost but with a reduced data
    throughput, making difficult the communication of heavy files such as images[10].
    To avoid relying on the cloud for image analysis, researchers have looked into
    bringing the computation of AI algorithm directly to the end device with constraint
    hardware. Those techniques are called embedded AI or Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML)
    [11]. Performing the AI computing task on the device allows the vision sensor
    to communicate only the result in small messages through LPWAN, saving battery
    life while increasing privacy and security and reducing the latency [12]. Despite
    promising results, TinyML methods only allow the end device to perform inference
    on its hardware and are not able to learn and evolve after its deployment into
    a specific environment. Therefore Smart Edge Devices need to be updated frequently
    to ensure their accuracy [13]. However, as said previously, WSNs in agriculture
    are deployed over vast geographical areas making it challenging to update devices
    through wired connections requiring remote updating. The Firmware Update Over
    The Air (FUOTA) problem is well known in the IoT field as every device will probably
    need bug fixes and security maintenance while deployed [14]. Multiple researchers
    have also studied its feasibility for LPWAN network [15] as their characteristics
    regarding data throughput and regulations involve extra layers of complexity to
    take into account. In this paper, we propose a study of the FUOTA process for
    LoRaWAN network as it is a widely used network in agriculture applications [16].
    We then analyze its usage in the context of a TinyML firmware update. Afterward,
    we build a prototype of an intelligent sensor using TinyML for fruit presence
    detection communicating its result through a LoRaWAN network for energy saving.
    The sensor feedback will let the farmer know when and where fruits are present
    to take the necessary actions (harvest, fertilizer application, etc.). After deploying
    the first model in a specific environment, we train a new model and perform a
    FUOTA with LoRaWAN to validate the feasibility of the process. Finally, we study
    the energy consumption of our prototype and the packet delivery ratio in different
    network scenarios. SECTION II. State of the Art A. Firmware Update for Internet
    of Things Devices IoT Technologies are being used exponentially in every domain
    of modern life, and as related protocols and applications evolve, the need for
    firmware updates also [17]. An update allows a developer to add functionalities
    to the IoT devices after deployment, fix bugs, and patch security issues. Good
    surveys on fundamental principles and programming techniques of an IoT device
    firmware update process have been made by the authors in [18] and [19]. Key points
    of the IoT Firmware Update process are: Over the Air: Devices are spread over
    various geo-graphical areas and might be difficult to reach. The update process
    must be performed wirelessly. In the agricultural domain, we talk about hundreds
    of devices in vast crops field [6]. Security: Ensuring that an update is performed
    only on the request of the authorized user is critical. Otherwise, hackers could
    take control of the device by remotely updating corrupted firmware. [20]. Energy
    Consumption: IoT devices are mostly battery-powered. When it is the case, it should
    minimize communication as wireless transmission is inherently power-hungry. However,
    a firmware update can be a large file [21]. B. Firmware Update Over the Air for
    LPWAN If the devices communicate through a LPWAN, the FUOTA process will be impacted
    accordingly, as the characteristics of such networks make the transfer of large
    file complex. The authors in [22] and [23] have surveyed existing issues and methods
    for different protocols. In LPWAN, the biggest constraint is energy consumption;
    Various strategies exist to optimize battery life and can be found in [21]. The
    second most significant issue is the data rate which can be low compared to the
    update''s size, as discussed in [24]. C. Firmware Update Over the Air for LoRaWAN
    Network This paper will focus on implementing a FUOTA process in LoRaWAN as it
    is the primary LPWAN protocol used in Agricultural applications [9]. The reason
    for this is its good technical abilities (data rate, distance, energy consumption,
    etc.) and its ability to create an ad-hoc network without relying on already existing
    network provider coverage [25] facilitating LoRaWAN deployment and usage in rural
    and remote areas. The LoRaWAN firmware update technical recommendations are described
    by the LoRa Alliance, the organism in charge of maintaining the LoRa technology,
    and can be found here [26]. The main issue with LoRaWAN FUOTA process is the size
    of the update to perform. LoRaWAN has a low data throughput and duty cycle and
    is subject to interference [29]. Therefore, sharing large data files is complex.
    To do so, three mechanisms must be applied: Multicast update (update all the device
    that needs together), clock synchronization (choose the right moment to perform
    the update), and Fragmentation (divide the update file into smaller ones). A detailed
    description of the methods applied to perform FUOTA is made by the authors in
    [27], and [28]. Regarding practical implementation, there are various attempts
    in the literature to propose a suitable solution for FUOTA in LoRaWAN. The leading
    available solution for programmers is to use The Chirp Stack LoRaWAN open source
    server [30] with the open source Embedded Device OS Mbded OS [31]. The example
    code can be found here [32]. There is also proprietary solution proposed like
    Multi-Connect Conduit [33] and Pycom [34] but only work with their specific hardware.
    On the research side, applications are relatively new and scarce: Authors in [35]
    have tried to implement FUOTA with multiple gateways, while the authors in [36]
    have looked into adaptive data rate techniques to optimize the process. Finally,
    the authors in [37] have developed a small test bench to validate the usage of
    FUOTA for LoRa in the agricultural domain, where the distance and energy factors
    have been studied to validate the practical application of FUOTA in Farms. D.
    Firmware Update for TinyML Model TinyML adaptation capabilities are a well-known
    issue as the inference model must be pre-trained before being embedded in a hardware-constrained
    IoT node [13]. To allow a device to adapt its model over time regarding the specific
    environment where it is deployed, researchers have proposed methods to allow on-device
    learning, like the author in [38] and [39]. However, we assert that TinyML model
    could still be pre-train on dedicated servers and then remotely updated on the
    device. Literature on this topic is scarce, and we found only one approach proposed
    by the author in [40] to update the model remotely through WiFi. They use a web
    platform to allow the end device to fetch the model it needs for different applications
    allowing the end device to full fill various objectives. Therefore, our approach
    to updating a TinyML model through LPWAN is novel. SECTION III. Architecture Proposal
    A. Scenario Fig. 1. Use case scenario Show All An intelligent camera sensor is
    deployed in a field to detect the number of fruits thanks to a TinyML algorithm.
    It then communicates the number of fruit detected to a cloud decision platform
    through a LoRaWAN network. A decision is then taken regarding the action to perform,
    for example, fertilizer application, irrigation, or harvest. This decision is
    then communicated to the performer, for example, the farmer. This use case scenario
    is depicted in Figure 1. When the accuracy of the inferences drops below a certain
    point, the sensor device requires an update from the server with a specific message
    sent through the LoRaWAN network. The application server must then acquire new
    picture data to retrain the TinyML Model of the device. Once done, the update
    is transmitted from the application server to the LoRaWAN server, which will deploy
    the update to the defined devices with a FUOTA process. This process is describe
    in Figure 2. Fig. 2. FUOTA with LoRaWAN network: Overall process Show All Our
    architecture is therefore made of four main components: 1) Smart Sensor It uses
    TinyML to infer the number of fruit in its sight of view. If the accuracy of its
    inferences is too low, it requests a firmware update over the air. 2) Gateway
    In charge of the communication between the LoRa device and the LoRaWAN server
    on the internet. 3) LoRaWAN Server In charge of receiving and dispatching the
    message from the device and the Application Server. Also in charge of the FUOTA
    process in LoRa. 4) Application Server In charge of the model retraining when
    enough new data are acquired. B. Environment Development The prototype is built
    with the following hardware and software parts: For the microcontroller with the
    camera sensor, performing the TinyML algorithm, and getting remotely updated,
    we use an Arduino Portenta H7 microcontroller with a Lora Vision shield. It is
    a 32-bit Microcontroller with a suitable specification to perform TinyML. We already
    proposed a prior TinyML application with this sensor [12]. The Arduino Portenta
    is running ARM Mbded Operating System [31] to perform the update when new firmware
    is received. Using the Arduino Ecosystem should help replicate our experiment
    for other researchers. To create and update the TinyML algorithm, we used Edge
    Impulse, the development platform based on tensor flow lite proposed by Google
    [41]. Finally, to communicate with LoRa, we use a Laird RG1868 gateway with the
    ChirpStack open source LoRaWAN Server that has already included tools for FUOTA
    [30]. Fig. 3. Laird RG1 running ChirpStack (left) and arduino portenta running
    MBEDOS (right) Show All C. Phases In this section, we describe the end-to-end
    phases implemented in our prototype. 1) Phase 1 - Firmware Update Request After
    the sensor deployment, the farm ecosystem around the sensor might change, making
    the accuracy of its inferences drop beyond an acceptable point (value to define
    regarding the application criticality). When the sensor notices that it has reached
    this point, it sends a special message to the server to inform of its situation
    and request a new model update. 2) Phase 2 - New Data Acquisition Once the server
    is noticed that an update is required, it should gather new data. In our scenario,
    farmers could take new pictures in the field. However, it could be interesting
    in future work to ask sensors to offload punctual pictures to increase the variety
    and quantity of data allowing the model to evolve. 3) Phase 3 - Model Re-Training
    We use Edge Impulse FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) algorithm to make our
    fruit detection [41]. With it, the device can count objects, find the location
    of objects in an image, and track multiple objects in real-time using up to 30x
    less processing power and memory than other similar dedicated algorithms such
    as MobileNet SSD or YOLOv5 [42]. 4) Phase 4 - FUOTA The FUOTA procedure is described
    precisely in [26]–[28]. Its architecture is shown in Figure 4. Fig. 4. LoRaWAN
    FUOTA specifications architecture Show All It is made of three components: The
    Network Server (NS) is at the core of the FUOTA process. It handles the communication
    of the unusually large update file by choosing the gateways used to broadcast
    the messages in compliance with the local regulations and limiting-self interference.
    The End Devices (ED) must implement the file distribution client (FDC) on top
    of the LoRaWAN link layer protocol stack. The FDC comprises three different protocols:
    Clock synchronization, multicast, and fragmentation. The Application Server (AS)
    handles the application encryption and decryption of the messages while also processing
    the application data mechanics. The interactions between AS and NS are specific
    to the application. The AS communicates with the NS to gather multicast settings
    to prepare the update when needed. The overall process of FUOTA is not standardized
    by the LoRa Alliance, which only provides recommendations. Here we will describe
    the process applied in the MBOS/ Chirp Stack project [32] that we implemented
    later with a TinyML update. This process can be seen in Figure 5. LoRaWAN devices
    can be of three classes: A, B, or C. A and B are the most frequent as they are
    less energy-consuming than C, but class C allows better transmission reliability.
    For more information, please refer to [43]. We take the case of a FUOTA for a
    device in Class A, meaning the device is always asleep unless it sends an uplink
    message or during a short receiving window after the uplink is sent. The FUOTA
    starts when the Application Server request the Network Server to update multiple
    devices in class A. The NS first needs to prepare every device for the multicast
    session. For that, every time one device sends an uplink, the Network server sends
    an acknowledgment and a multicast address. The same mechanism is employed to set
    up the fragmentation. Afterward, the device will send a synchronization request.
    When satisfied, the NS will request the device to go in C class at a precise hour,
    so every device to be updated goes in C class simultaneously; C class means the
    device is never asleep and constantly listening for messages. All the devices
    go in C class at the defined time and listen for the multicast transmission. The
    End device reconstructs the fragmented firmware update file thanks to various
    error correction mechanisms. Then it restarts itself, and the bootloader will
    load the new firmware image if it is correct, discarding the previous one. Finally,
    an acknowledgment of success is sent to the NS. If anything goes wrong during
    the process, the devices that are not correctly updated will be flagged for a
    new cycle of FUOTA. Fig. 5. LoRaWAN FUOTA session Show All SECTION IV. Experimentation
    A. Firmware Update Over the Air Performance Evaluation To test our prototype,
    we train a first model with a dataset of 100 pictures containing between 1 and
    5 strawberries. The accuracy of the FOMO algorithm reaches 90.2%, the RAM usage
    is 243.9 kb, and the size of the firmware is 77.5 kb, respectively 24.39% and
    3.88% of the Arduino''s hardware capabilities, leaving room for improvement. Afterward,
    we train another model with 100 different pictures for the same application. This
    time the accuracy is 89.2%, the RAM usage is 252.2 kb, and the firmware size is
    83.6 kb. Both models seem equivalent in performance when tested in real life directly
    on the microcontroller. We then implement Mbed OS 5.11.1 and flash the first TinyML
    model. Finally, we perform a FUOTA session to update the device with the other
    firmware containing the new model, as described previously and in [32]. All FUOTA
    tests have been made with only one device. The system behaves as expected and
    implements the new firmware after reboot meaning there is no particular issue
    for an update due to the nature of the TinyML compared to a classic firmware update.
    However, the duration of the update is more important with the TinyML firmware
    update (2m23s average of 10 tests) compared to the example update (32.3s average
    of 10 tests) provided in the OS. This is explained by the update size (83.6 kb
    for the tinyML firmware vs. 5.2 kb for the example update). You can find all the
    sources of our prototype with the adapted Mbed OS and further explanation on our
    GitHub [44]. B. Energy Consumption Evaluation Modeling energy consumption is a
    complex process in the IoT domain as it is highly dependent on the hardware specificities
    and various other parameters, as discussed in [21]. For our experiment, we used
    the simple energy evaluation model from the INET framework of the Omnetpp simulator
    [45] on a PC running Ubuntu 20.04 with 16GB RAM and an Intel I7 8565U. The hardware
    power consumption values for different running modes are gathered from the datasheet
    of the Arduino Portenta and are presented in table I. Table I Power consumption
    of the system To show energy consumption, we considered two scenarios. In each
    scenario, the device is in standby mode the majority of the time and only wakes
    up once a day to perform one TinyML inference and transmits a small telemetry
    message to the server. Moreover, the device wakes up once a week to be updated
    with a new firmware of 100kb size. In the first scenario, all communication are
    performed with LoRa, and in scenario 2 we use WiFi as a point of comparison. The
    simulator then evaluates the lifetime expectancy of the battery and run until
    both scenarios are out of power for a 2000 mA battery. Results are presented in
    Figure 6 and 7. It appears that using LoRa in such application could represent
    a significant energy saving compared to WiFi usage. However, improved optimization
    should be proposed in future work. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation of the
    battery lifetime for various sizes of firmware updates. Results are presented
    in Figure 8 and 9. As expected, the update''s size negatively impacts energy consumption,
    and the system runs out of battery quicker with large update files. However, the
    energy consumption is not proportional to the firmware size. Fig. 6. Evolution
    of battery level over time Show All Fig. 7. Battery lifetime of the system in
    days Show All Fig. 8. Evolution of battery level over time for various size of
    firmware Show All Fig. 9. Battery lifetime of the system in days for various size
    of firmware Show All C. Packet Delivery Ratio We use the Flora framework from
    Omnetpp [46] on the same previous hardware to characterize the packet loss ratio
    of the network regarding the number of devices being updated at the same time
    and the size of the firmware. The results are presented in Figure 10. We notice
    that the packet delivery ratio of the network decrease as the number of device
    on the network increase. This is a result of higher interference. We also emphasize
    the effect of the firmware size on the network. As it increases, the packet delivery
    ratio drops down faster as the number of nodes increases. Fig. 10. Packet delivery
    ratio per node number Show All SECTION V. Conclusion We propose in this paper
    an analysis of the FUOTA process for LoRaWAN with a specific application for TinyML
    model in an Agricultural Scenario. We then perform real-life experimentation of
    a FUOTA process to prove the feasibility of the solution while determining its
    energy efficiency through different scenarios. Despite promising results, it seems
    that remotely updating large-size firmware with LoRaWAN is costly in terms of
    energy consumption, especially if multiple devices are to be updated simultaneously,
    creating interference. However, It is our assumption that such methods could,
    if better optimized, be used to deploy Smart devices performing AI in farms. Future
    work should be oriented toward optimizing the FUOTA process for the TinyML model
    in LoRaWAN. It should also be essential to study the offload of images through
    the LoRaWAN network to collect data to facilitate the model re-training after
    its deployment in a new environment. Finally An interesting approach could be
    to use different Radio Access Technologies on the same device, such as LoRaWAN
    for standard data transmission and LTE for Firmware Update and Data offload. Authors

  description: Integrated precise irrigation management is one of the efficient methods
    to improve the crop productivity and also helps in water conservation where soil
    moisture sensors are widely used. Out of available soil-moisture sensors, the
    dual-probe heat-pulse (DFHP) sensor is the potential candidate due to its optimum
    price and better accuracy. A DPHP sensor has the heater probe kept at a distance
    from the temperature sensor probe. Heater probe consist of nichrome wire as the
    heating element, which is embedded in the stainless-steel tube. In this paper,
    we examine the acceptable tolerance in the heater resistance across 25 DPHP sensors,
    for the accurate soil moisture measurement. For this purpose, we used in-house
    developed 25 DPHP sensors where heater resistance is about 56 Ω with ± 5% tolerance.
    Under laboratory condition, we observed that difference in the measured volumetric
    water content (VWC) is within ± 3 % (VWC) when compared with standard gravimetric
    method. For the field measurements, we developed the automated-self sustained
    system and deployed 3 systems on the rooftop of the building. Under field conditions,
    we observed that difference in the measured VWC from the 3 systems is within ±
    3 % (VWC) when benchmarkeil with standard gravimetric method.

    Integrated precise irrigation management is one of the efficient methods to improve
    the crop productivity and also helps in water conservation where soil moisture
    sensors are widely used. Out of available soil-moisture sensors, the dual-probe
    heat-pulse (DPHP) sensor is the potential candidate due to its optimum price and
    better accuracy. A DPHP sensor has the heater probe kept at a distance from the
    temperature sensor probe. Heater probe consist of nichrome wire as the heating
    element, which is embedded in the stainless-steel tube. In this paper, we examine
    the acceptable tolerance in the heater resistance across 25 DPHP sensors, for
    the accurate soil moisture measurement. For this purpose, we used in-house developed
    25 DPHP sensors where heater resistance is about 56 Ω with ± 5% tolerance. Under
    laboratory condition, we observed that difference in the measured volumetric water
    content (VWC) is within ± 3 % (VWC) when compared with standard gravimetric method.
    For the field measurements, we developed the automated-self sustained system and
    deployed 3 systems on the rooftop of the building. Under field conditions, we
    observed that difference in the measured VWC from the 3 systems is within ± 3
    % (VWC) when benchmarked with standard gravimetric method. Published in: 2021

    It is progressively getting to be noticeable that enhancement in the agriculture
    technology has helped to improve the quality of crops. To improve the crop productivity
    and water conservation, integrated precise irrigation management is one of the
    efficient methods [1]–[2]. For in-situ water conservation, soil moisture needs
    to be maintained between the field capacity (FC) and the wilting point (WP) with
    respect to time. FC is a state of the soil, in which crops have sufficient intake
    of water and WP is the point that indicates that crops need water [3]. For the
    integrated precise irrigation management, in-situ soil moisture sensors are widely
    used and reported as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 describes the advantage and disadvantage
    of various reported soil moisture sensors [4]–[6]. The soil moisture sensors based
    on time domain reflectometry (TDR), frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) and neutron
    probe sensors are considered to be accurate but they are not affordable. Among
    the affordable soil-moisture sensors viz resistive, galvanic, tensiometer and
    heat pulse sensors, the heat pulse sensor offers good stability and insensitive
    to the soil electrical conductivity. Thus, in this paper we have used the dual-probe
    heat-pulse (DPHP) sensor considering its optimum price and accuracy. Fig. 1 Comparative
    analysis of various soil moisture sensors for in-situ soil moisture measurements
    Show All Researchers have explored the potential use of the dual-probe heat-pulse
    (DPHP) sensor to measure the volumetric water content (VWC) [7]–[11]. DPHP sensor
    comprise of the heater probe, which is kept at a distance from the temperature
    sensor probe. When an instantaneous heat-pulse is applied to the heater probe,
    then maximum rise in the temperature ΔT is observed at a fixed distance from heater
    probe [7]–[11]. Measured (ΔT) In this work, we analyze the tolerance in the heater
    resistance across 25 DPHP sensors, for the accurate in-situ soil moisture measurement.
    Further, out of 25 DPHP sensors, we have randomly selected 10 sensors and benchmarked
    the measured VWC by the DPHP sensor with standard gravimetric method. Furthermore,
    for the in-situ measurements, we developed a portable system and deployed on the
    rooftop of the building. Under field conditions, we benchmarked the measured VWC
    by the DPHP sensor and system with standard gravimetric (oven-dried) method. SECTION
    II. Theory Working principle of the DPHP sensor originates from the solution of
    heat conduction equation. When an instantaneous heat-pulse is applied to the infinite
    line heat-source in a homogeneous and isotropic medium, then maximum rise in the
    temperature (ΔT) is observed at a fixed distance from infinite line heat-source.
    Measured ΔT has an inverse relationship with the soil water content θ v as given
    by (1) [17] θ v = q ′ 4πk(ΔT) [Ei( − r 2 4k( t m − t 0 ) )−Ei( − r 2 4k( t m )
    )]− ρ b c s ρ w c w (1) View Source In (1), q ‘ is heat input per unit length
    given to the heater probe ( Wm −1 ),k is the thermal diffusivity of the medium
    where sensor is deployed ( m 2 s −1 ), t m is the time (s) taken to obtain the
    maximum rise in the temperature ΔT ( ∘ C), t 0 is the heat pulse time given to
    the heater probe (s), r is the space between the two probes (m), Ei(x) represents
    the exponential integral function of input x, ρ b and ρ w is the density of soil
    and water, respectively (kg/m3), c s and c w is the specific heat of the solids
    (dry soil) and water, respectively (J kg−1 K−1). SECTION III. Heat Pulse Sensor
    and System A. Dphp Sensor and System DPHP sensors used in this study is fabricated
    and developed at IISc, Bangalore, as shown in Fig. 2(a), where heater and temperature
    sensor probes are placed 3 mm apart. The system developed for the DPHP sensor
    for in-situ measurements is shown in Fig. 2(b). The detail fabrication of the
    DPHP sensor and development of the automated and self-sustained system is reported
    in [12] and [18]–[20], respectively. The heater probe shown in Fig. 2(a) consists
    parylene coated nichrome wire acting as the heating element, which is inserted
    into a stainless-steel tube [12]. The thickness of the heater probe and the temperature
    sensor is 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively as shown in Fig. 2(a). The resistance of
    the fabricated heater coil is around 56 Ω . We observed that tolerance in the
    heater resistance across 25 D PHP sensors is about 56 Ω±3 Ω , which indicates
    the approximately ± 5% tolerance. In order to ensure the functioning of the fabricated
    sensor, we prepared the soil samples with different water content in mould. Then,
    fabricated DPHP sensor is deployed in the mould containing soil sample [19]. Fig
    2. (c) shows the response of the fabricated DPHP sensor for different water content
    tested on the silt loam soil (red soil). From Fig. 2(c) it is evident that rise
    in the temperature decrease with increase in the soil water content, which is
    in agreement with (1). Fig. 2 (a) Developed heat-pulse sensor at iisc, bangalore,
    (b) developed automated and self-sustained system for in-situ measurements Show
    All B. Dphp Sensor Calibration A method for the calibration is the primary challenge
    in the heat-pulse technique for in-situ deployments. Standard calibration in the
    heat-pulse method is performed on the agar stabilized water, and specific heat
    is estimated [7]. Indian agriculture has wide range of soils ranging from clayey
    soil to sandy soil [3]. Thus, for the in-situ measurements, calibration of the
    heat-pulse sensors on the standard soil would be preferable over the agar solution
    considering the soil texture variations in the Indian agriculture field. For this
    purpose, we used the calibration process, which includes estimation of specific
    heat of the dry soil c s (solids present in the soil). In this work, white clay
    and sand is used as standard soil for the sensor calibration considering the variation
    in the soil texture. White clay soil and sand have clayey and sandy structure,
    respectively, which are considered as two extremes for the soil texture [3], [17].
    Thus, we used white clay and sand as standard soil and measured c s by using the
    developed DPHP sensor and results are shown in Table 1 (only for the two sensors
    is tabulated in Table 1). Table 1: Measured cs (j kg−1 k−1) using the two dphp
    sensors C. Accuracy of the Dphp Sensor Further, after calibration, in order to
    observe the accuracy of the DPHP sensors, we have used 25 sensors. A silt loam
    soil (red soil) sample with 6% (measured using standard oven-dried method) moisture
    is prepared and the dry bulk density is kept constant at 1200 kg m−3 in a mould.
    Red soil is used for this study. Further, 25 DPHP sensors are inserted in the
    mould. The DPHP sensor is turned on and VWC is calculated using (1). Fig. 3 shows
    the histogram of the 25 DPHP sensors. From Fig. 2 it is evident that maximum difference
    observed in the measured VWC by the DPHP sensor and the gravimetric technique
    is within ±3% VWC. Fig. 3 Measured accuracy for the 25 dphp sensors, where water
    content is fixed at 6% Show All D. Benchmarking with Standard Oven-Dried Method
    In this work, we have benchmarked the measured VWC by the DPHP sensor with the
    standard gravimetric method. Details of soil sample preparation is reported in
    [19], [23]. Fig. 4 compares the measured VWC by the DPHP sensors ( θ v − DPHP
    ) with the standard gravimetric technique ( θ v − Gravimetric ) for ten sensors,
    and silt loam soil (red soil) is used for the measurements. From Fig. 3 it is
    observed that the fabricated DPHP sensors measure the VWC with a maximum difference
    of around ±3% VWC when compared to the standard gravimetric technique. We compared
    the measured VWC by the DPHP sensors with the conventional gravimetric (oven-dried)
    method during the field measurements, which is explained in section IV. Fig. 4
    Calibration of the 10 dphp sensors and benchmarked the measured vwc by the dphp
    sensor with standard gravimetric method Show All E. Field Implementation After
    copious calibration of the DPHP sensors, we have developed a prototype and benchmark
    the measured VWC by the DPHP sensors with the conventional gravimetric method
    in both laboratory and field. We have deployed three systems on the rooftop of
    the building, and sensors are located 25 cm from the surface, as shown in Fig.
    5. System 1 and system 2 are deployed in silt loam (red soil), and system 3 is
    deployed in clayey soil (black soil). Fig. 5 Three systems deployed in the rooftop
    of the building Show All SECTION IV. Results and Discussion To understand the
    sensor response for different water contents, we first deploy the system in the
    laboratory. First, the sensor is placed in the dry soil. Then, water is added
    to the dry soil sample (silt loam soil) so that the soil reaches its field capacity
    (FC ≈ 23%). Further, we have recorded the water content at intervals of 4 hours
    for 100 hours. The measured VWC using the DPHP sensor is compared with the standard
    gravimetric method, as shown in Fig. 6. From Fig. 6 it can be observed that the
    DPHP sensor responds to different moistures, which is in agreement with measured
    water content using the oven-dried method. Fig. 6 Benchmark of measured vwc using
    dphp sensor with standard gravimetric (oven dried) method under lab conditions
    Show All Further, we have deployed the developed systems in the rooftop of the
    building as shown in Fig. 5. The heater probe resistance in system 1, 2 and 3
    is around 53 Ω,56 Ω and 59 Ω , respectively. Fig. 6 shows the measured VWC from
    the developed three systems and compared with the conventional gravimetric method.
    From Fig. 7 it is evident that for all the three systems, the discrepancy in the
    measured VWC from the developed system is within ±3% (% VWC), when compared with
    the conventional oven-dried method. From Fig. 6, it is also evident that the precision
    (measurement repeatability) for the system 1 and system 2 is around ±1% (% VWC).
    However, for the system 3 precision is around ±2% (% VWC). Table 2 shows the comparison
    of the performance analysis of fabricated DPHP sensor with few of the reported
    works. Fig. 7 Benchmark of measured vwc using dphp sensor and system with standard
    gravimetric (oven dried) method under field Show All SECTION V. Conclusions In
    this paper, we have used the 25 DPHP fabricated using off-shell components, where
    variation in the heater resistance was around 56Ω±3Ω , which indicates approximately
    ±5% tolerance. We have developed a system DPHP sensor and system and carried out
    the lab and field measurements. Under laboratory and field conditions, the maximum
    difference between measured water content using DPHP sensor and standard gravimetric
    method is around ± 3%. This shows the potential use of the affordable DPHP sensor
    and the system for in-situ soil moisture measurements. Table 2 Comparison and

    Today, a considerable number of applications of wireless sensor networks have
    been found in many fields such as wearable system [1], healthcare [2], rehabilitation,
    and telerehabilitation [3, 4]. One of the extreme application of wireless sensor
    networks is modern agriculture that improves production efficiency, product quality,
    and reduces their harsh environmental impact. Thus, the wireless sensor network
    has owned a fundamental contribution to emerging precision agriculture [5, 6].
    Precision agriculture can be defined as the technique of applying the right amount
    of input, which consists of water, fertilizer, pesticide etc. at the right location
    and time to expand production and improve the quality of protecting the environment
    [7]. Wireless sensor networks have been employed in the precision agriculture
    application for monitoring of a wide variety of pertinent parameters such as soil
    moisture, air temperature, and transmitting data wirelessly to the base station
    of the farmer [8–10]. The old systems that were used in the field had a great
    number of problems for the farmers. They had to spend more money on providing
    long cables for transferring data to the control rooms that they not only gives
    an ugly appearance to the greenhouses but also it made problems for movement of
    the farmer in the greenhouses [11]. Furthermore, the cable was decayed over time
    and the farmers have to substitute new cables instead of the older cables in the
    time period [12, 13]. By emerging wireless sensor networks, the drawbacks have
    been declined over time. Another essential issue is irrigation in greenhouses
    and farmland whose optimisation is one of the key factors to improve the crop
    yield. The irrigation was traditionally performed earlier. However, the farmers
    needed to refer to their lands for irrigating [14]. This work makes some drawbacks
    for the farmers, especially when they are not available in the greenhouses. Most
    greenhouses and farms are out of the city. Often, the farmers have to go downtown
    during the day for doing a special work which is simultaneous with irrigation
    time. Therefore, it is mandatory that they come back to the greenhouse to supply
    sufficient water for the crop. If they do not perform this work, it would make
    harmful effects on the crops. For example, abundant water closes the soil pores
    and prevents penetrating air into the soil. As a result, the soil has a lack of
    necessary gases such as nitrogen etc. Additionally, the condition provides the
    appropriate state for growing mushrooms which hurt the crops. On the other hand,
    low irrigation gradually destroys the crops and cause an essential adverse for
    the farmer [15]. For instance, potato crop is intensely sensitive to water. The
    shallow root system of potato provides very little margin for irrigation errors.
    If potato plants are watered precisely using water, they are more productive and
    produce higher quality tubers [16]. The potato yield can be improved significantly
    by using wireless sensor network nodes and calculating the exact amount of irrigation
    requirements [17]. Indeed, their system in [16, 17] employs a group of wireless
    sensor network nodes that were spread in the potato field for sensing the necessary
    parameters based on the radio frequency communication to transmit the measured
    data to a base station. Thus, watering systems monitoring by using electronic
    devices and the wireless sensor networks have aided to the issue, especially in
    monitoring fields, vineyards, and orchards. Accordingly, the networks, prevent
    damage crops and result in enhancing crop production. In this paper, a wireless
    sensor network is developed to improve tomato crops. First, a simple algorithm
    is presented, and then it is implemented on the developed wireless sensor network
    in which measures various parameters such as temperature, humidity, CO, and .
    The simple algorithm makes lower space of programming than other methods in [18–22]
    that result in utilising low-cost microcontrollers such as Atmega8 in the market.
    Also, the presented system benefits an irrigation system that provides a good
    condition for a greenhouse to enhancing the quantity and quality of tomato. Accordingly,
    the proposed wireless sensor network goes up the number of tomato crops 30% than
    traditional methods and also declines the cost of consuming methane gas, electricity,
    and water as many as 30, 24, and 10%, respectively. Although many precision agriculture
    systems and types of equipment benefit wireless sensor networks in the agricultural
    field in different applications [18–22], these are not targetted for low-cost
    wireless sensor nodes. 2 Proposed methodology Sensing, communications, and computation
    account three main features of the sensor networks that are the equivalent of
    obtaining the mandatory software algorithms and the required hardware. The proposed
    method of the paper is based on developing a wireless sensor network using a star
    network. The developed wireless sensor node is programmed to monitor various parameters
    such as light, humidity, temperature, as well as CO and . The data are wirelessly
    transmitted to a base station by an HM-TR module for human interpretation. Fig.
    1a shows the experimental setup for measuring and monitoring of environmental
    parameters that are developed and tested in the paper. Fig. 1 Open in figure viewer

    The proposed frame for communication between the central node and the sensor nodes
    2.1 Algorithm In order to implement the proposed algorithm in a wireless network,
    a simple module is used. The employed module is HM-TR in which uses an FSK (frequency
    shift keying) modulation [23]. The module operates at ISM (industrial, science,
    medical) band to send and receive the information and it does not need to permit
    the communication from radio and frequency management if the power of the device
    does not exceed the defined values [23]. 2.1.1 Proposed frame A proposed frame
    is used for communication between sensor nodes and central nodes whose contains
    consist of several packets of address, function, data, protocol, and CRC (cyclic
    redundancy check), as shown in Fig. 1b. The frame is sent for all of the sensors
    nodes by the central node and only one sensor node answers in every transmission.
    In other words, the central node works based on time-division multiplexers. At
    the beginning of the frame, a start packet is observed whose contain is 255. After
    the start packet, an address packet of 32 bytes is seen which is changed by the
    central node to be connected with every special sensor node. The sensor nodes
    have a special address that their values are saved on the flash memory of the
    sensor and the central nodes. Another packet is a data packet that is used to
    save the sensors’ data in sensor nodes. Other packets are explained in the next
    subsection in detail. 2.1.2 Sensor nodes algorithm In the sensor nodes, the obtained
    frame is received and separated. Then, the value of the address packet is extracted.
    If the transmitted address equals the address of the sensor nodes that have been
    saved in its flash memory, the sensor''s data in the sensor node is put in the
    data packet considering to function packet. The function packet is controlled
    by the central node to access every sensor data in the sensor nodes such as temperature,
    humidity, and so on. For example, when the central node only seeks the environmental
    temperature of the sensor node, it gives 1 to the function packet. While for other
    functions, the central node puts other numbers to the function packet. Thus, the
    content of the sensor data is put on the data packet in the frame. Moreover, the
    end packet contains a value of 254. When the start and end of the frame have values
    of 255 and 254, respectively, it is more likely for few problems to occur when
    the data packet contains values 255 and 254. In order to separate the data from
    the start and end of the frame, a protocol packet is defined. The protocol packet
    helps to diagnose the data from the start and the end of the frame. For example,
    when a 255 or 254 emerges in a data packet, its value of the protocol packet is
    changed from 1 to 0 in sensor nodes. The protocol packet is 1 byte and thus the
    data packet is 8 bytes. In the end, the CRC is gotten from the packets of the
    address, protocol, function as well as the data, and their value is saved in the
    CRC packet. Finally, the end of the frame is closed with the value of 254 in the
    sensor nodes and the sensor nodes send the frame to the central node. The mentioned
    descriptions are shown in Fig. 2b. Fig. 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flowchart
    of the proposed algorithm (a) The central node, (b) The sensor node 2.1.3 Central
    node algorithm In the central node, the obtained frames of node sensors are received
    and then are separated. After that, CRCs of the data is gotten and are saved in
    the flash memory of the central node. In the next step, the calculated CRC in
    the central node is compared to the CRC made in the sensor nodes where it is sent
    with the frame. If the central node''s CRC is equal to the sensor node''s CRC,
    the central node saves the content of the data packet for the sensor node and
    is prepared for communicating to the further sensor node. Otherwise, the central
    node waits to receive another frame of that sensor node. All explanations of the
    proposed algorithm have shown in Fig. 2a. 2.2 Hardware As Fig. 3 illustrates the
    proposed algorithm is implemented on the developed system in which consists of
    four sensor nodes (Fig. 3b), a central node (Fig. 3d) as well as a relay node
    (Fig. 3f). Fig. 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic diagram of the developed
    system (a) Sensor node, (c) Central node, (e) Relay board. The prototype of measurement
    setup: (b) Sensor node, (d) Central node, (f) Relay node 2.2.1 Sensor node The
    sensor nodes are used to collect various environmental data. The schematic and
    prototype of the developed sensor nodes are shown in Figs. 3a and b, respectively.
    The sensor nodes record the environmental data and instantaneously send them to
    the central node for the next processing. As it is shown in Fig. 3b, similar to
    a typical wireless sensor [24–27], the sensor nodes consist of a microcontroller,
    a transceiver as well as temperature, humidity, CO, , light, and passive infrared
    (PIR) sensors. The microcontroller is an Atmega8 AVR series that processes the
    obtained data. The transceiver, which operates in the ISM band at frequency 433
    MHz, is connected to the microcontroller through the serial port in sensor nodes.
    In order to determine environmental humidity, a humidity sensor (Hs1101) is used.
    The sensor is a capacitor sensor whose value changes in different moisture levels
    of the air. In order to bias the sensor, a NE 555 IC and four resistances are
    used, as shown in Fig. 4a [28]. Indeed, this IC is employed to make an astable
    circuit with variable frequency when the capacitor capacity of the humidity sensor
    alters [28]. By reading out the obtained frequency of the astable circuit using
    TIMER1 of the microcontroller, the humidity can be calculated and illustrated
    [28]. Another sensor is a temperature sensor (LM35) whose accuracy is and the
    operation of the temperature range is −40 to . LM35 is an analogue sensor and
    it contains three bases out of which two of them are the supply voltage while
    the rest of them is the sensor output. The sensor is similar to a BJT transistor
    and temperature variations cause some changes in the sensor output. By using the
    10-bit analogue-to-digital converter of the microcontroller, the variations can
    be recorded in digital numbers. Gas sensors are resistive sensors and consist
    of two sensors CO and . The gas sensors own four pins in which two pins are used
    to warm their core with a pulse voltage while two other pins are voltage output
    that change when gases meet a special gas on the sensor''s surface. The variations
    can be recorded by using the 10-bit analogue-to-digital converter in the microcontroller.
    Furthermore, the light sensor is a photocell (Photoresistor) whose resistance
    changes with the light intensity. Similar to temperature and gas sensors, the
    sensor output can be digitised by utilising the analogue-to-digital converter
    of the microcontroller and then is sent to a central node. Moreover, the PIR sensor
    is employed for recording the motion of animals and humans. Nevertheless, the
    output signal of PIR is weak and an Op-Amp is used to reinforce the signal (Fig.
    4b) [29]. Then, the output signal of Op-Amp is digitised by the analogue-to-digital-converter
    of the microcontroller. By defining a set point in the microcontroller, the human
    movement can be detected. Fig. 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The astable

    [29] 2.2.2 Central node The schematic and prototype of the central node are illustrated
    in Figs. 3c and d, respectively. As it can be seen, the central node consists
    of a microcontroller, a transceiver as well as a to USB communication module.
    By connecting these components, the transceiver wirelessly receives the data and
    sends them to the microcontroller throughout the serial port. Then, the information
    is sent to a personal computer (PC) by the microcontroller throughout the bus
    to further process. Nonetheless, users can see all of the sensor data on LCD if
    a PC is not available for them. Also, the users benefit from a phone set if a
    warning condition appears. In other words, users save several phone numbers on
    the flash memory of the central node and they will be called in the emergency
    circumstances. Another important issue in the microcontroller of the central node
    is to calculate time and date that is a extreme key for irrigation. However, it
    spends more processes in the microcontroller. In order to decrease the time processing,
    a DS1307 IC is used that produces an accurate time separately from the microcontroller,
    thereby, the process in the main processor (Atmega32) is removed and it provides
    more speed for other functions in the main processor. It should be noted, the
    system can be connected to WiFi using the EPS8666 module. Therefore, users can
    collect and see all of their data throughout the internet by username and a password.
    2.2.3 Relay node Figs. 3e and f demonstrate a schematic and prototype of the relay
    board, respectively, that consists of eight relays to control the heaters and
    fans. The node wirelessly communicates with the central node and receives the
    set and reset commands of the relays from the central node and then enables every
    relay that received its command. 3 Results This section contains the data collection
    and analysis part of the growing tomatoes crop. There are several important parameters
    such as temperature, humidity, light, , CO that have a highlighted role in the
    growth of the crop. It should be noted that the amount of heat required by tomatoes
    in greenhouses varies during the day and night. These plants need more heat to
    grow during daylight and less heat at night. The best temperature for growing
    tomatoes per day is between 21 and 30°C. Also at night, this rate varies between
    15 and 20°C. Temperatures <11°C cause the tomato plant to freeze and dry out.
    These plants also wither against temperatures >35°C. It is worth noting that the
    most desirable temperature for growing tomatoes at night is 17 and 24°C during
    the day. Of course, this rate may be one or more degrees lower or higher at different
    stages of growth. However, in general, the mentioned temperatures significantly
    increase the growth and quality of cultivated tomatoes. Additionally, the best
    humidity for growing the tomato is 65 to 90%. At first, the four sensor nodes
    were situated in different locations in the plastic tunnel greenhouse with an
    area of and also the central node in a base station for a duration of 6 months,
    as shown in Fig. 5. The greenhouse is equipped with four fans and four heaters
    (Fig. 5), and also lamps for the control of light intensity. The sensor nodes
    detect and record environmental parameters in 24 h and in 7 days of the week in
    the greenhouse consist of temperature, humidity, light, , CO and PIR that their
    intense variations can make a negative effect on the tomato crop. Then, the data
    are sent to the central node where they are situated out of the greenhouse in
    the base station (Fig. 5). The data are received and shown in the central node
    with an LCD or can be sent to a PC for further display and recording in external
    hardware. In the central node, a comprehensive menu was designed that the users
    can see and perform all setpoints from maximum to minimum for every sensor such
    as temperature, humidity, light, and CO, , so on. Also, users can set activation
    of PIR and phone calls. After setting all of the parameters, the users can return
    the main menu while the values will save for every time even with the power outage.
    Moreover, the system has been equipped with irrigation management that the users
    can change their values in the mentioned menu by setting the minute, hour, and
    day to give water to the soil using a pump. Furthermore, the developed sensor
    and central nodes can be set to inform the farmers with a beep in abnormal conditions.
    This action is very useful for two reasons. First, the farmers are aware of the
    abnormal condition in the base station because of the beep of the central node.
    Second, this state can be quickly found in the correspondent sensor node in the
    greenhouse because the sensor node also starts beep simultaneously with the central
    node. Therefore, farmers find the location quickly. Fig. 5 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Location of the central, the sensor and relay nodes as well as fan
    and heater in the greenhouse To investigate the performance of the developed system,
    every sensor is separately tested. First, the maximum and minimum temperature
    in every sensor node in the central node is set. The values were set to 37 and
    24°C, respectively. The desired temperatures were set to show the performance
    of the developed system for turning on or off heater or fan in response to the
    variation of temperature. After warming the greenhouse by using a heater deliberately,
    the environmental temperature increases from the defined setpoint (37°C), and
    the temperature sensor followed the variation. When the sensor sensed a temperature
    more than a setpoint, the base station was cleared from the variation (Fig. 6a)
    and the central node sends a set command to the relay node in order to turn on
    the cooler. The cooler is turned on until the temperature reaches the setpoint
    (37°C) as shown in Fig. 6a. In other words, the cooler is used to decline the
    temperature. On the other side, when the temperature decreases from the minimum
    setpoint (24°C), the central node alerts the farmers by beeping and also turns
    on the heater until the temperature reaches a minimised setpoint (Fig. 6b). The
    obtained results show high accuracy in awareness from environmental temperature
    (Figs. 6a and b). Also, as Figs. 6a and b reveal the other location is not observed
    variation because there is no ON heaters or coolers in the place. In another test,
    smoke is used to test the gas sensor of CO and . The tomato crop is very sensitive
    to CO and it can be quickly damaged. A little amount of CO and in a specific location
    of the greenhouse are made. When the gases hit the sensors, the output of the
    sensors altered, and because their values expanded more than the setpoint for
    and CO (8, 10%, separately), the central node informed the base station with a
    beep (Figs. 6c and 7a) as well as the fan acts in order to decline of the amount
    of the gases. In the next test to produce humidity, low steam near one of the
    sensor nodes is made. By performing that, the amount of capacitor capacity of
    the astable circuit in the sensor node changed which means increasing humidity.
    So, the sensor output exceeded than setpoint (60%). Thus, the farmers were informed
    using the central node in their station (Fig. 7b) and fans automatically act to
    go down the amount of steam in this location. Another test is relevant to investigating
    the amount of light intensity in the greenhouse, by setting or resetting light
    bulb as artificial lamps to give the sufficient light intensity to the tomato
    crop. Indeed, the setpoint of light intensity was defined 40% in the environment
    and when the light intensity was decreased of the amount, the artificial light
    was acted. In order to decline the light on the photocell sensor, the light intensity
    is blocked out by hand. As a result, the light bulb is turned on and by picking
    the hand up, the light bulb is turned off, as shown in Fig. 7c. Additionally,
    the sensor of soil humidity helped to the central node to make the decision that
    when the central node irrigates the soil and it helps more efficiency for tomato
    crop. However, the users can use time and date for irrigation instead of the sensor
    of soil humidity that decline the cost for the system. Fig. 8 shows the measurement
    of the environmental parameters by the developed system. As can be seen, the sensor
    node no. 2 and sensor node no. 3 are situated in the greenhouse (Fig. 8a) and
    the data of the sensor, which is received by the central node, is shown in Fig.
    8b in the base station on LCD of the central node. Also, Fig. 8c demonstrates
    status of temperature (T), Humidity (H), CO (CO), light (L) and (C) with abbreviation
    letters. If their values are higher than the setpoint, an up arrow appears beside
    them while for a value lower than the setpoint, a down arrow can be illustrated
    beside the abbreviation letters. Also, D is relevant to the PIR sensor when a
    human movement is detected (sensor node no. 4 in Fig. 8c). Furthermore, in Fig.
    8c is related to beep with new variations that occurred in sensor node nos. 1,
    2, and 4. Thus, the sensor nodes and the central node help to maintain the suitable
    environmental condition in the greenhouse by defining the parameters by users
    and when a change occurs in the environment, the developed system quickly responds
    to variations. Fig. 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Snapshot of the obtained

    a duration of 6 months to investigate the effect of the developed network on the
    growth of tomato plants. The obtained results in Fig. 9 show that tomato crops
    improved using the method. The tomato crops increase up to 30% utilising the developed
    system than traditional methods in this duration. In other words, the amount of
    the tomato obtained 3312 kg for 6 months while 2545 kg were cultivated with traditional
    methods in the duration. Additionally, the greenhouse experienced a decrease in
    consuming methane gas, water, and electricity as 30, 24, and 10%, respectively.

    viewer PowerPoint Improvement of tomato crop and declining the consumption of
    energy and water 4 Discussions The obtained measurement data of the developed
    wireless sensor network and analysing them have helped to grow the high-quality
    tomatoes in the greenhouse. Nonetheless, two fundamental issues should be considered
    in the work. The first is robustness. The overall robustness of a sensor network
    depends on many factors such as the ability of the network protocols to recover
    from errors, the quality of radio transmissions, how to endure the nodes in harsh
    outdoor conditions and disaster from wildlife or humans, as well as the accuracy
    of the sensors and software utilised for measurement of the environmental parameters
    [30]. Hence, if the network never performs reliably in any one of these areas,
    then it may fail to deliver data in the field [31]. In the present case, any data
    loss was not observed in the presented sensor network in the greenhouse. Since
    real-time monitoring of crop, loss of data communication emerges in outside interference
    of the communication such as being close to high power networks while the greenhouse
    environment is a controlled environment and there is no evidence of the issue.
    Secondly, it is indispensable that the sensors are positioned at an appropriate
    point of the greenhouse that the obtained measures are reliable for the entire
    greenhouse. The placement of the sensors is based on constraints such as several
    tomato plants are in the coverage region of at least one sensor, the overlap between
    the sensing regions is minimised (thus minimising the number of sensors). In order
    to obtain high precision localisation for the sensor nodes, the low-cost scheme
    in [32] was used. A comparison with other methods has been performed in the field
    in Table 1. As can be seen, there are some limitations in other methods. For example,
    Bluetooth protocol in [19] has a short communication range maximum of 50 m. However,
    the proposed system can work at a distance of 1000 m. In the WiFi protocol in
    [20], there is a high power consumption problem that leads to a serious drawback
    in using them while the power consumption of the presented system is low. In SigFox
    protocol, data bit per second is very low and it is not appropriate for the vital
    application [22]. However, the bit rate of the developed system can be set at
    9200–115,200 bit/s. In LoRa protocol, the power consumption is high, thereby emerging
    some problems relevant to this issue [21]. In ZigBee, the complexity of the network
    is very high [18, 33] while the proposed system is simply implemented. Also, the
    cost for implementation of ZigBee is very high [18, 33] while the cost of carrying
    out the proposed system is low. As Table 1 shows, the proposed system owns lower
    power consumption than [18–22] that the feature comes from the sleep mode of the
    transceiver and also using the low-power sensors. Indeed, when the transceiver
    sends repetitive information for a while, the microcontroller can change its mode
    to sleep. This feature aid in declining of the power consumption in the developed
    system, resulting in using nickel–cadmium batteries for sensor nodes. Thus, the
    lifetime of the battery increases and a battery will have more energy for the
    sensor nodes. It should be noted, if the gas sensor is used, the power of the
    system increases because the core of the gas sensor needs to be warm enough for
    detecting the amount of gas in the air. Thus, using the gas sensor follow with
    a high power battery. Furthermore, the developed system is designed to be connected
    to a system of emergency power when the power outage occurs. Indeed, electrically
    erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) is used to save these setpoints
    in the microcontroller when the problem emerges because all of the setpoints can
    be cleaned of the flash memory if EEPROM is not utilised. Accordingly, the developed
    system is versatile and can be developed based on the users’ views. Moreover,
    the developed system has a lower price than [18–22]. In contrast, the bit rate
    of the developed system is lower than [18–20] that used ZigBee, Bluetooth, and
    WiFi protocol. Nonetheless, the positive advantage of the proposed system can
    help to neglect the bit rate. The price plays a pivotal role for most farmers
    and they seek the lowest price among the smart system for monitoring. The proposed
    system has declined the price and also the power consumption that results in using
    an appropriate battery. Also, although the proposed system has lower communication
    distances than LORA and Sigfox in [21, 22], the distance is sufficient for use
    in the greenhouse. Since the area of the greenhouse is about . In the end, an
    ESP8266 module can be added to the presented system to collect all of the data
    and send them to the internet substrate. Then, the user can collect the data by
    having a username and password throughout the internet all over the world. Additionally,
    the simple protocol can be applied to another module such as the NRF module, which
    owns 1–2 Mbs bit rate. Therefore, it can be an alternative case for the system
    in the future for sending data with a more bit rate. Moreover, although wireless
    sensor networks surely revolutionise environmental research, it is difficult to
    carry out a fine judgment about being automatic completely. On account of the
    possible consequences of living things, there is understandable anxiety about
    sensor error. In the proposed system, the sensor-nodes are constructed and managed
    by manual operating using the users’ judgment, not with artificial intelligence.
    With regard to future work, sensor networks with embedded intelligence can be
    made for the automatic control and compatibility to the different environmental
    conditions without manual interference of users. The developed design and implementation
    described in this paper is effective and can be a guideline for further research
    in this area. 5 Conclusions In this paper, a comprehensive description of a developed
    wireless sensor network was presented by presenting a simple algorithm for internet
    of things applications in greenhouses. The developed wireless sensor network comprises
    four sensor nodes, a central node, and a relay node. The sensor nodes recorded
    essential environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature, CO, , movement
    of humans, and the light intensity that are extremely important for a greenhouse
    and then sent their data to the central node to turn on fans or heaters or artificial
    blubs in order to make an appropriate environment in greenhouses. Also, the developed
    system was equipped with irrigation management. Users set the maximum and minimum
    mentioned parameters and also the irrigation time in the set in the central node.
    The developed system was implemented in a greenhouse with an area of 750 m2 for
    6 months. The obtained results revealed a 30% improvement in tomato crops than
    traditional methods and also 30, 24, and 10% decreasing for consuming methane
    gas, water, and electricity. Also, the developed system own low-cost and low-power
    consumption than the mentioned works in the field. According to the results, the
    developed system can be a good candidate for monitoring essential parameters in
    greenhouses because of improving crop cultivation and also declining the required
    energy. 6 References Citing Literature Volume14, Issue8 November 2020 Pages 1258-1264

    is in constantly renewing, continuously demanding new systems that facilitate
    farmers´ work. Efficient agricultural practices are essential to increasing farm
    profitability, and reducing water consumption can be achieved by real-time monitoring
    of water needs. However, the prices of automatic systems for collecting data from
    several sources (soil and climate) are expensive and their autonomy is very low.
    This paper presents a low-consumption solution using the Internet of Things (IoT)
    based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN)
    technologies. By means of low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) communication, a
    farmer can monitor the state of crops in real time thanks to a large number of
    sensors connected wirelessly and distributed across the farm. The wireless sensor
    node developed, called BoXmote, exhibits very low power, since it has been optimized
    both in terms of hardware and software. The result is a higher degree of autonomy
    than commercial motes. This will allow the farmer to have access to all of the
    information necessary to achieve an efficient irrigation management of his crops
    with full autonomy. Keywords: LoraWAN; Internet of Things (IoT); agriculture 4.0;
    wireless sensor network; energy consumption 1. Introduction Some of the main problems
    that the world population faces today, and on which researchers from all over
    the world are working, are globalization, global warming, and the supply of food.
    In order to address the latter, it is necessary to develop modern solutions that
    allow the optimization of costs and increased yields, such as the smart management
    of water for precision irrigation in agriculture [1,2]. In recent years, many
    researchers have been integrating the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    into the field of agriculture, thus helping the development of what is known as
    precision agriculture. Precision agriculture aims to provide a decision support
    system that helps farmers to implement efficient agricultural practices, with
    the aim of increasing profitability, reducing environmental risks, and preserving
    natural resources [3,4]. So-called smart agriculture or digital agriculture uses
    intelligent networks and data management tools to employ all of the information
    and experience available in order to enable the automation of sustainable processes
    in agriculture. This agriculture is based on connected and knowledge-based agricultural
    production systems and makes great use of information and communication technologies
    (ICT), both for data collection and for subsequent processing. For this reason,
    the design and implementation of efficient and economic devices in agriculture
    are currently an important line of research [5]. Due to the characteristics of
    the agricultural sector, the use of wired systems for the collection of information
    is practically unfeasible, which is why work is currently underway to develop
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in order to minimize the economic cost and impact
    of installation in agricultural environments, thus avoiding hindering the work
    of the farmer [5,6]. WSN solutions for establishing different parameters in agriculture
    should include certain requirements for smaller farmers to implement this type
    of system on their farms, such as inexpensive devices (i.e., the cost of a radio
    chipset being less than 2€ and an operating cost of 1€ per device per year), low
    energy consumption (i.e., 10+ years of battery lifetime), and a long range of
    communication (i.e., up to 10-40 km in rural zones)—three areas in which we must
    work in the future [2,7,8]. Currently, there are some challenges to be overcome
    that still prevent the use of IoT for irrigation. Firstly, there are still many
    rural areas that do not have Internet connectivity. Secondly, they do not have
    electricity either. Thirdly, monitoring with soil sensors requires scalability,
    but this comes at a price. Finally, the integration of different and advanced
    sensors requires adequate standards. In order to solve the aforementioned problems,
    this paper develops and assesses an inexpensive WSN solution based on long-range
    (LoRa) technology with very low power consumption and high autonomy to control
    water needs for precision irrigation in agriculture. Many additional mechanisms
    have been proposed to increase the battery life of WSN end-devices and to accomplish
    energy saving, irrespective of whether the devices are already of low consumption.
    However, we found it difficult to compare them due to the diversity of the methodologies,
    end-device components, sensors used, and types of experiment. Therefore, the main
    contribution is that due to the fact that existing WSN systems for precision irrigation
    are mostly theoretical with limited proof of concept experiences in practice,
    providing details of devices and equipment as well as irrigation techniques [2,4],
    this work compares consumption to show a more energy-efficient end-device configuration.
    2. Wireless Sensor Networks in the Context of Smart Agriculture We can see different
    solutions for monitoring crops using WSNs. Many of these proposals have only been
    tested in the laboratory and still have to be developed and implemented on real
    crops. A low-cost, small-scale system to remotely monitor and control a greenhouse
    was created in [9]. In this study, the information was collected by an Arduino
    Mega and sent to a web page through ethernet communication. In [10], a system
    based on short message service (SMS) communication using a global system for mobile
    (GSM) module was developed to measure parameters such as soil moisture, pH, and
    atmospheric pressure. With these data, irrigation could be controlled and the
    farmer informed of the state of his crops. Similarly, the authors of [11] developed
    a WSN system with a soil moisture sensor and a temperature and humidity sensor.
    One of the most widely used technologies for creating wireless sensor networks
    in agriculture is the ZigBee technology. In [5,12,13], a WSN was presented for
    monitoring crops by measuring parameters such as soil moisture, pH, conductivity,
    salinity, and ambient light. General packet radio service (GPRS) technology can
    also be used in agriculture to create WSNs [6]. In [14], the authors developed
    an automated irrigation system to optimize the use of water in crops by combining
    the ZigBee and GPRS technologies. By means of this system, the humidity and temperature
    of the land can be measured. Furthermore, in [15], an IoT-based irrigation system
    was presented using soil moisture sensors controlled by ATMEGA 328P on an Arduino
    UNO board, along with a GPRS module. NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) is an LPWAN technology
    based on narrow band radio technology that can coexist with GSM and long-term
    evolution (LTE) under licensed frequency bands. NB-IoT is standardized by the
    3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and its specifications were released
    in June 2016; thus, additional time is needed before its network is established
    [16]. SigFox is a new technology used in IoT applications. In [17], a geolocation
    system was developed to locate herds of cattle. As advantages of the SigFox technology,
    we can highlight its wide range of coverage and low consumption, which makes it
    very appropriate for IoT solutions. With SigFox, LoRa technology has started to
    be used in precision agriculture in recent years as an alternative to previous
    protocols [18,19]. It is a long-range and low-power wireless communication system
    whose objective is to be used in long-term devices [20]. Based on the LoRaWAN
    technology, the MoniSen end-device [1] used the ATMEGA324P processor and the RN2473
    chip to establish LoRa communication, to measure parameters such as ambient temperature
    and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, and light intensity received by the
    plant. In a smart irrigation system [19], the end-device achieved a distance of
    7 km in the field tests. Table 1 shows a comparison of the different communication
    technologies discussed above for the creation of WSNs [8,16,21,22]. Table 1. Comparison
    between the different communication technologies for end-devices. If we analyze
    the data shown in the table above, we can see that GPRS technology, apart from
    its high cost, is not entirely suitable for the communication of wireless sensors
    due to its high energy consumption, which means it is little used in the creation
    of high autonomy nodes. Currently, the ZigBee wireless communication protocol
    is considered one of the best technologies in precision agriculture, given its
    low consumption. If we compare it with the LoRa and Sigfox technologies, we can
    see that all three have low consumption and low cost, making them ideal for the
    creation of WSNs. However, one of its main disadvantages is its short reach between
    nodes—100 m in open spaces, as shown in Table 1—which is both lower than the other
    wireless communication protocols and a great limitation for agriculture. NB-IoT
    is preferred for applications that require guaranteed quality of service, whereas
    applications that do not have this constraint could choose both LoRa or Sigfox.
    Furthermore, the additional energy consumption because of synchronous communication
    reduces NB-IoT’s end-device lifetime as compared to them. In addition, NB-IoT
    is not suitable for rural areas that do not benefit from LTE coverage. Thus, for
    applications that do not have large amount of data to send, Sigfox and Lora are
    the best options [8,16]. In the field of agriculture, a long battery lifetime
    of sensor devices is required. Using temperature, humidity, and electrical conductivity
    (EC), sensors could significantly reduce water consumption and improve yield,
    as discussed in [23]. Devices update sensed data a few times per hour, as the
    environment conditions do not radically change in this time period. Thus, Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN are ideal for this application. Moreover, various farms do not have
    LTE cellular coverage, thus NB-IoT is not a solution for agriculture in the near
    future. Although the LoRa and SigFox technologies have a great technical similarity,
    LoRa technology was used in this work for two reasons: Firstly, because we wanted
    to build a WSN that avoided dependence on third parties. One of the main features
    of this technology is that any user can build their own network, thus avoiding
    having to subscribe in order to use an external network. Secondly, because with
    LoRa, we can support coverage in remote rural areas. Finally, commercial wireless
    detection modules such as eKo Pro [24], MicaZ [25], TelosB [26], Zolertia [27],
    Adcon Telemetry GmbH [28], AquacomSensor Hub Aquaflex [29], Enviroscan [30], or
    Waspmote [31] for agriculture and its irrigation are still very expensive—usually
    exceeding 1000.00€—making it impossible for smaller farms to implement this type
    of system, as well as for smart farms, which require a large number of wireless
    end-devices for data collection that support reliable decision making. 3. Materials
    and Methods In the first instance, we installed the LoRa gateway in an elevated
    position [32], in the headquarters of an agricultural cooperative from which coverage
    of nearby crops could be given. Thanks to the LoRa technology, we could easily
    cover an area of about 5 km around this cooperative; this is less than other studies,
    but we did not modify the LoRaWAN PHY layer and did not point the antenna toward
    the test area [32,33]. Then, end-devices (BoXmotes, Bo True Activities SL, Huelva,
    Spain) were installed in the crop, which were equipped with the most suitable
    sensors, depending on the parameters that were to be measured. In this way, the
    BoXmote took measurements at regular intervals and sent them to the gateway through
    the LoRa technology. Once the gateway received the data, they were sent to a server
    via the ethernet connection. When the data reached the server, the farmer could
    consult them through a mobile application. 3.1. Hardware Description In this section,
    a complete description of the hardware that makes up our end-device is given.
    When choosing the hardware that forms our end-device, it should be noted that
    all of the components were selected with low consumption in mind, thus increasing
    battery life to the maximum. Each end-device comprised a radio transceiver, a
    micro-controller, sensors, and an antenna, along with other circuitry that would
    enable it to communicate with the gateway to transmit information collected by
    the sensors [34]. 3.1.1. Monitored Parameters and Sensors According to [4], the
    majority of papers monitored between three and four parameters with soil moisture
    being the most used in soil sensors, and air temperature and humidity as atmospheric
    parameters. Soil temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), and luminosity are
    other parameters that are measured regularly [5]. In relation to the measurement
    of soil moisture, most studies use the conductivity between two electrodes that
    are inserted into the soil by measuring the constant dielectric of the soil. Most
    published works use the low-cost sensors YL69 (Sparkfun Electronics, Niwot, CO,
    USA) and VH400 (Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) that operate with Arduino.
    However, we both tested and discarded them because they did not behave stably
    under real conditions. Thus, to measure the soil parameters, we used well-known
    commercial sensors [35] (see Table 2) as the capacitive sensor of the frequency
    domain reflectrometry (FDR) type ECH2O 10HS (Meter Group, Inc, Pullman, WA, USA)
    to measure soil moisture, and ECH2O 5TE to measure soil moisture and temperature,
    as well as EC. These sensors were not specifically created to be integrated in
    an Arduino measuring system, but we developed our own code written in the open
    source Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software and uploaded
    it to the board to be able to work with it. Table 2. Popular wireless nodes used
    in the agriculture domain. The low-cost DHT11/DHT22 sensors (Adafruit Industries,
    New York, NY, USA), which provide temperature and relative humidity readings,
    as well as light-dependent resistance (LDR), are the most commonly used sensors
    for smart irrigation monitoring [4]. Just as we did to test low-cost soil sensors,
    we tested these sensors for a year in real conditions and they worked well, and
    since IoT irrigation systems generally do not need the highest level of accuracy,
    we decided to use them for our work. 3.1.2. LoRa Technology LoRa, whose meaning
    is “long range”, is a long-range communications system promoted by the LoRa Alliance
    [36]. This system is aimed to be used in devices where energy consumption is of
    the utmost importance. LoRa can commonly refer to two distinct layers [20]: 1.
    A physical (PHY) layer, the so-called LoRa, that uses the radio modulation technique
    chirp spread spectrum (CSS). 2. A medium access protocol (MAC) layer in which
    LoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and the specific access network architecture.
    The LoRa modulation physical layer (Semtech Camarillo, CA, USA) allows a wide
    range at low power. We used the RN2483 transceiver module for Lora Class A, which
    operates in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band of 868
    MHz. The payload of each transmission can vary from 2 to 255 octets and the data
    rate can reach 50 Kbps [1]. LoRaWAN provides a MAC mechanism, which allows many
    end-devices (end-nodes) to communicate with a single gateway using LoRa modulation.
    A typical LoRa network shows a star-of-stars topology, which includes three different
    types of devices—the end-devices, the LoRaWAN gateways, and the network service
    [20,32]. In the basic architecture of a LoRaWAN network (Figure 1), the end-nodes
    communicate with the corresponding gateway using LoRa with a LoRaWAN link, and
    the gateways send LoRaWAN frames to a network server via a broadband link (i.e.,
    Ethernet or GPRS) [20]. Figure 1. Photograph of the wireless sensor node. 3.1.3.
    Sensor Node The node is the device in charge of collecting the necessary data
    in the field to later transmit to the gateway. Its two main characteristics must
    be low consumption and being able to establish communication at the greatest possible
    distance. Arduino boards (Smart Projects Srl, Scarmegno, Italy), such as Arduino
    UNO and Arduino Mega, are the most utilized nodes for the implementation of irrigation
    systems, and the most utilized controller is the ATmega328 (Atmel, San José, CA,
    USA) [4]. The selection of the best node for an IoT irrigation system depends
    on the necessities and the characteristics. We opted for developing our own design
    for the nodes, with the aim of addressing our own particular requirements of low
    power consumption and autonomy. Our end-node includes a processor fully compatible
    with Arduino IDE. Moteino (LowPowerLab, LLC, Michigan, MI, USA) is ideal for IoT
    applications because of its very small size (1.3 × 0.9 inch). The moteino used
    is a versatile low-cost and low-power Arduino based on the Atmel ATMega328P microcontroller.
    Moteino gives years of run time at a low transmission rate, with a 2000–2600 mAh
    battery. During sleep mode the radio power consumption is about 0.1 uA; during
    receive mode around 15mA; and in transmit mode the power consumption is up to
    130 mA. On the other hand, to establish LoRa communication with the gateway, the
    node has the RN2483 chip. This chip was also optimized to obtain the lowest possible
    consumption, in addition to being certified by the LoRa alliance. As small farmers
    cannot afford commercial solutions, we designed a shield for implementing the
    low-cost IoT irrigation system. This system can integrate numerous sensors that
    measure a large number of agricultural parameters, both soil and atmospheric (See
    Figure 1). A lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery with a nominal voltage of 3.7
    V and a capacity of 2000 mAh, equipped with a protection circuit that prevents
    overcharging as well as deep discharging, was used to power the node. As an alternative,
    Li-Ion batteries with 3.7 V nominal voltage and a capacity of 2600 mAh can also
    be used, obtaining greater autonomy. LiPo batteries were chosen as they can achieve
    a high load density with a very small weight and size. Additionally, with the
    implementation of a small solar panel and the TP4056 module, the battery could
    be recharged continuously, increasing the device´s autonomy and providing the
    discharge effect. In order to guarantee correct communication, the node was equipped
    with an omnidirectional antenna with SubMiniature version A (SMA) connector with
    an operating frequency of 868 MHz. Finally, all of the components were placed
    in a polyester enclosure (IP66) with a silicone lid seal, in which all of the
    necessary holes were drilled to mount the connections of the antenna and the sensors.
    To connect the (external) sensors to the (internal) electronics, we used cable
    glands (IP68) (Bopla Gehäuse Systeme GmbH, Bünde, Germany) for the BoXmote placed
    in the field test. In the following image (Figure 2), the completely assembled
    node (end-device for the lab test) is shown. Figure 2. Node sensor (end-device
    for the lab test). 3.1.4. Gateway The Gateway is the element in charge of receiving
    the information from the nodes and taking it to the network. It consists of a
    microprocessor, a concentrator, and an antenna. First, the antenna receives the
    information sent by the node and communicates it to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
    (Sony, Pencoed, Wales) microprocessor through the IC880a concentrator, which includes
    a Semtech SX1301 chip. The base-station placements were at the edge of the rooftop
    on a building in the University of Huelva for the laboratory test, and on the
    rooftop of a cooperative for the field test. The base-stations employed in our
    experiments were ISM-868MHz outdoor omnidirectional antennas (SIRIO GP 868 C and
    GP901C models). Then, the Raspberry Pi is responsible for processing all of the
    information necessary to upload the information to the network through the previously
    installed software. In this work, we estimated the consumption in a rural scenario
    using fixed positions from the end-device to the gateway, not under mobility conditions
    [32]. 3.2. Software Description Since the Moteino driver is fully compatible with
    Arduino, it was programmed using the Arduino IDE software with the C++ programming
    language. The software operation of the node is shown in the flow diagram (Figure
    3). When the device is activated, the different outputs and inputs of the processor
    are configured. Next, the RN2483 chip is initialized, through which the information
    is later transmitted. Then, the necessary data are collected from the different
    sensors that are connected to the node at that moment. Since the sensors deliver
    a specific voltage depending on the physical parameter we wish to measure, it
    is necessary to transform this reading into specific physical units. To this end,
    data processing is carried out following the guidelines set by the manufacturers.
    To save battery, only the necessary data are processed (fog computing). The rest
    is processed in the cloud. Once the desired data are obtained, these are sent
    through the RN2483 module to the nearest gateway. Figure 3. Flow chart of the
    node sensors. After having sent the information, the LoRa module enters a “sleep”
    mode, through which it is possible to lower its consumption drastically. Then,
    the same is done with the Moteino microcontroller. In this way, the device has
    minimum consumption during the time between measurements, preserving the battery
    life well. The time between measurements must be programmed to extend the battery
    life, but also, in turn, to have sufficient precision to quickly detect changes
    in soil moisture or weather conditions, and it is not necessary to monitor the
    parameters in real-time [4]. In our experience, for the cultivation of berries
    in hydroponics, taking measurements every 30 min is sufficient. In irrigated systems
    with trees, they tend to be taken with less frequency, as well as in outdoor irrigated
    crops too. Thus, we used the most extreme case. 4. Results As already mentioned,
    one of the main characteristics that an IoT device must have is low consumption.
    Specifically, in the agriculture sector, it is essential to design a very low
    consumption device with which a great autonomy is achieved [37]. In this way,
    the farmer does not have to worry about the maintenance of the device during the
    months of maximum work, being able to devote his time to other tasks. Given the
    importance of a high autonomy of the device in agriculture, in this study we focused
    on quantifying the consumption of our BoXmote, performing a consumption test in
    the laboratory. Then, from the data obtained in the said test, the life of the
    battery in a real crop was estimated. Finally, a comparison of the results obtained
    with other existing devices was made. For the experiments, we followed the methodology
    used in [1,6,13,38]. The node used to perform the experiment consisted of a Moteino
    microcontroller and a LoRa module with the RN2483 chip. To measure volumetric
    water content, soil temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity data, it was
    decided to use ECHOH2O 5TE and ECHOH2O 10HS sensors, which are widely used in
    agriculture. As regards the battery, a lithium battery with a nominal voltage
    of 3.7 V and a capacity of 2000 mAh was available. To perform the experiment,
    the node was configured to take measurements every 93 s. It was decided to perform
    the test with such a short interval between measurements in order to decrease
    the total duration of the experiment. In order to save the battery as much as
    possible in the intervals in which the node is not working, the different components
    go to sleep mode, drastically lowering the consumption and preserving even more
    the battery charge. The node was located in the laboratory at a temperature of
    approximately 20 °C with the meter sensors in the air, and at an approximate distance
    between the node and the Gateway of 600 m. In order to correctly evaluate the
    consumption of the device, its process was divided into three states: Active mode:
    in this mode, the node configures the microcontroller and initializes the RN2483
    chip. Once these actions have been carried out, it proceeds to read the data provided
    by the sensors and performs the subsequent processing of the information. Send
    mode: this mode of operation is the one that consumes the most energy, since it
    is the moment in which the information is sent to the nearest gateway. “Sleep”
    mode: Unlike in the previous case, this mode saves the maximum battery charge
    as it is not necessary to take or transmit measurements. To do this, both the
    microcontroller and the RN2483 chip “fall asleep.” Figure 4 shows the BoXmote
    with which the battery consumption test was carried out. As previously mentioned,
    the 5TE and 10HS sensors were incorporated, since they are currently the most
    widely used in agriculture. Figure 4. Node with ECH2O soil moisture sensors. 4.1.
    Experimental Laboratory Setup In the first experiment, real measurements of consumption
    were taken in the different modes of operation, as well as the time that each
    one remains active. We used a Digital Multimeter JHS MY-64 [39] to realize the
    current measurement. To ascertain the state of the end-device, we added a light-emitting
    diode (LED, sleep mode indicator) to monitor it. The consumption shown takes all
    the parts of the node (antenna, all sensors, processing, etc.) into consideration.
    The measurements were performed by averaging. The statistical procedure of one
    sample t-test was used to determine if the sample of observations could have been
    generated by a process with the experimental average value. The results obtained
    are summarized in the table below. In Table 3, we can see how the node spends
    most of the time in \"sleep,\" mode with a consumption of 0.036 mA. This consumption
    increases up to 9.4 mA while the microcontroller is in active mode, acquiring
    data through the sensors. Finally, while the information is sent through the LoRa
    module, the consumption is 22 mA for approximately one second. Table 3. Average
    power consumption (mA) for the different modes. From the data shown in Table 3,
    we can calculate the average device consumption for this time interval between
    data collection as follows: 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 9.4 mA×4 s+22 mA×1 s+0.036 mA×88 s 93
    s =0.674 mA Once the average consumption of the node is obtained, and knowing
    the capacity of the battery, we can calculate its theoretical duration: 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛=
    2000 mAh 0.674 mA =2967 h=123 days As will be seen later, this theoretical duration
    is only useful for performing a first estimate. Normally, the actual duration
    of the battery is well below the theoretically calculated value. The second test
    had as its objectives obtaining the discharge curve of the battery and its real
    duration. Thus, measurements of the voltage supplied by the battery were taken
    periodically during the operation of the device. In this way, we were able to
    estimate its state of charge, as well as the time for which the device can operate
    without needing maintenance or battery change. Next, the voltage values measured
    against the number of days that it was in operation were plotted on a graph. As
    can be seen in Figure 5, the voltage supplied by the battery starts at 4.1 V and
    decreases rapidly during the first few days. Meanwhile, as we get closer to the
    nominal voltage of the battery (3.7 V), the curve decreases more slowly toward
    this value. Once the voltage drops below the nominal value of the battery, it
    drops drastically. This behavior is typical of lithium batteries, as is the case
    here. Figure 5. Node battery voltage. During the experiment, the node ran for
    a total of 72 days, during which it took measurements every 93 s. In this time
    period, more than 49,000 measurements were taken. If we compare the battery life
    obtained in the real experiment with the theoretically calculated one, we can
    verify that its real life is approximately 60% of the theoretical one. These data
    may vary depending on the characteristics or battery and environmental conditions.
    For example, in [1], a value of 70% is taken to estimate the duration of the battery.
    In contrast, [6,13,38] did not use any correction factor to calculate battery
    life. 4.2. Field Test The farm selected as a case study is a berry farm located
    in Huelva (Andalusia, Spain), one of the most important berry producing areas
    in Europe and where 100% of the crop is irrigated under plastic (Figure 6). In
    climatic terms, this is a semi-arid zone with an annual rainfall of approximately
    630 mm. The validation tests were carried out on a blueberry crop that covers
    two plots of approximately 4 hectares each. Figure 6. Experimental site for the
    field test. The devices were installed in this crop for 6 months (January–June,
    2018) (Figure 7). Figure 8 shows the snapshots of real data from the sensors.
    Figure 7. Installed device taking measurements every 30 min. Figure 8. User interface
    of the application web. Because the parameters that are be measured in the crop
    do not show large variations in short time intervals, it was decided that if measurements
    are taken every 30 min, a correct balance between battery life and adequate precision
    would be obtained, allowing us to evaluate the state of the crop in real time.
    Thus, if we use the data previously measured in the different operating modes,
    we can calculate the average of the device for a time between measures of 30 min
    in the following way: 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 9.4 mA×4 s+22 mA×1 s+0.036 mA×1795 s 1800 s
    =0.069 mA Taking into account the calculations performed previously, and assuming
    that the actual duration is 60% of the theoretical calculation, the estimated
    duration of the battery for a time between data collection of 30 min would be
    the following: 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 2000 mAh×0.6 0.069 mA =17391 h=724 days With this autonomy,
    the end-device would be able to operate for two years without the need for battery
    change or any maintenance. 5. Discussion Estimating the energy efficiency for
    an IoT device is very difficult when there are several communication technologies,
    electronic components, and measuring devices, as well as a multitude of environmental
    conditions and particular situations for each crop and its needs. These limitations
    are commented upon in some works [40]. It was not the objective of this work to
    modify hardware and software parameters to reduce consumption, but to decide on
    the most appropriate technology and components that would allow us to develop
    an end-device with low consumption. We also decided on the best intervals for
    data collection and sending, and the microcontroller was programmed to achieve
    minimal consumption. Finally, we compared the results with other similar works
    in the field of smart irrigation. The results achieved in this study improve upon
    the recently published ones. For instance, [13] present a node formed by the Msp430F1611
    Texas Instruments processor and wireless communication at 2.4 Ghz with a gateway.
    To measure the different terrain parameters, they used two Hydra Probe II sensors.
    The measurements were taken every 30 min, obtaining an average consumption of
    0.5035 mA. The calculated autonomy was 223 days, achieved by installing a 2700
    mAh battery. In [1], a device using LoRa communication was developed to measure
    temperature and humidity parameters and soil data. With a time between measures
    of 60 min, the average consumption of the device was 0.4026 mA, achieving a range
    of 73 days for a 2400 mAh battery. Unlike the previous case, the author corrected
    the duration of the battery by the factor 0.75, thus achieving a result closer
    to reality. The GAIA2 system [5] communicates via radio at 2.4 GHz with a gateway.
    In laboratory tests, with a node and a humidity and temperature sensor SHT71,
    an average consumption of 0.089 mA was obtained. On the other hand, a real field
    experiment was carried out in which two MPS-2 sensors were used, capable of measuring
    the water potential and soil temperature, obtaining a total battery life of 56
    days. Finally, the LoRa irrigation system proposed by [19], which uses a lithium
    battery with 4800 mAh, consumes, in their different operative modes, 2.0987 mA
    on average, equating to a battery life of 57 days under the same conditions as
    our experiment. We presented a system capable of an average consumption of 0.069
    mA, thus providing a battery life of up to 724 days. If we compare these results
    with those obtained in previous articles, we can see that consumption has been
    reduced significantly, along with a significant increase in battery life. The
    following Table 4 shows a comparison of the results obtained in other studies.
    Table 4. Comparison of data obtained with other methods. If we compare the results
    obtained in our study with those obtained by [13], we can see that both devices
    take measurements every 30 min and have two sensors that measure various parameters
    of the soil. However, the average consumption obtained by our device is a reduction
    of 86% compared to the consumption of the other device. Regarding the life of
    the battery, our device is capable of increasing the life of the battery by more
    than 300% compared to the work in [13]. Comparing the results of our BoXmote with
    those obtained by [1], we can see that our average consumption is 82% less than
    that of their device. Bearing in mind that in this case the time between measurements
    is 60 min, this would mean that average consumption would be even higher if the
    time were reduced to 30 min. Regarding the life of the battery, the BoXmote has
    an autonomy 990% greater than the device presented by [1]. Finally, if we compare
    the results of our BoXmote with [5], we can see that both devices have two soil
    sensors and a time between measurements of 30 min. In this case, the life of the
    battery is increased by 1292%, which represents a significant improvement over
    the solution proposed by [5]. As can be seen, a significant increase in battery
    life was obtained in terms of wireless sensor networks. In this way, one of the
    great problems that these devices present during their operation is solved. Another
    advantage that our system has over other similar ones that are currently marketed
    is its low cost. The BoXmote has a cost of 70.00€ compared to the usual cost of
    end-devices around 350.00€. This low cost allows us to distribute a large number
    of nodes for the crop, thus obtaining much more precise information. 6. Conclusions
    Most of the papers related to WSN do not include quantitative results about the
    impact of the WSN’s deployment in the field [41]. In this paper, we presented
    a low-cost system based on LoRa technology capable of taking measurements of the
    parameters most used in precision agriculture, such as humidity and ambient temperature,
    light received by the plant, and soil temperature, soil moisture, and EC. The
    results obtained show better consumption than that of commercial wireless sensors.
    The consumption of the node was measured in its different operating states, and
    the battery discharge curve was obtained, achieving, if measurements were taken
    every 30 min, an approximate battery duration of 724 days. All the consumption
    required by data acquisition and sending to the gateway was taken into consideration.
    In order to increase the battery life and take into account the discharge effect,
    a solar panel could be installed in the node and evaluation performed on how it
    affects the consumption of the battery. Another line of work is related to the
    type of battery installed. In this case, the operation of the node can be compared
    with another type of power, such as alkaline or lithium-ion batteries. We are
    aware that more work is needed on energy consumption, both from a theoretical
    and practical point of view. The analysis of gateway consumption is another interesting
    topic for agriculture, especially in remote areas or developing regions. Finally,
    a more detailed study on the evolution of NB-IoT technologies versus LoRaWAN and
    SigFox should be analyzed. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.D.B.; Methodology,

  description: Wireless sensor network (WSN) bidirectional nodes, including the sensing
    node and the solenoid valve control node, were developed for information collection
    and micro-irrigation monitoring system in a litchi orchard, aimed at improving
    the problem of wireless communication barriers and the micro-irrigation management
    efficiency. The sensing node was composed of an MCU8051, a CC2530 RF chip for
    communication, a RFX2401for amplification. This node is supposed to collect data
    from a DHT22 air temperature and humidity sensor, a GY-30 light intensity sensor
    and a TDR-3 soil moisture sensor. The control node includes an MCU8051, a CC2530
    RF chip for communication, and peripheral drive circuits for adapting the bi-stable
    pulse solenoid valve. The application software and backstage management software
    were written with these two nodes as the hardware platform, based on ZStack agreement.
    The maximum effective bidirectional communication distance of the designed nodes
    reached 1205m in unoccupied regions and 122m in litchi orchards. Within a 30 min
    working cycle, it could be estimated that two 3.7 V battery with a rated capacity
    of 3000 mA•h can power the sensing node for time up to 500d. Test results in litchi
    orchards show that the average packet loss rate is 0.75%. The system was processing
    smoothly with the above nodes for information acquisition and controlling micro-irrigation
    in litchi orchards.

    Efficiency 1. Introduction Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy and,
    in many cases, in the survival of nations, since it provides the basic subsistence
    for the entire population of a country while at the same time it interacts with
    several other industries. Especially in rural areas, inhabitants depend on agriculture
    as it is critical not only for their nutrition but it also constitutes the base
    of all trade. Moreover, the ever increasing world population demands larger amounts
    of food which subsequently presupposes a well-managed and cost-effective agriculture.
    Throughout the world, irrigation is one of the main water consumers. Almost 60
    percent of all the world water, taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and wells,
    is used for the irrigation of. Without irrigation, crops would never have been
    grown in the deserts of California and Israel. Irrigation has been around for
    as long as humans have been cultivating plants. Even though the traditional way
    of pouring water on fields is still a common irrigation method, other more efficient
    and mechanized, methods are also used. One of the more popular mechanized methods
    is the centre-pivot irrigation system, which uses moving spray guns or dripping
    faucet heads on wheeled tubes that pivot around a central source of water. There
    are many irrigation techniques farmers use today, since there is always a need
    to find more efficient ways to use water for irrigation. Producers need to find
    more effective and efficient use of water resources while maintaining high crop
    yields. Some efforts to more efficiently utilize water for crop production are
    examined, Producers has to find more effective and efficient use of water resources
    while maintaining high crop yields. While the producers have to apply water to
    meet the needs of the crop, they must realize that with traditional management
    practices, yields and returns from the irrigated crop will be reduced as compared
    to a fully irrigated crop. Moreover, to properly manage the water for the greatest
    return, producers must have an understanding of how crops respond to water, how
    crop rotations can enhance irrigation management, and how changes in agronomic
    practices can influence the water needs. Water stress during critical times may
    result in low yields. Crops, such as corn, respond with more yields for every
    inch of water that the crop consumes as compared to other crops such as winter
    wheat or soybeans. However, crops, such as corn require more water for development
    or maintenance before any yield is produced. Corn requires approximately 10 in.
    of water to produce the first increment of yield as compared to 4.5 and 7.5 in.
    for wheat and soybeans respectively. The integration of automated procedures in
    agriculture increases the productivity as well as the quality of the products,
    thus fulfilling the ever increasing demand for healthy and inexpensive food around
    the world. However, an efficient automated system has to describe all the main
    processes that are involved in the agriculture chain. Plant cultivation, which
    can be considered as the most critical process, is affected by many factors such
    as the temperature, the humidity and the topography of the surrounding environment.
    Achieving ideal values for these factors and optimizing their consequences depend
    on the type of the crops cultivated. Thus, the design of an efficient irrigation
    system should consider these factors to achieve a successful and high quality
    harvest. For example, the process of grape maturation is affected by the photo-synthesis
    that produces the sugar that is stored in the grapes. In grapes, the balance among
    sugar, acid, pH and potassium is fundamental in determining the quality of the
    produced wine. This balance depends to a large extent on the frequency of the
    irrigation of the cultivated fields. The scientific discipline of Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSNs) has reached a point of maturity that it can provide accurate and
    highly effective services to farmers. Thus, WSNs should monitor the above described
    factors to achieve an improved harvest (Shu-ming et al., 2009). WSNs are able
    to rapidly capture process and transmit critical data in real time. The real-time
    data collected by sensors located in the cultivated fields may be used by experts
    or by automated systems to make decisions, such as which irrigation policy should
    be applied. Additionally, since a WSN does not require the deployment of wires,
    the need for human intervention is minimized. For these reasons, it is expected
    that WSNs will become a low cost yet effective approach for the monitoring of
    fields in the near future. Additionally, WSNs can be combined with a system that
    manages the water applied to each field based on the environmental conditions
    and on the feedback sent by the individual sensors. There are several advantages
    in using WSNs and automated decision systems in agriculture: • Improved estimation
    and planning of field irrigation based on the available water supply. • Minimization
    of the required human resources, time, and effort in the agricultural production.
    • Early detection of possible floods in the field that could be destructive for
    the crops and proper pumping of the water to mitigate such cases. • Better coordination
    between different working groups, i.e. farmers and technical assistants thanks
    to a clear division of responsibilities. • Creation of knowledge gathered from
    the deployed sensor networks for future applications in the agriculture domain.
    All the irrigation models that have been proposed so far do not use an agriculture
    model to calculate the quantity of water for irrigation. Moreover, they use WSNs
    to collect data from the area without considering the routing of data from the
    sensors to the base station, a technique that could provide improved energy efficiency.
    In this paper, we propose a system that takes into consideration the historical
    data and the change of the climate values to calculate the quantity of water that
    is needed for irrigation. In case that the change of the collected values is above
    a threshold more frequent data collection is proposed to be performed to minimize
    the necessary quantity of water. On the other hand, in case that the change of
    the values is below a preset threshold then the time interval to collect the data
    can increase to save sensor energy, leading to a prolonged sensor lifetime. In
    this paper an integrated architecture, based on the use of WSNs, for automated
    irrigation management is proposed that aims to achieve effective and prompt irrigation
    of parcels with great energy efficiency due to the utilization of a novel routing
    protocol. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work is
    presented. Section 3, describes the structure of the proposed system. Section
    4, presents the performance evaluation. In Section 5, the paper is concluded and
    areas of future work are presented. 2. Related work The work in the area of WSNs
    in agriculture is composed of two parts. The first part deals with the routing
    protocol used to minimize the energy consumption in WSNs, while the second part
    addresses the development of irrigation systems in agriculture that manage the
    water used for irrigation. 2.1. Energy efficient routing algorithms in WSNs There
    exist several proposals to develop protocols that consider the energy efficiency
    of sensors in their routing activities. In hierarchical networks, nodes are organized
    in clusters in which a node plays the role of a cluster head. The cluster head
    is responsible for coordinating activities within the cluster and for forwarding
    information between clusters. Clustering has the potential to reduce energy consumption
    and to extend the lifetime of the network, by achieving a high delivery ratio
    in a scalable manner. In agriculture, the network used may be rather large since
    it needs to cover the entire cultivated fields. Therefore, the hierarchical protocols
    may be suitable and beneficial for precision agriculture. In (Heinzelman et al.,
    2000) LEACH, a hierarchical protocol in which most nodes transmit to cluster heads,
    is presented. The operation of LEACH consists of two phases: • The Setup Phase.
    In the setup phase, the clusters are organized and the cluster heads are selected.
    Each node determines whether it will become a cluster head in this round by using
    a stochastic algorithm at each round. If a node becomes a cluster head once, it
    cannot become cluster head again after P rounds, where P is the desired percentage
    of cluster heads. • The Steady State Phase. In the steady state phase, the data
    is sent to the base station. The duration of the steady state phase is longer
    than the duration of the setup phase in order to minimize overhead. LEACH is a
    wireless distributed protocol that helps WSNs to use less energy. However, LEACH
    uses single-hop routing where each node can transmit directly to the cluster-head
    and the sink. Therefore, it is not recommended for networks that are deployed
    in large regions. PEGASIS is an energy efficient protocol (Lindsey and Raghavendra,
    2002) using a chain-based protocol and providing an improvement over LEACH. In
    PEGASIS each node communicates only with a nearby neighbour in order to send and
    receive data. It also takes turns (cluster head transmit after collecting data
    from all the nodes) transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount
    of energy spent per round. The nodes are organized in such a way as to form a
    chain, which can either be accomplished by the sensor nodes themselves, using
    a greedy algorithm starting from a certain node, or the Base Station (BS) can
    compute this chain and broadcast it to all the sensor nodes. TEEN is a hierarchical
    protocol designed for sudden changes in the sensed attributes, such as sudden
    drops in temperature due to frost (Manjeshwar and Agrawal, 2009). Responsiveness
    is an important attribute of time-critical applications, in which the network
    is operated in a reactive mode. The sensor network architecture in TEEN is based
    on a hierarchical grouping where closer nodes form clusters and this process goes
    to a higher level until the sink is reached. Even though TEEN works well in conditions
    like sudden changes in the sensed attributes, in large area networks and when
    the number of layers in the hierarchy is small, TEEN tends to consume a lot of
    energy, because of long distance transmissions. Moreover, when the number of layers
    increases, the transmissions become shorter and the overhead in the setup phase
    as well as in the operation becomes dominant. In (Lotf et al., 2008), a routing
    protocol for self-configuration and hierarchal routing, named ELCH, is presented.
    In this protocol, the sensors vote for their neighbours to elect suitable cluster
    heads. It combines the cluster architecture with multi-hop routing for the reduction
    of the total transmission energy. The above approaches take into consideration
    the energy consumption of the sensors in order to extend the lifetime of the network.
    However, since they are general purpose networks they do not take into account
    the principles, characteristics and requirements of the specific application that
    sensor networks are used for. All the aforementioned protocols try to minimize
    the energy consumption. However, they differ on the algorithm used. Most of these
    algorithms are based on the selection of the node having the higher residual energy
    in every cluster as the cluster head for the next round. Although, this consideration
    seems to be quite rational, there are many cases where its effectiveness is limited.
    For instance, in the cases where the node having the higher energy residues is
    positioned close to the border line of its cluster, significant amounts of energy
    are spent by the cluster nodes in order to transmit to their cluster head. 2.2.
    Automated irrigation in agriculture WSNs have been used for the automated irrigation
    of parcels (Rehman et al., 2011). These applications address the scarcity of water
    problem and the need of proper water management. This is achieved by providing
    water only to places where it is needed, while at the same time controlling the
    quantity of the consumed water. Various models, systems and methodologies for
    the irrigation of parcels have been developed. In (Diaz et al., 2011) a methodology
    to guide the development of applications for the agricultural domain based on
    WSNs is presented. This methodology divides the development of applications in
    agriculture in steps that gets an input, produces an output, and describes the
    procedures to be undertaken by a specific group of users. Specifically, the purpose
    of this methodology is to describe the life cycle of applications by identifying
    the responsibilities of the individual users. In (Stone et al., 1985), a computer-based
    monitoring system for continuous measurements of soil water potential is proposed
    and analyzed. This model measures the quantity of water during a period. The results
    are used to decide the quantity of water to be used for irrigation. Indirect estimates
    using direct measurements of the soil moisture are discussed in Zazueta and Smajstrla
    (1992). In this model the measurements of time in samples are used to estimate
    the quantity of water that is required for irrigation. Moreover, in Meron et al.
    (1995) a control system for apple tree irrigation management using densitometers
    is presented. In this model the water required for irrigation is measured using
    a soil sensor-actuated automatic irrigation system. Sensor actuation thresholds
    are optimized for high fruit yield and quality. In (Testezlaf et al., 1997) an
    automated irrigation control system for the management of greenhouse container
    plants is evaluated. The system consisted of soil moisture sensors, a hardware
    input/output interface, a computer with the relevant software and actuators. An
    evaluation of the control system is performed considering a greenhouse. The results
    show that the control system is reliable in applying water responding to the plant
    demands. Reliable measurements of the substrate water tension using sensors presented
    a major difficulty. In (Kim and Evans, 2009) the design of decision support software
    and its integration with an in-field WSN to implement site-specific sprinkler
    irrigation control via Bluetooth wireless communications is described. This model
    consists of machine conversion, localization, and mission planning. The first
    requirement is to convert a self-propelled irrigation machine from a conventional
    mechanical and hydraulic system to an electronically controllable system for individual
    sprinkler head control. Then, the geographic location of the irrigation machine
    is continuously monitored by a self-positioning system. Once the machine is controllable
    and accessible, mission planning decide the time to irrigate that each sprinkler
    head should apply at each location. In (Sudha et al., 2011), a TDMA-based medium
    access control (MAC) protocol is used to collect environmental data such as soil
    moisture and temperature of an irrigation system. The sensors are in the idle
    state and change to the active state to measure the temperature and the moisture
    level of the soil. The base station sends requests to nodes to collect the temperature
    and the moisture level of a particular area. A node responds to this request by
    sending back the present value of the moisture and the temperature of that region.
    The other nodes remain in the idle state. After sending the required data the
    node goes back to the idle state. This process is repeated for all the nodes.
    In using a direct communication method each sensor node sends its data directly
    to the base station. In addition to the above, there also exist some recent attempts
    to develop remote sensing and control systems for irrigation management using
    WSNs. In (Kim et al., 2008), a remote sensing and control of an irrigation system
    using a distributed WSN is described. The field conditions are monitored by sensor
    stations distributed across the field based on a soil property map, and they are
    periodically sampled and wirelessly transmitted to a base station. In (Xiaohong
    et al., 2009), a water-saving irrigation system based on fuzzy control technology
    and WSN is described. The node takes the soil moisture error and error change
    rate as its input and obtains the water demand amount of the crops under certain
    soil moisture conditions. In (Dubey et al.., 2011), a WSN based remote irrigation
    control system and automation using dual tone multi frequency (DTMF) code is described.
    The system uses signalling to control the water flow for sectored, sprinkler or
    drip section irrigation. In (Zhang et al., 2011), a calibration method for detecting
    soil water content based on information sharing is described. The system is an
    efficacious approach to determine the balance between the calibration accuracy
    of moisture sensor and the investment of agricultural production. All these attempts
    propose systems that are able to provide irrigation services to parcels without
    considering in depth the efficient management of the water used. 3. Overview of
    the proposed system The proposed system considers climate values, such as humidity,
    temperature and wind to calculate the quantity of water that is needed for proper
    irrigation. Also, when evaluating the climate parameters it considers past states
    and compares them to the current states to make efficient decisions. For example,
    if the value of the temperature in the previous day has decreased then less water
    is required. Based on the collected historical values the quantity required might
    be larger. Thus, water can be conserved in case of a high rate of change of these
    environmental values. The total complexity of the model is 2n + n, where n is
    the number of nodes in the cluster. The proposed automated irrigation management
    system, as mentioned above, aims at the automatic irrigation of parcels with possibly
    non-uniform composition like the one shown in Fig. 1, which comprises of five
    neighbouring parcels having different crops. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Neighbouring parcels hosting different kinds of crops. The proposed automated
    irrigation management system comprises of two subsystems. The first subsystem
    concerns the WSN which collects the data from the cultivated fields, as shown
    in Fig. 2a. The second subsystem involves the decision making system, the flow
    chart of which is depicted in Fig. 2b. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    2. (a) The proposed WSN architecture, (b) the flow chart of the proposed decision
    making system. The proposed WSN structure includes a set of sensors that monitor
    the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity, the temperature and the
    speed of air, and the duration of sunshine hours per day. The individual sensors
    are placed at appropriate locations in the parcels. The collected information
    is transmitted to a base station. More specifically, the sensors at the field
    scan the weather conditions periodically (for example every 10 s). The collected
    data are sent via wireless (for example, a ZigBee radio transmitter) to the base
    computer at the receiver. The sensors are self-powered by a battery. A set of
    sensors is used to measure air humidity and temperature. Also humidity sensors
    are used to measure soil moisture content and wind speed. Moreover, specialized
    sensors are used to measure the flooding water levels. The main application is
    based on the collected inputs it receives from the sensors. It then, acts based
    on the configuration that is applied to the system. This configuration is based
    on the requirements for the place that needs to be monitored. This is related
    to the type of crops that are planted in the field (corn, potatoes, etc.), the
    chemical soil components (i.e. sodium content) and the season of the year (i.e.
    winter, summer etc). This system can be used by growers, who want to monitor the
    status of soil moisture content and watch on their computer monitor the conditions
    at various locations, follow the weather information and monitor in detail the
    irrigation operation. During the irrigation, they may also want to see the current
    location of irrigation. For example, if a rain shower passes over the field, the
    software should be able to automatically adjust the amount of water being applied.
    In the proposed system, the routing protocol that is used to send traffic from
    the information sources to the destination assumes the coexistence of a base station
    and, without loss of generality, of a set of homogeneous sensor nodes. These nodes
    are randomly distributed within a delimited area of interest. The base station
    is located at a long distance away from the sensor field. Both the base station
    and the set of sensor nodes are considered stationary. The base station is able
    to transmit with high enough power to all the network nodes, due to its unlimited
    power supply. Moreover, the sensors are hierarchically organized into clusters.
    3.1. The irrigation and decision making system In agriculture, the efficient management
    of water should be considered. Therefore, the water required for irrigation has
    to be minimized. The proposed system based on the information sent from the sensors
    estimate the quantity of water needed. The sensors are used to send to the base
    station the humidity and the temperature of the soil, the humidity, the temperature
    and the speed of the air, and the duration of sunshine per day. The proposed system
    based on these values calculates the water quantity for irrigation. Moreover,
    to develop a more accurate system the historical data regarding the quantity of
    irrigation used in previous period are considered to adjust the quantity of water
    that is needed for irrigation. A comparison between current and past states is
    necessary to arrive at optimum decisions. The main parameters that affect the
    surface runoff are the following: the climate (rainfall intensity, moisture content,
    wind, evaporation) and the type of vegetation. An important factor for the implementation
    of an irrigation system is the knowledge of the soil moisture at the beginning
    of the growing season, which depends mainly on the weather conditions during the
    preceding winter. Additionally, the knowledge of the water quantity stored in
    underground aquifers, which is available for plants through the capillary rise,
    is critical. In order to reach a decision for the irrigation needs of a particular
    parcel, it is necessary to add up the useful water from the rain (Pe), the change
    in the stored moisture (SM) in the soil root zone at the beginning of the germination
    period, the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and the water that by capillary elevation
    reaches the crop rooting zone from the ground (GW) – all these are measured in
    kg/m2 day. If the soil is cohesive, the water can easily rise above the ground
    level, but the rate of capillary rise is slow. On the contrary, if the soil is
    light, then the height of the capillary rise is limited, but the pace of growth
    is fast. If these rates are sufficient to meet the water needs of the plant there
    is a steady development of the crop and the following holds: (1) If these water
    sources cannot meet the water needs of the crops for normal growth, the water
    balance is in deficit. To achieve a smooth development and a normal yield, the
    crops should be provided with a quantity of water (IRn) equal to this deficit:
    (2) where ETc is expressed as follows: (3) kc is the crop coefficient and ETo
    is the reference evapotranspiration in kg/m2 day that is expressed as follows:
    (4) where Ra is the theoretical solar radiation expressed as equivalent depth
    of evaporated water in mm d−1, Tmean is the mean air temperature in °C and TD
    is the difference between maximum and minimum air temperature in °C. Pe is presented
    as follows: (5) where Pt is the total precipitation in kg/m2 day and D is the
    decline allowed in the soil moisture content until the next irrigation dose is
    applied. The function f(D) is an adaptation factor that equals 1 when D = 75 kg/m2
    day, whilst for every other value of D f(D) is expressed as follows: (6) The SM
    contribution is significant in a water balance model for net crop requirements.
    The soil moisture is controlled by a combination of climate properties, land surface
    model characteristics and land–atmosphere interaction. GW contributes to the partial
    coverage of net the crop water requirements, through capillary elevation. The
    extent of the capillary elevation depends on the soil characteristics and the
    distance to the water table. In this paper, the main focus is on the use of a
    WSN to collect data using sensors and to send the data to a database. Then the
    sensed data can be used by a system for the automated irrigation of the fields.
    Therefore, in this paper Pe, SM, GW are not further analyzed. It is assumed that
    their values are provided by appropriate tensiometer sensors. Therefore, Pe, SM,
    GW are considered to sum up to a value k as presented in the following: (7) In
    this framework we consider k to be equal to the total amount of rain in this area
    expressed in kg/m2 day. Nevertheless, the value of the evapotranspiration (ETc)
    that is used to describe the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the
    land surface to the atmosphere is calculated based on information provided by
    sensors located in the fields. Evaporation is related to the amount of water that
    is sent to the air from sources such as soil, canopy interception and waterbodies.
    Transpiration is the amount of water in a plant and the subsequent loss of water
    as vapor through the stomata in its leaves. The rate of evapotranspiration depends
    on climatic factors (i.e. on temperature, sunlight, wind speed, and humidity).
    Therefore, an increase in the temperature in the wind speed or in the amount of
    sunlight results to a corresponding increase of evapotranspiration. On the other
    hand, humidity has the opposite effect. The models used in the literature to estimate
    the water quantity are categorized in empirical, computational and combinational.
    The empirical relationships are based on air temperature (Hargreaves, 1974, Thornthwaite
    and Hare, 1965). They only require as input the value of the air temperature and
    calculate the water without using other parameters, such as moisture or wind speed.
    Moreover, they are based on the mean values of temperature and may provide limited
    results if the period of use is less than a month. The computational models are
    based on the solar radiation (Caprio, 1974, Idso et al., 1977). They use the value
    of the radiation during the day to estimate the water without considering other
    parameters as moisture or temperature. They may have limited performance if the
    parcels are on a hill. The computational models may provide more accurate results
    as they consider all the environmental parameters to estimate the water for irrigation.
    In (Monteith, 1965), a combination model for the water based on parameters as
    temperature, moisture and wind speed is proposed. This model is general and does
    not consider the kind of crops in the estimation process of the required water.
    In (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977), a model that is an improvement of the model in
    Monteith (1965) and it is based on the kind of crops is proposed. However, both
    models offer high complexity and are difficult to use in case of frequent changes
    on the parameters. Therefore, in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) a model that is based
    on the previously proposed models but is more flexible due to its low complexity
    is proposed. This model does not use the resistance of the surface to estimate
    the water. In this paper, the model proposed in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) for
    the calculation of evapotranspiration is used. The evapotranspiration according
    to this model is calculated as follows: (8) where αe is a fixed value and is considered
    to be equal to 1.3. Δ symbolizes the curve slope of the vapor saturation and is
    calculated based on the information from sensors on the air temperature and the
    saturation pressure of water as follows: (9) where T is the air temperature and
    es is the soil temperature expressed as follows: (10) γ represents the air cool
    factor that depends on the air speed at 2 m height and it is calculated by the
    sensor as follows: (11) where u2 is the air speed at 2 m height. Rn expresses
    the total net radiation energy that depends on microwave radiation that is sent
    from the sensor. (12) where Sn is the algebraic sum of the incoming minus the
    reflected microwave radiation and Ln is the net microware radiation. Both these
    values are based on the soil and air humidity values reported by the sensors.
    The parcels are categorized based on the geographical, topological and climate
    information as well as on the type of crops cultivated in them. In Fig. 1, we
    see an example where five different parcels with different crops are monitored.
    The parcels are then divided into clusters and the sensors are allocated in each
    cluster. For example, parcel A can be divided into two clusters. Then, based on
    the above mentioned characteristics of each cluster and on the real time data
    collected by the sensors the quantity of the water needed (QWi) at cluster i is
    calculated using the following equations: (13) (14) The values of the above equations
    are collected by the sensors that are located in the parcels. The proposed system
    to save water for irrigation makes an adjustment on the quantity of water as calculated
    in (14) based on the information reported by the sensors. The system considers
    the mean value of the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity, the
    temperature and the speed of air, as well as the duration of the sunshine hours
    per day for the specific geographical area in previous periods. Therefore, the
    mean value of the water quantity used in previous periods is calculated as follows:
    (15) where Δ′ symbolizes the curve slope of the vapor saturation and is calculated
    based on the information in previous periods of the air temperature and the saturation
    pressure of the water. γ′ represents the air cool factor that depends on the wind
    speed at 2 m height that is collected in the previous period. Rn′ expresses the
    total net radiation energy that depends on the microwave radiation that is sent
    from previous period. Moreover, the ratio of change on the values during the last
    days is calculated as follows: (16) where Δ″ symbolizes the curve slope of the
    vapor saturation and is calculated based on the information collected during the
    last days regarding the air temperature and the saturation pressure of the water.
    γ″ represents the air cool factor that depends on the wind speed at 2 m height
    during the previous days. Rn″ expresses the total net radiation energy that depends
    on microwave radiation during the previous days. Therefore, the quantity of water
    needed for irrigation (QWrequired) is calculated as follows: (17) If no historical
    values are available, the proposed system can be adjusted to use only the information
    provided by the real time values from sensors. 3.2. Case study It is important
    to consider the mean values of the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity,
    the temperature and the speed of air, and the duration of sunshine hours per day
    for the specific geographical area in previous periods. Therefore, their mean
    values for a specific area during the same month in previous years could provide
    indication on the environmental conditions. These mean values combined with the
    real time values collected by the sensors could provide better results for the
    water quantity required for irrigation. The proposed model is considered as an
    improvement to the one proposed in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) as it estimates
    the water for irrigation based on the previous values collected by sensors. An
    example that proves the efficient management of water by the system is the case
    that for a specific field the mean water required for irrigation based on (14)
    is 10 kg/m2 per day. This quantity of water can be minimized if historical data
    are considered. If historical data are used, then the mean value for irrigation
    could be less than the current measurements. If the value is 5 kg/m2 the water
    that will be used for irrigation will be less than the current amount (using (14))
    and it can be calculated as follows: (18) Therefore, there is no need for irrigation
    when historical data are used but there is a need to pump out water. Thus, water
    can be managed more efficiently. Moreover, in case that the mean ratio of change
    of the water required for irrigation the previous month is −1 and the current
    water required for irrigation is 10 kg/m2 then less water is required for irrigation
    (see Table 1, Table 2). Table 1. The detailed values of the quantity of water

    1 25 0.5 43 57 41 25 4. Performance evaluation of the proposed model In this section,
    the proposed model is evaluated using ECHERP, a protocol that pursues energy conservation
    (Nikolidakis et al., 2013). ECHERP is a scheme that is based on the appropriate
    selection of nodes as cluster heads. It models the network and the energy spent
    to transmit data from sensors to base station, as a linear system. Then, using
    the Gaussian elimination algorithm it selects the cluster heads of the network.
    Its main characteristic is that it elects as cluster head the node that minimizes
    the total energy consumption on the cluster. Based on the energy level and location
    information that the nodes send, each node sets up a neighbour information table
    and sends this table along with its corresponding information to its neighbours.
    This information is sent to the BS that runs a Gaussian elimination algorithm
    to compute the number of rounds at which every node can be a cluster head, trying
    to maximize the network lifetime. The BS broadcasts the unique IDs of the newly
    selected cluster heads and their cluster members and the nodes use this information
    to enter a cluster. The lower level cluster head aggregates the data and then
    transmits the compressed data to the upper lever cluster heads until the data
    reaches the base station. The sensor nodes placed in a WSN have the responsibility
    of the event detection, data processing and transmission of data. The energy spent
    on these actions has to be minimized as the nodes are battery equipped and thus
    have limited energy. The notation of rounds is used to describe the successful
    send of data from sensors to the BS. Therefore, one round is the one-time data
    send from all sensors to the BS. The energy ETx(k,d) that a node dissipates for
    the radio transmission of a message of k bits over a distance d is due to running
    both the transmitter circuitry ETx-elec(k) and the transmitter amplifier ETx-amp(k,d)
    and is given by the following: (21) where Eelec is the transmitter circuitry dissipation
    per bit, which is supposed to be equal to the corresponding receiver circuitry
    dissipation per bit and εamp is the transmit amplifier dissipation per bit per
    square meter. Moreover, in case that the node distance from the base station is
    d, it is more efficient to split this distance including a few nodes in the middle.
    In case that d = d1 + d2 + d3, then . Thus the ETx(k,d) reaches its minimum value.
    Similarly, the energy ERx(k) dissipated by a node for the reception of a k bit
    message is due to running the receiver circuitry ERx-elec(k) and is given by:
    (22) In order to evaluate the performance of ECHERP, simulations over 50 different
    100 m × 100 m network topologies were performed. The general network architecture
    considered is the following: • A fixed base station is located away from the sensor
    nodes. • The sensor nodes are energy constrained with a uniform initial energy
    allocation. • Each node senses the environment at a fixed rate and always has
    data to send to the base station. • The sensor nodes are immobile. • The network
    is homogeneous and all nodes are equivalent, i.e. they have the same computing
    and communication capacity. • The network is location unaware, i.e. the physical
    location of the nodes is not known in advance. • The transmitter can adjust its
    amplifier power based on the transmission distance. In all the simulation scenarios
    we examined 100 homogeneous nodes with an initial energy of 3 J, randomly scattered
    within a 100 × 100 m2 sensor field. The BS was positioned at point (0,150), so
    it is at least 100 m away from the centre of the field and the packets sent are
    36 bytes. The energy consumption due to communication is calculated using the
    first order energy model (Heinzelman et al., 2000). We assume that each sensor
    node generates one data packet per round to be transmitted to the BS. The sensor
    nodes were grouped into clusters consisting of cluster heads that send data to
    upper level cluster heads to finally reach the BS. Fig. 7 shows the number of
    nodes that remain alive when LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP are applied. More precisely,
    the depletion of all the network nodes in LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP takes place during
    the 800th, 980th and 995th rounds respectively. Download : Download full-size

    which are illustrated in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, concerning these metrics in the case
    of uniform energy distribution. Table 5. Comparison of ECHERP to LEACH and ELCH

    to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a number of simulations using
    different values of time required for a round have been considered. In the simulation
    tests the trade-off between the time of a round and the water required is defined.
    The main objective of this model is to keep the energy consumption of the nodes
    in low level while having more accurate measurements from sensors on the water
    required. The total water required for irrigation is expressed as follows: (23)
    where Total Water represents the quantity of water required based on the irrigation
    model presented in (17). Mean Water represents the average value of the water
    required when different values of time for a round are considered. Moreover, the
    round represents the number of times that the exchange of data from sensors to
    base station is performed. The quantity of water required for irrigation is calculated
    as follows: (24) Based on the above formulas simulation tests were performed to
    calculate the quantity of water required and the lifetime of the network for various
    values of round time ranging from 10 to 230 s. In all the tests it was assumed
    that the duration of the network lifetime was equal to 995 rounds. The simulation
    results are summarized in Table 6. Therefore if a round in ECHERP is equal to
    110 s energy efficiency is provided while smaller quantities of water are consumed.
    5. Conclusions This paper focused on the issue of automated irrigation in agriculture
    and proposed a novel system for efficient irrigation using WSNs. The proposed
    system is based on a model which performs efficient irrigation management by finding
    the appropriate schemes for the rational utilization of water for irrigation.
    The automated irrigation system proposed is based on the use of a novel routing
    protocol named ECHERP. The utilization of this protocol offers remarkable energy
    efficiency. The development of novel systems, like the one proposed in this paper,
    which combines efficient irrigation models along with energy efficient utilization
    of WSNs shows to be a very promising and effective application of automation in
    agriculture. The proposed model can be further extended to consider the effect
    of the field characteristics on the quantity of water required for irrigation.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Ahmedabad, India SECTION I. Introduction
    AGRICULTRE is one of the most important economic activity in the country. Although
    the total contribution of agriculture in country''s GDP is about 16% which is
    third after industry and service sector but, it employs the largest (about 52%)
    workforce of the country. Apart from direct employment, it supports economical
    activities such as animal husbandry and agro based industries. Seed, water, fertilizers
    and pesticides are considered as important inputs in agriculture. Among these,
    water is the most important supply as majority part of the country is arid or
    semi arid and prone to draught. Major threat to the agriculture sector is insufficient
    water supply. This has demanded the need of effective water management system
    for farm irrigation. The conventional method to decide the need of water supply
    is based on information like-type of crops, variety of crops and time duration
    etc. Scientific study reveals that these approaches are not a right practice to
    decide water supply to the farm. It is equally important to consider present weather
    and soil condition in the decision making process to determine frequency and quantity
    of the water supply. The present practice leads wastage of water resource and
    also reduces productivity. Modern practices in irrigation address the optimized
    used of water and higher water productivity [1]. The proposed system is intended
    to provide portable, scalable and affordable solution to achieve optimized usage
    of water supply. It collects on field data like soil and atmosphere temperature
    and soil moisture with the help of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The collected
    data stored in the centralized data server. On the basis of these data, an expert
    system generates a decision about the need of water irrigation in the field. Optimized
    usage of water reduces the wastage of water and also increases the production.
    This paper next presents some of the applications of WSN in the area of agriculture
    in general. It is followed by discussion of development of sensor nodes for soil
    moisture and temperature, and field irrigation management system in section –
    III and section – IV respectively. Section – V presents the architecture of expert
    system to be developed in future work. Finally the paper is concluded in section
    – VI. SECTION II. WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK FOR AGRICULTURE APPLICATION Wireless
    communication and distributed computational capabilities of WSN provides many
    advantages over wired data acquisition for agricultural applications. These advantages
    are like-low cost, small size, low power consumption, reduced maintenance, great
    flexibility, portability, scalability and distributed intelligence. WSN is a network
    of many smart sensors which can sense any physical variable and communicating
    with each other and transfer the data remotely without any wired connection. As
    many as 250 different successful applications of WSN are listed in [2]. Many researchers
    have made an effort to achieve high yield and low usages of water, fertilizers
    and pesticide with successful implementation of WSN in the field as well in greenhouses
    and vineyards [3],[4],[5]. WSN technology along with RFID technology provides
    solution for many application of agriculture as well food industries. A very good
    survey on these applications is presented in [6]. Another concept of Precision
    Agriculture was grown during the last decade. It is to incorporate site-specific
    crop management strategies along with the soil moisture content measurements.
    This involves large number of soil health monitoring smart sensors together [7].
    It is proposed to develop a WSN based expert system which provides the support
    to the farmers to decide the right amount of water supply to the field. An intelligent
    system provides the required knowledge base in terms of optimum conditions of
    soil moisture and soil temperature for all popular crops. Following sections discuss
    the design and implementation of both in details. SECTION III. On FIELD Data Acquition
    An important part of the work is to decide the most suitable protocol for proposed
    WSN for agriculture application. Any wireless sensor is made up of blocks like-microcontroller,
    transceiver, signal conditioning circuit, power supply, and memory. Wireless sensor
    networks are networks of compact microsensors with wireless communication capability.
    A comprehensive comparative study of sensor nodes platforms, energy management
    techniques, offs the-shelf microcontrollers, battery types and radio devices are
    presented in [8]. Functional architecture and its related challenges are shown
    in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Functional Block diagram of wireless sensor node Show All In
    case of agriculture application, long battery life, large distance and low complexity
    are desirable features of WSN. Bluetooth (over IEEE 802.15.1), ultra-wideband,
    (UWB, over IEEE 802.15.3), ZigBee (over IEEE 802.15.4), Wi-Fi (over IEEE 802.11)
    and Wireless Hart (over IEEE 802.15.4) are five protocol standards for short-range
    wireless communications. A very comprehensive study of above mentioned protocols
    in terms of nominal transmission power, nominal range, maximum signal rate, frequency
    band, encryption, maximum number of cell nodes, extension of the basic cell, basic
    cell, coexistence mechanism, spreading techniques, modulation type, channel bandwidth,
    number of RF channels is presented by Lee and his colleague [9]. The comparative
    study reveals that the ZigBee would be the proffered protocol compare to others
    due to long battery life (in months), long range (10–100 m), moderate signal rate
    (250 kb/s) and easy availability of commercial hardware. commercial hardware modules
    available at lower cost. Conceptual diagram of the proposed system is presented
    in fig. 2. The overall system comprises sensor node for soil moistures and temperature,
    base station and expert system. Fig. 2 Concept diagram of proposed system Show
    All The sensor nodes are developed on the microcontroller PIC 16f877A based platform.
    XBee Series 2 based on ZigBee/802.15.4 silicon from Ember™ is used as transceiver
    module. Local display for soil moisture and temperature is available on each node
    through LCD LM016L. Each node is powered by Li-ion battery. 1) Soil Moisture Node
    Most important parameter for on field measurement is soil moisture. Soil moisture
    is the water that held in the spaces between soil particles. There are two different
    levels of soil moisture viz. surface moisture of upper 10 cm of soil and root
    zone soil moisture from 20–40 cm. Soil moisture is key parameter to determine
    when to irrigate and how much water to supply. It has been observed that most
    of the time the fields are over irrigated. More water than the required prevents
    the nitrogen to be used by roots, and lack of oxygen in the root zone. Subsequently
    it reduces the productivity. Different crops need different level of moisture
    for optimum growth. It is known as Maximum Allowable Depletion (MAD). In depth
    understanding of permanent wilting point and field capacity for various types
    of soils i.e. sand, slits and clay is presented in [10]. Over irrigation leads
    to wastage of energy and natural resources. A serious threat on sustainable agriculture
    in North Gujarat due to water wastage is presented in a white paper. [11]. Various
    options of solid state moisture sensors were explored. Among these, Decagon''s
    EC-5 and Watermark''s 200 SS-V are popular and suitable sensors for soil moisture
    measurement. These sensors are costly and not easily available in local market.
    As an intermediate solution, Honeywell''s HIH 4000–002 was considered to approximately
    measurement of soil moisture. 2) Temperature Sensor Node Soil and surrounding
    atmosphere temperature play a vital role in irrigation scheduling. Abnormal variation
    in atmospheric temperature leads towards the change in the predefined irrigation
    scheduling. Normally the temperature near the plant is less due to evaporation
    process. If the plant receives enough water from the soil than the about 2–4°
    C less temperature is maintained near the plant. A stress condition of the plant
    can detect by closely monitoring the temperature near the plant. LM-35 is the
    most suitable sensor to measure the temperature on the field due to limited range
    of measurement and small size. SECTION IV. Field Irrigation Management System
    An important part of the system is the management system. One of the sensor nodes
    is configured as receiver or base station. It is connected with the host PC via
    serial port. The data received by the receiver node further transmits the data
    in its serial buffer to the microcontroller. The microcontroller transmits the
    data serially via MAX 232 to the computer. Data received by host PC is then stored
    in the data base and most recent value is shown on the screen by the GUI (Graphical
    User Interface) developed in Visual Basic 6. A few snapshot of the system is shown
    in fig. 3. Fig 3a Main GUI panel Show All Fig 3b Expert comment on the screen
    Show All It is possible to generate charts and graph of the on field temperature
    and soil moisture values since the sawing of the seed. This feature is helpful
    for analysis. History button provides facility to view the previous readings of
    the parameters directly stored in the database. The user can directly check the
    previous readings without opening the Microsoft Access file. An attempt is made
    to develop expert system which guides the farmer about the perfect irrigation
    schedule according to the selected crop. The expert system shows the values of
    minimum soil moisture and maximum allowable temperature to be maintained for that
    particular crop at different time zone i.e. from sawing to cultivation. It helps
    farmer to provide optimum water supply in the field. The system helps to prevent
    wastage of water and energy used in irrigation due to over irrigation. SECTION
    V. Future Work The proposed system is in the pilot scale. The future work is planned
    in two directions. The first is to expand the sensor network to cover larger size
    actual field. The factors like battery life, optimum number of nodes and quality
    of service are going to be very important in actual implementation. Simulation
    study using open platform ns2 is being planned. Better interoperability between
    nodes and gateway will the prime objective. It will make the system scalable and
    flexible enough to implement for different conditions. It is also planned to develop
    low cost and easy to use soil moisture sensor. This is very much important to
    reduce the overall cost. Inclusion of pH measurement of soil is also planned.
    The proposed expert system is very primitive. It is planned to develop an expert
    system which take the actual field data from the sensor network and integrate
    them with the knowledge base to generate suggestive action for better agriculture
    activities like– irrigation schedule, crop pattern, preventive care for pathogenic
    conditions, close monitoring of quality of farm product, etc. Proposed structure
    for such system is shown in fig. 4. Fig 4 Block diagram of Proposed Expert System
    Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion Increase in the productivity and overall profitability
    in agriculture is a need of the day. An efficient usage of water in the field
    is the key to achieve these. Proposed irrigation management system will help to
    achieve the optimum supply to various crops. Wireless Sensor Network works can
    be used as backbone to the proposed system. Authors Figures References Citations

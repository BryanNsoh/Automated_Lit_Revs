    networks and big data in the future of precision crop production Keywords: precision
    crop production; ICT; IoT; sensors; big data; AI 1. Introduction The world population
    is undergoing continuous growth and is anticipated to reach 10 billion within
    the next 35 years. It is imperative to make significant advancements in agricultural
    production and disaster management to ensure adequate sustenance for the world’s
    population [1]. As the quantity of arable land remains static, the quality of
    the soil is not improving, and groundwater levels are dropping, there is an urgent
    need to responsibly enhance agricultural productivity [2]. Precision agriculture
    has transformed agricultural practices since its inception in the 1980s by utilizing
    technologies like remote sensing, the geographic information system (GIS), and
    the global positioning system (GPS). This integration has transformed crop production
    methods, resulting in a significant shift in agricultural mechanization thinking
    [3]. The combination of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and artificial intelligence
    (AI) enables precision crop production. This cutting-edge technology employs sensors
    and artificial intelligence to optimize crop growth and yield, allowing farmers
    to collect detailed data about their fields and use it to make informed decisions
    about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. Moreover, the greatest output
    benefit of precision agriculture is decreased temporal yield changes, which has
    increased yield stability and climate change tolerance [4]. The agricultural industry
    faces several significant challenges related to effectively utilizing new technologies,
    including discovering knowledge and correlations from historical records, processing
    large volumes of unstructured data in an appropriate format, managing extensive
    amounts of image and video data, monitoring crops using multiple sensors, and
    effectively communicating and integrating these data. Additionally, the adoption
    and accessibility of emerging technologies can be cost-prohibitive for individual
    farmers, while a lack of low-technology expertise requires extra training and
    better information and communication technology (ICT) management equipment. Ensuring
    the security of these systems is also a critical concern within the agricultural
    community [5,6]. Precision agriculture has undergone a transformation over the
    past three decades, advancing from strategic monitoring using satellite imaging
    for regional decision making to tactical monitoring and control allowed by low-altitude
    remotely sensed data for site-specific field-scale applications. The incorporation
    of data science and big data technology into precision agriculture strategies
    has led to a rapid analysis of data, facilitating timely decision making [7,8].
    Farming could move to a more effective, productive, and sustainable paradigm through
    the integration of technologies such ground IoT sensing and remote sensing, using
    both satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as well as utilizing data
    fusion and data analytics [9]. Wireless connection methods, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    and cellular networks, are utilized to transmit sensor data to a central hub,
    allowing farmers to monitor their farms in real time and make informed crop production
    decisions. The improvement of agricultural goods and services while reducing investment
    costs represents a critical objective for future farming. Big data can effectively
    support diverse precision agriculture functions and assist in the extraction of
    information and insights from data in order to process important farming decisions
    and difficulties. In the agricultural sector, ICT plays an important role in developing
    breakthrough data creation, transformation, and management technologies [10].
    Site-specific data collection, characterized by the acquisition of comprehensive
    information regarding events occurring during the vegetation period, offers a
    practical solution to this issue. This methodology enables the identification
    of underlying processes and their causes, leading to precise intervention that
    reduces adverse environmental effects. It creates a monitored and controlled environment
    in both spatial and temporal domains and sets the stage for a more advanced decision
    support system than is currently available. Previous studies have advocated for
    this approach [11,12]. This review offers an informed summary of the most recent
    approaches used in precision agricultural production. It meticulously investigates
    and highlights the cutting-edge technology and approaches that are currently transforming
    the agricultural practice scene. The study focuses on the application of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and big data in the agricultural industry and research. The review
    provides light on these technologies’ beneficial effects in enhancing crop yields,
    resource usage, and overall farm management by explaining their practical applications.
    Moreover, it addressed the challenges that come with integrating IoT and big data
    in agriculture. It discusses the challenges that have been encountered, such as
    data security concerns, technical difficulties, and the necessity for a strong
    infrastructure which are among many other limitations faces the integration of
    IoT in agricultural practices around the world. 2. Overview of Precision Agriculture
    Technology 2.1. ICT, IoT, Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Data Fusion Sustainable
    agricultural development presents a crucial solution to address rapid population
    growth, facilitated using ICT in precision agriculture. This approach has yielded
    innovative techniques that enhance agricultural productivity, efficiency, and
    regulation while concurrently preserving the environment [2]. To ensure long-term
    agricultural production, modern technologies must be used in the agricultural
    field, like blockchain [13,14], the IoT [15], and (AI) [16]. The most promising
    strategy for solving these problems is data-driven agriculture using these technologies.
    (IoT) assists in data collection at all stages of agricultural production and
    supply chain management [17]. The internet now plays a crucial role across many
    industries. Within the agricultural domain, a suggested approach that involves
    monitoring agricultural fields utilizing the IoT is utilized. This approach employs
    sensors that analyze diverse parameters within the agricultural domain, leveraging
    wireless sensor network technology [18]. “IoT” refers to the connection of devices
    and tools, such as sensors, to the internet, allowing them to transfer data. The
    IoT is a huge network with an enormous number of objects connected to a global
    information infrastructure. The number of connected devices has increased many
    folds, giving rise to the scalability issue in the IoT. For proper communication
    to take place, a unique sender and receiver must be recognized, along with the
    identification of an appropriate path or channel [19]. In agriculture, the use
    of IoT technology has the potential to revolutionize the way farms operate and
    increase the efficiency and productivity of the industry. Another application
    of IoT in agriculture is the use of precision farming techniques, which involve
    using sensors and other technologies to gather data and make precise and timely
    adjustments to various aspects of farming operations. For example, GPS-guided
    machinery can be used to precisely apply fertilizers and pesticides, reducing
    the number of resources used and minimizing waste. Even though, due to the necessity
    for skills in interacting with sensors, the internet cloud, and end-user apps,
    farmers face difficulties adopting smart farming and IoT technology [20]. The
    Internet of Things has numerous applications in the Digital Agriculture field,
    including detection of plant physiological status, nutrient replenishment recommendations,
    water requirements, and so on [18,21]. The (IoT) offers significant benefits for
    agriculture and sustainable crop production, including the ability to anticipate
    and prepare for potential disturbances that may originate from remote locations,
    such as insect pest invasions and monitoring soil nutrients, water dynamics, and
    pest management. The other advantages of using IoT technology in farming systems
    are that the ability of using in yield prediction, energy and cost savings, and
    the establishment of indoor vertical farming systems by utilizing the information
    from the established IoT station there [20]. Regarding ecological aspirations,
    the Internet of Everything (IoE) is receiving an increasing amount of attention
    [22]. This increases the effectiveness of protection and hence lowers costs. Big
    data can be utilized for different spatiotemporal applications, such as connecting
    remote IoT equipment to cloud-based computing capabilities [23,24]. The use of
    IoT with big data analysis techniques is the basis for new decision making tools.
    In agriculture, “big data” refers to the massive amount of data generated by agricultural
    activity and measurement. Processing and managing large amounts of data is a difficult
    undertaking when using standard approaches and systems [7]. Big data have a big
    chance in agriculture for solving various farming difficulties and, as a result,
    increasing agricultural production quality and quantity. Big data analytics can
    be used to anticipate agricultural harvesting time, soil quality, crop protection,
    and irrigation requirements. Furthermore, big data empowers agricultural practitioners
    and related industries to gain information about different factors that impede
    agricultural production and make efficient decisions in daily farming [2]. While
    it is unclear whether agriculture practitioners’ information will be replaced
    by algorithms, big data applications are likely to revolutionize how agriculture
    farms are managed and operated [25,26]. The collection of data from multiple sources
    is a critical component of achieving predictive decision making capabilities in
    precision agriculture. Weather conditions play a pivotal role in determining the
    productivity and management of agricultural systems, emphasizing the importance
    of accurate area-based weather forecasting for the future of precision crop production
    and with further data collection from various sources would allow to monitor and
    optimize crop growth conditions [27]. Precision agriculture datasets typically
    comprise a diverse range of data related to crops, soil, and nutrients, atmospheric
    data, technological data such as GIS data, GPS data, and data from trucks and
    the Variable Rate Fertilizer (VRT) system [7,28,29,30]. Big data analysis is a
    methodical strategy that applies cutting-edge analytic tools to big data sets.
    This entails the integration of two technical components, namely extensive data
    sets and an array of analytics tool categories such as data mining, statistics,
    AI, predictive analytics, and natural language processing (NLP), among others.
    The analysis of such data is accomplished through the utilization of big data
    mining techniques. In the realm of smart agriculture, the feasibility study is
    significantly improved by the application of IoT and big data analytics in the
    cloud [2,18]. In Figure 1, we can see the relationship between IoT and data analytics.
    Because of the volume, velocity, and variety of data generated by IoTs, they are
    classified as “big data systems”. These data are mined and processed in order
    to show the relationships between inputs and outputs [31]. Figure 1. The relationship
    between the Internet of Things and data analytics [32]. Cloud computing is a method
    that allows for the sharing of resources at a low cost. Cloud computing service
    providers make these services available at an economical cost. The storage of
    agricultural data has been facilitated through the utilization of cloud computing.
    In the agriculture sector, cloud computing is employed in conjunction with IoT
    technology [33]. According to Neményi et al., 2022 [34], the combination of artificial
    intelligence and cloud computing constitutes a comprehensive support system for
    the IoT. It requires combining data from intelligent wireless sensors, such as
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [35] and satellites, data acquisition systems
    on agricultural machinery and crop production equipment, and robots such as unmanned
    ground vehicles (UGVs), with precise positioning systems (such as navigation systems,
    real-time kinematics (RTK), and Lidar). The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a
    wireless network made up of geographically distributed sensor stations. Sensors
    → MCU → Nodes → Gateways → Clouds (server) [34]. Multisensor data fusion is a
    technology that facilitates the integration of data from multiple sources to create
    a comprehensive representation. Data fusion systems have found broad use in many
    different domains, including but not limited to sensor networks, robotics, video
    and image processing, and intelligent system design. The process of data fusion
    is described as a complex, multifaceted operation that involves automated detection,
    association, correlation, estimation, and gathering of data from multiple sources
    at various levels [36,37]. The practice of data fusion offers numerous benefits,
    primarily through improving the authenticity and availability of data. The utilization
    of data fusion strategies has been extensively applied in various sectors, including
    the food and chemical industries, with the aim of augmenting the analytical platforms’
    overall performance and robustness [38,39,40]. Munnaf et al., 2021 [41] recommend
    employing Site-Specific Seeding (SSS) for potato production using the proposed
    multi-sensor data-fusion technique to manage in-field soil and crop variabilities
    and improve productivity and profitability in their study. (SSS) was examined
    for potato production utilizing Management Zone (MZ) maps based on several soil
    and crop variables. Despite using more seeds, SSS increased tuber yields, and
    gross margins compared to Uniform Rate Seeding (URS). SSS profitability ranged
    from 2.34% to 27.21%, with the highest profitability in low-productivity fields.
    The study suggests using SSS for potato production, along with the proposed multi-sensor
    data-fusion approach, to manage in-field soil and crop variabilities and improve
    productivity and profitability. These studies have concentrated on how cloud computing,
    IoT, and multisensor data fusion are integrated in precision agriculture, while
    Neményi et al. (2022) [34] highlighted the complementary advantages of AI, cloud
    computing, and IoT for comprehensive data use, cloud computing offers cost-effective
    data storage. Fusion of data from multiple sensors is essential to enhance data
    availability and validity across sectors. Munnaf et al. [41] recommends Site-Specific
    Seeding (SSS) with multisensor data fusion in potato production because it outperforms
    Uniform Rate Seeding (URS) in terms of tuber yields and profitability, especially
    in low-productivity fields. These results highlight the need for data-driven approaches
    for enhanced crop productivity and optimized resource management. 2.2. AI, Real-Time
    Monitoring, and Big Data (Mining and Analyzing) In contemporary times, traditional
    yield modeling aimed at meeting the demands of sustainability and identifying
    yield drivers and factors restricting yield is increasingly being executed using
    AI. An expanding number of researchers are employing AI to model an extensive
    array of agricultural tasks. The technical literature sources reveal the application
    of diverse techniques for supporting precision agriculture decision making. AI
    presents a promising prospect for improving the world’s food security, including
    closing crop yield gaps, minimizing food waste, and mitigating resource utilization
    inefficiencies [42,43]. Counter propagation artificial neural network (CP-ANN),
    SKN, and XY-F models were used along with high-resolution soil and crop data such
    as spatial-temporal soil types and crop production effectiveness to predict classes
    of wheat yield productivity. The SKN network predicts the low category of yield
    output the best, with a proper classification percentage of 91.3% for both cross-
    and independent validation. Temperature and other climate effects have also been
    analyzed by AI [44,45,46]. These researches emphasize the importance of conventional
    yield modeling to be integrated with AI-driven methods in precision agriculture.
    Applications for (AI) like CP-ANN, SKN, and XY-F models show highly promising
    results, especially SKN with a 91.3% classification accuracy for low yield. Precision
    agriculture involves the collection of real-time and historically generated data,
    which is structured or unstructured in nature. With the increasing adoption of
    precision agriculture practices, the amount of unstructured data generated has
    grown significantly. Consequently, current research efforts have focused on extracting
    meaningful insights and knowledge from these unstructured datasets [30]. High-spatiotemporal-resolution
    automated monitoring of the soil, plants, and atmosphere is an important factor
    in converting labor-intensive, experience-based decision making in agricultural
    production to an autonomous, data-driven way. Real-time field data might help
    growers make better management decisions, and researchers could use this information
    to find answers to important scientific problems [47]. The implementation of fully
    automated decision making systems (ADMS) is essential in precision agriculture.
    These systems are designed to monitor multiple chemical or physical parameters
    of soil and plants while simultaneously regulating them to maintain optimal conditions
    for each specific plant or soil type. Despite the feasibility of developing such
    systems using existing technologies, the implementation of ADMS encounters significant
    challenges. ADMS generally consists of four main sections: the sensing technique,
    sensor interfaces, the information transmission platform, and the data processing
    and control unit; the crucial role of precision agriculture in utilizing both
    historical and real-time data for well-informed decision making is highlighted
    by both studies. Despite its feasibility, both studies agree that deploying ADMS
    is challenging. They develop a comprehensive view of the changing precision agricultural
    scene, combining data-driven insights with the complexities of implementing automated
    systems technologies. Figure 2 shows the general structure of automated decision-making
    systems [48]. Figure 2. The general structure of automated decision making systems
    ADMS [48]. There are now three fundamental approaches accessible for soil and
    plant sensing systems: satellite imaging, on-the-go sensors, and in situ soil
    and plant sensors. Satellite imaging is a way of monitoring soil and plant quality
    and fertility by acquiring and analyzing multi-spectral satellite images of the
    field of interest [49]. This technology is very costly and limited to particular
    countries. The second, more financially practical way is to attach sensors to
    agricultural machinery, other agricultural equipment, or even drones, known as
    on-the-go sensors. The last approach entails the placement of soil and plant sensors
    across the area, which can share data in real time [50,51]. This is the only approach
    capable of providing continuous, real-time data without the need for human intervention.
    These sensors do, however, have some drawbacks, such as the need for protection
    from wild animals and the need to occasionally remove them from the field during
    crop cultivation and harvest to prevent damage from agricultural machinery. Depending
    on the period of removal, this may result in gaps and data loss for several hours
    or days. Real-time soil nutrient sensing has a lot of potential for the future
    of agriculture because nitrogen leakage and groundwater pollution have developed
    into significant problems for society. Nitrate sensors can be used for a variety
    of purposes, such as monitoring nitrate concentrations in groundwater by mounting
    them to groundwater pumps or estimating nitrate leaching more precisely by installing
    them in leaching water collectors in fields [52]. The real-time measurement of
    soil nutrient content, particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, is critical
    for fertilization. These detectors are still in the experimental stage [53]. Utilizing
    in situ and on-the-go sensing systems that could record significant data and soil
    parameters in a short period of time is one of the needs of precision farming
    and crop production. This representative data collection results in average cost-effectiveness,
    but by analyzing the data and taking additional measurements, it could also improve
    our current knowledge. Vis-NIR spectroscopy can be used to measure the soil’s
    pH, organic matter concentration, and moisture content [54]. In general, the more
    complicated the problem to be solved, the more data are required [55]. The analysis
    of big data sets is a way to identify relationships, patterns, and trends in the
    data [7]. Incorporating observations from farms and in situ sensing systems with
    current databases presents an opportunity not only to predict yields using traditional
    statistical techniques or DSS Decision Support Systems but also to explore the
    potential of machine learning (ML). This provides an avenue for more advanced
    and sophisticated yield prediction models to be developed [43]. For both in situ
    and on-the-go sensing systems the diverse and unstructured nature of the data
    produced by these sensors presents a significant challenge and requires the use
    of advanced tools for analysis, and because of the enormous volume of data, traditional
    storage and processing systems must be scalable. When dealing with data from different
    sensor types and manufacturers, interoperability concerns may occur, making integration
    more difficult. Furthermore, protecting data privacy and security is essential
    considering the sensitivity of agricultural information. To enable efficient and
    secure big data use in precision agriculture, it is necessary to create strong
    data management strategies, implement standardized protocols, and give security
    measures top priority. The integration of microchips and broadband networks with
    farm equipment, crops, animals, machines, and products through an IoT platform
    is a technological advancement that offers real-time connectivity between devices
    [56]. The application of IoT is particularly relevant in sustainable agriculture,
    given the diversity of factors involved in the agricultural ecosystem, including
    biodiversity, stochastic weather patterns, and the interdependence of living and
    non-living systems. As a result, a comprehensive approach is necessary to address
    these complexities. In addition, IoT and AI can help reduce the effects of climate
    change and greenhouse gas emissions, further emphasizing the significance of these
    technologies in modern agriculture [57,58,59,60]. The research studies’ comparisons
    illustrate multiple approaches for soil and plant sensing systems in precision
    agriculture, each with unique benefits and limitations. Using multi-spectral images
    from satellite imaging to monitor soil and plant quality is highly expensive and
    limited to certain countries. Real-time data can be obtained through on-the-go
    sensors that are installed on machinery or drones, but these sensors must be protected
    from wildlife and occasionally removed during cultivation. Real-time soil nutrient
    sensing is currently in the experimental stage but is crucial for solving environmental
    challenges. With their diverse and unstructured data, in situ and on-the-go sensing
    systems provide a challenge that requires scalable storage and advanced analytical
    tools. For effective big data use in precision agriculture, both studies emphasize
    the value of robust data management, standardized protocols, and security measures.
    2.3. Sensor Development and Sensor Platforms Sensors are utilized at various stages
    of the farming process, from planting through the packaging of the final product.
    The farming process can be broadly classified into distinct categories, including
    planting, soil management, nutrient and water management, pest and disease management,
    yield harvesting, and post-harvest processing, all of which can benefit from the
    integration of advanced sensing technologies. Figure 3 shows sensing technologies
    and their applications in agriculture [61,62]. Figure 3. Sensing technologies
    and their applications in agriculture [62]. Sensors serve a vital function in
    enabling the conversion of real-world signals into their digital representations
    within Ag-IoT systems. The integration of sensors in machine components has become
    increasingly prevalent, providing producers with insights into the systems’ dynamic
    loading and repetitive biotic and abiotic stresses. By collecting and comparing
    data from sensors positioned in the soil, crops, and animals, it is possible to
    identify technical improvements that prioritize criteria of ecological and economic
    sustainability, ultimately enhancing the soil-, plant-, and animal-friendly nature
    of precision agriculture [63]. The appropriate choice of sensors for an application
    is crucial for both inventors and users of IoT systems to ensure optimal sensor
    utilization. Technological advancements in sensors have significantly influenced
    the proliferation of the IoT. Key factors that must be considered when selecting
    sensors for IoT system development include low power consumption, information
    transfer compatibility between the computers and the sensor, precision, sensibility,
    repeatability, and durability [47]. Table 1 gives sensor categories and sensor
    measurements, and examples from the literature are provided. Table 1. Sensor categories
    and measurements [47]. When deployed on UAVs (drones, airplanes), UGVs (tiny,
    intelligent robots), and satellites, cameras with the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) can be utilized to estimate yield and using hyperspectral cameras
    and NDRE (normalized difference red edge) cameras can improve the estimates’ accuracy.
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can
    be used to perform color-based crop (fruit) maturity checks. Gloves with various
    sensors integrated, including touch pressure sensors, imaging, inertia measurement,
    location, and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), are used to classify fruits
    and have been applied in fungal disease classification [77,78,79,80,81,82]. Sensors
    that move both vertically and horizontally within the soil or remain stationary
    in the ground have the potential to collect critical data. With the emergence
    of nanotechnology, the use of increasingly smaller sensors is becoming commonplace
    [83]. The implementation of such sensors, coupled with the resulting data collection,
    can significantly reduce losses during agricultural operations and increase their
    effectiveness. Furthermore, the data collected facilitates the establishment of
    clear classification conditions based on the inherent quality of the crop, thereby
    mitigating the risk of incorrect classification and associated losses [34]. The
    authors of [84] have provided comprehensive information on techniques for disease
    identification in plants, emphasizing the significance of remote sensing methods.
    In a similar vein, ref. [85] have described an automated system for detecting
    facial expressions of pain in sheep with the aim of identifying diseases. Many
    different parameters can be measured with chemical sensors, including soil pH,
    soil salinity, soil nutrients, oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
    the pH and conductivity of irrigation water, and photosynthesis. The pH of soil
    and water is a critical parameter to determine, as it affects the solubility of
    nutrients, which in turn has a significant impact on plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. The two main categories of chemical sensors are photochemical and electrochemical.
    Electrochemical sensors evaluate the electrical properties of chemical reactions
    or the presence of substances, whereas photochemical sensors monitor the spectral
    signature of chemicals or chemical [86]. Some researchers attempt to continuously
    determine grain quality characteristics (protein content, mass density, and moisture
    content) because these affect the market value of the harvested crop. Grain quality
    factors can additionally assist in clarifying grain yield variation [87]. Another
    type of sensors recently under study are soil-degradable sensors that have emerged
    as a specialized sensing technology designed for monitoring soil parameters, including
    moisture content, temperature, pH levels, and nutrient concentrations. These sensors
    possess the unique ability to naturally degrade over time within the soil environment.
    Soil-degradable sensors offer several potential advantages, such as eliminating
    the need for sensor retrieval, minimizing soil pollution risks, and providing
    insights into soil dynamics without disrupting the ecosystem [88]. Inexpensive
    and low-maintenance biodegradable soil moisture sensors could improve existing
    knowledge on the spatial and temporal variability of available soil water at the
    field scale [89]. In their study, Sui et al., 2021 [88] developed and evaluated
    a biodegradable soil moisture sensor using stencil-printing. The sensor was made
    of environmentally friendly materials and consisted of slowly degrading encapsulants
    and rapidly degrading electrodes and substrates. The chosen materials allowed
    the sensor to function reliably in the presence of soil microbes and then quickly
    failed after the encapsulant degraded. The sensor eventually decomposed completely,
    eliminating the need for retrieval. The sensor’s material selection did not hinder
    crop growth, as confirmed via ecotoxicity testing. Different thicknesses of encapsulants
    were used, and the sensor’s sensitivity to volumetric water content (VWC) was
    measured. Accelerated degradation tests under elevated temperature conditions
    assessed the sensor’s long-term stability. The breakdown of the sensor was characterized
    by showing stable performance during its functional lifetime and rapid degradation
    afterward. The encapsulation with a slowly degrading wax blend provided protection,
    reduced drift, and controlled degradation time. A linear capacitance response
    was observed for VWC, ranging from 0 to 72% in soil samples. Overall, these biodegradable
    sensors have the potential to enable maintenance-free, cost-effective, and real-time
    soil moisture measurement at high spatial density for precision irrigation control
    in agriculture. Figure 4 presents an illustration of the mechanism for moisture
    sensor degradation. Wax covers the sensor while it is functional, but after the
    encapsulation fails, it quickly degrades. The sensor’s encapsulant and other functional
    parts degrade in the soil. Figure 4. Illustration of the moisture sensor degradation
    mechanism [88]. These printed sensors have shown reliable performance in laboratory
    settings, but they still have some drawbacks, such as (1) the potential for fouling
    in soil over time, which could affect performance and signal drift; (2) the need
    for maintenance or the eventual removal of the sensors to prevent accumulation
    in the field; and (3) the potential toxicity of the conductive components to soil
    microbes and crops [90,91]. Previous papers have highlighted the changing landscape
    of sensor applications in precision agriculture, including yield estimation, disease
    diagnosis, animal health monitoring, and innovative soil parameter monitoring
    using biodegradable sensors. The incorporation of advanced technologies has the
    potential to revolutionize the collection of data in order to improve agricultural
    practices, which will enhance crop productivity. It has also identified challenges
    such as successfully integrating diverse technologies, processing huge amounts
    of data, ensuring standardization for connectivity, addressing high implementation
    costs, securing data privacy, evaluating environmental impacts, educating farmers
    for technology adoption, navigating regulatory constraints, ensuring sensor reliability
    in harsh conditions, and scaling solutions for widespread agricultural application.
    2.4. Data Transmission Technologies One of the most significant advancements in
    infield monitoring over the past 10 years has been the replacement of wired-based
    complex systems with wireless sensor networks (WSN), complemented by effective
    power management techniques [92]. Sensor networks are used in precision agriculture
    to monitor field environmental conditions and other parameters. These sensors
    connect with one another, producing a network that collects environmental data
    collaboratively. WSNs are naturally specialized and have a simpler infrastructure,
    allowing them to transfer data easily and efficiently from the field to a remote
    user [93]. For the real-time monitoring of critical parameters like soil moisture
    and crop health, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have become essential in agriculture.
    They enable the effective use of water, fertilizer, and pesticides through optimizing
    resource management. WSNs improve data accuracy by efficiently distributing frequencies
    to reduce interference. Precise monitoring over large agricultural landscapes
    is made possible by considering signal intensity, bandwidth usage, and adaptation
    to changing transmission ranges. Energy efficiency is a top priority for WSNs
    for long-term deployment. They are essential for implementing precision agriculture
    and promoting sustainable farming practices due to their scalability and strong
    system models that adapt to various farm sizes and changing conditions. Data transmission
    via wireless constitutes a crucial component of an IoT system, particularly in
    the agricultural domain. Designing an effective Ag-IoT system requires comprehending
    the contributing elements pertaining to radio frequency (RF) that impact signal
    strength, interference, system model, bandwidth, and transmission range. Moreover,
    a thorough understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different wireless
    communication technologies is important for optimal device selection. Wireless
    IoT sensors can track environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, luminosity,
    and soil moisture in real time [94,95,96,97,98,99]. Agricultural data collected
    with sensors will be delivered in a variety of forms based on the required level
    of precision and resolution, necessitating the use of appropriate interfaces to
    ensure compatibility. In the realm of IoT-based intelligent farming, communication
    protocols are essential for covering both short-range and long-range distances
    on the land [100]. ZigBee, Bluetooth, NB-IoT (Narrowband LPWAN technology which
    can coexist in LTE or GSM under licensed frequency bands) [101], and Wi-Fi are
    used for short ranges, while LoRaWAN, Sigfox, LTE m (Long-Term Evolution for Machines)
    [102] and LPWAN protocols in mobile communication networks are utilized for long
    ranges. The LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is designed to function with
    low power consumption and is capable of transmitting sensor signals to a central
    server from up to 30–40 km away on level terrain [103]. In terms of communication
    technologies employed for node and gateway/base station interactions, half of
    the reviewed literature utilized LoRa/LoRaWAN. The selection of an appropriate
    communication technology depends on the unique characteristics of the project,
    such as the required range and data rate, and thus a variety of options are available
    for consideration [104]. A WSN-based application was presented by [105,106], who
    discussed some of the scheme’s advantages, Fuzzy-based Clustering Scheme, for
    example, attempts to reduce the deployment cost, propagation delay, and energy
    consumption while enhancing the reliability of the network. It is particularly
    well suited for large-scale monitoring applications of WSNs with higher node density.
    Will, real-world performance evaluation, addressing hardware and software requirements,
    comparing comparison with existing schemes, responding to network dynamics, and
    ensuring scalability in large-scale WSNs are all potential challenges should be
    discussed. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS/3G/4G, ZigBee, LoRa, and SigFox were among the
    wireless technologies and protocol suites compared by the authors. Because of
    their suitable communication range and low power consumption, they demonstrated
    that LoRa and ZigBee wireless technologies are highly efficient for precision
    agriculture. It is mentioned that numerous strategies and algorithms linked to
    the energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks are classified. They also discussed
    the approaches that can be applied in PA. In the agricultural industry, 4G/3G
    wireless network technology is used to connect IoT-based smart devices for data
    sharing, precise assessment, accurate calculation, and so on. While the 3G/4G
    connectivity paradigm has shown great promise, there are some limitations that
    prevent the technology from reaching its full potential in the agricultural sector.
    One of the most significant limits is the operational area [107,108,109,110].
    The comparison of various protocols is shown in Table 2. Table 2. Communication
    technologies and their advantages [111]. Despite the high speed and good connectivity
    provided by the 4G network, it is not feasible to interconnect all the smart farming
    devices in remote locations at a low installation and maintenance cost. To conduct
    demanding computational operations and run loaded services, a growing number of
    devices and a vast amount of research on IoT devices for smart farming are required.
    These devices also require increased intelligence, speed, scalability, secure
    communication capabilities, and processing power. Ultra-low latency and high connectivity
    are required for IoT devices to achieve quick performance and low costs. The utilization
    of 4G and 3G communication technologies has proven inadequate for real-time precision
    practices, primarily due to issues such as bandwidth limitations, connectivity
    issues, and slow data transfer speeds. In contrast, the integration of 5G technology
    within the agricultural sector has had a significant impact on various aspects,
    including real-time monitoring, unmanned aerial vehicles, virtual consultation,
    predictive maintenance, artificially intelligent robotics, data analytics, and
    cloud repositories. Consequently, the incorporation of 5G structures has facilitated
    improved speed, connectivity, scalability, and processing power, thereby enabling
    the resolution of existing limitations [100,112,113,114]. The important areas
    in the agriculture sector where the development of a 5G mobile network could be
    beneficial are highlighted in Figure 5. Figure 5. Areas of 5G in the agricultural
    sector [100]. While 3G may have coverage limitation, the adoption of 4G in IoT-based
    smart farming ensures reliable connectivity. The anticipated release of 5G revolutionized
    data transport with its ultra-fast, low-latency communication. However, extensive
    infrastructure development is needed for 5G implementation. The decision between
    various technologies requires balancing elements like coverage, speed, and the
    infrastructure’s preparedness, reflecting the shifting connectivity environment
    in precision agriculture. 5G technology allows the increasing usage of IoT applications
    in digital agriculture and the advancement of precision farming technologies,
    allowing spot spraying and real-time image collecting without latency. As a result,
    overall agricultural efficiency, resource optimization, and sustainability improve.
    The use of 5G in agriculture represents a paradigm change, providing farmers with
    advanced technologies to handle the problems of modern farming while also contributing
    to global food security [100,114]. 6G provides better connectivity and faster,
    more reliable communication. It provides higher data rates for real-time transmission,
    lower latency for near-instantaneous responses, and supports massive IoT connectivity,
    which allows to increase the productivity of Agricultural applications. 6G also
    seeks to increase energy efficiency, optimize resource consumption, and extend
    device battery life [115]. The constraints and challenges of implementing 5G in
    precision crop production include low coverage in rural regions, reliability and
    latency-related issues, energy consumption challenges, and implementation costs
    that have not been highlighted. 6G, which is still in its early stages, may face
    hurdles in infrastructure deployment, moving from 5G, unclear adaptation to environmental
    conditions, and resolving data security and privacy concerns. The precise constraints
    in the expanding field of precision agriculture are dependent on ongoing improvements
    and the specifics of different implementations. The comparison of 3G, 4G, 5G,
    and 6G in precision agriculture discussed in the previous works reveals a changing
    landscape. While 4G promises a reliable connection in IoT-based smart farming,
    5G transforms real-time data transit with ultra-fast, low-latency communication,
    although at the expense of significant infrastructure construction. The widespread
    implementation of 5G in agriculture has a beneficial impact on sustainability,
    resource optimization, and efficiency. In order to increase productivity in agriculture,
    the expected 6G technology intends to provide better connectivity, faster and
    more dependable communication, higher data rates, lower latency, and extensive
    IoT support. Both 5G and the potential 6G network have challenges, such as coverage
    limitations, problems with reliability, latency concerns, energy consumption issues,
    infrastructure deployment difficulties, and data security and privacy issues in
    precision crop production. For agricultural sensor data to be presented in a variety
    of ways, communication protocols and interfaces are essential. Wu et al., 2023
    and Chen et al., 2015 [116,117] presented a cyber–physical infrastructure that
    enables the seamless integration of diverse sensors and transparently handles
    their physical differences throughout the World Wide Web (WWW). The infrastructure
    makes it possible to utilize sensor web accessibility and web processing services,
    which allow applications to access sensor data without knowing its physical details.
    IoT communication protocols (such as, MQTT, TLS, DTLS, and AES) are crucial for
    enabling secure communication between resource-constrained devices and services
    on fog, edge, and cloud nodes, as well as HTTP/HTTPS and WebSockets, make it possible
    to transmit data over the web [118]. A lot of Dashboards and standardized models
    improve the visualization of data. The selection depends on sensor types, network
    architecture, and the most appropriate data presentation style chosen to support
    decision making in precision agriculture. 3. Discussion 3.1. Amount of Needed
    Data for Precision Crop Production Precision crop production involves the use
    of advanced technologies to optimize crop yield and reduce waste. Among the key
    components of precision crop production is the collection of data from multiple
    sources (sensors, satellites, etc.). The amount of data needed from sensors in
    precision crop production is related to many aspects. On the one hand, collecting
    large amounts of data is essential for achieving the best possible results in
    precision crop production. Sensors should be used to collect data on a wide range
    of variables, including soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels, as well
    as plant health indicators such as leaf color, height, and growth rate [43]. One
    important principle is that the amount of data needed will depend on the specific
    crops being grown as well as the environmental conditions in which they are being
    grown. It also depends on the goals of the farmer. For example, crops that are
    more sensitive to changes in temperature or moisture levels may require more frequent
    data collection than crops that are more resilient. If the goal is to increase
    yield, then collecting a large amount of data may be necessary to identify the
    factors that are most important for achieving this goal. The authors of [119]
    examine in their article the use of affordable air pollution sensors for air quality
    monitoring and how machine learning techniques can increase the accuracy of the
    sensor data. The study shows data from two low-cost, self-built air pollution
    nodes that were installed at a Barcelona official reference station for four months
    and collected high-resolution data from five electrochemical sensors as well as
    temperature and humidity measurements. During the four months of testing, they
    gathered about 5.5 million samples of row data from each sensor. The Field Monitoring
    Laboratory in Mosonmagyaróvár has been operating in two experimental fields since
    April 2020. The primary goal is to build an IoT data collection technology based
    on site-specific precision crop production demand. The laboratory produces more
    than 100 sensed data points; the data are collected with the LoraWan communication
    protocol in 10–15 min intervals, depending on sensor type. A system structure
    was designed that can integrate the database from different sensors (from different
    producers). The server development is implemented in the .NET language. MS SQL
    databases are used to store sensor data. There were more than 2 million raw data
    collected in the maize vegetation season, and more than 3 million raw data were
    collected over the last three years [43]. The high-resolution data enables an
    analysis of signal processing, sensor sampling approaches, filtering, and calibration
    of low-cost sensors. In the same context, it would be clear how crucial it is
    to analyze and clarify the data acquired to determine how factors like atmospheric,
    soil, and plant characteristics affect the development of precision crop production.
    The development of big data and IoT has led to an explosion in the number of connected
    devices and sensors, generating vast amounts of data that can be analyzed for
    insights. While these technologies have numerous advantages, they also present
    some significant disadvantages that need to be addressed. 3.2. Advantages and
    Disadvantages of IoT Sensors and Big Data in Precision Crop Production The implementation
    of IoT and big data analytics in agriculture has yielded notable benefits. IoT
    sensors and stations facilitate the real-time tracking and monitoring of various
    processes, leading to improved operational efficiency and enhanced crop yield
    optimization. Decision makers can utilize big data analytics to make informed
    and data-driven decisions. Moreover, big data analytics can enhance accuracy by
    providing accurate predictions, trends, and insights. Cost savings are also achieved
    using IoT sensors, which minimize waste, improve asset utilization, and reduce
    energy consumption. These sensors generate data that can be utilized to adjust
    irrigation and fertilization schedules, ensuring that crops receive appropriate
    amounts of water and nutrients at the optimal time. It also has some notable drawbacks;
    one of the primary limitations is the high cost associated with implementing these
    technologies. Additionally, managing the vast amounts of data generated by these
    sensors can also be complex and challenging, requiring the necessary infrastructure
    and expertise to manage and analyze the data effectively. Moreover, the reliability
    of IoT sensors and stations is not always guaranteed, and they are prone to errors
    and failures, which can lead to incorrect data and flawed decision making. Another
    disadvantage is the potential for data overload, whereby the sheer volume of data
    collected can be overwhelming and challenging to process, resulting in difficulty
    filtering out irrelevant data and identifying critical data points. This can cause
    delays in decision making, leading to missed opportunities or increased costs
    this is consistent with [120,121,122]. Challenges with IoT integration in precision
    agriculture include knowledge gaps among farmers, a decrease in agricultural area,
    and the effects of climate change. Data privacy issues highlight the necessity
    for efficient approaches. Future prospects include developments in machine learning,
    AI, and sensing technologies aimed at enhanced proactive decision making. It is
    crucial to fill the knowledge gap and provide scalability for various farming
    needs. The agriculture industry, technology developers, and authorities may work
    together to promote an environment that encourages greater adoption. Opportunities
    will be opened for a sustainable and technologically advanced future in precision
    agricultural production by overcoming challenges and continued research. 4. Conclusions
    The collection of data on various crop-related variables provides farmers with
    a comprehensive understanding, allowing them to make informed decisions for optimized
    yields. However, caution is required, as a large amount of data can lead to information
    overload, requiring a focus on relevant information. The vast amount of raw data
    provides an excellent platform for in-depth research of crops such as maize vegetation
    seasons, providing significant insights into growth, development, and long-term
    performance. This dataset can be used for trend analysis, pattern recognition,
    and potential predictions to enhance maize cultivation practices. The amount of
    data needed for a field plot is determined by the research objectives, precision
    requirements, and available resources. While more data points improve the representativeness
    and accuracy, practical factors like plot size and study complexity also play
    a role. It is important for researchers to carefully plan their data collection
    strategy, taking into consideration the specific research goals and the trade-off
    between data quantity and quality. This ensures that an adequate amount of data
    are collected to provide meaningful insights and draw reliable conclusions while
    also considering practical constraints. Furthermore, the real-time monitoring
    of IoT sensors improves agricultural operating efficiency by giving valuable data
    for informed decisions. Despite the benefits, big data and IoT sensor adoption
    requires careful consideration due to associated challenges such as security,
    complexity, privacy concerns, and reliability issues, necessitating a thorough
    review of their benefits and drawbacks before implementation. Author Contributions

    of sets of wirelessly connected sensor nodes often placed in hard-to-reach environments.
    Therefore, it is expected that sensor nodes will not be powered from the power
    grid. Instead, sensor nodes have their own power sources, the replacement of which
    is often impractical and requires additional costs, so it is necessary to ensure
    minimum energy consumption. For that reason, the energy efficiency of wireless

    progress on wireless sensor networks based on LoRa was provided. Furthermore,
    analyses of energy consumption of sensor nodes used in agriculture to observe
    environmental parameters were conducted using the results of real measurements
    in the field, as well as simulations carried out based on collected data about

    used in conducted simulations were highlighted. In the analyses, special emphasis
    was placed on choosing the optimal packet size. Unlike in other papers analyzing
    energy efficiency of LoRa communication, in this paper, it was proven that the
    adjustment of the transmission speed to the actual size of the packet is important
    for better energy efficiency of communication and that it can reduce energy consumption
    considerably. Moreover, in the paper, the contents of a packet that can be used

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Sensor networks, as a special subtype of wireless
    networks, consist of sets of wirelessly connected sensor nodes often placed in

    efficient application of wireless sensor networks in agricultural processes contributes
    positively to the sustainable development of the economy based on agriculture
    and food production. The effects of these activities also have a positive impact
    on the ecology. The processes of monitoring ecological and agronomic parameters
    that enable a precise assessment of the physiological state of crops enable the
    timely adjustment of agrotechnical measures to reduce the impact of climate change
    on agricultural production. Wireless systems based on the usage of sensor nodes
    make processes in agriculture more intelligent because they become more precise,
    data-oriented, and greatly automated [1]. The broad usage of microprocessors and
    microcontrollers, which include small sensor nodes that can be self-modifiable,
    low-cost tooling, and scalability, demonstrates that wireless sensor networks
    can be used in the digitization of agriculture [2]. As they join a large number
    of sensor nodes into a network, wireless sensor networks represent the base for
    an extremely heterogeneous IoT environment in which there are many different technologies
    and communication standards. Such a heterogeneous environment enables optimal
    adjustment to different areas of sensor application. Every field of sensor application
    requires a suitable selection of communication systems and parameters to achieve
    reliable and energy-efficient communication. The aim of the implementation of
    wireless sensor networks in test environments is to connect sensor nodes, deployed
    at different remote locations, to servers used to store and process data in a
    reliable and energy-efficient manner. To enable applied research aimed at increasing
    the efficiency of implemented wireless sensor networks, the communication processes
    that occur within the networks are subjected to testing for the selected scenarios.
    The analyses include the specifics of communication in different scenarios regarding
    the need for continuous monitoring of network parameters and real-time communication.
    The source of energy required for the activities of the sensor nodes is primarily
    a battery. The sensor nodes can operate from several months up to several years.
    The battery cycle is affected by numerous different stress factors including temperature,
    discharge current, charge current, and state of charge ranges. Since the sensor
    node’s battery life cycle is one of the most severely limited resources in the
    network, for the implementation of the wireless sensor network especially in areas
    that are more difficult to access and areas that can be accessed less often, which
    is a typical example in digital agriculture, it is important to consider the optimization
    of energy consumption and to achieve the maximum possible energy savings. Therefore,
    in this paper, the configurations of wireless sensor networks concerning the optimization
    of the consumption of energy are analyzed. Optimization is analyzed in terms of
    the choice of adequate star-of-stars topology typical for LoRaWAN networks, data
    collection, as well as the set-up of network radio parameters. As already confirmed
    by other sources, for example [3,4], the sizes of the packets sent contribute
    significantly to energy consumption. Unlike in other studies conducted in this
    field, for example in [3,4], in this paper, special emphasis is given to finding
    the optimal packet size with regard to transmission rate in order to find the
    most energy-efficient size of the packet to be used in precision agriculture.
    For that reason, unlike other articles, this article gives an example of the contents
    of a packet that can be used in precision agriculture in order to prove that the
    6-bit packet is sufficient for efficient collection of parameters from the environment
    and higher energy-efficiency of communication, in contrast to the 11-bit packets
    used in standard commercially available equipment. The content and contributions
    of the paper are outlined in the following way: In Section 2, a review of the
    literature in the field of application of LoRa wireless sensor networks is presented,
    and the developments in the field carried out in this work are highlighted. In
    Section 3, the research methodology of issues related to the energy efficiency
    of LoRa sensor networks is presented, which includes the presented model of energy
    consumption of the LoRa sensor node, the defined parameters of wireless communication
    in LoRa networks, the selection of appropriate parameters for LoRa communication,
    the analysis of aspects of wireless communication based on LoRa with regard to
    the choice of appropriate volume of traffic in the LoRa network, proposed structure
    and format of LoRa packets, limitations based on LoRa time-on-air communication,
    as well as an explanation of unconfirmed and confirmed data transfer processes
    in the LoRa network. Furthermore, in Section 4, the evaluation and the optimization
    of energy consumption in LoRa sensor networks are analyzed in detail in selected
    scenarios, and the results of the collected measurements from the field as well
    as the results collected based on simulations are presented. The simulations are
    carried out on the basis of all collected parameters, which were previously shown
    by field measurements to guarantee energy-efficient communication. Finally, in
    Section 5, the most important remarks related to the selection of solutions that
    provide adequate energy efficiency of LoRa-based communication are highlighted.
    2. Literature Review The sensors intended to control the cultivation of agricultural
    crops can monitor environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    soil temperature, soil moisture, chemicals in the soil, leaf wetness, air flow,
    insolation, luminosity, and solar radiation. The application of IoT solutions
    is increasingly common in precision agriculture in greenhouses, orchards, and
    vineyards [5,6,7,8,9]. In order to optimize the parameters of wireless communication,
    it is necessary to carry out analyses of various communication aspects. Therefore,
    the optimization of parameters should be carried out to achieve reliable communication
    with minimal energy consumption, which is the subject of research in this article.
    An important criterion in the selection of appropriate technologies is low energy
    consumption, so that the battery-powered nodes achieve a sufficiently long autonomy
    and multi-year life cycle expectancy. Therefore, technologies from the group of
    Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, high-range low-power wireless
    technologies, are suitable for application in precision agriculture scenarios
    [10]. The specifics of LPWAN technologies are a long communication range for sending
    information over greater distances and low power consumption. These features make
    LPWAN technologies very practical for open-area IoT implementations. There are
    many LPWAN technologies and new ones are constantly emerging and improving, but
    currently, LoRa, Sigfox, and Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) are leaders in the field
    [11,12]. The advantage of the application of these technologies in networking
    relates to the fact that the end devices working with these technologies are designed
    to consume energy efficiently and minimally [13]. Low power and narrow bandwidth
    allow for very low power consumption used in operation [14]. Its low power associated
    with long-range communication makes LoRa the most prominent among LPWAN technologies
    [15]. Of all LPWAN technologies, LoRa has probably involved consideration of most
    scientific studies concerning problems, current solutions, and open issues [13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38].
    A significant number of surveys has been conducted with the aim of analyzing requirements,
    deployments, and challenges of LoRa technology [13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,37,38].
    Therefore, available surveys [13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,37], from 2019–2023
    are listed and briefly described hereafter. In [39], a systematic literature review
    of published studies on LoRa applications was conducted using articles from 2010–2019.
    The study [16] presents an overview of LoRa networking, covering the technological
    difficulties in setting up LoRa infrastructures, such as connection management,
    allocation of resources, consistent communications, and security. In [17], a comprehensive
    survey of LoRa from a systematic perspective is given. It includes analysis of
    LoRa communication processes, security, and its enabled applications. In [18],
    the landscape of available simulators for IoT and wireless sensor networks is
    explored and their performance is compared. Moreover, LoRa networking performance
    metrics, including range, throughput, energy usage, and security is studied in
    [13,19]. In [20], the literature survey presented in the paper describes LoRa
    performance under different scenarios and a few implementation obstacles of this
    technology. Furthermore, in the papers [21,22], a discussion of the advantages
    of LoRa over the existing technologies used in IoT is presented. Also, in [23,24],
    a detailed description of the LoRa technology is given with regard to existing
    security and reliability mechanisms. Also, in [38], a survey of Machine Learning
    techniques for wireless sensor networks is presented. Finally, in [37] a review
    of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented and a comparison was conducted
    among different wireless technologies or protocols, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G, LoRa, and SigFox. None of these surveys considered the methods
    of energy efficiency of LoRa implementations in precision agriculture based on
    the amount of network traffic and the size of sent packets with regard to transmission
    rate, which is the subject of research in this article. The majority of the research
    conducted on LoRa and LoRaWAN has been focused on features such as coverage, range,
    network capacity, throughput, delay, scalability, and robustness, for instance
    in [25,26,27,28,29,30,40,41,42]. However, limited consideration of features such
    as energy consumption has been given, unlike the considerations in this article.
    It is essential because many LoRa devices are not powered by the grid. Prompted
    by the challenges of energy consumption, some recent works have focused on the
    power dissipation of sensors within wireless sensor networks [15]. Although the
    analyses in the majority of the proposed papers suggested to estimate the amount
    of energy consumed by a sensor node, LoRa technology was not directly included
    in their energy models [43]. Thus, for instance, in [44], an energy model for
    ultra-low power consumption of sensor nodes was presented. However, the radio
    frequency module used in the study did not include LoRa technology. Another model
    of energy estimation was presented in [45] aimed to achieve low energy consumption
    of sensor nodes. In order to save energy, it was concluded that the microcontroller
    and the communication module must be idle as long as possible when they are not
    active. Although these papers provide useful results, LoRa technology was not
    considered in the performed analysis, as is the case in this article. Furthermore,
    some other studies which took LoRa communication into account did not study the
    optimization of the consumption of energy of LoRa sensor nodes. For instance,
    in [46], a comparison of LoRaWAN classes was presented and their energy consumption
    models were proposed. Although the obtained results are based on real measurements,
    the paper did not study the effects of LoRa parameters such as communication range,
    coding speed, and transmission power level on the total energy consumed, which
    is the subject of research in this article. The analyses presented in [31] deal
    with this topic to a limited measure, providing only incomplete estimates on parameters
    related to LoRaWAN energy efficiency. However, they did not consider the practical
    behavior of the hardware of the LoRaWAN device, nor the effect of the main LoRaWAN
    mechanism settings and parameters, which is also the subject of research in this
    article. Moreover, only a few works provided data relevant to the current consumption
    of LoRa and LoRaWAN devices, obtained from a manual or by experimental measurements
    [31,32,33,34,36,47]. Such details correspond to device states of sleep, transmission,
    as well as reception [47]. Although the developed models enable the characterization
    of lifetime and energy costs of LoRaWAN device, these models do not include, for
    instance, energy consumption used within the processing state of sensor units,
    which is also the subject of research in this article. In addition, based on the
    information relevant to transmit, receive, and sleep states of a LoRa/LoRaWAN
    device, a few analytical models of LoRa and LoRaWAN energy consumption have been
    published, for example, in [31,36]. They include the lifetime of sensor nodes
    and the energy cost of data delivery. However, these models are also very basic
    since consideration needs to be given to several other states for a LoRa and LoRaWAN
    device that exist and are involved in communication. These include, for instance,
    a detailed calculation of time for message transmission, provided only in [48].
    It is important to note that the aforementioned study only examines LoRa, and
    therefore does not model the use of acknowledgments and retransmission which are
    important mechanisms of the MAC layer defined in LoRaWAN, which is set to be the
    subject of research in this article. Although some studies show the energy consumption
    of sensor nodes based on both LoRa and LoRaWAN communication, the presented values
    are obtained from a data table or empirically [49,50,51,52,53,54,55]. However,
    the studies in question did not consider an energy model that can thoroughly estimate
    and optimize the energy consumption of sensor nodes, which is also the subject
    of research in this article. Considering the results of the research studies provided
    so far, as well as the aforementioned deficiencies in those studies, in this article
    a detailed analytical model of energy consumption of sensor nodes and energy cost
    of data delivery is provided. The model considers the hardware behavior and mechanisms
    of real LoRaWAN devices, as well as their physical and MAC layer parameters. The
    proposed energy consumption model is based on Class A, as the most energy-efficient
    LoRaWAN class. Based on the literature review, it can be concluded that this paper
    is among the first to specify a detailed analytical model of energy consumption
    and simulation of the energy cost of data delivery of sensor nodes. It considers
    both the real hardware behavior of LoRaWAN devices and real-case tests of data
    packet delivery in different specific fields of LoRa deployment scenarios. While
    the actual hardware behavior of LoRaWAN devices includes, for instance, their
    levels of power consumption in different modes of operation, the real-case tests
    of data packet delivery conducted in different specific LoRa field deployment
    scenarios enable decision making on whether a packet delivery confirmation is
    required in a particular application scenario or not. The defined energy model
    is supplemented by the optimization of LoRaWAN parameters important for the reduction
    in energy consumption of sensor nodes, such as spreading factor, coding rate,
    and bandwidth, as well as the generated traffic volume. It is necessary to emphasize
    that the impact of LoRaWAN parameters such as payload size, acknowledged transmission,
    coding rate, spreading factor, and communication range on the sensor node consumption
    is also studied in [15]. In contrast to the analyses in [15], in this paper, special
    emphasis is placed on the analysis of optimization of energy consumption with
    regard to packet transmission rate considering different sizes of data packets
    which are not all very common in commercial devices, as well as energy consumption
    aspects in different scenarios of LoRa network deployment. Furthermore, unlike
    the analyses carried out in [52], in which the battery lifespan is calculated
    without the use of acknowledgments, this paper presents the possibility of using
    acknowledgments to estimate the lifespan of batteries more precisely. Furthermore,
    the impact of deficiency of data delivery caused by degradation on the energy
    performance of LoRaWAN was considered. For actual analysis, the simulated models
    are derived based on measurements conducted in the real testbeds. The possibility
    of using acknowledgments or omitting them is also analyzed, based on the results
    collected by real measurements, in order to select the best case for the optimization
    of energy consumption. In addition, the models used in this paper also study the
    impact of collisions on LoRaWAN energy performance. Moreover, unlike the analyses
    in [53], in which the focus is placed on the optimization of the fixed LoRaWAN
    setup communication with only a single considered data rate, this paper analyzes
    the use of different available data rates to select the best method for the optimization
    of energy consumption. The model considers the possibility of the use of an adaptive
    data transmission rate, as presented by results of conducted simulations. Finally,
    unlike the analyses conducted in [3,4], which considered large-scale LoRa network
    deployments with up to 100 densely distributed sensor nodes, in this paper, analyses
    are conducted for precision agriculture application scenarios in which deployments
    of up to 20 optimally distributed sensor nodes are sufficient for the monitoring
    of environmental parameters. In addition, unlike the energy profile used in [3,4],
    the selected energy profile used in the simulation process is based on the estimated
    energy consumption of a transceiver [54] due to its energy efficiency and application
    in the conducted field measurements. All the procedures for modeling the energy
    aspects of LoRa communication processes applied in the model presented within
    this paper enable a more precise assessment of the optimal combinations of parameters
    to achieve a reduction in the energy consumption in the selected specific use
    cases, whereby a special emphasis is placed on the analysis results of the optimization
    of energy aspects related to defining the optimal packet size with regard to traffic
    rate. 3. Methodology 3.1. Energy Consumption Model of Lora Sensor Node The energy
    consumption modeling process represents an essential consideration when designing
    sensor nodes to monitor a specific application. For most applications, such as
    the ones presented in [55], the communicating sensors should perform the following:
    sense events, process the local information of sensed events, and transmit packets
    to the access point [56]. Each task consumes power over a given period. Therefore,
    an accurate energy consumption model of the sensor node is essential to estimate
    the sensor lifetime, as proven in [15,57]. Furthermore, the energy model allows
    the power consumption optimization of the sensor node. In order to study the sensor
    node autonomy, it is necessary to model the different operating modes of the sensor
    node. Then, the consumed energy of each mode can be determined, and the consumption
    energy model can be defined. Most of the time, the sensor node is put into sleep
    mode. That is a low-power mode, but the energy consumed in this mode can also
    impact the total energy consumption of the sensor node. The total consumed energy
    E_Total of the sensor node for one cycle is: E_Total = E_Active + E_Sleep, (1)
    where E_Sleep and E_Active represent the dissipated energy by the sensor node
    in the sleep mode and the total energy consumption during the active mode of the
    node microcontroller, respectively [15]. The duration of the sleep mode should
    be ≥99%, and the duration of the active mode should be ≤1% [15]. In addition,
    E_Sleep is expressed as: E_Sleep = P_Sleep · T_Sleep, (2) where P_Sleep and T_Sleep
    are the power consumption and the time duration in the sleep mode, respectively
    [15]. The total energy consumption in active mode E_Active is calculated as the
    sum of the energy consumption used for the operation of each part of the sensor
    node. Therefore, it is given by the following equation [15]: E_Active = E_WU +
    E_M + E_PROC + E_WUT + E_Tx + E_WUR + E_Rx, (3) where the consumed energies that
    should be considered are the ones for the system wake-up, data measurement, microcontroller
    processing, the wake-up of the transmitter, the transceiver’s transmission, the
    wake-up of the receiver, and the reception of the transceiver, respectively [15],
    as presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Energy consumption states of the sensor node.
    Energy consumption in specific operating modes can be determined regarding the
    current consumption of LoRa/LoRaWAN transceiver modules, as declared in the specifications
    and affirmed by conducted measurements, presented in Table 1. As can be seen,
    the sleep current ranges from 0.1 μA to 34 mA. Sleep current for the hardware
    platforms is up to several orders of magnitude greater than sleep current of their
    transceivers [58], which can be near 1 μA, or even lower than that [47]. In addition,
    the power consumption can be determined from the transceivers’ electrical specifications
    under the stated supply voltage conditions, as presented in Table 2. Table 1.
    Transceiver current consumption. Table 2. Transceiver power consumption. The output
    power is sensitive to the power supply voltage, and their performance is typically
    expressed at 3.3 V [64]. For instance, the HopeRF RFM95/96/97/98(W), used in the
    field measurements whose presentation is given in Section 4 of the paper, has
    a minimum output supply voltage of 2.4. V and a maximum of 3.7 V, which applies
    to the high-power +20 dBm operation [54]. According to [54], the following can
    be quoted: (a) Transmit mode of operation of the transceiver In transmit mode,
    the power consumption, presented in Table 2, is optimized only when packet data
    needs to be transmitted by enabling the following blocks: RF, PLL (used for calibration
    of the receiver), and PA (amplifier capable of yielding RF power) [64]. The transceivers
    feature three different RF power amplifiers [54]. Two of these, connected to RFO_LF
    and RFO_HF, can deliver up to +14 dBm and are not regulated for high power efficiency
    [65]. The third, PA, connected to the PA_BOOST pin, can deliver up to +20 dBm
    via a dedicated matching network [58]. The low-frequency PA_LF covers the lower
    bands (up to 525 MHz), while the high-frequency PA_HF covers the upper bands (from
    860 MHz). Finally, the high-power PA_HP, connected to the PA_BOOST pin, covers
    all frequency bands the transceiver addresses. (b) Listen mode of operation of
    the transceiver In this mode, the circuit spends most of the time in an idle state,
    during which only the RC oscillator is on. Then, periodically, the receiver wakes
    up and looks for an incoming signal. If a signal is detected, the receiver is
    kept on, and the data are analyzed. Otherwise, if there is no signal for a defined
    period of time, the receiver is switched off until the following receive period
    [64]. The radio stays mainly in a low-power mode during the listen mode. This
    fact results in very low average power consumption. (c) Receive mode of operation
    of the transceiver The receiver automatically restarts after a packet collision
    or after receiving a valid packet. In receive mode, the transceiver can detect
    packet collisions and restart the receiver. Collisions are detected by a sudden
    rise in received signal strength. This functionality can be useful in network
    configurations where many asynchronous slave nodes attempt periodic communication
    with a single master node [64]. Depending on the application and the environment,
    there are various ways to implement listen mode: wake on a Preamble Detect interrupt,
    wake on a SyncAddress interrupt, or wake on a Payload Ready interrupt [64]. 3.2.
    Energy Profile of LoRa Sensor Nodes Each sensor node is characterized by an energy
    profile and LoRa parameters. The node’s behavior is designed as specified by [70,71,72,73],
    as presented in Table 3. The energy consumption model based on LoRa, which estimates
    the consumed power of different states of sensor nodes, is used. The default energy
    profile used in the simulation process, whose presentation is given in Section
    4 of the paper, is based on the energy consumption of [54], due to its energy
    efficiency and application in conducted field measurements. Therefore, the energy
    consumption values of the selected transceiver listed in the specifications [54]
    are used. However, the simulations are not solely constrained to a single energy
    profile, since a comparison was made of the selected transceiver with other transceivers
    referenced in the literature relevant to the research area. The power consumption
    optimization in the selected scenarios is conducted by adopting specific power
    reduction settings of communication parameters. For instance, a reduction in the
    power consumption of the radio frequency (RF) mode is applied. As a result, it
    minimizes the total power consumption of sensor nodes since RF modules (for Tx
    and Rx) use considerable power. Table 3. Energy profiles of the sensor nodes.
    During the simulation process, different energy profiles are allocated to nodes,
    imitating various nodes, whereby the average values of energy consumption in different
    states are used. The different energy states of the simulated nodes are summarized
    in Table 3 according to sources in the cited literature and the technical report
    of the transceiver used in the conducted field measurements. A similar experiment
    has been conducted in [3], but there are differences between the energy profile
    in transmit and receive modes. As can be observed from Table 3, the power states
    that are considered are transmit, receive, sleep, and processing, as well as waking
    up and setting up the radio. The simulation process assumes that all nodes have
    an initial transmit power of 14 dBm, which conforms to the LoRaWAN specification.
    This power level, which corresponds to the low-power operation mode, enables lower
    energy consumption than the high-power operation mode, but also sufficient signal
    coverage of the area, which was previously proven by field measurements. Moreover,
    only the operations in the channels required by the LoRaWAN specification are
    considered, i.e., 868.1 MHz, 868.3 MHz, and 868.5 MHz. As already proven, optimizing
    the LoRa parameters such as SF, CR, and payload size are crucial in reducing the
    sensor node’s consumed energy. A spreading factor SF12 should be used in the second
    receive window [70]. However, in this work, a confirmed message was sent with
    SF10. A lower spreading factor results in a faster reception, yielding lower energy
    consumption at the node. The spreading factor SF10 is favored since the areas
    in the selected scenarios are well covered by the LoRa signal, which can be concluded
    according to the previously presented field measurements [52]. Moreover, a lower
    spreading factor results in faster data reception, which causes a lower node energy
    consumption. However, since the LoRa gateway handles a downlink channel by allowing
    for a higher duty cycle and higher transmit power operation, a loss of packets
    due to lowering the spreading factor can be resolved by transmitting data at higher
    power, as also stated in [74]. Therefore, within the simulation process, it is
    assumed that the downlink message scheduled for the first receive window (Rx1)
    uses the same frequency and data rate as the uplink messages. In the second receive
    window (Rx2), a fixed predefined frequency and data rate (for SF10) are used.
    3.3. Selection of Adequate Parameters for LoRa-Based Communication The LoRa-based
    access networks implemented in open spaces connect sensor nodes in different remote
    locations to centrally located storage and data-processing servers. The range
    of communication is an essential parameter when considering the effectiveness
    of implemented solutions regarding the implementation of sensor networks in remote
    areas to monitor environmental and agronomic parameters. In most cases, the high
    data transfer rate is not so significant. However, it is necessary to ensure the
    energy-efficient transmission of data over relatively long distances. The parameters
    described hereafter affect LoRa transmission range and energy efficiency [54].
    LoRa operates in the sub-GHz unlicensed frequency bands. The LoRa systems operate
    at the ISM frequency bands, and the carrier frequency (CF), the center frequency
    used for the transmission band, is 863 MHz to 870 MHz in Europe. Moreover, there
    are also some regulatory constraints in most countries on the permissible occupied
    bandwidth (BW) [54]. Increasing the signal bandwidth (BW) allows a higher effective
    data rate to be used, thereby reducing the transmission time at the expense of
    reduced sensitivity of the receiver. It is possible to choose between 125 kHz,
    250 kHz, or 500 kHz. However, in the multi-data-rate channel mode, the gateway
    is limited to a 125 kHz bandwidth with typically eight channels, even though the
    maximum bandwidth of LoRa is 500 kHz. Therefore, if there is a need for a high
    data transfer rate, the best choice is the value of 500 kHz. On the other hand,
    if it is necessary to achieve a long communication range, it is necessary to choose
    the bandwidth value of 125 kHz. The greater the bandwidth, the shorter the time-on-air
    value, and the sensitivity of the receiver is better. However, a higher time-on-air
    value will also mean higher energy requirements. The spreading factor and error
    correction rate allow the optimization of the trade-off between occupied bandwidth,
    data rate, link budget improvement, and immunity to interference. The spread spectrum
    LoRa modulation is performed by representing each bit of payload information by
    multiple chirps of information. A chirp is a sinusoidal signal whose frequency
    monotonically increases (upchirp) or decreases (downchirp) [60]. A chirp is a
    pulse that sweeps from fLow(−BW/2) to fHigh(+BW/2) [60]. The number of chirps
    forms a symbol. For instance, if a symbol value is between 1 and 128, the number
    would be one of the combinations of 27 = 128 chirps. The Spreading Factor (SF)
    represents the number of chirps per symbol. Its value is an integer number between
    6 and 12. The values of SF from 6 to 12 represent 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048,
    and 4096 chirps/symbol, respectively. The greater the SF value, the more ability
    the receiver has to remove the noise from the signal. Thus, the greater the SF
    value, the more time is taken to send a packet, but a higher range will also be
    achieved because the receiver’s sensitivity is better. For example, if the expansion
    factor is minimal, i.e., SF = 6, a higher speed can be achieved, but with a reduction
    in the possible range. SF = 6 presents a particular use case for the highest data-rate
    transmission possible with the LoRa modem. The spreading factor must be known
    in advance on both transmit and receive sides of the link, as different spreading
    factors are orthogonal to each other. Generally, according to the LoRaWAN specifications,
    the spreading factor control is limited to 6 unique spreading factors going from
    spreading factor 12, or the lowest data rate, to spreading factor 7, for the highest
    data rate. This means up to six sensor nodes can transmit data simultaneously
    on the same channel. Due to interference, some of the data bits can be lost, so
    the error correction bits are used to recover the original lost data bits. LoRa
    uses Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques to increase the robustness of radio
    communication links. FEC requires error correction bits, redundant bits, to be
    added to the data. Thus, error coding incurs a transmission overhead. Although
    FEC reduces the data throughput, it increases the receiver’s sensitivity. LoRa
    defined a set of values which are referred to as Code ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} to calculate
    the Coding Rate (CR) based on the following equation [67]: CR= 4 4+Code (4) Hence,
    CR = {4/5, 4/6, 4/7, 4/8}, and it denotes that every four useful bits are encoded
    by 5, 6, 7, or 8 transmission bits, while the overhead ratio is 1.25, 1.5, 1.75,
    and 2, respectively. The coding rate could maximize the data rate if fewer code
    bits are used. The smaller the coding rate is, the higher the time on air is to
    transmit data, but the prolonged data transfer time will also affect the battery
    consumption. The packet header can be optionally included in the coding rate for
    use by the receiver. However, if more redundant bits are sent to the receiver,
    LoRa will consume more power. Therefore, in response to channel conditions, the
    coding rate and the robustness to interference can be changed. In addition, the
    relationship among LoRa transmission parameters is also relevant for energy consumption.
    If the bandwidth of LoRa is constant, the chirp rate differs according to the
    SF [67]: R c =BW· R s = B W 2 2 SF  [chirps/s] (5) For each SF, the orthogonality
    of the chirp prevents interference with any other [62]. Thus, when two or more
    transmitters use the same channel to transmit data with different SFs simultaneously,
    the packets do not interfere with each other [68]. With knowledge of the key LoRa
    parameters, bandwidth, and the spreading factor, the LoRa symbol rate can be controlled
    [54]: R s = BW 2 SF  [symbols/s] (6) SF= log 2 ( R c R s ) (7) Moreover, depending
    on the SF in use, LoRa bit rate ranges [54]: R b =SF· [ 4 4+CR ] [ 2 SF BW ] ·1000
    [b/s] (8) Data rate (DR) can also be expressed considering LoRa transmission parameters
    [54]: DR=SF· BW 2 SF ·CR [b/s] (9) The higher the SF and the lower the channel
    bandwidth, the lower the data rate is and, thus, the longer the data transmission
    time is [68]. The analysis of the effect of different values of SF and CR LoRa
    radio parameters on the consumed energy and range is performed in [69]. According
    to the presented results, the following can be concluded. When the SF value is
    high, the time necessary for data transmission increases. This means that the
    sensor node consumes more power to transmit data. The reason for setting a high
    SF value is to maximize the transmission range as one of the most critical factors
    in field deployment, as also proved in [15]. Furthermore, when the coding rate
    increases, the data transmission time and the consumed energy decrease. Therefore,
    when a long range needs to be ensured, energy consumption can be regulated by
    the CR factor. By increasing the CR value from 4/8 to 4/5, the energy consumption
    can be reduced while maintaining the maximal range enabled by the high SF parameter
    value [69]. However, this depends on the radio conditions because it could imply
    more retransmissions which would cause more energy consumption. 3.4. Choosing
    the Adequate Volume of Traffic in the LoRa Network The aim of analyzing the impact
    of the amount of transmitted network traffic within the network on the energy
    consumption for one-hop star topology scenarios is analyzed in [69], as quoted
    within this chapter. First, the scenario where all nodes send data at the same
    time interval, a typical case in rural scenarios for sending data collected from
    the field, is analyzed. It is concluded that node placement in a star topology
    presents a vital determinant of sensor node lifetime. However, although adequate
    signal coverage of the area must be achieved, the nodes should be as close as
    possible to the gateway to reduce energy consumption. Moreover, regarding the
    energy depletion of individual nodes, it is concluded that the star topology is
    more suitable for application to sensor networks than the cluster topology, in
    which the energy of cluster head (CH) nodes is depleted the fastest. Since CH
    nodes are difficult to replace, this causes the loss of functionality of the entire
    cluster, while in the star topology, the depletion of energy of an individual
    node does not cause such a loss in data delivery from the area it covers with
    its signal. In addition, it is concluded that in scenarios where sending a more
    considerable amount of data is unnecessary, as in the case of monitoring the state
    of yield, energy savings should be achieved by sending an adequately determined
    smaller volume of data from sensors. Finally, it is concluded that significantly
    less energy consumption can be noted within the same time interval when sending
    data with higher delay, i.e., less frequently. Thus, from the presented results,
    applying LoRa technology is an adequate solution in IoT scenarios where fast transmission
    of large amounts of data is not required, as in precision agriculture. In precision
    agriculture, additional energy savings can be achieved by sending smaller data
    sets over extended periods between transmissions. Considering these conclusions,
    optimizing energy consumption in a LoRa network requires consideration of the
    optimal packet size. To save energy, sending as little total traffic as possible
    is necessary. Therefore, optimizing packets to maximize information transfer in
    the minimum number of bits is vital [75]. Sending the highest value information,
    with the right balance of redundancy, compactness, and timeliness, should provide
    the best results in applying a sensor network based on LoRaWAN for monitoring
    environmental and agronomic data essential for precision agriculture. The LoRaWAN
    specification, defined for each worldwide region, provides for a maximum data
    payload size N. This maximum payload size varies by data rate (DR) because of
    the maximum on-air transmission time allowed for each regional specification.
    For example, for EU863-870, the maximum payload size for DR0-DR2 is 51 bytes,
    for DR3 it is 115 bytes, for DR4-DR7 it is 222 bytes, while for DR8-DR15 it is
    not defined [75]. If DR limits are restricted only to higher values, for instance,
    never below the chosen DR, this also limits how far away signals can be received,
    so this should be considered when choosing a packet length. Moreover, while 51
    bytes in the payload in Europe may not be very restrictive, in the regions that
    operate in the 900 MHz ISM band, the lowest DR is restricted to 11 bytes [75].
    However, for all DRs other than DR0, the available maximum packet size is equal
    to or greater than the EU863-870 region. Therefore, if the same packet format
    should be used in all regions, and DR0 is chosen to be supported (since a lower
    DR typically means a more extended range), the maximum payload length for any
    packet would be 11 bytes. If the sensor node is restricted to operate above the
    DR0, the maximum payload becomes 51 bytes. Since the sensors can monitor parameters
    related to both the environment and the state of the crops, the data in the packet
    payload is used to transmit measured values, for example, temperature, humidity,
    pressure, solar radiation, and rain. When sending data packets, it is crucial
    to maximize the transfer of useful information. Hence, it must be considered that
    the payload contents are used to maximize the transfer of useful information with
    minimal transmission bandwidth. Therefore, a critical aspect of data transmission
    planning refers to the processes for determining the necessary update rate of
    information to make a minimum number of samples. A reasonable sampling rate should
    be used to capture the original data. Moreover, for highly periodic measurements,
    as is the case for monitoring of most parameters related to precision agriculture,
    an adequate sampling rate will result in an accurate representation of the measured
    values. Thus, more frequent data delivery is necessary for monitoring data related
    to the amount of precipitation essential for irrigation procedures, especially
    in the rapid occurrence of short-term storms. In these cases, it is necessary
    to take several samples per hour to assess the current state as accurately as
    possible. It is logical to group all readings into the same packet in the case
    of sensors with multiple sensor elements that have synchronized measurements.
    In the case of group readings, bits are often arranged in registers of a fixed
    size. However, in this case, there is an unnecessary waste of resources allocated
    for unused bits. For example, some sensors have 10- or 12-bit resolution, while
    LoRaWAN provides slots of 8 bits (or multiples of 8) for transmission, where it
    is possible that some of these bits remain unused. Therefore, optimizing the data
    transfer between devices is necessary to maximize the transfer of useful information
    in the minimum number of bytes. In a group reading, the process of maximizing
    data transfer in the fewest bits, i.e., the process of bit packing, takes advantage
    of binary payload data transmission where payload bits are sent one after the
    other to ensure a compact flow of information. An example of such a message format
    as can be found at the commercially available all-in-one sensor weather stations
    is presented in Table 4. The values presented in Table 4 represent the collected
    data and contents of the actual packet with a payload of 11 bytes. Table 4. Packet
    payload of 11 bytes. However, an essential aspect of bit packing is ensuring the
    appropriate scale and precision of the data. Many physical measurements can be
    compressed into smaller data representations, so sending more bits than required
    for the same data is inefficient. For example, for transferring information about
    environmental temperature, an 8-bit representation can be used instead of the
    11-bit. It enables the representation of a temperature range from −40 °C to +87.5
    °C, sufficient to display the required temperatures with high accuracy. The same
    applies to other environmental parameters monitored by sensors, such as the relative
    humidity sensor, which can measure environmental humidity or soil moisture at
    different depths, and the pressure sensor or rain gauge which is used to determine
    the maximum instantaneous rainfall rate. Irrigation planning based on monitoring
    current conditions in the environment carried out by sensor nodes represents a
    relevant example of the increasingly necessary application of sensor networks
    in precision agriculture, especially regarding the necessity of optimal water
    utilization, which is essential in the face of increasingly frequent water shortages.
    The proposed 6-byte payload format shown in Table 5 corresponds to the optimal
    data set for monitoring environmental parameters essential for the crop irrigation
    process, which provides the same amount of useful information as the previously
    shown 11-byte payload, but within the reduced packet size. Table 5. Packet payload
    of 6 bytes. 3.5. Time on Air Constraints of Communication Based on LoRa To optimize
    the overall energy consumption in the network, LoRaWAN facilitates the control
    of the air time and data rate [3]. To effectively manage the regulatory constraints
    of time on air and receiver sensitivity, it is necessary to be able to calculate
    the total on-the-air transmission time of a LoRa packet for a given configuration
    of communication parameters, i.e., spreading factor (SF), coding rate (CR) and
    signal bandwidth (BW), as defined hereafter. For calculating the time on air,
    it is convenient to define the symbol duration Tsymb. The symbol duration of a
    LoRa symbol is defined as [76]: T symb = 2 SF BW , (10) This is the time taken
    to send chirps at the chirp rate, recalling that the bandwidth defines the chirp
    rate. The symbol duration is based on the spreading factor (SF) and the bandwidth
    (BW). Each LoRa symbol comprises 2SF chirps, each covering the entire bandwidth.
    Every LoRa packet consists of a preamble and data. The preamble contains only
    upchirps, while the data part comprises upchirps with discontinuities (the position
    of the discontinuities in frequency is what encodes the transmitted information).
    Therefore, LoRa packet duration can be calculated as the sum of the duration of
    the preamble and the transmitted packet. The preamble length is calculated as
    follows [54]: T preamble =( n preamble +4.25) T symb , (11) where npreamble is
    the number of programmed preamble symbols. The payload duration depends upon the
    header mode enabled, implicit (headerless) or explicit (with header) modes. The
    number of symbols that make up the packet payload and header are given by [54]:
    payloadSymbNb=8+max(ceil( 8PL−4SF+28+16−20H 4(SF−2DE) )(CR+4),0), (12) with the
    following dependencies: the number of payload bytes PL, the spreading factor SF,
    the header (H = 0 when header is enabled, and H = 1 when no header is present),
    the data rate optimization (DE = 1 when the low data rate optimization is enabled,
    DE = 0 when it is disabled), and the coding rate CR (from 1 to 4). If the time
    on air requires reduction, and the packet length is known in advance, then the
    header information can be removed once the destination of the packet is known.
    The payload duration is then the symbol period multiplied by the number of payload
    symbols [54]. T payload =payloadSymbNb·Tsymb, (13) Then, the time-on-air, or packet
    duration, is simply the sum of the preamble and payload duration [54]: T packet
    = T preamble + T payload , (14) LoRaWAN devices must comply with the regulations
    imposed in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands in which
    they operate [3]. These regulations include a limitation in the duty cycle of
    transmission and excited transmit power [77]. The duty cycle indicates the fraction
    of time a resource is busy. LoRaWAN enforces a per-band duty cycle limitation.
    In Europe, duty cycles are regulated by Section 7.2.3 of the ETSI EN300.220 standard.
    Since every radio device must comply with the regulated duty cycle limits, this
    applies to sensor nodes and gateways. For example, ETSI regulations limit the
    duty cycle over one-hour intervals, whereas LoRaWAN enforces compliance with such
    limitations over the interval between transmitting a message and the next one.
    Moreover, on The Things Network’s public community network, a Fair Use Policy
    applies, which limits the uplink air time to 30 s per day per node and the downlink
    messages to 10 messages per day per node. If private networks are used, these
    limits do not apply, but the governmental and LoRaWAN limits apply. To stay within
    these limits, the easiest way to do this is to calculate how much air time each
    packet consumes to choose a good transmit interval. For instance, as presented
    in Table 6, the calculator [48] is used for the chosen packet payload size (the
    maximum of which is 51 for low data rate (SF12), up to about 222 bytes for the
    best conditions (SF7)), the chosen packet header size (which is at least 13 bytes
    for the header for regular uplinks, or a total of 23 bytes for a Join Request),
    the chosen coding rate (from 4/5 to 4/8, where higher values mean more overhead),
    the chosen number of preamble symbols (which is 8 for all regions but can be different
    using plain LoRa),the chosen bandwidth (which is typically 125 kHz, but can be
    250 kHz or 500 kHz), the chosen spreading factor (where “higher” means more range
    and better reception, but also more air time), and the chosen total air time to
    send the entire packet (in ms). Therefore, as presented in Table 6, the calculated
    values include the TTN Fair Access Policy-based number of average messages/day
    and average messages/hour when sending all day, as well as the duty-cycle-based
    time between the start of the next packet in the same sub-band. ETSI regulations
    limit the duty cycle to one-hour intervals so as not to crash its servers by generating
    excessive traffic, and not to directly improve energy savings. Table 6. Maximum
    number of packets according to duty cycle. As can be seen from the conducted calculations
    presented in Table 6, by complying with the TTN Fair Access Policy, since more
    messages/hour can be sent for smaller packets, for a maximum packet size of 51
    bytes, a total of 10 packets/hour cannot be exceeded. The control of the air time
    is achieved by adapting the data rate, i.e., by changing SF values. Also, the
    values are presented for the three chosen values of packet application payload
    sizes. As the presented values show, the decrease in the spreading factor results
    in a lower air time. However, a higher air time allows the receiver to demodulate
    the message better. Instead of defining a specific data rate, LoRaWAN specifies
    the data rate as a combination of a spreading factor and bandwidth [47,78]. It
    can be seen that DR3 uses SF9, while DR2 uses SF10. Hence, with DR3, a double
    amount of data can be sent simultaneously, compared to DR2 [4]. Similarly, since
    the symbol time for DR3 is half the symbol time for DR2, there will also be half
    the energy per bit if the same transmit power is used. Likewise, this is also
    true for SNR [4]. 3.6. Battery Lifespan Choosing the optimum SF parameter, which
    enables the highest possible transmission speed, leads to a longer battery life
    [48]. Despite the better range, a sensor node will consume more energy when transmitting
    with a higher spreading factor [3]. Therefore, in addition to modifying the spreading
    factor value, the transmission power can be altered to increase the range further
    or decrease the energy consumption. Considering the limitation in the duty cycle,
    after transmitting a message, every sensor node needs to wait Toff seconds before
    transmitting data again in that band (periodicity) [54]: T off = T air T dc −
    T air , (15) In the case of sending a message with a payload size of 51 bytes
    and a spreading factor of 12 while respecting a duty cycle limit of 1% (which
    dictates that the time for data transmit/hour is 36 s), the time off is 4 min
    and 57 s. Since the LoRa gateway utilizes a downlink channel allowing for a higher
    duty cycle and higher transmit power operation, a loss due to lowering the spreading
    factor can be resolved by transmitting at a higher power [4]. However, an optimal
    combination of energy consumption regarding limited battery life should be achieved.
    To achieve a longer sensor node battery lifetime, e.g., in the order of years,
    the LoRaWAN nodes need batteries with greater capacity than typical button cell
    batteries, e.g., of AA type, but these are more expensive [47]. The results presented
    in [47] show that an appropriately configured LoRaWAN sensor node powered by a
    battery of 2400 mAh can achieve a 1-year lifetime if sending a message every 5
    min and a theoretical lifetime of 6 years for infrequent communication. Moreover,
    an energy consumption of 0.05–0.44 mJ and a battery lifetime between one and 13
    years, respectively, are obtained for a device running on two AA batteries when
    transferring data from 1 to 10 times per hour [53]. For the chosen packet payload
    sizes, the calculator [79] is applied to estimate the differences in energy consumption
    for several types of batteries which can supply sensor nodes, as presented in
    Table 7. The assumptions considered are processing power of 15 mW for 5 ms, confirmed
    reading of a sensor value per each period, and sleep mode consumption of 10 µW.
    The worst-case results have been calculated for the usage of SF12, transmission
    power of +14 dBm, and with the acknowledgment in the second Rx window. The best-case
    results have been calculated for the usage of SF7, transmission power of +2 dBm,
    and with the acknowledgment in the first Rx window. As can be seen from the comparison
    of the collected results, a substantial energy consumption reduction can be achieved
    by transmitting smaller data packets. Table 7. Battery lifespan. Since sensor
    nodes are supplied with cell batteries upon delivery, purchasing a solar panel
    initially represents an additional cost in contrast to the sensor nodes, which
    are only battery-powered. The cost of a set of cell batteries represents approximately
    12 times the cost of a cheaper sensor or approximately 2 times the cost of a more
    expensive sensor [80]. Additionally, the cost of a solar panel represents 8 times
    the cost of a cheaper sensor, or 4/3 times the cost of a more expensive sensor.
    For instance, while temperature and luminosity sensors are cheaper, humidity and
    atmospheric pressure sensors are examples of more expensive sensors. In the case
    when the duration of the battery’s lifetime is short and frequent battery changes
    are required, the application of solar power supply represents an effective solution
    in the long term. However, due to the limited capacity and lifetime of batteries,
    they need to be replaced after a particular time, even if solar power is used.
    However, in sensor networks where more sensor nodes are implemented, the energy
    consumption per sensor node for the exact total generated network traffic in the
    same period becomes lower than when fewer sensor nodes are implemented. Thereby,
    the battery life per each sensor node is extended, and the battery needs to be
    changed less often, which demands less energy from the solar collector. In Table
    7 data related to battery consumption are presented in cases where different packet
    sizes, different numbers of messages, and different network parameters, such as
    SF, are used. As presented, the longest battery life is achieved when smaller
    packets are sent, when packets are sent less often, and when SF7 is used, and
    not SF12. 4. Results and Discussion 4.1. Evaluation of Communication Range and
    Channel Attenuation Modeling Different scenarios are selected to analyze, in actual
    conditions, the propagation of LoRa signals at different distances and in different
    environments. The propagation of LoRa signals in rural environments (with and
    without obstructions such as a forest), suburban environments, and urban environments
    are considered. Two stations, transmitting and receiving, are examined, providing
    point-to-area and point-to-point communication services. The environments in which
    line-of-sight is impossible due to obstructions are taken into consideration in
    the conducted analyses. Some realistic case study scenarios are considered, in
    which the distance between the receiver and the transmitter is less than 100 m,
    500 m, 2 km, 5 km, and 7 km, respectively. Therefore, the chosen distances between
    the receiver and the transmitter are much lower than the theoretical and experimental
    range described in the literature [81], which refers to open environments under
    line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. In the rural LOS scenario, the transmitter antenna
    is placed above a grove of trees. In contrast, in the considered NLOS scenarios,
    the transmitter antenna is positioned so that the signal is partially propagated
    through trees or the signal propagation is partially obstructed by buildings.
    In the analyzed cases conducted in this research, the gateway is placed at the
    height of approximately 65 m above the ground. The field experiments are conducted
    using hardware prototypes based on LoRa devices to determine the state and range
    of communication links. In real testbeds, measurements are made using an RFM95/96/97/98(W)
    LoRa module to determine how parameters such as transceiver antenna gain, spreading
    factor, and coding rate influence communication. Different parameters are used
    to measure signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio at various distances between
    the transmitter and receiver and to determine whether it is possible to achieve
    reliable communication in different areas, and under what conditions. The conducted
    study considers operation in the European region, in the EU863–870 ISM band, where
    three default channels are defined: 868.10, 868.30, and 868.50 MHz. Each of these
    channels has a bandwidth of 125 kHz, uses LoRa modulation, and must allow data
    rates from 0.3 kbps to 5 kbps (DR0 to DR5), depending on the SF value set. Considering
    the compromise between range and interference immunity, and energy consumption,
    two transmission power modes, a low-power (LP) mode and a high-power (HP) mode,
    are compared, and their impact on the communication range is analyzed. The LP
    mode with the transmission power of +14 dBm considers high efficiency and low
    current consumption (25 mW). The HP mode with the transmission power of +20 dBm
    considers a more extended range and robustness but has a higher current consumption
    (100 mW). The duty cycle of transmission at +20 dBm is limited to 1%. Although
    the transceiver supports transmit power of up to +20 dBm, according to frequency
    regulations, such power is permitted only for one frequency channel. However,
    any of the six channels can use +14 dBm. The LoRaWAN protocol is used for long-distance,
    low-power communication. A common problem that occurs in for instance, remote
    rural areas, as well as in some other specific deployments, such as in forests
    [82], is the lack of a seamless power source that allows the installation of gateways
    near an area that needs to be covered by the LoRa signal. Also, this causes the
    occasionally complex interconnection of gateways with the infrastructure of the
    core network. In these cases, it is necessary to use a more extended communication
    range. While communication over long distances of multiple kilometers is used
    for IoT, the narrow bandwidth can make it unreliable, and there may be significant
    losses in the delivery of sent packages. Moreover, since the line of sight is
    not always free of obstacles from vegetation or buildings, this imposes NLOS conditions
    that impair transmission quality. The performance metric used is packet delivery
    percentage. Therefore, the conclusions about the transmission quality, according
    to measured packet delivery percentage, and the combinations of communication
    parameters that give the best results are presented hereafter, as well as in Figure
    2 and Figure 3. Figure 2. Delivery rates of packets with the maximal size. Figure
    3. Delivery rates of packets with a minimum size. As presented within the NLOS
    scenarios, some unsuccessful transmissions of packets are noted. The number of
    unsuccessful transmissions is more significant with a greater distance and less
    visibility between the transmitter and the receiver. During the measurement and
    data-collection process, the LoRa signal’s bandwidth was set to 125 kHz. Moreover,
    the transceiver is configured to use different values of spreading factor, two
    of which are selected for more detailed analyses. These are SF = 7 (minimum value)
    and SF = 10 (optimal energy consumption if a more extended range needs to be ensured).
    Furthermore, the LP mode with the transmission power of +14 dBm for low current
    consumption (25 mW) and the HP mode with the transmission power of +20 dBm with
    higher current consumption (100 mW) are chosen. Table 8 shows the amount of delivered
    packets compared to packets sent with different configurations of SF and CR network
    parameters in different scenarios. Accordingly, 100% indicates that all sent data
    has been received. Circled values are those in which the most efficient data transfer
    was achieved in each of the scenarios, considering the combination of network
    parameters that represents a more energy efficient solution. Table 8. Measured
    packet delivery ratio. The presented results indicate that, among all considered
    scenarios, the most critical packet deliveries are in remote suburban and rural
    areas with no direct optical visibility since NLOS conditions impair transmission
    quality. Therefore, data with the best values for a particular scenario were selected
    among the obtained data. In doing so, the differences in the obtained results
    should be considered with regard to the selected packet sizes. The selected packet
    size values were Pmax = 51 bytes and Pmin = 11 bytes. As shown in Table 8, during
    the scenario selection process, the selected scenarios (the ones with the white
    background) are those in which the percentage of successful transmissions is the
    highest among all collected results within each particular scenario. However,
    when several options have the same percentage of packet delivery, the combinations
    of communication parameters that enable lower energy consumption are chosen within
    the selection process. According to previously conducted analyses, they include
    combinations in which smaller transceiver power values are selected (LP mode,
    compared to HP mode) due to lower energy consumption, a lower value of the SF
    parameter (7, compared to 10), if possible, considering the quality of communication
    (the higher percentage of packet delivery), and the higher value of the CR parameter
    (4/5). The presented results reveal that there is no packet loss up to a distance
    of 500 m, regardless of the NLOS conditions. Moreover, within 2 km and at a more
    extended range from the transmitter, in the case of NLOS (non-line-of-sight blocked
    by some obstacles and possible interference from other radio systems), there are
    situations where a complete loss of communication occurs. However, the number
    of delivered packets can be increased with adequately selected communication parameters,
    as, for instance, higher SF and, if necessary, lower CR values since combinations
    with minimum CR are more susceptible to noise. Moreover, the following must be
    observed. Despite some sources, the packet delivery level increases with the amount
    of data sent. Also, with a shorter packet length, the percentage of packet delivery
    is higher in some cases. Therefore, even in NLOS conditions at distances over
    5 km, it is possible to achieve communication, while it is necessary to consider
    the usage of higher SF values. In further analyses of the quality of communication,
    the performance metrics used on the receiving end are the Received Signal Strength
    Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The conducted analyses consider
    the power received at the end of the symmetrical half-duplex communication link
    between the transmitter and the receiver. Measurements of received signal strength
    (RSSI) and noise impact on the signal (SNR) enabled conclusions about the transmission
    quality concerning the achieved packet delivery rate, as presented hereafter,
    with the highlighted combinations of communication parameters that produce the
    best results. The RSSI measures the incoming signal power at the RF input port,
    evaluated within the receiver bandwidth. This value is absolute in units of dBm
    and with a resolution of 0.5 dB. The RSSI value is usually used to determine the
    most significant possible distance between the transmitter and the receiver since
    the signal strength decreases as the distance between the transmitter and the
    receiver increases [52]. However, the signal strength also depends on the interference,
    i.e., the noise level. Therefore, the RSSI can sometimes indicate incorrect positioning
    of equipment [83]. In order to minimize the effects of obstacles on communication
    between the receiver and transmitter as much as possible, during all measurements,
    the gateway was placed at a height slightly above 60 m. Nevertheless, even then,
    direct visibility between the sensor node and the gateway was not enabled because
    the sensor node, considering its purpose, was placed too low to receive the most
    valuable results of the measurement. Moreover, the value of signal versus noise
    represents the comparison of the signal strength to the noise power. It is denoted
    as SNR, and its unit of expression is dB. SNR is the best indicator of obstacles
    in signal transmission. A positive SNR value means the signal is stronger than
    the noise, and a negative SNR means that the noise overpowers the signal [84].
    For the listed combinations of communication parameter settings, measurements
    of RSSI and SNR values are carried out using the RFM95/96/97/98(W) LoRa module.
    For the signal strength at shorter distances, higher RSSI values are obtained.
    The obtained RSSI values are around −80 dBm at distances less than 100 m, at distances
    of 500 m between −100 and −110 dBm, and at greater distances from −110 to −130
    dBm. Moreover, with increasing distance between the transmitter and the receiver,
    the values of the SNR parameter decrease. In NLOS scenarios, the influence of
    obstacles on the SNR levels can be noted as well. The SNR values become negative
    at distances ≥2 km, which means that the received signal operates below the noise
    floor. In addition, the moderate success of the collected transmissions within
    each scenario is calculated for the measured range of RSSI and SNR values, and
    some unsuccessful transmissions are noted. Finally, as presented, the number of
    lost packets is recorded for the RSSI parameter values less than −110 dBm and
    the negative SNR parameter values. According to the specifications of the transceiver
    used in the measurements [54], under an extended range mode of operation, and
    in the case of 125 kHz bandwidth, the following RF sensitivity levels can be realized:
    −118 dBm for SF = 6, −123 dBm for SF = 7, −126 dBm for SF = 8, −129 dBm for SF
    = 9, −132 dBm for SF = 10, −133 dBm for SF = 11, and −136 dBm for SF = 12. A message
    is received if the signal strength is higher than the receiver’s sensitivity.
    During the measurements, the LoRa signal’s bandwidth was set to 125 kHz, and the
    transceiver was configured to use the different values of spreading factors. As
    presented in Figure 4, obtained from the analysis of the collected results, this
    enabled receiver sensitivity of up to approximately −130 dBm. Figure 4. Limits
    of reliable data transmission. (a) Original picture after conducted measurements;
    (b) Retouched version of original picture with the displayed rectangle within
    which confirmations of packet delivery are required, and black line on the left
    of which packets have not been delivered. The results presented in Figure 4 and
    Figure 5 were obtained from approximately five hundred conducted measurements
    of SNR and RSSI values, as described in more detail in [52]. Several spots with
    missing values were found in Figure 4, evident after analyzing the collected data
    from Figure 5 and from all additional sets of SNR and RSSI values with SF7-SF10
    [52]. The spots were then filled and values were calibrated. Therefore, Figure
    4 was updated from scratch and presented in this form after the retouching process
    to obtain a complete view of the values. According to the collected results about
    the unsuccessful transmissions, it can be concluded that for SNR[dB] < 0, for
    the purpose of a reliable data transmission, confirmations, i.e., acknowledgments,
    are also necessary. The results of the conducted research in this paper are first
    collected for all measurements in all scenarios to obtain Figure 5 presenting
    the limits of reliable data transmission. Based on it, it is possible to check
    whether the measurement results obtained in real time fit into the areas where
    an acknowledgment of packet delivery is required or not. If the measurement data
    is within the framed area (i.e., if values of RSSI are between −120 dBm and −110
    dBm), there is a higher probability that a packet delivery confirmation is required
    and it can be sent. For RSSI values lower than −120 dBm (i.e., if values are between
    −130 dBm and −120 dBm) the loss of packets occurs and confirmation of its delivery
    is necessary. Figure 5. Comparison of measured RSSI and SNR values. The values
    of SNR at which transmission errors, i.e., BER, occur within the communication
    process depend on the value of the SF parameter and, to some extent, on the CR
    values as well [76,85,86]. To quantify this, it is assumed that all losses are
    caused by channel gain variability [86]. To reduce data transmission losses in
    LoRa communication, it is possible to use the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism
    for optimizing data rates, air time, and energy consumption in the network. The
    ADR mechanism controls a sensor node’s spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission
    power to optimize device power consumption while ensuring that messages are still
    received at the gateways. Generally, the sensor nodes close to gateways should
    use a lower spreading factor and a higher data rate, while sensor nodes further
    away should use a high spreading factor because they need a higher link budget.
    When ADR is in use, the network server is capable of increasing the data rate
    and can indicate to the sensor node that it should reduce its transmission power,
    while the node can use an automatic data rate reduction when it detects that it
    is not receiving any response from the network. It is important to note that ADR
    should be enabled only if a sensor node has stable RF conditions. The network
    server takes the 20 most recent uplinks as the input for the optimal data rate,
    starting when the ADR bit is set. These measurements contain the frame counter,
    SNR, and the number of gateways that received each uplink. The maximum SNR of
    the last 20 received uplink messages is used to determine the quality of the link
    between the node and gateway. If the SNR is lower than required (e.g., if BW =
    125 kHz is considered, for SF = 6: SNR = −5 dB, for SF = 7 (DR5): SNR = −7.5 dB,
    for SF = 8 (DR4): SNR = −10 dB, for SF = 9 (DR3): SNR = −12.5 dB, for SF = 10
    (DR2): SNR = −15.5 dB, for SF = 11 (DR1): SNR = −17.5 dB, and for SF = 12 (DR0):
    SNR = −20 dB), the network server tries to decrease the data rate or increase
    the transmit power [4]. According to the obtained results of the conducted measurements
    shown in Figure 4, it can be seen that the area where increased packet losses
    occur due to signal weakening is located precisely in the area of SNR values specified
    as marginal for the application of ADR. The most significant losses occur at SNR
    values lower than −5 dB if the RSSI values are lower than −110 dBm. Furthermore,
    it is also evident that, in the case when the SNR values are lower than −5 dB
    and the RSSI values are in the range from −110 dBm to −120 dBm, data delivery
    still occurs, while in the case when the RSSI values are lower than −120 dBm,
    the result is a complete packet loss. 4.2. Evaluation and Optimization of Energy
    Consumption in Simulated LoRa Networks Considering everything stated so far, a
    prime focus of the conducted research in the following part of the paper is on
    a detailed analysis of the impact of payload size on energy consumption based
    on simulation process conducted using simulator [87]. Input values used in the
    simulation are the ones presented in Section 3.2 describing energy profile of
    LoRa sensor node, as well as all parameters presented in Section 3 and Section
    4.1. The selected payload sizes correspond to real-life applications related to
    monitoring environmental parameters used in precision agriculture. Therefore,
    the maximum possible payload size of 51 bytes, an average size of 11 bytes (used
    in most commercially available applications), and a minimum size of 6 bytes (proven
    optimal for the chosen precision agriculture application) are considered. Thus,
    the analyses are conducted to quantify the impact of relevant LoRaWAN parameters
    and mechanisms on energy consumption in the scenarios in which different packet
    payload sizes are used. In order to save energy, non-time-critical data can be
    accumulated. Furthermore, by increasing the payload size, the overhead related
    to header information decreases, and the number of retransmissions in a stable
    propagation environment reduces. For this reason, it was assumed that the grouped
    measurements of different parameters are sent within the same packet for the analyses
    conducted in this paper. Typical applications of sensor networks in precision
    agriculture for environmental monitoring are time-related. Collecting current
    data is essential to obtain more detailed information about specific agrometeorological
    parameters, for example, the amount of precipitation, such as rain, in specific,
    more frequent periods. Hence, it is vital to provide a considerable amount of
    helpful information. As opposed to the default transmission rate (λ) of 0.02 bits
    per second, equivalent to transmitting a 9-byte message every chosen hour, for
    instance, in [3], the data transmission rate is adjusted to the quantity of data
    that should be transmitted, i.e., to the actual packet size, as well as the packet
    transmitting interval. The interval is set to 10 min. This means the packet is
    transmitted every 10 min, so six packets are transmitted per hour. Moreover, the
    overhead data are considered for assessing the accurate transmission rate, as
    presented in Table 9. Unlike the previously conducted analyses [3,4], in which
    the transmission rate does not match the size of the packet and is set to a fixed
    rate of 0.19 × 10−3, this approach considers the actual packet size in determining
    the transmission rate. This is the main difference between the previously conducted
    analyses in [3,4], and the analyses conducted in this work, which result in more
    precise results of the subsequent simulation procedures. Table 9. Packet payloads.
    One of the possible energy efficiency mechanisms is reducing the total volume
    of sent data and an adaptive data sampling process. With less frequent data transmission,
    the overhead of starting and initializing a transmission is also lower. As already
    proven, approaches based on reducing the number of packets transmitted can improve
    the success rate of packet delivery. According to the TTN Fair Access Policy,
    for a maximum packet size of 51 bytes, a total of 10 packets/hour cannot be exceeded.
    Therefore, the transmission interval is set to 10 min, which means that data is
    transmitted every 10 min, so six packets are transmitted per hour. Although the
    sampling period of 10 min is more extended than the minimum of approximately 5
    min, determined by considering duty cycle regulations, it is still short when
    energy savings are considered. However, it is coordinated with the necessary data
    related to measuring the amount of precipitation, especially in the case of short-term
    intense precipitation, after which the need for irrigation can be significantly
    reduced. The network’s capacity is reduced, not only due to transmissions in the
    downlink but also due to the off-period time following these transmissions. 4.3.
    Overview of Simulation Results The performance of the network and individual sensor
    nodes is evaluated based on the number of uniquely received packets and the mean
    ratio of the number of uniquely received packets on the gateway to the uniquely
    transmitted packets per node, i.e., the data extraction rate. This indicates how
    reliably the intended payload bytes are received by the gateway. Moreover, this
    differs from the packet delivery success ratio because it does not include retransmissions
    in the calculation. Hence, the main objective is that the intended payload is
    received by the gateway, while the number of retransmissions necessary to achieve
    this goal is of secondary importance. The collected results of the simulation
    process are presented and compared hereafter. According to the results presented
    in Figure 6, it can be observed that the substantial energy in the transmit (Tx)
    and receive (Rx) states can be reduced by disabling confirmed messages. In addition,
    since analyzing energy consumption optimization regarding the reduction in acknowledged
    transmissions, the impact of the duty cycle limit on the downlink capabilities
    of the gateway is also considered. The gateway cannot acknowledge all confirmed
    messages if only the default channels are utilized. Consequently, the number of
    retransmitted packages increases. Regarding the collected results for the deployed
    LoRaWAN sensor network scenarios, it can be concluded that the number of acknowledged
    frames must be minimized as much as possible to avoid capacity and energy drain.
    Figure 6. TxRx energy consumption per unique packet of one sensor node. The communication
    channel variance, measured in dB, concerning the average path loss, i.e., path
    loss variance (PLV), is a consequence of varying propagation characteristics of
    the signal in space and time. As presented, the channel dynamics significantly
    impact the performance of a LoRaWAN network and the energy efficiency of the nodes.
    In general, the following can be stated. First, the ADR mechanism attempts to
    achieve a robust signal while considering energy consumption. This is achieved
    by lowering the data rate when the channel conditions worsen and increasing the
    data rate when the SNR conditions improve. According to the results presented
    in Figure 7, it is evident that ADR should be used in the analyzed scenarios since
    substantial energy savings can be achieved by enabling ADR. ADR reduces the energy
    consumption of the sensor nodes. First, it optimizes the LoRa parameters in such
    a way that nodes do not transmit with more power than needed. Secondly, this inherently
    diverges the utilized spreading factors, yielding fewer collisions. This demonstrates
    the importance of including ADR in assessing and optimizing transmission parameters
    in LPWANs to ensure a long battery life of sensor nodes. Figure 7. Consumed energy
    per byte for different packet payload sizes. However, ADR reacts slowly in situations
    with many devices or when a significant channel variance is present. The current
    ADR mechanism is unable to adjust for rapid channel variances. This effect is
    negligible if confirmed messages (i.e., retransmissions) are employed to ensure
    receiving each intended message. If no acknowledgments are used, the data extraction
    rate decreases when the channel variance increases. The nodes are unable to adapt
    adequately to the channel. Concerning the data extraction rate, it is better not
    to enable an adaptive data rate when not using confirmed messages. However, this
    results in higher energy consumption. Despite the beneficial effects of increasing
    the payload size, sending more bytes per packet increases the total number of
    bytes sent redundantly. After receiving 20 uplink messages, the network will respond
    with adequate ADR parameters to accommodate non-optimal propagation [88]. For
    larger payload sizes, this implies that more bytes have been sent before the LoRa
    parameters are adjusted to the channel. In addition, ADR changes the parameters
    in steps, which causes an even slower adaption to the propagation environment
    for larger payload sizes. This effect is notable when observing the energy consumption
    of nodes with a slow data transmission rate. This results in higher energy consumption.
    Therefore, LoRa devices should send smaller packets to adapt to the channel faster
    since this will reduce air time and energy consumption for packets sent with non-optimal
    parameters. The energy per useful bit is a function of the maximum range and different
    payload sizes. With high SF values and an increase in the payload size, the energy
    per useful bit decreases. Also, with low SF values, the payload variation does
    not substantially affect energy per bit. In extension to these analyses, the analyses
    carried out as part of this work consider fixed, predefined payload sizes when
    estimating the transmission rate values. Therefore, the corresponding transmission
    rate calculated is used for each scenario related to the estimation of energy
    consumption based on the selected packet size. The conclusions based on the obtained
    results fulfill those obtained in [3,4,15], and indicate that, regardless of SF
    values, if the payload size decreases, the energy per useful bit also decreases,
    as well in the chosen scenarios of optimal packet sizes in bytes for the given
    case study. Delivering a large number of packets in a short time by a more significant
    number of nodes causes bursts of collisions, as presented in Figure 8. Figure
    8. Percentage of bytes that collided out of the total number of bytes sent. In
    LoRaWAN, the reliability of packet delivery is achieved through the acknowledgment
    of packets in the downlink. However, sending confirmation increases the energy
    consumption in the network. Therefore, when there is a certain tolerance for packet
    loss, as is the case when sending not so time-critical data, for instance, data
    related to the state of the environmental and agronomic parameters, it is possible
    to omit sending confirmations. This is especially appropriate in cases of implementing
    sensor networks with a smaller number of nodes and sending data less often, where
    the frequency of possible collisions is reduced. Moreover, this is also appropriate
    in cases where high signal quality is ensured and there are no significant losses
    during packet transmissions. Considering what has been stated, it can be concluded
    that in some cases, acknowledgments of packet delivery are not sent due to savings
    in energy consumption. However, to ensure the successful delivery of the amount
    of data needed to gain insight into the value of environmental and agronomic data
    necessary for crop condition assessment, it is recommended to use packet sequence
    numbers nevertheless. In this way, the server could check the received traffic,
    and in the critical case of a more considerable difference between the sequential
    numbers of the two successively received packets, it can inform the sensor node
    that ADR should be applied and continue sending data according to its recommendations.
    The LoRa network server can monitor the detailed radio information from all gateways
    that receive a given frame. These data include information about the gateway,
    extended unique identifier (EUI) of the networking devices (sensor node), server
    timestamp, acknowledgment flag as set by the device, frame counter (FCnt), and
    encrypted data payload. In addition, some extended radio information such as the
    radio frequency, spreading factor, bandwidth, coding rate, the gateway’s Rx UTC
    and GPS time, and the gateway’s position (latitude and longitude) can also be
    added. According to this information, the network server can control the sequence
    number of the particular packet received from the selected sensor node. A standard
    comma-separated value (.CSV) file which is presented to the receiving end contains
    the following columns: EUI, timestamp, FCnt, frequency, data rate, RSSI, SNR,
    gateway EUI, port, data E.g.,: 0004A30B00FFEF62,1655557243123,161,868500000,SF11
    BW125 4/5,-115,-3.5,024B0BFFFF0310B2,1,693e0001bf3eb0020000ff 0004A30B00FFEF62,1655557843123,162,867500000,SF11
    BW125 4/5,-102,-12.8,024B0BFFFF0310B2,1,693e4001bf3e98020000ff 0004A30B00FFEF62,1655558443123,163,867700000,SF11
    BW125 4/5,-115,-2.5,024B0BFFFF0310B2,1,693e4001bf3e80020000ff 0004A30B00FFEF62,1655559043103,164,868100000,SF11
    BW125 4/5,-118,-2,024B0BFFFF0310B2,1,693e4001bd3e70020000ff 0004A30B00FFEF62,1655560243103,166,868300000,SF11
    BW125 4/5,-115,-7.8,024B0BFFFF0310B2,1,693e8001bd3e58000000ff ⋯ Therefore, it
    is evident that, based on continuous monitoring of the counter (FCnt), an insight
    into its changes can be gained to define an arbitrary maximum deviation from two
    consecutive counter values before the application of ADR is requested. In the
    case that the application server contains some data, for instance, about ADR usage,
    which it needs to transmit to a specific sleeping sensor that sends data periodically,
    when that sensor is a Class A device, the application server must wait for an
    uplink from the sensor before it can send its data [72]. The application server
    immediately transmits the downlink once the uplink is received. Upon receipt of
    the downlink, the sensor goes back to sleep. This way, even if some overhead is
    present, energy savings can be achieved. Furthermore, as can be concluded from
    the collected results presented in Figure 9, the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
    state energies are the most significant contributors to total energy consumption.
    However, the sleep mode energy has a more significant share in the total energy
    if ADR is used while the confirmations are omitted, as presented in Figure 10.
    The results show that optimizing the LoRa parameters such as SF, CR, and payload
    size is a crucial element in reducing the consumed energy by the sensor node.
    The total consumed energy per useful bit is a function of the payload at different
    spreading factors (SF). For the more excellent value of SF, more time is taken
    to send a packet, so more consumed energy is needed to transmit data. Moreover,
    when the coding rate (CR) decreases, the time on air and, consequently, the consumed
    energy increases. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the LoRaWAN communication
    range, the spreading factor, and the transmission power. The range is a function
    of SF at different transmission powers. If the SF increases, the LoRaWAN range
    increases as well. Moreover, the LoRaWAN range increases with increasing transmission
    power. It can be concluded that the theoretical maximum range that can be achieved
    at the determined power level is obtained with the highest SF. Figure 9. Percentage
    of TxRx energy in the total consumed energy. Figure 10. Total consumed energy
    per packet per sensor node. (a) Unconfirmed packets with and without ADR; (b)
    Confirmed packets with and without ADR. Saving electricity is one of the fundamental
    priorities in all aspects of modern life [89,90,91]. The results of this work
    show the saving of electricity in precision agriculture. Limitation of the proposed
    study relate to the fact that only data for three carefully selected sizes of
    packets that contain data essential for precision agriculture are presented in
    the paper. However, these sizes correspond to one of the smaller, average and
    the largest packet that can be sent over the network. Moreover, it was shown that
    a 6-bit packet is sufficient for transferring the same amount of data as an 11-bit
    packet. 5. Conclusions and Recommendation This paper analyzed the energy-efficient
    operation of a LoRa-based wireless sensor network intended for precision agriculture.
    This type of sensor network may be used for crop condition monitoring by measuring
    essential environmental parameters. The paper proposed a concise presentation
    of information in the packet payload (a 6-byte payload format, which provides
    the same amount of useful information as the 11-byte payload used with commercially
    available devices). The given example of the selected smaller packet size is a
    more suitable solution in terms of energy saving. Furthermore, the difference
    in the analyses carried out in this paper compared to the analyses carried out
    in the literature so far lies in the definition of an adequate transmission rate.
    While the analyses carried out so far have assumed fixed values of the transmission
    rate, in this paper it was assumed that the transmission rate changes with each
    sending, considering the amount of data in the sent packets, i.e., the size of
    the packet. This affects the results, because in this paper it was proven that
    for better energy efficiency of communication, it is important to adjust the transmission
    speed to the actual size of the packet. So, the high transmission rate can be
    more energy-efficient method when sending smaller packets. By testing LoRa communication
    modules in real case study conditions, the results collected through field measurements,
    simulations, and laboratory tests were compared. An optimized energy model for
    LoRa sensor nodes was presented. It was shown that the consumed energy changes
    with different parameter settings. Optimizing LoRa parameters, such as SF and
    CR, regarding the required long-range communication is crucial in reducing the
    energy consumed by the sensor nodes in the case study areas. However, it is proven
    that, regardless of SF values, if the payload size decreases, the energy per useful
    bit decreases as well. Moreover, it is evident that ADR should be used in the
    analyzed scenarios since substantial energy savings can be achieved by enabling
    ADR. After receiving 20 up-link messages, the network will respond with adequate
    ADR parameters to accommodate non-optimal propagation. Therefore, LoRa devices
    should send smaller packets to adapt to the channel faster since this will reduce
    air time and energy consumption for packets sent with non-optimal parameters.
    Finally, it was concluded that receiving a transmission acknowledgment consumes
    energy, which considerably reduces the sensor node lifetime. Therefore, another
    contribution of the paper is the graph showing the limits of reliable data transmission.
    According to the obtained graph, it is possible to identify areas within which
    it is not necessary to send acknowledgments, which can significantly reduce energy
    consumption based on the last measured SNR and RSSI values. Moreover, the selection
    of the frequency of sending acknowledgments must also be compliant with the ETSI
    and LoRaWAN standards, which also apply to gateways. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    technological transformation has recently occurred in the agriculture sector.
    Precision agriculture is one among those transformations that largely focus on
    the acquisition of the sensor data, identifying the insights, and summarizing
    the information for better decision-making that would enhance the resource usage
    efficiency, crop yield, and substantial quality of the yield resulting in better

    monitoring, the farmlands are connected with various sensors that must be robust

    challenging task, which needs energy-efficient models for handling the lifetime
    of the sensors. In the current study, the energy-aware software-defined network
    for precisely selecting the cluster head for communication with the base station
    and the neighboring low-energy sensors. The cluster head is initially chosen according
    to energy consumption, data transmission consumption, proximity measures, and

    the optimal cluster head. The cluster fitness is assessed in each round to retain
    the cluster in the subsequent rounds. The network model’s performance is assessed

    is defined as an activity humans undertake to ensure that a population has access
    to adequate, safe, and nutritious food sustainable. Many countries rely on the
    exports of agricultural products to generate adequate revenue to feed their citizens.
    In such a context, agricultural ties and crop yields are essential, and more strategies
    and approaches have been practiced recently to ensure productivity enhancement
    [1]. Real-time monitoring of the environmental condition and remote control in
    agriculture is fast expanding to create more profitable and efficient agricultural
    systems and instruments. Precision agriculture has the potential to go in this
    direction. These two words refer to integrating sophisticated technology with
    traditional agricultural techniques for fine-grid crop management. Farmers may
    benefit from vital environmental information from their cultivated regions provided
    by intelligent farming systems, enabling them to boost their productivity and
    revenue. These technological advancements have the potential to benefit practically
    every aspect of agriculture, from seeding to irrigation to crop management and
    harvesting systems [2]. Precision Agriculture (PA) is a movement that aims to
    facilitate and optimize agricultural growth for both farmers and society. It is
    important to note that PA is an advanced farming technology that monitors, evaluates,
    and records agricultural areas and crops. Advanced sensing technology has allowed
    on-site soil and climate monitoring to provide precise recommendations. Increased
    agricultural production, decreased environmental consequences, and enhanced human
    well-being may be achieved using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Sensors
    would assist in monitoring farm inputs [3]. Farmers use optimized inputs like
    water and fertilizer to boost output without sacrificing quality and cost [4].
    The desire for increasing agricultural efficiency while minimizing environmental
    impact pushes the progress of innovation towards integrated “smart” agricultural
    production that replace traditional farming techniques. Knowledge-based agricultural
    management systems with autonomous systems have been created to minimize the inputs
    by considering time-sensitive and demographic crop-centric conditions [5]. However,
    feasibility studies analyzing the costs and advantages of implementing agricultural
    robotic mechanisms as recently launched models are required to enable greater
    acceptance by sector users [6,7]. The sensor nodes would transfer the real-time
    data to the base station (BS), which is further processed for precise decision-making.
    The sensors’ lifetime and the sensor devices’ communication would make the process
    challenging. The data is transferred over a predefined path as the routing technique
    recommends. Static routing techniques are more secure than dynamic routing; nevertheless,
    solutions based on static routing are not suitable for broad areas like agriculture
    farms or in the network where scalability matters. IoT technology has been extensively
    fused with other industries in recent years to encourage interaction that would
    enhance network performance, resource usage, and load distribution [8]. Climate-related
    difficulties may be solved in the agriculture sector by implementing innovative
    IoT systems, which can boost agricultural yields and productivity. For decades,
    agriculture has used sensors to procure data in static settings. The offline configuration
    can gather static data and gives enough knowledge to make excellent judgments
    about future yields or crops for the following year. Still, it cannot provide
    data on rapid environmental changes jeopardizing agricultural products. This article
    aims to use cutting-edge IoT-based sensor infrastructure to gather information
    from the surroundings and transfer the sensor data to the BS for timely decision-making
    in precision agriculture. Wireless agriculture sensors are dispersed across the
    agricultural field in the suggested framework to extract information relating
    to soil composition, such as moisture, temperature, and humidity levels. This
    data is safely transported to the cluster heads, which serve as the point of contact
    or as a manager for data exchange to the BS. Following is a list of the primary
    aspects of the study. The suggested software-defined network is efficient in establishing
    a wireless sensor network that is robust and computationally efficient with multiple
    clusters of nodes with divergent levels of residual energy. The sensor node’s
    responsibilities are delegated to the cluster heads for further processing, increasing
    the nodes’ survival. It ensures node availability by discharging responsibilities
    depending on available residual energy. The clusters are updated over multiple
    rounds concerning their fitness values, that result in clusters with an optimal
    number of nodes. Finding a cluster head (CH) that can effectively oversee data
    flow between sensor area nodes and the BS. Each round, the CH-index value is updated
    concerning the local and global best node index values. At the same time, the
    initial CH-index is determined based on the residual energy and the distance to
    the BS. Validated the proposed framework against existing studies concerning various
    network characteristics and summarized the findings. The other sections of the
    paper are organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the Material and Methodology,
    which discusses different networking metrics used in evaluating the model and
    the assumption in the simulated network. Section 3 discusses the proposed Energy
    Aware Software Defined Network model. Section 4 summarizes the results obtained
    from the experimentation. Section 5 offers the conclusion and future scope. Literature
    Review Placidi et al. [9] have proposed a low-cost soil moisture sensor named
    Sentek commercial sensor that works over a LoRa WAN-based network for economic
    precision agriculture. Loamy to silty soils were compared. The moisture readings
    were accurate. However, reliability issues were found that might be addressed
    by using costlier commercial sensors. The research emphasizes sensors for analyzing
    soil moisture content without handling other critical characteristics like pH,
    temperature, humidity, and sunlight. Hsu et al. [10] offer a novel service approach
    built on top of the IoT cloud computing platform, which may be employed to enhance
    the current approach of integrating the cloud-to-physical networking and the processing
    capabilities of the IoT. This study applies cutting-edge platform technologies
    to the cloud agricultural platform. It may collect vast area data and analysis
    through cloud integration, enabling farms with limited network bandwidth data
    resources to provide agricultural monitoring automation and pest control picture
    analysis. A robust network infrastructure for monitoring and regulating agricultural
    fields in remote areas was introduced in research by Ahmed et al. [11]. They introduced
    an IoT-based control system for farming and agriculture development. All topological
    components and enhancements are thoroughly reviewed and studied. The IoT routing
    and MAC solution accomplished energy efficiency, low latency, and substantial
    throughput. Integrating a Wi-Fi long-distance (WiLD) network over a fog-computing
    strategy makes the system’s performance possible. Another study for alerting the
    farmers on mildew issues was proposed by Sergio et al. [12], using the IoT paradigm.
    They presented the SEnviro (Sense our Environment platform) system to monitor
    grape crops. To reduce communication between endpoints, they employed the edge
    computing concept. The authors in the study on an irrigation system based on IoT
    that recognizes plants automatically, Kwok et al. [13], have used deep learning
    to recognize the kind and category of plants for an automated plant watering system.
    The plant’s water need is computed by identifying a current set of plant photos
    and data set obtained from the farm. When the identification procedure is accomplished,
    it uses the database to obtain irrigation information. Modeling training procedures
    takes time since many photos must be saved. In the study by Ratnaparkhi et al.
    [14], sensors are investigated as the most potent instrument for IoT deployment.
    Based on their uses, a broad range of agricultural sensors are provided. Sensor
    arrays, location, acoustic and airflow sensors were among the sensors studied.
    It was also discovered that agricultural sensors increase agricultural output.
    Some of the issues encountered in installing sensors in Distributed systems include
    their customization, continuous Wi-Fi connection, the management of errors and
    malfunctions, and identifying the proper sensors for diverse contexts. Jawad et
    al. [15] conducted a study on agricultural applications based on wireless sensor
    networks. This study aims to conduct a comparative analysis of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    LoRa, diverse cellular technologies, and Sig Fox wireless and protocol suites.
    LoRa and ZigBee proved effective for Precision Agriculture because of their long-range
    communications and low energy needs. Many methods and techniques concerning the
    power consumption of WSNs were grouped. The authors propose a smart agricultural
    IoT (SMAIoT) system to track and analyze data from various inexpensive sensors
    [16]. This network infrastructure is designed to gather data from soil, air, groundwater,
    and animals and utilize them to make appropriate judgments. The suggested framework’s
    distinctive feature is automating tasks, such as irrigation, fertilizers, insect
    identification, and pesticide spraying, with high productivity. Long-Range Wide-Area
    Network (LoRaWAN) [17,18] is a technology that could internet connect multiple
    devices over the internet in a much-secured manner. The LoRaWAN is inspired by
    Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) due to its capacity to communicate across
    large distances [19]. LoRaWANs offer low-power, low-cost, long-range, and low-data-rate
    communication. LoRaWAN includes end devices, gateways, network servers, and applications.
    Gateways and network servers link hundreds of thousands of LoRa end devices. LoRa
    lets low-power devices communicate long-distance with low bitrate. It is the best
    choice for most IoT applications, including smart towns, smart billing, intelligent
    transportation, automated lighting, and precision agriculture. LoRa only works
    in low-bitrate settings [20]. The main limitation of the LoRaWAN technology is
    the limited number of nodes based on the duty cycles, and not suitable for applications
    that rely on low latency applications. Vij A et al. [21] have used a pre-processed
    agriculture data set to add machine-intelligent approaches to the agricultural
    decision support model. Rather than utilizing a publicly accessible dataset, a
    model is designed to gradually learn plants’ watering demands. Various ML algorithms
    are tested in terms of accuracy for making irrigation choices. Before making accurate
    judgments, manual irrigations are conducted twice. Because of the model’s dynamic
    nature, data are processed in stages and may be used for several plants with different
    watering circumstances. There is a great necessity for a learning method that
    can be taught by itself utilizing a substantially lighter learning procedure with
    environmental factors, which does not require more memory in the system but require
    more computing. According to the study, edge computing should be included in the
    agricultural system for making accurate decisions with immediate calculation locally.
    This article will describe a smart infrastructure that uses IoT and edge computing
    to monitor soil moisture using sensors, data transfer among sensors, and an Analytics-as-a-Service
    cloud. The details of various state-of-art approaches are shown in Table 1. Table
    1. Summary of various state-of-art models in WSN for real-time data exchange.
    The existing technologies for precision agriculture primarily focus on data acquisition
    and processing of the data for precise recommendations to the farmers. Some studies
    focus on the security aspects of the study. There are ample studies that focus
    on the lifetime of the network and effective communication among the nodes in
    the network. However, the models either focus on the survivability of the nodes
    or the efficient routing mechanism, not on both things simultaneously. Nevertheless,
    there is demand for a model to maximize the network’s lifetime and routing techniques
    for pushing the data across the sensor devices and the BS. The suggested software-defined
    network is efficient concerning the sustainability of the nodes. Additionally,
    the proposed model does have minimal network latency. The CH is selected based
    on the index values populated based on the local and global best values, resulting
    in an optimized way of assessing the node index values and choosing an optimal
    CH for the data exchange. The implementation of the proposed technology is discussed
    in the forthcoming sections of the study. The pivotal point of the study focuses
    on the survivability of the network but maintaining the throughput and latency
    of the network to be at the optimal level. However, the latency of the network
    is not a crucial parameter in PA, yet the model desired to maintain the latency
    to be minimal. 2. Material and Methodology IoT technologies have recently been
    used in various areas because of their cheap cost, ease of implementation, and
    cost-effective ecosystem. A vast array of sensor nodes was dispersed around the
    field to perceive the required data in IoT [24]. Under either a single-hop or
    multi-hop data transmission paradigm, data are gathered and transmitted to the
    BS for further processing. The current section of the paper elaborates on the
    details of the implementation environment, evaluation parameters used in assessing
    the model’s efficiency, and the proposed energy-aware software-defined network
    model. The IoT environment is separated into multiple regions, and each area has
    one cluster leader responsible for gathering and forwarding sensory input to BS.
    Additionally, most sensor nodes went into sleep mode to extend the network lifespan.
    Various energy-aware technologies are used to formulate the network architecture
    for exchanging data among the nodes. Some of those technologies include Low energy
    adaptive cluster hierarchy (LEACH) [25], improved chain-based clustering hierarchical
    routing (ICCHR) [26], Multiple-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) [27], Probabilistic
    Buckshot-Driven Cluster Head Identification (PB-RESHM) [23], Energy Aware Distance-based
    Cluster Head selection and Routing (EADCR) protocol [28], Spider Monkey Optimization
    (SMO), Energy-efficient Cluster Head Identification (SSMOECHS) [29], Group Search
    Ant Lion with Levy Flight (GAL-LF) [30], Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA)
    [31], Probabilistic Cluster Head Selection (LEACH-PRO) [32], heterogeneous Modified
    Grey Wolf Optimizer (HMGWO) [33], Fibonacci Based Trimet Graph Optimization (FBTGO)
    [34], and fitness-value-based improved GWO (FIGWO) [35], and are used in identifying
    the CH and exchanging the data with the BS. Optimizing the selection of the CH
    in a wireless sensor network involves prioritizing the node with the highest residual
    energy while considering the minimum energy consumption required by the communication
    mechanism. This will facilitate the transmission of a greater amount of data simultaneously
    by the CH. Energy or distance are often employed as the primary identifiers of
    the CH. Individual nodes with significant leftover resources and energy with low
    operating costs are the best candidates for cluster heads. Each round assigns
    an updated index value to the appropriate cluster head, relying on the leftover
    resources. Existing indices are updated to reflect the current best CH globally
    in the network. 2.1. Implementation Environment The proposed model for precision
    agriculture is implemented in the simulation environment using the CupCarbon simulator,
    a discrete-event-driven model installed in a Windows environment. The Cupcarbon
    simulator is publicly available [36]. The network events are periodically captured
    from the simulator. Table 2 summarizes the implementation environment in detail.
    Table 2. Details of the Implementation Environment. This scenario takes place
    over a 100×100  m 2 elevation grid. A maximum transmission distance of 30 m may
    be detected in this case. The scenario is used to evaluate how well the given
    strategy works. The model was constituted over the same cohort of nodes executed
    for 2000 repetitions. The details of the simulated environment are discussed in
    Table 3. The sample screens of the simulation environment are presented in Figure
    1. Figure 1. In sample screens of the implementation environment, the sink denotes
    the base station, and the circle around the sensors denotes the coverage area.
    Each node in the network is assigned a node number to differentiate. Table 3.
    Details of the simulation Environment. 2.2. Evaluation Metrics The performance
    of the proposed energy-aware IoT architecture in PA is being assessed using various
    standard evaluation metrics like Energy consumption, network latency, mean network
    lifetime, bandwidth consumption, and the node’s communication fitness. The significance
    of each evaluation metric mentioned above is discussed along with the formula.
    2.2.1. Energy Consumption Energy consumption is critical in determining the sensor
    network’s longevity. Each node in the network has leftover energy connected with
    it. The energy is utilized for communicating data among other nodes across the
    network. The longest-lasting nodes may designate the nodes with the most energy
    resources as the local head for data exchange with the BS. Energy consumption
    is a statistic used to assess network performance. Topological adjustments, such
    as the location of the linked BS and the sum of links associated with the node
    that will minimize the energy demand enhance the network’s sustainability. The
    energy usage for data exchange with BS is calculated using the following Equation
    (1) for direct communication. Nodes that rely on the other nodes would rely on
    the other nodes to exchange the data [37]. 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔 𝑦 𝑑𝑖 𝑟 𝑡 (𝑑𝑠𝑡)= 𝑑 𝑒 + 𝑑 𝑑𝑐 𝑑𝑠
    𝑡 2 (1) 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔 𝑦 𝑒𝑥 𝑐 𝑡 (𝑑𝑠𝑡)= 𝑑 𝑒 + ∑ 𝑛 𝑥=0 𝑑 𝑒 𝑥 𝑑𝑠 𝑡 4 (2) From the above equations,
    𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔 𝑦 𝑑𝑖 𝑟 𝑡 (𝑑𝑠𝑡) The energy needed to push the data directly to BS 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔 𝑦
    𝑒𝑥 𝑐 𝑡 (𝑑𝑠𝑡) The energy required for transferring the data through a neighboring
    node 𝑑 𝑒 Amount of power the intermediate relay nodes use during a data transfer.
    𝑑 𝑑𝑐 Amount of energy required for direct transfer of the data to BS. 𝑑𝑠𝑡 the
    distances measured among the corresponding node and the destination node 𝑛 The
    adjacent nodes that facilitate the transmission of data. 2.2.2. Mean Network Lifetime
    The mean network lifetime is another crucial statistic in assessing network design
    performance. It is always desired to have a network with a greater network lifetime.
    The sum of nodes in the network determines it. The network lifetime over the time
    stamps of the range 1 to 𝑛 is assessed using Equation (3) [38]. 𝑛 𝑙 = ∑ 𝑛 𝑡𝑖𝑚=1
    1 𝜋(2 × ( 𝑑 𝑏𝑠 𝑛 𝑐 )+1)× 𝑛 𝑐 2 × 𝑑 𝑛 × 𝑡 𝑛 −𝜋 ×  𝑑 𝑏𝑠 2 × 𝑑 𝑛 𝑡 𝑛 (3) where the
    notations used are as follows 𝑡 𝑛 Denotes the total number of nodes in the network.
    𝑑 𝑛 The nodes density within the network. 𝑑 𝑏𝑠 The distance between the corresponding
    node to the BS. 𝑛 𝑐 Denote the network coverage. 𝑛 𝑙 Denote the network’s lifetime.
    2.2.3. Bandwidth Consumption Data are continually transferred between network
    nodes and the BS, leading to data exchange bandwidth usage. The CH uses bandwidth
    while sharing data among sensor network nodes, which is desired to be minimum
    [39]. The formula for the bandwidth consumption is identified by 𝐵 𝑐 is shown
    in Equation (4). 𝐵 𝑐 = 𝑇 𝐴 𝑏 − ∑ 𝑝 𝑖=0 𝐵 𝑟 𝑖   (4) The variable 𝑇 𝐴 𝑏 in the above
    equation denotes the total allotted bandwidth and the variable 𝐵 𝑟 designates
    the bandwidth required at each instance 𝑖 in the network. The bandwidth requirement
    is assessed based on the sum of spike packets passing through the node at an instance
    of time concerning bits per packet as shown in Equation (5). 𝐵 𝑟 =  𝑆 𝑝  ×  𝑏
    𝑝 𝐼 𝑡 (5) where the notations used are as follows 𝑆 𝑝 the sum of spike packets.
    𝐼 𝑡 Instance of time. 𝑏 𝑝   Bits per packet. 2.2.4. Node’s Communication Fitness
    The communication fitness of a node is one of the indications used to determine
    if it can function as a CH. At some stage in the network, the node with appropriate
    communication fitness is identified as competent to become the CH. The fitness
    of node communication is tested regularly. The evaluated value aids in determining
    the best cluster head node for data transmission among nodes and the linked BS
    [40]. The formula for assessing the node’s fitness is shown in Equation (6). 𝑓
    𝑛 =1−𝑚𝑖𝑛(1, ∑ 𝑎 ∑ 𝑏 (𝑚𝑎𝑥(0, 𝑥 𝑎𝑏 − 𝑒 𝑡 𝑒 𝑡 ))/ 𝑡 𝑛 ) (6) where the notations used
    are as follows 𝑥 𝑎𝑏  Represents the energy corresponding to the internal node
    communication. 𝑒 𝑡  Energy threshold at the instance. 𝑡 𝑛  Total number of nodes
    in the network. 2.2.5. Network Latency Network latency refers to the time it takes
    to exchange data among nodes and the BS, i.e., connected BS, through CH. Network
    latency is intended to be as low as possible for speedier data interchange. If
    the packet must be transferred between numerous cluster heads before reaching
    the BS, the delay will grow as the number of data packets is exchanged. Each CH
    must wait until all the packets are processed, which includes propagation and
    queuing delays. In general, network latency is measured in terms of time delay
    associated with the distance the packet travels at a determined transmission rate
    to the size of the packet at the specified transmission rate [41]. The formula
    for network latency over the transmission rate 𝑇 𝑟 is determined based on Equation
    (7). The propagation delay associated with the network is shown in Equation (8),
    and the Serialization delay is shown in Equation (9). 𝑛 𝑙 = 𝑝 𝑑 𝑆 𝑑 (7) 𝑝 𝑑 =  𝑑𝑠𝑡
    𝑇 𝑟 (8) 𝑆 𝑑 = 𝑏 𝑝 𝑇 𝑟 (9) 2.3. Architecture Assumptions Several network assumptions
    are emphasized before discussing the technical aspects of the recommended Energy-aware
    IoT Framework for precision agriculture. The hypothesis is listed in bullet points
    as follows. There are divergent sensor nodes scattered in each network region
    for real-time monitoring. The regions in the network are circular size areas relying
    on the network coverage of the nodes. The nodes and the BS are fixed upon deploying
    them to establish the network. All the communication links among the sensors and
    sensor nodes to the BS are symmetric and bi-directional. Each network node differs
    concerning the availability of the residual energies like batter life, processing
    capabilities, and available memory. Based on the leftover energy reserves, nodes
    are classified as low, sustainable, or high. Each region in the network would
    have multiple clusters, and each would have multiple sensor nodes. Among those
    sensor nodes in the cluster, there would be one CH that is responsible for the
    exchange of the data. 3. Energy Aware Software Defined Network model In each search
    space, the suggested model is non-dominant. Depending on available resources,
    nearby nodes, proximity to the corresponding BS, and associated network maintenance
    expenses, CHs are chosen. The proposed approach for sensor networks consists of
    two phases. At first, we consider energy, distance, and latency while selecting
    a cluster’s heads. In the next phase, the index at each cluster head is updated
    in line with the local and global best residual energies, and the indexes and
    the nodes are updated. The present subsection of the suggested framework provides
    an in-depth description of the framework. The connection among the sensor node,
    CHs, and BS is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Image representing the connections
    among various devices in the network. 3.1. Initial Selection of the Cluster Head
    The initial selection of the CH is based on multiple factors considered in choosing
    the optimal CH in the cluster. Choose the node with the most available residual
    and lowest energy consumption to find the most suitable CH. It will enable the
    CH to transmit more data packets. Energy and distance are the main determinants
    in locating the CH. It is desired to consider the CH close to the BS, as it would
    consume less energy to push the data to the BS, and the communication latency
    can also be minimized [42]. The CH-index is used in determining the significance
    of the CH. The node that has the highest CH-Index would be assumed to be the optimal
    node for being a cluster head. The energy metric for overall communication is
    identified by 𝐸 𝑐 for 𝑝  packets over a distance 𝑑 , from the node to the BS is
    shown in Equation (10) [43]. 𝐸 𝑐 = 𝐸 𝑖𝑛𝑡 −{( 𝐼 𝑒 ×𝑝)+( 𝐸 𝑡 ×𝑝× 𝑑 2 )}  (10) where
    the notations used are as follows 𝐼 𝑒 Implied energy 𝐸 𝑡 The energy needed to
    push the data from the node to BS The formula for implied energy is shown in Equation
    (11) [44]. 𝐼 𝑒 =  𝐸 𝑡𝑑 + 𝐸 𝑡𝑎 (11) where the notations used are as follows 𝐸 𝑡𝑑  The
    total energy deployed to exchange the 𝑝 packets among the sensor node and the
    BS 𝐸 𝑡𝑎  The energy needed for data time aggregation The total energy is measured
    as recognized by the notation 𝐸 𝑡𝑜𝑡 , which also includes the amount of idle time
    recognized by 𝐸 𝑖 of the node as shown in Equation (12). 𝐸 𝑡𝑜𝑡 = 𝐸 𝑖 + 𝐸 𝑐 (12)
    The distance measure is assessed between the CH and the BS using the Euclidean
    distance measure. The Euclidean distance measure is generally used in spatial
    image processing techniques [45]. The same distance measure is used in measuring
    the distance among the coordinates in terms of measuring metrics, i.e., meters
    [46]. The notation 𝑑 𝑚 recognize the corresponding formula for the distance measure
    as shown in Equation (13). 𝑑 𝑚 = ( 𝑚 𝑦 − 𝑛 𝑦 ) 2 + ( 𝑚 𝑥 − 𝑛 𝑥 ) 2 − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (13) In the above equation, the ( 𝑚 𝑥 , 𝑚 𝑦 ) are
    the coordinates associated with the CH, and the coordinates ( 𝑛 𝑥 , 𝑛 𝑦 ) correspond
    to the BS. The delay among the nodes is the other significant parameter that is
    considered. The latency is proportional to the density of nodes within the cluster.
    As a result, the count of cluster nodes should be reduced to minimize the delay.
    The corresponding formula is shown in Equation (14). 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦= 𝑚𝑎 𝑥 𝐶 𝑛 𝑖=1 (𝐶 𝐻
    𝑖 ) 𝑐 𝑛 (14) In the above equation, the numerator 𝑚𝑎 𝑥 𝐶 𝑛 𝑖=1 (𝐶 𝐻 𝑖 ) denotes
    the maximum delay associated with the CH and the notation 𝑐 𝑛 designates the sum
    of nodes in the cluster. The CH-index is measured based on all the above measures
    and the residual energy availability. The formula for the CH-index is shown in
    Equation (15). 𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 = 𝑅 𝑒 𝑖 1 𝑐 𝑛 ∑ 𝑐 𝑛 𝑗=1 𝑅 𝑒 𝑗 +( 𝜔 𝑥 × 𝐸 𝑐 )+( 𝜔 𝑦 ×
    𝑑 𝑚 )+( 𝜔 𝑧 ×𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦) (15) From the above equation, the notations 𝜔 𝑥 , 𝜔 𝑦 , 𝜔
    𝑧 designated the weights associated with each of the features. The weight 𝜔 𝑥
    is associated with the communication energy metric, and the weight 𝜔 𝑦 corresponds
    to the distance measure; the associated values are assumed to be in the range
    of 0 and 1. The weight associated with the delay, i.e., 𝜔 𝑧 is considered 0.2
    in the earlier studies. The deployment of the sensors and the network topology
    can be seen in Figure 3. Figure 3. Image representing the node deployment and
    network topology. 3.2. Updating of the CH-Index The next phase of the proposed
    model is to update the CH-index values, which would assist in identifying the
    optimal CH in the current iteration. The index of the CH is being updated using
    the spider monkey optimization model. The updated CH-index value based on the
    SMO algorithm is used in the successive rounds of the network lifetime. The SMO
    approach considers the cluster heads’ local and global best CH-index values. During
    the initiation phase, the initial fitness of the search space is determined based
    on resided energy index, delay, and distance measures. In the successive phases,
    the CH-index values are considered in optimizing the index values. The corresponding
    objective function for updating CH-index is shown in Equation (16). 𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥
    =𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 +( 𝐼 𝑙𝑏 −𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 )×𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(0,1)+(𝐶 𝐻 𝑝𝑏 −𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 )×𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(−1,1) (16)
    In the above equation, the notation 𝐼 𝑙𝑏 represents the index value of the local
    best node in the cluster, especially when a node other than the CH may have a
    better index value based on the current environmental conditions. The function
    𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(0,1) is to confine the range of values between 0 and 1 and similarly for
    the function 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(−1,1) . The notation 𝐶 𝐻 𝑝𝑏 designates the node’s perturbation
    rate based on underlying factors. The value of the CH-Index would be updated based
    on the index value of the global best. The global best is recognized as the node
    with the highest CH-Index value. The corresponding function to update the index
    values based on the global best is shown in Equation (17). 𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 =𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥
    +(𝐶 𝐻 𝑔𝑏 −𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 )×𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(0,1)+( 𝐼 𝑙𝑏 −𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 )×𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(−1,1) (17) In the above
    equation, the notation 𝐶 𝐻 𝑔𝑏 designates the global best value of the index values.
    The assessed CH-index is used in updating the CH. The fitness of the cluster is
    assessed every time to decide if the cluster could be retained for the next successive
    rounds or to merge the nodes in the cluster with the neighboring clusters. The
    fitness of the cluster is identified by 𝑓 𝑐 and is assessed using the formula
    as shown in Equation (18). 𝑓 𝑐 = 1 ∑ 𝑛 𝑐 𝑖 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 𝑗 |𝐶 𝐻 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 − 𝑀 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 | − −
    − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (18) From the above equation, the notation 𝑛 𝑐 denotes
    the sum of clusters in the network, and the notation 𝑛 𝑖 denotes the sum of corresponding
    nodes within the cluster. The mean index values of all the nodes in the cluster
    are identified by 𝑀 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 . Based on the value of the cluster fitness, the clusters
    in the network are retained for subsequent rounds of the transmission network.

    network availability, throughput, remaining energy, energy usage, and mean network
    lifetime, the suggested software-driven network model is carefully studied compared
    to the findings of various advanced network models. The first connection creation
    and node list update take 845-time units. The proposed software-driven network
    model is compared to current models using a comparable experimental setting. In
    the current study, various models like LEACH, PB-RESM, SSMOECHS, Two-Tier Clustering-based
    Data Aggregation (TTCDA) [47], and Energy-efficient Clustering Data Aggregation
    (EECDA) [48] are considered in the evaluation of the proposed model. The network
    life is the metric measured in terms of time units, which is generally analyzed
    against the percentage of the active nodes in the network along with measures
    like First Node Die (FND) and Last Node Die (LND). The FND is the metric that
    denotes when the first node turned inactive in the network, and the LND denotes
    the last node that turned inactive in the network. Either of the metrics would
    assist in analyzing the network lifetime. The network lifetime performance is
    shown in Table 4 on executing for 3000 rounds. The corresponding graphs generated
    from the experimental values of network lifetime are shown in Figure 4. Figure
    4. (a) Graphs representing the analysis of the First Node Die (b) Graphs representing
    the Last Node Die. Table 4. Experimental values of network lifetime. The model’s
    performance is assessed concerning throughput and network lifetime metrics. It
    is desired that the network throughput is always desired to be high, which determines
    the sum of packets that are successfully delivered. The study’s throughput is
    measured as kilobits per second (kbps). The network lifetime is measured in time
    units, which elucidates the availability of the nodes in the network, which is
    also desired to be high. The lifetime metrics are evaluated as the total rounds
    of the network to deliver the packet without significant loss successfully. The
    experimental values of network throughput and lifetime are shown in Table 5. The
    corresponding graphs of network throughput and network lifetime are shown in Figure
    5. Figure 5. (a) Graphs representing the analysis of network throughput, (b) Graph
    representing the analysis of network lifetime. Table 5. Experimental values of
    Network Throughput and lifetime. The other metrics, like energy consumption and
    leftover energy at the stable homogeneous network, are discussed in Table 6. From
    the metrics mentioned above, leftover energy is the metric that determines the
    remaining residual energy in the network upon successful transmission of the data,
    which was desired to be high. Energy utilization is the metric that presents the
    overall energy consumption for network maintenance and data exchange, which is
    desired to be a minimum. The energy parameter in the current study is measured
    in terms of milliwatts (mW). The corresponding energy utilization and leftover
    energy-related graphs are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6. (a) Graphs representing
    the analysis of energy utilization for 2000 rounds, (b) Graphs representing the
    analysis of leftover residual energy. Table 6. Experimental values of Energy utilization
    and Leftover Residual Energy. For better analysis of the efficiency, the model
    is analyzed with other cutting-edge techniques like cumulative low-energy adaptive
    clustering hierarchy-LEACH(Cum_LEACH) [49], stable election protocol (SEP) [50],
    and distributed energy-efficient clustering (DEEC) [51]. The model is evaluated
    with an initial energy of 50 mW instead of 100 mW as the initial simulated energy
    for the other evaluations. Table 7 shows the model’s performance, and leftover
    energy and consumption are reported in milliwatts to preserve consistency throughout
    the study. The experimental values are evaluated for 500 rounds. The energy consumption
    and leftover energy graphs are shown in Figure 7, with reduced initial energy
    over 500 rounds. Figure 7. (a) Graphs representing the analysis of energy utilization,
    (b) Graph representing the analysis of leftover residual energy. Table 7. Experimental
    values of Energy utilization and Leftover Residual Energy with reduced initial
    energy over 500 rounds. The experimental results in Table 4 and Table 5 demonstrate
    that the proposed model exhibits superior performance compared to the advanced
    models employed for comparison. The proposed model has resulted in better network
    throughput, lifetime, and leftover residual energy. The energy utilization is
    retained to be minimal compared to the other models that are considered in the
    evaluation process. The other significant evaluation metric is the computational
    delay in the network, which is assessed for each round. The analysis is made over
    multiple rounds. The experimental results on delay evaluation are presented in
    Table 8, and the corresponding graph on network delay is shown in Figure 8. Figure
    8. Graphs representing the network delay over multiple rounds. Table 8. Experimental
    values of time delay in milliseconds at various rounds of the simulation. The
    proposed model has a minimal time delay at all rounds from starting till the end
    of the network’s analysis. The network with minimal would have a faster response
    to the service request, and the network would be more productive. The proposed
    network procedure has been shown to perform well across several assessment parameters.
    The proposed model has approximately 26% times better node sustainability in the
    network than the other existing models. It can be observed from the results obtained
    that the time delay at the 2000th round of the proposed model is approximately
    18% lesser than the PB-RESHM, which is a model that holds the least time delay
    among the existing contemporary models. The energy utilization of the model is
    approximately 14% better than the other state-of-art models, and the model holds
    approximately 10% more residual energy than the other existing models. The comparison
    in the study is made across multiple approaches, and the experimental values of
    the state-of-art models are acquired from the previous publications to ensure
    the values are authentic, resulting in the change of approaches over multiple
    parameters. 5. Conclusions The studies have determined that the WSNs are a crucial
    component of remote sensing for smart agricultural systems, allowing for better
    monitoring, temperature monitoring, irrigation system monitoring, and water supply
    monitoring. It’s crucial because it facilitates interaction between various network
    entities in the intelligent agricultural ecosystem. A WSN is made up of nodes
    that are in constant contact with one another and with a BS. The sensors’ topology
    management, mapping, and storage, as well as their battery life, all have their
    drawbacks. Due to these barriers, the efficiency of the intelligent farm system
    has been diminished. The proposed energy-aware model is robust in establishing
    and maintaining the network with reasonable lifetime, delay, and energy consumption.
    The experimental analysis with various contemporary models has proven that the
    proposed approach has outperformed network management. The unique way of choosing
    the initial CH based on the underlying node capabilities, updating the cluster
    head index based on the local and global best indexed, and assessing the cluster
    fitness to retain the cluster in subsequent rounds would assist in better network
    establishment and maintenance. The forthcoming strategy involves utilizing and
    establishing auto-encoder technology to deploy sensors and prioritize feature
    significance in the cluster head selection process within the network. The futuristic
    evaluations may consider evaluating against the network with a broader area with
    dense nodes for precise analysis of the network’s robustness. The network performance
    can be further assessed by incorporating the temporary support nodes to improve
    the network’s lifetime. Funding The paper funding was performed by the Deputyship

  description: Precision agriculture, driven by IoT(Internet Of Things) technologies,
    has revolutionized the farming industry by enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven
    decision-making. This study proposes an enhanced data transmission system for
    LoRa- (Long Range)based precision agriculture, leveraging the capabilities of
    dual LoRa devices. The system aims to overcome communication challenges in large
    agricultural areas and ensure reliable and extended-range connectivity between
    sensor nodes and the central gateway. The proposed system architecture includes
    IoT sensor nodes deployed throughout the farm, equipped with various environmental
    sensors to monitor crucial parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, and pressure. Two LoRa devices are introduced within the system.
    A local LoRa device is placed in proximity to the sensor nodes, and a main LoRa
    gateway serves as the central hub for data aggregation. The local LoRa device
    acts as a relay point, receiving sensor data from the nearby nodes and transmitting
    it wirelessly to the main LoRa gateway. This dual LoRa device setup extends the
    communication range and enhances signal strength, enabling seamless and reliable
    transmission of sensor data over long distances, even in challenging terrains.
    The main LoRa gateway collects the transmitted data from the local LoRa device
    and forwards it to the network server for further analysis and decision-making.
    This data-driven approach empowers farmers to gain real-time insights into the
    farm's conditions, optimize resource allocation, and improve agricultural practices.
    In our project, we transfer the collected sensor data using LoRa and we implement
    it into Machine Learning for rainfall prediction.

    agriculture, driven by IoT(Internet Of Things) technologies, has revolutionized
    the farming industry by enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making.
    This study proposes an enhanced data transmission system for LoRa- (Long Range)based
    precision agriculture, leveraging the capabilities of dual LoRa devices. The system
    aims to overcome communication challenges in large agricultural areas and ensure
    reliable and extended-range connectivity between sensor nodes and the central
    gateway. The proposed system architecture includes IoT sensor nodes deployed throughout
    the farm, equipped with various environmental sensors to monitor crucial parameters
    such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and pressure. Two
    LoRa devices are introduced within the system. A local LoRa device is placed in
    proximity to the sensor nodes, and a main LoRa gateway serves as the central hub
    for data aggregation. The local LoRa device acts as a relay point, receiving sensor
    data from the nearby nodes and transmitting it wirelessly to the main LoRa gateway.
    This dual LoRa device setup extends the communication range and enhances signal
    strength, enabling seamless and reliable transmission of sensor data over long
    distances, even in challenging terrains. The main LoRa gateway collects the transmitted
    data from the local LoRa device and forwards it to the network server for further
    analysis and decision-making. This data-driven approach empowers farmers to gain
    real-time insights into the farm''s conditions, optimize resource allocation,
    and improve agricultural practices. In our project, we transfer the collected
    sensor data using LoRa and we implement it into Machine Learning for rainfall
    prediction. Published in: 2023 International Conference on Intelligent Technologies

    Coimbatore, India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION LoRa (Long Range) is a wireless communication
    technology that enables long-range, low-power connectivity for various applications,
    including precision agriculture. In precision agriculture, LoRa plays a crucial
    role by providing reliable and efficient connectivity between sensors, devices,
    and the central monitoring system. This technology utilizes the unlicensed radio
    spectrum, allowing for long-range transmission of data over several kilometers,
    even in rural or remote areas. By using LoRa-based solutions, farmers can monitor
    environmental conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and crop
    growth remotely and in real-time. This information helps optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, pest control, and overall crop management, leading to increased
    productivity, resource efficiency, and cost savings. The integration of LoRa in
    precision agriculture projects facilitates seamless connectivity, scalability,
    and extended battery life for sensors, making it an ideal choice for modern farming

    various parameters in precision agriculture, such as soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, light intensity, etc. Choose sensors that are compatible with the LoRa
    technology and can provide accurate and reliable measurements. LoRa-enabled sensor
    nodes using microcontrollers like ESP32. Interface the selected sensors with the
    microcontroller and program it to collect sensor data at regular intervals. LoRa
    transceivers, such as SX127, enable long-range communication between the sensor
    nodes and the central LoRa gateway. Set up LoRa communication protocols and configure
    the nodes to transmit sensor data packets using LoRa modulation. Establish a centralized
    LoRa gateway such as the Dargin LG308 Indoor LoRa Gateway. Connect the gateway
    to the Internet using Ethernet or Wi-Fi connectivity for cloud integration. Configure
    the gateway to receive LoRa packets from the sensor nodes. Set up LoRa parameters,
    including network frequency, data rate, and encryption, to ensure secure and reliable
    data transmission. Develop firmware for the sensor nodes to transmit the collected
    sensor data to the gateway using LoRa communication. Implement protocols such
    as MQTT or HTTP to send the data from the gateway to a cloud platform for further
    processing and analysis. Using logistic regression machine learning algorithm
    to find the relationship between the temperature, humidity, and light intensity
    and to find the percentage of a rainfall probability. Fig. 1 Workflow Show All
    In this flowchart firstly the data can be collected using various environmental
    sensors and if the soil moisture content is less than 30% the motor pump will
    turn on and if it is above 30% the motor pump will be turned off. From the field
    LoRa gateway the collected environmental sensor data can be transferred to the
    home LoRa gateway to monitor the environmental conditions from their home. Fig.
    2 Block Diagram Show All In this block diagram, the two LoRa gateway can be implemented
    one is Home and another one is LoRa gateway. The field LoRa gateway collects the
    data from temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light intensity, and pressure
    sensors and this data can be transmitted to the Home LoRa gateway the data can
    be transferred to the Thing speak cloud, and using Machine learning the collected
    sensor data can be pre-processed and analyzed and it can predict the rainfall
    probability based on the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. SECTION IV.
    RESULTS Fig. 3 Field Gateway hardware setup Show All The hardware setup of the
    Field LoRa gateway involves Esp 32 acting as a microcontroller and the LoRa e32
    device is used to transfer the data to long range without internet connectivity
    and the temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light intensity, and pressure can
    be connected to microcontroller and the relay is used to control the flow of power
    and the solenoid valve controls the water flow based on the soil moisture sensor
    threshold. In summary, the Field LoRa gateway, with its ESP32 microcontroller,
    LoRa E32 for long-range communication, and a suite of environmental sensors, relay,
    and solenoid valve, is a comprehensive and intelligent solution for optimizing
    agriculture and other applications that demand efficient data monitoring and control
    without the need for internet connectivity. Fig. 4 Field gateway results Show
    All This implies that the LoRa (Long-Range) technology, is a low-power, long-range
    wireless communication protocol. Precision agriculture involves optimizing farming
    practices to maximize yields, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact
    through data-driven decision-making The Field Gateway is a crucial component in
    our project. It serves as a data collection and communication hub located in the
    agricultural field. Here''s what it does: The Field Gateway collects real-time
    data from various environmental sensors deployed in the field. These sensors could
    include soil moisture sensors, weather stations, temperature and humidity sensors,
    soil nutrient sensors, and light intensity. The gateway integrates data from these
    sensors, providing a comprehensive view of the field''s conditions. It may perform
    some initial data processing or aggregation to ensure the data is accurate and
    meaningful. The Field Gateway uses LoRa technology to transmit this data wirelessly
    to the Home LoRa Gateway. LoRa is suitable for long-range communication, making
    it ideal for transmitting data from remote agricultural locations. Lora’s low-power
    characteristics are beneficial for a Field Gateway since it can operate on battery
    power or solar energy, allowing it to be deployed in remote areas without a constant
    power source. Fig. 5 Home Gateway hardware setup Show All The home LoRa gateway
    receives the environmental data from the field gateway and this data can be transferred
    to the Thing Speak cloud for the data visualization. The hardware components involve
    the esp32 microcontroller the LoRa e32 and the antenna. To improve the efficiency
    of data processing. The data received and processed by the Home LoRa Gateways
    plays a critical role in providing accurate results and also it provides constant
    and reliable. Fig. 6 Home gateway results Show All The home LoRa gateway is the
    central hub or base station responsible for receiving data from one or more field
    LoRa Gateways deployed in the agricultural field, The primary role of the Home
    LoRa gateway is to receive data transmitted by the Field LoRa gateways. It continuously
    listens for incoming data packets from the field. If there are multiple Field
    LoRa Gateways deployed across the agricultural area, the Home LoRa Gateway aggregates
    the data from these various sources. This aggregation ensures that all data from
    different parts of the farm are centralized in one location for further processing.
    The Home LoRa Gateway decodes the LoRa packets received from the field. LoRa technology
    uses a specific modulation scheme, and the gateways are equipped to interrupt
    the extract the sensor data contained within these packets. The received data
    is typically stored temporarily on the Home LoRa Gateway. This storage may be
    used for data redundancy and to ensure that data is not lost in case of communication
    interruptions. Depending on the project''s design, the Home LoRa Gateway can forward
    the collected data to a cloud-based platform or a central database. Cloud storage
    allows for long-term data retention and easy access from anywhere with an internet
    connection. The gateway may perform initial data analysis or preprocessing tasks,
    such as data filtering, outlier detection, or data aggregation over time intervals.
    This can help reduce the amount of data transmitted to the cloud decision support
    for precision agriculture. Farmers and agricultural experts can access this data
    to make informed decisions related to irrigation scheduling, fertilization, pest
    management, and crop health monitoring. The Home LoRa Gateway may be programmed
    to trigger alerts or notifications based on predefined conditions. For example,
    it can send alerts when soil moisture levels drop below a certain threshold, indicating
    a need for irrigation. In more advanced setups, the Home LoRa Gateway can integrate
    with existing farm management systems, enabling seamless data flow and automation
    of farming operations. The Home LoRa Gateway serves as the central data hub in
    your LoRa-Based Precision Agriculture project. It receives, aggregates, decodes,
    and processes data from the field LoRa gateways, ultimately contributing to data-driven
    decision-making and improving precision Agricultural practices on the farm. The
    below table shows the received value from the Home LoRa gateway. TABLE I. Sensor
    readings SECTION V. THING SPEAK CLOUD The Home LoRa Gateway is configured to transfer
    the collected agricultural data to the Thing Speak cloud platform. Thing Speak
    provides a user-friendly and highly customizable interface for storing and visualizing
    IoT data. Thing Speak offers a wide range of visualization tools, including graphs,
    charts, and gauges. Farmers can access the visualizations through a web-based
    dashboard or a mobile app. They can view real-time and historical data related
    to their fields, allowing for informed decision-making. Farmers have the flexibility
    to create custom dashboards tailored to their specific needs. They can select
    the parameters they want to monitor, arrange widgets as per their preferences,
    and set thresholds or alerts for critical parameters. With Thing Speak, farmers
    can monitor the status of their fields in real-time. They can track parameters
    such as soil moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors
    that impact crop health and growth. Thing Speak also achieves historical data,
    enabling farmers to analyze trends and patterns over time. This data analysis
    can reveal seasonal variations, identify areas for improvement, and assist in
    long-term planning. The integration with Thing Speak allows farmers to set up
    alerts and notifications. When sensor data exceeds or falls below predefined thresholds
    (e.g., soil moisture levels too low), the platform can send email or SMS alerts
    to inform farmers of critical conditions. Fig. 7 Thingspeak results Show All The
    existing methods for transmitting sensor readings from agricultural lands typically
    rely on direct transfers through the ThingSpeak cloud, necessitating high internet
    speeds. Acknowledging the challenge posed by limited internet connectivity in
    these regions, the proposed methodology introduces LoRa devices to efficiently
    transmit sensor data from the home LoRa gateway to the field LoRa gateway. This
    innovative approach not only overcomes internet connectivity limitations but also
    addresses cost concerns by substituting high-cost wind speed sensors, commonly
    used in existing methods, with more economical pressure sensors. Real-time tests
    conducted in a wheat field demonstrate the accelerated and cost-effective delivery
    of environmental sensor data to users, highlighting the efficacy of the LoRa device
    in optimizing resource utilization while ensuring efficient data transmission.
    SECTION VI. MACHINE LEARNING (ML) A logistic regression classifier is instantiated
    using the Logistic Regression class from scikit-learn. The model is trained on
    the training data (X_ train and y_ train) using the fit method. This step involves
    finding the optimal parameters for the logistic regression model to make accurate
    predictions. The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data (X_
    test) using the prediction method. The predicted values are stored in the ''y_
    pred'' variable. The accuracy of the model is calculated using the accuracy_ score
    function from sci-kit-learn. It measures the proportion of correctly predicted
    instances in the test data. The accuracy score is printed as a percentage. The
    code provides an example of how to use the trained model to predict the probability
    of rainfall for new data. In this case, it uses an example data point with temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity values of [38, 25, 850]. The predict_ prob method
    is used to obtain the probability of class 1 (rain) for the new data point. The
    result is converted to a percentage and printed as the \"Predicted Rainfall Probability.\"
    TABLE 2. Rainfall Probability SECTION VII. CONCLUSION LoRa-based precision agriculture
    is indeed a promising application of IoT technology that holds significant potential
    for revolutionizing modern farming practices. By deploying LoRa-based sensors
    in agricultural fields, farmers gain the ability to monitor a wide range of critical
    environmental factors in real time. These sensors can capture data on soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and light levels, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive understanding of their crop conditions. This data is transmitted
    wirelessly to a central server or a cloud-based platform, enabling farmers to
    access it remotely. Such real-time monitoring empowers farmers to make informed
    decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, ultimately leading
    to optimized crop yields and resource conservation, especially when water usage
    is a concern. Beyond real-time monitoring, the data collected through these sensors
    can be harnessed for predictive analytics. Machine learning algorithms can be
    employed to analyze historical data and current conditions to make forecasts,
    such as predicting rainfall probability. This can be invaluable for farmers in
    terms of planning irrigation schedules, avoiding over-irrigation during rainy
    periods, and conserving water resources during droughts. Machine learning models
    can also assist in crop disease prediction and early pest infestation detection,
    helping farmers take preventive measures, and thus reducing crop losses. In essence,
    the fusion of LoRa-based sensor technology and machine learning in precision agriculture
    not only increases farm productivity but also contributes to more sustainable
    and environmentally friendly farming practices. Authors Figures References Keywords

    Download chapter PDF 2.1 Introduction Precision farming involves the collection,
    transmission, processing, and archiving of farm-borne data and information for
    efficient farm management and decision making (Abd El-kader and Mohammad El-Basioni
    2013). This is based on the effective integration of smart sensors and communication
    technologies, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The WSNs make it possible
    to monitor and specifically target each farm activity at a low cost, regardless
    of the farm’s geographical area and location. However, an obstacle to precision
    agriculture is the limitation of readily available WSN technology, as most farms
    are located in regions with little or no telecommunication network coverage. Although
    the adoption of fixed base stations (i.e. repeaters) may solve these problems,
    however, this would increase the overhead cost of the project. In general, WSNs
    produce large amounts of sensitive data at regular intervals, which are not only
    susceptible to cyber attacks but also require high-bandwidth channels. To solve
    these problems, we adopted the latest variant of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
    model in Benyeogor et al. (2022), coupled with radio or Internet capability and
    a secure data aggregation scheme for effective data acquisition. The UAV acts
    as an airborne mobile base station with integrated cyberphysical and telemetric
    capabilities that extends its data communication coverage at a minimal cost (Yaqot
    et al. 2021; Bacco et al. 2018; Radoglou-Grammatikis et al. 2020). Each farm-wide
    WSN (FWSN) comprises several sensor nodes that, in turn, consist of a radio-enabled
    microcontroller that aggregates data from heterogeneous sensors. These low-level
    sensors could be used to measure farm variables such as soil fertility, moisture,
    pH, temperature, humidity, egg counts, animal health status and/or location. The
    proposed system could enable farm managers to monitor and respond to different
    situations on the farm in real-time via a remote server or base station with analytical
    front-end applications for interpreting sensors’ data and proffering appropriate
    decisions to actors (i.e., actuation mechanisms) such as an irrigation system
    or other farm mechanization for effective precision farming. 2.2 Related Work
    The UAV is not only capable of providing ideal remote monitoring platforms, but
    is also capable of solving compatibility and reliability problems in precision
    farming. It provides small ground sampling distances, coverage on demand, and
    fast turnaround of information to farmers (Jr. and Daughtry 2018). This was demonstrated
    in Haque et al. (2014), where an autonomous low-weight, and low-cost UAV was developed
    using an Android-based flight controller. This system also uses the Google Maps
    application for localization, trajectory planning, and navigation. To improve
    UAV performance, Daniel et al. (2015) proposed two approaches for mathematical
    modeling of UAV dynamics and kinematics. Their dynamics model was based on Lagrangian
    mechanics and Denavit-Hartenberg formulas, while their kinematic mathematical
    model was derived from classical mechanics equations. They applied their model
    for the control of one axis motion of a UAV. In Yang and Wang (2013), Runfeng
    and Xi introduced a novel solution for the incline detection of UAVs, which involved
    coupling a special robot vision camera with an inclinometer to analyze and formulate
    intelligent behavior for UAVs. Their system-aided a prototype UAV that is controlled
    by an on-board microprocessor to achieve and maintain level attitude for sustained
    periods of time (a crucial feat for the deployment of UAVs as airborne mobile
    base stations). Most of these UAVs have low battery life, poor power-material
    balance or are too expensive for economic use, and are therefore not suitable
    for use as mobile base stations for widely separated FWSNs as required for large-scale
    precision farming. In a closely related work, Caruso et al. investigated how near
    a UAV must fly over the sensors of an on-the-ground WSN to properly collect data
    (Caruso et al. 2021). According to them, this might be used as a criterion for
    selecting the suitable UAV, installing sensors at the appropriate spacing on the
    field, and resolving trade-offs between field size and UAV autonomy and flight
    path. Also, Zeng et al. explored various applications of UAVs as aerial base stations
    (i.e., signal amplifiers or repeaters) in future wireless communications systems,
    citing the cost-effectiveness of the approach (Zeng et al. 2016). Similar to this,
    Singh and Sharma devised a UAV-based platform for collecting and managing agricultural
    crop information in real-time. Singh et al. (2022). According to them, their system
    is 96.3% efficient and has high potential in agricultural applications such as
    crop health monitoring, spraying fertilizers, and pesticides. This method was
    experimentally explored by Lottes et al. in (2022), where they employed a machine
    learning-based approach for analyzing the spatial distribution of crops and weeds
    on farms using aerial photographs captured by a UAV. Secondly, FWSNs could produce
    large amounts of sensitive data, which are not only susceptible to cyber-attacks
    but also require high bandwidth channels. Many security and aggregation approaches
    have been proposed for different networks (Geneiatakis et al. 2017; Ren et al.
    2017; Tanaka et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2019; Sivaraman et al. 2015; Olakanmi 2017;
    Azrour et al. 2021; Guezzaz et al. 2022). However, these aggregation schemes would
    be too complex for resource-constrained FWSN gateways. Meanwhile, Bayerlein et
    al. in (2021) proposed a multi-UAV Path Planning scheme for wireless data harvesting
    with deep reinforcement learning that can be adapted to various parametric changes
    of a data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, geospatial
    factors, maximum flight time, etc., without the need to perform expensive recomputations
    or relearn control policies. In relation to this, several approaches were already
    proposed to improve the observability of precision farming by enhancing data communication
    in FWSN systems (Olakanmi and Adama 2020; Gong et al. 2015; Saikia et al. 2017;
    Kim et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2008; Gupta et al. 2016; Mabrouki
    et al. 2021). However, these favor the adoption of multipath as the best approach
    to developing WSN protocols for reliable data communication in FWSNs. Inline with
    this, Olakanmi and Adama (2020) proposed a secure multipath routing protocol based
    on sectorization and best-neighboring node selection models. According to them,
    this could satisfy the performance requirements of FWSNs in precision agriculture.
    Overall, multipath solutions are capable of increasing the reliability of FWSN
    system even though they could incur high computational and communication costs.
    Therefore, they are stark choices for precision farming. In essence, this suggests
    a dual approach involving the improvement of both the design and model of the
    UAV and FWSN systems, respectively, for effective data harvesting and precision
    farming. To solve the latter, we adopted and improved on the UAV model of Benyeogor
    et al. in (2022), which has demonstrates high aerodynamic efficiency, and sufficient
    payload carrying capacity/flight time. Hence, based on these literature, especially
    the works of Caruso et al. (2021); Zeng et al. (2016); Singh et al. (2022); Olakanmi
    (2017), the present paper focuses on employing the UAV model in Benyeogor et al.
    (2022) for efficient and cost effective aerial data communication in the FWSN.
    2.3 Data Aggregation Scheme for FWSN Gateway Our FWSN is clusterized into different
    clusters, the core of which is the gateway that consists of a microcontroller
    and a transceiver. The wireless transceiver serves as an access point through
    which data enter or exit a cluster. Each gateway aggregates the readings of its
    sensors and sends them to the UAV once they reach the range (\\({\\approx }100\\)
    m) during data collection. The UAV is embedded with a wireless transceiver to
    collect data from a specific FWSN, which comprises several sensor nodes, as shown
    in Fig. 2.1. The UAV semi-autonomously flies to the vicinity of the base station
    that houses the Farm manager server (FMS) to relay the harvested data, by means
    of radio telemetry. Meanwhile, the same data are uploaded to the cloud server,
    using a WiFi connection, once the UAV is within the coverage of the mobile network.

    2.2 Different views of the developed multisensor node consisting of soil pH sensor,
    soil moisture sensor, air volatility sensor and air humidity or temperature sensor
    Full size image Each multisensor node (or simply sensor node) can comprise sensors
    such as a temperature sensor to measure the temperature of a farmland soil, as
    shown in Fig. 2.2. The soil temperature would be a good indicator to inform a
    farmer on how much irrigation his farmland would require. A soil moisture sensor
    is also included to estimate the percentage of moisture contained in a farmland
    soil. This enables a farmer to determine when the soil is saturated with water
    and when to stop irrigation. A leaf moisture sensor can also be used to estimate
    the average volume of moisture on the surface of a leaf, which, together with
    soil temperature and moisture sensors, is a pointer to the level and timing of
    the required irrigation. The air temperature and relative humidity sensors are
    sensors that could help a farmer correctly estimate the weather and atmospheric
    conditions of the farm. This information would further help the farmer in determining
    what type of crops to plant per time and when to plant such crops. Obtaining environmental
    farmland data from a single geographical location is not a true picture of the
    overall measured phenomena. This is because the real-time values of such measured
    phenomena are not always uniform across a farmland. There are usually regions
    of peak value and regions of low values across a farmland. Therefore, it is more
    accurate to take measurements at multiple sites and evaluate the average values.
    This would provide a more accurate estimate of the environmental variables measured
    on farmland. An important aspect of this is how these information are securely
    transmitted from the FWSN gateway to the data acquisition system, before being
    relayed to the cloud serverbase station, at minimal computational communication
    cost. Therefore, we propose a data aggregation scheme that can be embedded in
    the cluster gateway to secure and reduce the number of transmission sessions between
    the gateway and the UAV. The following cryptography primitives are used in the
    proposed scheme. 1. Hash Function: A key based hash function H(.) is a mathematical
    operator that maps a message M of arbitrary length to strings of bits of fixed
    length (n bits) to give strings of bits of fixed length (l bits). That is, H:
    \\(\\{{0,1}\\}^* \\times \\{{0,1}\\}^n\\rightarrow \\{{0,1}\\}^l\\). It is used
    to generate a message digest to confirm that the content of the message has not
    changed. A hash function is easy to compute, has public functionality, pre-image
    and collision resistance. 2. Elliptic Curve Cryptography: Elliptic curve is a
    mathematical group that can be represented as: \\(E_q{(a,b)}: y^2=x^3+ax+b \\,
    (mod \\, p)\\) over a prime finite field \\(F_q\\), where \\(q>3\\), \\(a,b\\in
    F_q\\), and \\(4a^3+27b^2 \\, (mod \\, p) \\ne 0\\). It has the following properties;
    with a group member P and \\(\\kappa \\in Z^*_p\\), the point \\(Q = \\kappa _1*P\\)
    where Q is a point on the elliptic curve, such that Q can be computed given \\(\\kappa
    _1\\) and P (scalar multiplication), while finding \\(\\kappa _1\\) given Q and
    P is infeasible. This infeasibility is known as the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm
    Problem. Also, the addition of any points of \\(E_q{(a,b)}\\) with \\(R \\in Z^*_p\\)
    gives a value that is not an element of \\(E_q{(a,b)}\\) but an element of \\(Z^*\\).
    The formulated data aggregation scheme contains three algorithms; registration
    and key management, separable data aggregation, and de-aggregation algorithms.
    2.3.1 Registration and Key Management Registration and key management algorithm
    involves the generation of cryptographic key parameters for each cluster gateway
    (BS), Farm Manager Server (FMS) and sensors in the data harvesting system. The
    FMS registers each of the gateways and sensors in the FWSNs through the following
    steps: Step 1: The FMS randomly generates \\(b_k \\in {Z^*_p}\\) as master secret
    key for each BS k and randomly generates \\(a_{i,k} \\in Z^*_p\\) for each of
    the sensors i under the BS k to compute: \\(A_{i,k} = (b_k+a_{i,k})P\\); \\(gp_k
    = b_kP,\\) where \\(A_{i,k}\\) is the sensor’s secret key and \\(gp_k\\) is the
    BS’s public key. Step 2: FMS keeps a triple \\(\\{A_{i,k}, b_k, gp_k, \\kappa
    \\}\\) then publishes \\(gp_k\\) to the BS and securely sends a \\(A_{i,k}\\)
    as \\(B_{i,k} = A_{i,k} \\oplus \\kappa \\) and \\(Y_{k} = b_{k} \\oplus \\kappa
    \\) to BS k, where session \\(\\kappa \\) is the mutually generated session key
    between the FMS and BS generated as follows: BS of each cluster randomly generates
    \\(x_1\\), computes, and publishes \\(w_1 = x_1P\\) and \\(q_1 = w_1P\\). FMS
    randomly generates \\(x_2\\), computes, and publishes both \\(w_2 = x_2P\\) and
    \\(q_{2} = w_2P\\). Then, the BS computes its session key with the FMS as \\(\\kappa
    = x_1q_2\\). FMS also computes its session key with BS as \\(\\kappa = x_2q_1\\).
    Step 3: BS decrypts \\(B_{i,k}\\) and \\(Y_{k}\\) as: \\( A_{i,k} = B_{i,k} \\oplus
    \\kappa \\), \\( b_{k} = Y_{k} \\oplus \\kappa \\) and keeps a copy of \\(\\{A_{i,k},
    b_{k}, {gp}_k\\}\\). 2.3.2 Data Aggregation A simple but efficient data aggregation
    approach is proposed for each BS to aggregate and secure their sensors data. To
    secure data and reduce traffic, at each synchronized interval, each sensor forwards
    its data \\(M_{i,k}\\) as \\(m_{i,k}=M_{i,k} \\oplus A_{i,k}\\) to its BS, which
    generates the sensor aggregation parameters \\(D_{k}, \\Delta _{k}, \\tau _{k},
    \\varphi _{k}, \\omega _k\\) as follows: Step 1: BS k randomly selects \\({\\gamma
    _{k}, \\beta _{k} \\in \\mathbb {Z}^*_{q}}\\) and time stamp \\(t_s\\) and computes
    its aggregation parameters as: \\(\\varphi _{k} = (b_{k} \\oplus \\gamma _{k})
    \\) \\(D_{k} = \\gamma _{k} \\oplus \\beta _{k}\\) \\(\\Delta _{k} = H(gp_k \\parallel
    D_{k} \\parallel b_{k})\\) \\(\\tau _{k} = D_{k}*\\gamma _{k}-\\beta _{k}\\) \\(\\omega
    _{k} = (b_{k} \\oplus \\beta _{k} \\oplus t_s).\\) Step 2: BS then publishes \\(\\varphi
    _{k}, D_{k}\\) of each sensor to FMS, who will later use it for data deaggregation.
    Step 3: BS aggregates all sensor data \\(m_{i,k}\\) in the synchronized interval
    as \\(\\rho _{k} = \\sum ^n_{i =1}m_{i,k}\\) Step 4: Signs the aggregated data
    as \\(\\sigma _{k} = (H_{b_{k}}(\\varphi _{k} \\parallel \\omega _{k} \\parallel
    \\beta _{k} \\parallel t_s \\parallel \\tau _{k} \\parallel \\rho _{k})\\parallel
    \\Delta _{k} )\\) Step 5: For each sensor data \\(m_{i,k}\\) BS computes the aggregation
    ratio \\(\\hbar _{i,k}\\) as \\(\\hbar _{i,k} = \\frac{m_{i,k}}{min(m_{1,k}......m_{n,k}})\\)
    and computes the signature ratio \\(\\eta \\) as \\(\\eta _{i,k} = \\sigma _{k}*\\hbar
    _{i,k} \\) Step 6: BS uploads \\(\\rho _{k} ||\\sigma _{k}||(\\eta _{1,k}||......||\\eta
    _{n,k}||||\\varphi _{k}||D_{k}\\) to the harvester as their aggregated data, who
    then transfers them to FMS. 2.3.3 Data De-Aggregation The major problem with most
    existing aggregation schemes is how the receiver separates the individual data
    from the aggregated data received. To obtain individual sensor data from the aggregated
    data received, we developed the following separation procedure for the aggregation
    scheme as follows. Step 1: FMS recomputes \\(\\tau ''_{k}, \\omega ''_{k}, \\Delta
    _{k}, t_s\\) as: \\(\\gamma ''_{k} = \\varphi _{k}\\oplus b_{k}\\) \\( \\beta
    ''_{k} = D_{k} \\oplus \\gamma ''_{k} \\) \\(t''_s = \\omega _{k} \\oplus t_s
    \\oplus b_{k} \\oplus \\beta ''_{k}\\) \\(\\tau ''_{k} = D_{k}*\\gamma ''_{k}-\\beta
    ''_{k}\\) \\(\\Delta ''_{k} = H(gp_k \\parallel D_{k} \\parallel b_{k})\\) \\(\\sigma
    ''_{k} = (H_{b_{k}}(\\varphi ''_{k} \\parallel \\omega ''_{k} \\parallel \\beta
    ''_{k} \\parallel t''_s \\parallel \\tau ''_{k} \\parallel \\rho ''_{k})\\parallel
    \\Delta ''_{k} )\\) Step 2: FMS checks if the computed \\(\\sigma ''_{k} ?\\,{=}\\,
    \\sigma _{k}\\), accepts the aggregated data \\(\\rho _{k}\\) and proceeds to
    step 3, otherwise rejects \\(\\rho _{k}\\). Step 3: To deaggregate the aggregated
    data \\(\\rho _{k}\\), for each sensor, FMS extracts the signature ratio \\(\\eta
    _{i,k}\\) from the cluster data \\(\\rho _{k} ||\\sigma _{i,k}||(\\eta _{1,k}||......||\\eta
    _{n,k}\\) to calculate the aggregation ratio \\(\\hbar _{i,k}\\) as \\(\\hbar
    ''_{i,k} = \\frac{\\eta _{i,k}}{\\sigma ''_{i,k}}\\), and generates the sensor
    data \\(m_{i,k} = \\frac{\\eta ''_{i,k}*min(m_{1,k}, m_{2,k},\\ldots ,m_{n,k})}{\\sigma
    _k}\\). Step 4: Decrypts \\(m_{i,k}\\) to obtain \\(M_{i,k} = m_{i,k} \\oplus
    A_{i,k}\\). FMS repeats steps 1–4 for each of the sensors in each cluster to obtain
    their data. FMS securely sends the de-aggregated data to the cloud server for
    analytical requests from actors. Possible technological processes by which these
    data packages could be communicated between the various FWSN gateways and the
    data acquisition system, and between the latter and the cloud server or base station
    are explained in Sect. 2.4. 2.4 Farm Wireless Sensor Network System For the purpose
    at hand, the UAV serves to transport the data acquisition system (as its only
    payload) to FWSNs for proximity data harvesting. This involves the integration
    of ground-based and airborne instrumentation or telematic systems to form an intelligent
    FWSN system over the entire farmland to collect information about the state of
    farm animals or plantations in real-time. For efficient wireless transmission
    or acquisition of information in FWSN systems, the combination of radio, serial
    Bluetooth, and WiFi communication is used. The radio communication medium is operated
    within the industrial scientific medical (ISM) range of bands. Using this medium,
    it was possible to relay the pre-processed data from various FWSN to the cloud
    server and base station for further analysis. The various communication models,
    protocols, and circuitry designs of this system are technically described as follows.
    2.4.1 Farm Wireless Sensor Network (FWSN) The hardware implementation of this
    system comprises a central microcontroller that is digitally interfaced with an
    NRF24L01 transceiver module, as shown in Fig. 2.3. The operational parameters
    of this system are given in Table 2.1. This is a RF front-end device that can
    be programmed to function as a transmitter or receiver, or a combination of both.
    In addition, it enables the interconnection of several similar transceiver modules,
    which could be used to set up a WSN cybertronics and cyber-physical system. In
    the current work, it is configured to harvest sensors’ data from a given FWSN
    and transmit them as a single data package to the data acquisition system on the
    UAV. Fig. 2.3 The NRF24L01 transceiver module Full size image 2.4.2 Data Acquisition
    System This is the IoT-based or radio communication system that is onboard the
    UAV, which constitutes the augmentation of the NRF24L01 transceiver system in
    Fig. 2.3 with the WiFi ESP32 WiFi module. Its function is to receive data packages
    from the FWSN transmitter and then relay them to the base station and a cloud
    server via the RF communication channel and WiFi connectivity, respectively. The
    WiFi ESP32 WiFi module is adopted for the latter to effectively extend the capability
    of the RF communication medium and transmit the same data package to a remote
    server or beyond the LoS cloud server via the Internet. To implement the software
    components of the FWSN system, the security scheme in Sect. 2.3 is used and consists
    of the data aggregation and deaggregation algorithms (including intrinsic security
    features) that are core components of the software layer of the FWSN system. In
    pseudocode, these computational processes are simplified to Algorithms 1 and 2
    for the transmitter (ground-based) and receiver (airborne) ends, respectively,
    of the FWSN system. Table 2.1 Parameters for radio transmission of data packages
    using the NRF24L01 transceiver module Full size table 2.5 Performance Analysis
    Our practical demonstration of this FWSN system is captured in Fig. 2.4, which
    entails real-time streaming and visualization of sensors data from a single multisensor
    node deployed in our experimental farm. This shows the applicability of the system
    for the collection, transmission, classification, visualization, and increase
    in response speed of farm data. This telemetric method was applied in the field
    evaluation of the complete FWSN system. Several sensor nodes were geospatially
    sampled at different locations of the FWSN. The results of these are discussed
    below. Fig. 2.4 Practical demonstration of farm data acquisition with the FWSN
    system Full size image 2.5.1 Quantity-Specific Geospatial Sensing Having demonstrated
    the visualization of sensors’ data at each node, we also demonstrated the practicality
    of large-scale data harvesting on large farms, based on the model in Fig. 2.1.
    To do this, data from a specific type of sensor in 10 different multisensor nodes
    installed at different geographical locations in a FWSN are collected and sampled.
    Here, we harvested data from the soil humidity sensor, temperature sensor, pH
    sensor, and air volatility sensor of each multisensor node in the FWSN. Coupled
    with the geographical positions of each these nodes as shown in Fig. 2.5a, the
    values of which were predetermined during their installation, the 3D bar charts
    in Fig. 2.5b–d visualizes the geospatial variation of soil humidity, soil temperature,
    soil pH, (at a depth of 20 cm), and air volatile organic compound (VOC) concentration
    (such as methane, carbon dioxide, smoke, etc.) across the farmland. For instance,
    Fig. 2.5d allows us to assess the atmospheric chemical profile and perform an
    air quality assessment of the geographical location of the farm. This method provides
    geospatial situational awareness of various environmental changes on the farm
    for effective and progressive planning. Fig. 2.5 Visualization of geospatial variations
    of environmental changes on the farm Full size image 2.5.2 Evaluation of FWSN
    System To test the performance of the FWSN system (incorporating the FWSN gateways,
    data acquisition system, and aggregation schemes), we used three 50 by 100 m farmlands
    each with twenty different wireless sensors with a communication range between
    75 and 100 m. Also, to evaluate the effect of the data acquisition system and
    our schemes (i.e., Algorithms 1 and 2) on the turnaround of the sensors’ data,
    we measured the average round trip time of the sensors to two cloud servers with
    and without the aggregation scheme. Figure 2.6 shows the average round-trip time
    for various numbers of sensors data of different 32-byte size harvested, aggregated
    and uploaded to Google (note that \\(t_1\\) denotes the time latency for data
    transmission with the data harvester aggregation scheme while \\(t_2\\) denotes
    data without two entities). These analyzes reveal that the data aggregation scheme
    reduces the average round-trip time, regardless of the number of sensors on the
    farm compared to when the data aggregation scheme is not engaged. This indicates
    that the use of the developed data aggregation scheme improves the data harvester
    in terms of latency and traffic. Fig. 2.6 Comparison in the average round trip
    time (i.e., time latency) between FWSN and Google cloud with and without data
    harvester and aggregation for different sensors Full size image 2.5.3 Latency
    of RF-Based Data Transmission To determine the rate at which multisensor data
    packages are transmitted, communication latency analysis is performed as a function
    of the number of sensors in a node. Figure 2.7 shows a latency of 1.1 s for 1
    sensor and 1.3 s for 4 sensors is real-time and applicable to precision agriculture,
    based on the scope and technical requirements of our experimental farm. Fig. 2.7

    Full size image 2.6 Conclusion This paper presents low-cost technological capabilities
    that could be used to monitor and improve agricultural productivity. These include
    the development of modular multisensor data acquisition systems, reliable mid-range
    and long-range communication technologies, and software-oriented security schemes
    (for secure transmission and processing of information), coupled with the adoption
    of UAVs as mobile base stations. Experiments were performed to ascertain the applicability
    of the system to modern agriculture. The preliminary results show that the developed
    system is robust and effective for real-time precision agriculture. In addition,
    deployment tests show that the adopted UAV has effective hovering capability over
    a particular location for the onboard data acquisition system to relay farm sensors’
    data. Meanwhile, the aggregated scheme, the associated edge computing and communication
    systems have high reliability to secure the telemetry of farm data while reducing
    communication traffic between the farm multisensor nodes and the cloud server
    or base station. Therefore, we hope that the present work incites interest in
    the developed system and the general applications of electronics and computing
    to agriculture. In view of this, we envisage that this work would also improve
    scientific collaborations between scientists, engineers, and farmers to fully
    exploit the capabilities of the developed FWSN system. References Abd El-kader

  description: Agriculture productivity can be enhanced by IoT-enabled real-time monitoring
    of weather and soil pa-rameters. Increased volume of sensor data demands a significant
    amount of memory and power. It also overloads the network, making real-time parameter
    monitoring very difficult. A large volume of sensor data reduces the lifetime
    and latency of the network, decreasing the overall throughput. Hence, a reduction
    in data overload becomes necessary for energy optimization of these energy-constrained
    sensors. Data aggregation is an effective way of optimizing energy consumption
    by reducing the volume of redundantly sensed data. Data aggregation helps in designing
    energy-efficient routing algorithms to transmit information by consuming min-imum
    energy to increase the operational period of the network. This paper surveys different
    routing algorithms for data aggregation with a focus on energy optimization in
    precision agriculture. The survey includes IPv6 routing protocol for low-power
    and lossy networks (RPL) to reduce network overload during data transmission,
    nature-inspired algorithms for energy-optimized intra-cluster communication, and
    energy-efficient compressive sensing (CS) to minimize redundant data by aggregation.
    It also examines duty-cycling algorithms for reducing average energy consumption
    by periodically placing sensors into the sleep mode during inactive state to save
    energy. Different performance benchmarks are evaluated to determine the suitability
    of the routing algorithms in agriculture.

  description: Monitoring system is widely used to detect the environment parameters
    such as temperature, humidity and position information in cold chain logistic,
    modern agriculture, hospital and so on. Poor position precision, high communication
    cost, high packet loss rate are the main problems in current monitoring system.
    To solve these problems, the paper presents a new monitoring system based on Narrow
    Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and BeiDou system/Global System Position (BDS/GPS)
    dual-mode positioning. Considering the position precision, a dual-mode positioning
    circuit based on at6558 is designed, and the calculation formula of the positioning
    information of the monitored target has been derived. Subsequently, a communication
    network based on wh-nb75-ba NB-IoT module is designed after compared with the
    LoRa technology. According to the characteristics of high time correlation of
    sensor data, an adaptive optimal zero suppression (AOZS) compression algorithm
    is proposed to improve the efficiency of data transmission. Experiments prove
    the feasibility and effectiveness of the system from the aspects of measurement
    accuracy, positioning accuracy and communication performance. The temperature
    and humidity error are less than 1 °C and 5% RH respectively with the selected
    sensor chips. The position error is decided by several factors, including the
    number of satellites used for positioning, the monitored target moving speed and
    NB-IoT module lifetime period. When the monitored target is stationary, the positioning
    error is about 2 m, which is less than that of the single GPS or BDS mode. When
    the monitored target moves, the position error will increase. But the error is
    still less than that of the single GPS or BDS mode. Then the AOZS compression
    algorithm is used in actually experiment. The compression ratio (CR) of it is
    about 10% when the data amount increasing. In addition, the packet loss rate test
    experiment proves the high reliability of the proposed system.

    error is about 2 m, which is less than that of the single GPS or BDS mode. When
    the monitored target moves, the position error will increase. But the error is
    still less than that of the single GPS or BDS mode. Then the AOZS compression
    algorithm is used in actually experiment. The compression ratio (CR) of it is
    about 10% when the data amount increasing. In addition, the packet loss rate test
    experiment proves the high reliability of the proposed system. Keywords: NB-IoT;
    BDS/GPS dual-mode positioning; data compression algorithm 1. Introduction Monitoring
    system can detect environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and location
    information, and send these information to the monitoring center, which greatly
    reduce the workload of staff and enhanced management efficiency. Hence, it has
    gotten more and more recognition and application in cold chain logistic monitoring,
    modern agriculture arrangement, hospital monitoring and so on. Due to hardware
    technology, communication network and other reasons, the system still has the
    following deficiencies: (i) Poor positioning precision, especially for the moving
    object. Currently, the positioning error is about 50 m for the stationary object,
    while that is more than 100 m for moving object. (ii) High cost, especially for
    the communication cost. The hardware cost is a one-time investment, but the communication
    cost needs to be paid for every day. Actually, the transmission data amount of
    a monitoring system is small, but it needs to communicate with the monitoring
    center through 3 g/4 g network, so it has to pay for the expensive network resources,
    and the cost of communication is very high. (iii) Unreliable network performance,
    poor stability and high packet loss rate. The packet loss rate of existing monitoring
    systems is about 10% when the distance is about 1 km. When the communication network
    becomes worse, the packet loss rate will be higher. Therefore, it is essential
    to develop a monitoring system with high reliability and low cost. Generally,
    the monitoring system mainly includes the three parts: communication network design,
    position function design and realization, and data transmission. The data transmission
    network of the monitoring system belongs to long-distance network. 4 g and low-power
    wide area network (LPWAN) are main long-distance communication. 4 g has high power
    consumption and high traffic cost, which is not suitable for non-real time communication.
    LoRa and NB-IoT are representative technologies of LPWAN [1]. LoRa is a physical
    layer technology which uses a proprietary spread spectrum technique to modulate
    signals in sub-GHz ISM bands. The bidirectional communication of LoRa is provided
    by the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation that spreads a narrow-band signal
    over a wider channel bandwidth. The resulting signal has low noise levels, enabling
    high interference resilience and is difficult to detect or jam [1]. It provides
    long-range communication up to 10–40 km in rural areas and 1–5 km in urban areas
    and has very high energy efficiency [2,3,4]. Compared to LoRa, NB-IoT can use
    the current 3 g/4 g network to save the network cost and shortens the developing
    period with the license frequency band [5,6,7]. It uses a minimum system bandwidth
    of 180 kHz for downlink and uplink communication and can be deployed in three
    operating modes: (a) Stand-alone, (b) Guard band, and (c) In-band [8,9,10]. The
    physical channels and signals of NB-IoT are time-division multiplexed. The data
    rate for uplink is about 160 to 200 kHz and 160 to 250 kHz for downlink. The coverage
    is 18 km in cities and 25 km in suburbs. Because of the above advantages, NB-IoT
    has been widely used in many fields [11,12,13]. It is regarded to be a very important
    technology and a large step for 5 g IoT evolution [14,15]. Many famous companies
    have shown great interest in NB-IoT as part of 5 g systems, and spent lots of
    effort in the standardization of NB-IoT [16,17]. Shi proposed a smart parking
    system using NB-IoT communication technology, which can effectively improve the
    utilization rate of the existing parking facilities [18]. Anand presented a remote
    monitoring mechanism for the water level in a storage tank using NB-IoT [19].
    Haibin studied NB-IoT in smart hospitals [20]. An infusion monitoring system was
    developed to monitor the real-time drop rate and the volume of remaining drug
    during the intravenous infusion. Srikanth put forward the utilization of onshore
    narrowband IoT infrastructure for tracking of containers transported by marine
    cargo vessels while operating near the coastline [21]. Xihai applied NB-IoT in
    an Information monitoring system to reduce the power consumption [22]. Cao applied
    the NB-IoT in intelligent traffic lights system for urban areas in Vietnan to
    reduce traffic congestion [23]. The above studies show that NB-IoT is oriented
    to applications that require high QoS and low latency and has strong links, high
    coverage, low power, and low cost [24]. Because of these, the paper proposed the
    monitoring system scheme based on NB-IoT. BeiDou satellite System (BDS) is a global
    positioning system independently developed by China. Its space station consists
    of 5 geostationary orbit satellites and 30 non-geostationary orbit satellites,
    while the space station of Global Position System (GPS) consists of 24 satellites
    (21 working satellites and 3 standby satellites). The user terminal of BDS has
    double-direction message communication, and the user can transmit short-message
    information of 40–60 Chinese characters per time [25]. GPS does not have the function
    of short-message communication. Unlike GPS which uses dual-frequency signals,
    BeiDou-3 uses triple-frequency signals, which can better eliminate the effect
    of the ionosphere and improve the positioning reliability and accuracy [26,27,28].
    With the initial service provided by the BDS foundation strengthening system,
    it can provide meter-level, sub-meter-level, decimeter-level and even centimeter
    -level service. In addition, BeiDou-3 satellite network has laid an “inter satellite
    link” in space. Thus, all satellites in the constellation can be connected without
    global stations, and the satellites can continue to provide services even if they
    are disconnected from the ground. Because of these advantages, BDS begins to be
    widely used to measure height [29], vehicle position [30], anomaly detection [31],
    and train position [32], etc. Some scholars propose to combine BDS with other
    positioning technologies to produce higher cost performance [33,34,35]. However,
    for both BDS or GPS, the number of observation satellites in a single satellite
    navigation system is limited, they will become extremely vulnerable in the case
    of severe environmental interference, and they cannot guarantee the positioning
    accuracy and availability of the receiver. Since GPS and BDS have common features
    in system design and positioning principle, the receiver can simultaneously receive
    the satellite signals of the two satellite navigation systems for dual-system
    integrated positioning to avoid the situation that a single satellite system cannot
    locate due to the lack of satellites. Therefore, in theory, BDS/GPS dual mode
    positioning can optimize the satellite position and improve the accuracy and availability
    of positioning results. This paper will use the BDS/GPS dual mode positioning
    system to improve the positioning accuracy. In wireless sensor networks, there
    is a large amount of redundant information in the original data collected by sensor
    nodes, including the temporal redundancy collected by the same node at adjacent
    times and the spatial redundancy collected by adjacent nodes in geographical areas
    [36]. If the data carrying a large amount of redundant information is transmitted,
    the communication bandwidth will be wasted and increased network delay and node
    energy consumption, which will affect the stability and life of the whole sensor
    network system. Compressing redundant information before transmitting original
    data is a mechanism that can effectively reduce node energy consumption. In recent
    years, researchers have proposed many data compression algorithms for wireless
    sensor networks. The main algorithms for wireless sensor data are divided into
    compression based on time correlation and compression based on space correlation.
    Data compression algorithm based on time correlation is a kind of typical compression
    algorithm. It often focuses on mining data time correlation and removing data
    time redundancy with the help of some classical coding technologies, such as Huffman
    [37], LZW [38], S-LZW [39], LEC [40], RLE [41]. The data compression algorithm
    based on spatial correlation is also a typical compression algorithm, which is
    often combined with clustering mechanism [42,43,44], and strives to fully mine
    the spatial correlation of data and reduce and balance the energy consumption
    of each node of the network. Data compression algorithms based on temporal and
    spatial correlation have attracted more and more attention. For example, the algorithm
    proposed by Ciancio and Donoho [45,46] not only involves removing the temporal
    redundancy of data, but also discusses how to establish an optimal path, so that
    the spatial redundancy can be removed to the greatest extent when the data is
    transmitted along this path. Difference mechanism is often used in data compression
    [47,48,49]. The common point of the data compression algorithm based on the difference
    mechanism is that by selecting a reference data, a single sensor node only needs
    to transmit the difference between the original sensing data and the reference
    data, so as to remove the temporal redundancy, or the adjacent sensor nodes in
    the geographical region only need to transmit the difference between their original
    sensing data and the reference data, so as to remove the spatial redundancy. The
    difference between these algorithms is the choice of difference coding. Differential
    Code Compression Method (DCCM) is the typical algorithm. The disadvantages of
    DCCM algorithm are: (i) simply taking the average value of data as the reference
    value, which is lack of rationality; (ii) The correlation between data is not
    mined. So the paper will propose a new algorithm to compress the sensor data.
    In view of the problems in the above literature, the paper proposes a monitoring
    system scheme with high positioning accuracy, low cost and high network reliability.
    Three main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (i) A new
    positioning system based on BeiDou System/Global Position System is proposed to
    improve the position accuracy. The hardware and software are introduced in detail
    in the paper. In the dual positioning system, more satellites can be obtained
    to calculate position information. The calculation formulas have also been derived.
    (ii) A new data compression algorithm is proposed. The new algorithm removes data
    redundancy according to the time correlation between data, and the compression
    rate is about 90%, while the complexity of it is similar to that of the commonly
    used algorithms. (iii) A transmission network system based on NB-IoT for the compressed
    data is proposed. Compared with LoRa technology, the system is more stable, more
    reliable and lower packet loss rate through the experiment. The development period
    of the system is shorter and the cost is lower. The remaining paper is organized
    as follows. Section 2 describes the monitoring system in detail, including hardware
    design and software design. Section 3 gives the results and test data. Section
    4 presents the discussion and analysis. Finally, Section 5 presents conclusions.
    2. Materials and Methods According to the framework of IoT, the network frame
    of the proposed scheme is divided into four parts: data acquisition layer which
    includes sensor nodes and sink nodes, communication layer which is NB-IoT station,
    application layer which is IoT cloud platform and user layer which is the monitoring
    center. The sensor node is the detection terminal which is used to detect the
    information around the sensor and send these information to the sink node. The
    sink node is used to receive the information from the sensor nodes and compress
    the information and send it to the IoT cloud platform. The whole hardware frame
    of the monitoring system is shown in Figure 1. The monitoring system includes
    one monitoring center which is in PC, and two mobile carriages. Each carriage
    includes one sink node and three sensor nodes. The sensor node is mainly composed
    of a stm8 MCU, a temperature and humidity sensor, a RFID module and lithium battery.
    Stm8 controls the temperature and humidity sensor to collect the temperature and
    humidity information nearby, and then send the information to the sink node through
    the RFID. The sink node is mainly composed of a stm32 MCU, a TFT display panel,
    a RFID module, a BDS/GPS module, a NB-IoT module and battery. Stm32 receives the
    temperature and humidity information from the sensor node through RFID and gets
    the position information from BDS/GPS module, then compresses and sends these
    data to the OneNET cloud platform through the NB-IoT module. The monitoring center
    is in PC. The temperature and humidity of each sensor node, the sink node position
    can be acquired in monitoring center by accessing the cloud platform. My SQL database
    is used to manage current and historical data. Real time map of each mobile carriage
    can also be displayed. Figure 1. Hardware frame of the monitoring system. 2.1.
    Hardware Design The hardware of monitoring system includes two parts, one is the
    sink node hardware, the other is the sensor node hardware. The hardware of sink
    node includes stm32f103c8t6, cc1101 RFID module, wh-nb75-ba NB-IoT module, at6558
    BDS/GPS positioning module, TFTLCD display screen, key module, 3.3 V voltage regulator
    module and several LED lights. The system is powered by 5 V battery. The physical
    hardware is shown in Figure 2. The wh-nb75-ba can access mobile developer platform
    OneNET for free, communicate with MCU by UART and configure with AT instruction
    set [50]. The positioning data collected by BDS/GPS module and temperature and
    humidity data sent by sensor nodes are sent to NB-IoT module through UART port
    during UART interrupt, and finally uploaded to cloud platform. At6558 chip is
    used in the positioning module with BDS/GPS dual positioning mode to obtain higher
    positioning accuracy. It is a real six in one multi-mode satellite navigation
    and positioning chip, which contains 32 tracking channels and can receive global
    navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals of six satellite navigation systems
    at the same time, and realize joint positioning, navigation and timing. This chip
    has high sensitivity, low power consumption and low cost, which is suitable for
    vehicle navigation, hand-held positioning and wearable devices [51]. The chip
    communicates with MCU through UART serial port. The baud rate of UART serial port
    is set to 9600, and the data format is strictly in accordance with international
    NMEA0183 standard. It is a low power chip. The working current is less than 23
    mA, the sleep current is less than 10uA. RFID module cc1101 is a kind of RF application
    which is lower than 1 GHz for ultra-low power consumption. It has high data transmission
    speed and long transmission distance. It is connected with MCU through 4-wire
    SPI interface and provides two universal digital output pins with configurable
    functions [52]. The 2.3-inch TFTLCD is a color LCD, which can exchange data with
    MCU through SPI interface. CH340 is used to down load the program in the PC to
    the stm32. In addition, some LED lights are used to indicate whether modules are
    connected successfully or not. Some keys are used to reset system or initialize
    modules. Figure 2. The Sink node physical diagram. The hardware of each sensor
    node includes stm8s103f3p MCU, cc1101 module, dht11 temperature and humidity sensor
    chip, using dry battery for power supply. The hardware block diagram of sensor
    node is shown in Figure 3. The stm8s103f3p MCU of the sensor node which has various
    communication protocols such as I2C, SPI and UART are designed in the 20 pins.
    It has 8 KB flash program memory and 1 KB RAM space that is fully competent for
    the current temperature and humidity acquisition and subsequent data acquisition.
    There are 46 working state configuration registers and 32 command registers. The
    temperature and humidity sensor DHT11 has a single bus bidirectional serial communication
    interface, which can be directly connected with the serial port of MCU. It can
    measure temperature and humidity at the same time. The measurement accuracy of
    humidity is ±5% RH, that of temperature is ±1 °C. In view of the low precision
    requirement, and the focus of our research is low power consumption, so we use
    this chip. It should be emphasized that in order to reduce the power consumption,
    the MCU does not read the temperature and humidity value of DHT11 all the time,
    but only reads when receiving the reading request from the sink node. SWD is used
    to load down the program from the PC to stm8s103f3p. Figure 3. Sensor node physical
    diagram. 2.2. Software Design According to the hardware frame in Figure 1, the
    software of monitoring system includes three parts: (i) the sink node software.
    Receiving the data sent by each sensor node, starting the positioning module to
    obtain the positioning information, configuring the cloud platform, and compressing
    and sending the received data and so on must be completed by the software of the
    sink node. Before the sink node sends data, the cloud platform must be configured
    according to the actual situation. Then the data sent by the sink node can be
    stored in the cloud platform. The cloud platforms of different NB-IoT companies
    are different. People need to refer to the user manual for configuration. (ii)
    the sensor node software. The main task of sensor node software is to start each
    sensor on the node to make them work normally, then collect their data and send
    them to the sink node. (iii) the monitoring center software. The software of the
    monitoring center needs to download temperature, humidity and positioning information
    from the cloud platform and store them in the database. In addition, it also needs
    to display the location information on the map and draw the temperature and humidity
    curve. 2.2.1. Software Design of Sink Nodes The software design of sink node mainly
    focuses on four subprograms: NB-IoT subprogram, RFID subprogram, BDS/GPS subprogram
    and data compression subprogram. The main program flow chart of sink node is shown
    in Figure 4. After the initialization of each module, the main program will be
    looped in each module subprogram to deal with each module in real time. The watchdog
    is added to the main program to reset the program to prevent the program from
    getting stuck or running away. Figure 4. Main program flow chart of sink node.
    OneNET platform is a NB-IoT cloud platform developed by China Mobile Communication
    Company. It can communicate with multiple sink nodes and can read data from multiple
    sink nodes at the same time by multithreading. We should login in the platform
    “https://open.iot.10086.cn (accessed on 20 January 2022)” to register the device
    name. Then add the objects for each device, as well as the number of points and
    properties of each object. In our experiment, there are three objects in each
    device, namely temperature, humidity and position information. Finally, the data
    type of each object should be described. For example, the data type of temperature
    is 31 bits floating point. According to the Internet Protocol for Smart Objects
    (IPSO) Alliance Technical Guideline, the longitude, the object ID of latitude,
    humidity and temperature is 3300, 3303 and 3304 separately. The instruction format
    is described detailly in the manual [53]. After the NB-IoT module is connected
    to the OneNET platform, the platform will record the life cycle of the sink device
    (the life cycle is configured 3600 s in the initialization). When the life cycle
    expires, the OneNET platform will issue a life cycle update request, and the sink
    node can update the life cycle. Or the sink node can actively update the life
    cycle before the life cycle expires. In this paper, the life cycle is automatically
    updated, and the life cycle update flag is activated by setting a certain time
    through the timer. During the life time, the NB-IoT and cloud platform can communicate.
    The NB-IoT subprogram is shown in Figure 5. At first, the timer will judge whether
    it exceeds 3600. If yes, the NB-IoT module will be initialized. If no, it continues
    to judge whether the receive flag bit is 1. If it is 1, it means that the reception
    is completed, and the data needs to be sent and the receive flag should be cleared
    and over. Otherwise, the life cycle flag will be judged, if it is 1, it means
    the time is over and the new request of update the life cycle should be sent.
    The two flags are active in timer interrupt and UART interrupt respectively. Figure
    5. The Flowchart of NB-IoT subprogram. One sink node should receive data from
    several sensor nodes. How to receive data from multiple sensor nodes efficiently
    and successfully? Here, a polling mechanism is proposed. As Figure 6 shown, the
    sink node sends ‘read request’ to sensor node1, sensor node2, and sensor node3
    in turn. If sensor node1 send ‘answer request’ in time, then the data of sensor
    node1 will be allowed to send, the sink node will receive the data from sensor
    node1. Then next sensor node. The RFID module cc1101 in sink node accesses a sensor
    node every second in turn. The response timeout mechanism of the sub node is set
    up to avoid the data transmission errors due to the fact that the sub node is
    not in the transmission range and does not respond when the sink node sends a
    request. Figure 6. The flowchart of RFID subprogram of sink node. RFID initialization
    mainly refers to the function configuration of cc1101 chip in RFID module. Specifically,
    through SPI communication mode, we can read and write the internal register of
    cc1101, so as to complete the setting of fundamental frequency, modulation and
    demodulation mode, baud rate, packet length and other related parameters. For
    one of the two general digital output pins with settable functions contained in
    cc1101, the level jump from low to high occurs when receiving data. The data can
    be received and read by configuring the rising edge of the I/O port of MCU to
    trigger interrupt. The flowchart of RFID subprogram is shown Figure 6. BeiDou
    System is a positioning and navigation system independently developed by China.
    The positioning accuracy of BDS can reach 2.5 m in the Asia Pacific region and
    10 m in the world. The test accuracy is 0.2 m/s; Timing accuracy is 10 ns. It
    also has its unique short message communication function. GPS is Global Positioning
    System. It is well known in the world and developed by the United States. We use
    BDS/GPS dual system for positioning to obtain higher positioning accuracy. The
    positioning principle is as follows:    𝜌 (𝑚) 𝐵 = 𝑟 (𝑚) 𝐵 + 𝐸 (𝑚) 𝐵 +𝑖∗ 𝛿 𝑡 𝐵
    +𝑗∗ 𝛿 𝑡 𝐺 − 𝜏 𝑚 𝐵 + 𝐼 𝑚 𝐵 + 𝑇 𝑚 𝐵 + 𝜀 𝑚 𝐵 𝜌 (𝑛) 𝐺 = 𝑟 (𝑛) 𝐺 + 𝐸 (𝑛) 𝐺 +𝑗∗ 𝛿 𝑡
    𝐺 +𝑖∗ 𝛿 𝑡 𝐵 − 𝜏 𝑛 𝐺 + 𝐼 𝑛 𝐺 + 𝑇 𝑛 𝐺 + 𝜀 𝑛 𝐺 (1) where, 𝜌, 𝑟, 𝐸,  𝛿 𝑡 , 𝜏, 𝐼, 𝑇
    respectively represent the pseudo range measurement value of the receiver to a
    star, the real distance, ephemeris error, receiver clock error, satellite clock
    error, ionospheric delay, tropospheric delay and pseudo range measurement noise.
    Superscript m, n denotes different satellites. Subscripts B and G indicate different
    satellite systems. B represents Beidou and G represents GPS. i = 1, j = 0. If
    (x, y, z) is used to represent the position coordinates of the unknown receiver,
    and (x(n), y(n), z(n)) is used to represent the position of satellite n, then
    𝑟 (𝑛) is equal to the following expression. 𝑟 (𝑛) = (𝑥− 𝑥 (𝑛) ) 2 + (𝑦− 𝑦 (𝑛)
    ) 2 + (𝑧− 𝑧 (𝑛) ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − −

    be calculated by original observation, navigation message and corresponding model.
    If the pseudo range measurement noise is ignored, five unknown parameters need
    to be solved, namely, the position of the receiver, the BDS clock difference of
    the receiver and the GPS clock difference ((x, y, z)> 𝛿 𝑡 𝐵 , 𝛿 𝑡 𝐺 ). Define
    error correction pseudo range measurements 𝜌 (𝑛) 𝑐 is as Expression (3) shown.
    𝜌 (𝑚) 𝑐 = 𝜌 (𝑛) + 𝜏 (𝑛) − 𝐼 (𝑛) − 𝑇 (𝑛) (3) Then, the pseudo range observation
    equation of BDS/GPS dual system can be expressed as Expression (4):    𝜌 (𝑚) 𝑐,𝐵

    (5), continue to use Newton iterative algorithm to solve the location result.
    In order to reduce the utilization rate of CPU, the positioning data of BDS/GPS
    is transmitted to memory of MCU by UART port through DMA mode every second. The
    UART idle interrupt is triggered after all the positioning data are sent successfully,
    and the MCU responds to the interrupt to read the data in DMA for subsequent processing.
    The process of interrupt response program is similar to NB-IoT. It is not described
    in detail. The subprogram flowchart of BDS/GPS is given in Figure 7. After the
    BDS/GPS module parameters are set successfully, we can use the serial port assistant
    to read the module positioning information. Figure 7. The flowchart of BDS/GPS
    subprogram. Data compression subprogram is used to compress data redundancy, reduce
    power consumption of sink node and improve data transmission efficiency. According
    to the characteristics of small amount of data transmission and good local time
    correlation of the system studied in this paper, the wireless remote data compression
    system designed includes sequence correlation packet processing and Adaptive Optimal
    Zero Suppression (AOZS) compression. Correlation grouping processing refers to
    the grouping rearrangement of the original sequence according to the transmission
    data format to obtain n groups of incremental subsequences with good time correlation.
    Then AOZS compression is performed on each subsequence to eliminate the time redundancy
    in the sequence. Adaptive optimal zero suppression (AOZS) compression algorithm
    is improved from differential code compression algorithm, which is suitable for
    the compression of incrementally sorted data sequences. AOZS algorithm reduces
    the number of coded data and removes the time redundancy in the original sequence
    by eliminating zeros and encoding the zero eliminational factor, and selects the
    best coding bits by calculating the compressed data length to shorten the length
    of the final coding. Assume that the data sequence collected by the sink node
    in an upload cycle can be expressed as D. 𝐷= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑑 1 𝑑 2 ⋮ 𝑑 𝑚 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    ⎥ ⎥ = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑣 11 ⋮ 𝑣 𝑚1 ⋯ ⋱ ⋯ 𝑣 1𝑛 ⋮ 𝑣 𝑚𝑛 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ (8) where, m is the acquisition
    times of sensor terminal in an upload cycle; di is the data sequence value collected
    for the i-th time; n is the number of measurement parameters; vjk is the value
    of the k-th measurement parameter in the j-th data acquisition. There are N data
    that appear only once, and the minimum data is recorded as α , the maximum difference
    between adjacent data is recorded as 𝛽 . When in data compression, the relevant
    bit factor { 𝑟 1 , 𝑟 2 ,…, 𝑟 𝑚 } of the original data sequence should be recorded
    at first: 𝑟={ 1, 𝑑 𝑖 = 𝑑 𝑖−1 ,𝑖=2,3,…,𝑚   0, 𝑑 𝑖 > 𝑑 𝑖−1 ,𝑖=2,3,…,𝑚 (9) The relevant
    bit factor records the repetition of sequence adjacent data. By default, the relevant
    bit factor 𝑟 1 of 𝑑 1 = 0. The coding bit factor Cx is determined by the minimum
    binary coding bit factor 𝐶 𝛼 and the maximum difference binary coding bit factor
    𝐶 𝛽 of the sequence as Expression (10). 𝐶 𝑥 ={ 𝐶 𝛽 , 𝐶 𝛼 ≤ 𝐶 𝛽 𝐶 𝛾 , 𝐶 𝛼 > 𝐶 𝛽
    (10) Here, 𝐶 𝛾 ∈[ 𝐶 𝛽 , 𝐶 𝛼 ] . Then, the maximum value that can be represented
    by a set of Cx bit codes 𝑑 𝑥 = 2 𝐶 𝑥 −1 . 3-bit binary is used to record the encoded
    bit information in AOZS algorithm. 000, 001,…, 111 means using 2, 3,…, 9 bits
    binary to coding di respectively. The relationship of Cx and di is shown in Table
    1. The relationship of coding length 𝐿 𝑥 and coding bit factor Cx is shown as
    Expression (11). Table 1. The relationship of bit numbers, code, Cx and di. 𝐿
    𝑥 =([ 𝛼 𝑑 𝑥 ]+𝑁−1) 𝐶 𝑥 +𝑀+3 (11) where, [ ] means to take up as an integer. M
    is the numbers of { 𝑑 1 , 𝑑 2 ,…, 𝑑 𝑚 } , notes the minimum of 𝐿 𝑥 as 𝐿 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ,
    and its corresponding code bit factor Cx is the best code numbers, noted as Coptimal.
    Zero elimination operation refers to subtracting an integer value (recorded as
    zero elimination factor) from all data of the sequence, and finally making all
    data of the original sequence become 0. The zeroing factor 𝑠 𝑖 of the i-th order
    is recorded as Expression (12). 𝑠 𝑖 =𝑚𝑖𝑛{ 𝑑 𝑚𝑖𝑛 , 𝑑 𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 } (12) where, 𝑑 𝑚𝑖𝑛
    is the minimum value of sequence. After the above parameters are determined, the
    algorithm records the sequence coding information and related information, and
    uses Coptimal bit number binary to encode the all zero elimination factors. The
    flow chart is shown in Figure 8. Table 2 shows the implementation process of the
    AOZS algorithm. Figure 8. The flowchart of data compress algorithm. Table 2. An
    example of AOZS algorithm. So, the compression code is 100,001001,1111,0100,0110,0010.
    Compression Ratio (CR) is used to describe the efficiency of compression. 𝐶𝑅=
    𝑆 𝐶𝑃 𝑆 𝑂𝑅 (13) Here, 𝑆 𝐶𝑃 is the amount of compressed data, 𝑆 𝑂𝑅 is the amount
    of original data. Obviously, the smaller the CR, the smaller the proportion of
    the compressed data to the original data, and the better the compression performance.
    2.2.2. Software Design of Sensor Nodes and Monitoring Center Software of each
    sensor node is simpler than that of sink node. It includes two parts. One is to
    read the humidity data and temperature data of the DHT11. The other is to drive
    the Bluetooth module to send these data to the sink node. The flowchart is given
    in Figure 9. It needs to complete the initialization of MCU peripherals and related
    modules. Clock initialization is used to set the working frequency of the system.
    Timer initialization is used to read temperature and humidity sensor data. Because
    the single line communication mode of DHT11 does not have a standard communication
    format, it is necessary to use a timer to simulate the communication sequence
    to realize the reception and transmission of data. Finally, the cc1101 module
    should be initialized. Figure 9. The flowchart of sensor nodes. The monitoring
    center is developed with C++ language, which mainly realizes the following functions:
    (i) according to the longitude and latitude coordinates obtained from the cloud
    platform, it can display the location of the mobile carriage (sink node) in real
    time; (ii) it can display the real-time temperature and humidity in the carriage;
    (iii) it can dynamically draw the temperature and humidity change line chart;
    (iv) Using database to manage the collected data, it can save the historical data
    for data analysis. Figure 10 is the operation flowchart of monitoring center.
    Figure 10. The operation flowchart of monitoring center. 3. Results 3.1. Measurement
    Accuracy First, we do the measurement accuracy experiment. The experience was
    carried on the author’s campus from 22 September to 21 October 2021. The campus
    is located at 120°55′ E and 28°51′ N. The weather was sunny during the test. The
    campus is spacious. The parameters of cc1101 are a carrier frequency of 433 MHz,
    a baud rate of 100 kbps, and a modulation mode of 2 FSK. The transmission power
    of the NB-IoT circuit is 13 dBm, the antenna gain is 3 dB, and the transmission
    rate is 3.9 Kbps. Each test point continuously sends and receives 1000 data packets.
    The packet loss rate of the whole network is less than 1% within 8 km, and the
    packet loss rate is 0% within 400 m. We read the humidity data and temperature
    data 10 times of 6 sensor nodes every day for a week and compare the data of thermometers
    and hygrometers which are put near the sensor node simultaneously. Then, the error
    was calculated and drawn in Figure 11a,b. The temperature error is less than 1
    °C, as shown by the red line on Figure 11a. The average of temperature error is
    about 0.5 °C, as shown by the black line on the Figure 11a. The humidity error
    is less than 5% RH, as shown by the red line on Figure 11b. The average of humidity
    error is about 2% RH, as shown by the black line on the Figure 11b. The error
    of temperature and humidity are mainly decided by the DHT11 chip precision. Figure
    11. The measurement error. (a) temperature error (b) humidity error. Then, one
    sink node and its three sensor nodes were placed in a mobile car. We put a Leica
    GNSS (teaching edition) in the car, which is a professional position for the measuring
    instrument. The car was moved in different speed, and we read the latitude and
    longitude information of the monitoring center and Leica Receiver simultaneously.
    Let the longitude and latitude test by Leica GNSS are LonA, LatA. Let the longitude
    and latitude test by our system are LonB, LatB. Then the position error can be
    calculated by the Expression (14). Δ𝐿𝑜𝑛=(𝐿𝑜𝑛𝐴−𝐿𝑜𝑛𝐵)×1000×(111.413×𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝐿𝑎𝑡𝐵× 𝜋
    180 )−0.094×𝑐𝑜𝑠(3×𝐿𝑎𝑡𝐵× 𝜋 180 )) Δ𝐿𝑎𝑡=(𝐿𝑎𝑡𝐴−𝐿𝑎𝑡𝐵)×1000×(111.133−0.59×𝑐𝑜𝑠(2×𝐿𝑎𝑡𝐵×
    𝜋 180 )) 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒= Δ𝐿𝑜 𝑛 2 +Δ𝐿𝑎 𝑡 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (14) The relationship
    between positioning error and vehicle speed is shown in Figure 12. Figure 12.
    The relationship between positioning error and vehicle speed. The positioning
    error is decided by several factors, such as the number of satellites used for
    positioning, vehicle speed, NB-IoT life cycle, etc. The average number of observable
    satellites under the GPS/BDS dual mode is 9, and the positioning performance is
    better than that of GPS single system and BDS single system. The main reason is
    that the number of available satellites increases, and the geometry configuration
    is enhanced. Under BDS/GPS dual positioning system, more positioning satellites
    can be obtained, so the accuracy is higher than that of GPS or BeiDou single positioning
    system. When the vehicle is static, the positioning error is about 2 m. When the
    car moves, the positioning error increases. The faster the car speed, the greater
    the positioning error. When the life period of NB-IoT is set as 3600 s, and the
    speed is less than 40 km/h, the positioning error is less than 10 m. When the
    speed is about 60 km/h, the positioning error is about 20 m. The larger the life
    cycle of NB-IoT, the greater the positioning error, because the larger the life
    cycle of NB-IoT, the greater the transmission latency. 3.2. Network Performance
    Test Network performance test includes data compression rate and transmission
    packet loss rate. Limited by the experimental conditions, it is impossible to
    obtain a large number of test data of sensor nodes. Therefore, the experimental
    data on data compression rate is taken from the temperature data of Intel-Berkeley
    University Joint Research Laboratory in reference [40]. Compare the compression
    ratio between the AOZS algorithm proposed in this paper and the commonly used
    DCCM (Differential Code Compression Method) algorithm, as shown in Figure 13.
    Under the condition of the same amount of node data collection, the compression
    ratio of AOZS algorithm is lower than DCCM algorithm, and the compression performance
    is better, because AOZS algorithm makes full use of the correlation between data,
    and the coding based on the optimal bit factor removes the redundant information
    to the greatest extent. The more data the node collects, the higher the time correlation
    of the data. The coding factor of AOZS algorithm can describe more original data
    and fully mine the time correlation of data. Therefore, the compression ratio
    becomes smaller and smaller and tends to be stable gradually. With the increase
    of the number of sensor data, the compression rate of DCCM algorithm is maintained
    at about 50%, and that of AOZS algorithm is maintained at about 10%. Figure 13.
    The Comparison of data compression ratio. Another indicator of network communication
    reliability is packet loss rate. Sx1268 is a new generation 433 MHz LoRa half
    duplex transceiver chip produced by Semtech in 2018. It is also one of the commonly
    used Lora chips at present. So we compare the communication reliability between
    Sx1268 LoRa module and our wh-nb75-ba NB-IoT module. Figure 14 is the comparison
    of packet loss rate of our NB-IoT module and LoRa Sx1268 module under the same
    transmitting and receiving condition. When the distance is less than 250 m, the
    packet loss rate of both circuits is nearly 0. With the increase of distance,
    the packet loss rate of LoRa module increases significantly, while that of NB-IoT
    module increases little. When the distance is 400 m, the packet loss rate of LoRa
    module is about 1.5%, that of NB-IoT module is still nearly 0. when the distance
    is 600 m, the packet loss rate of LoRa module is about 2%, that of NB-IoT module
    is about 0.5%. when the distance is 800 m, the packet loss rate of LoRa module
    is about 5%, that of NB-IoT module is about 0.7%. when the distance is 800 m,
    the packet loss rate of LoRa module is about 5%, that of NB-IoT module is about
    0.7%. When the distance is 1000 m, the packet loss rate of LoRa module is about
    10%, that of NB-IoT module is about 1%. When the distance is 1200 m, the packet
    loss rate of LoRa module is about 15%, that of NB-IoT module is about 1.2%. Figure
    14. The packet loss rate of our NB-IoT module and LoRa sx1268. 4. Discussion Through
    these tests aboved, the monitoring system realizes the higher position precision.
    It is shown that the BDS/GPS dual mode position have higher position precision
    than that of single BDS or GPS. When the monitored target is stationary, the positioning
    accuracy is only determined by the positioning module. The position calculation
    formula under the dual-mode positioning module is deduced as above. When the monitored
    target moves, the positioning accuracy is jointly determined by the positioning
    module, vehicle speed and life cycle. However, under the same vehicle speed and
    the same life cycle of NB-IoT, the monitoring system accuracy of dual-mode positioning
    is still higher than that of single BDS or GPS positioning mode. Considering the
    characteristics of sensor data in monitoring system, an adaptive optimal zero
    suppression (AOZS) algorithm based on time correlation is proposed in this paper.
    After testing and comparing with the commonly used differential code compression
    method (DCCM) algorithm, the data compression rate of the new algorithm can be
    as high as 90%, which greatly reduces the amount of data transmission in the communication
    network and improves the network performance and transmission efficiency. With
    the increase of the number of sensor data, the compression rate of DCCM algorithm
    is maintained at about 50%, and that of AOZS algorithm is maintained at about
    10%. Packet loss rate is the main indicator of communication network performance.
    We tested and compared the packet loss rate of the monitoring system based on
    wh-nb75-ba NB-IoT module and the monitoring system based on sx1268 LoRa module
    which is mainly used. When the distance is less than 250 m, the packet loss rate
    of both circuits is nearly 0. With the increase of distance, the packet loss rate
    of LoRa module increases significantly, while that of NB-IoT module increases
    little. The greater the distance, the greater the difference between the packet
    loss rate data of the two circuits. 5. Conclusions A new monitoring system is
    proposed in the paper, based on NB-IoT and BDS/GPS dual-mode positioning. The
    whole monitoring system includes three parts: sensor node, sink node and monitoring
    center. The sensor node which is based on cc1101 RFID circuit realizes the detection
    of surrounding temperature and humidity and data transmission. The sink node receives
    and compresses the temperature and humidity data from the sensor node, obtains
    the positioning information through at6558 BDS/GPS positioning module, and uploads
    these data to the cloud through wh-nb75-ba NB-IoT module. The monitoring center
    can download data from the cloud and save it to the local machine, and can analyze
    the historical data through an operation interface. Experiments and analysis show
    that the proposed scheme has better positioning accuracy, better data compression
    ratio and transmission performance. The temperature and humidity error are less
    than 1 °C and 5% RH especially with the selected chip. The position error is decided
    by several factors, including the number of satellites used for positioning, the
    monitored target moving speed and NB-IoT module lifetime period. When the monitored
    target is stationary, the positioning error is about 2 m, which is less than that
    of the single GPS or BDS mode. The AOZS compression algorithm is used to improve
    compression ratio (CR). The CR is about 10% when the data amount increasing. The
    scheme of this paper had encouraged experiments and was efficient and practicable
    in monitoring system. However, many aspects, still need to be further studied,
    such as transmission delay, multi-sensor nodes and low-power circuits. Furthermore,
    optimizing the network structure to reduce its consumption and accomplishing end-to-end
    network will be the main direction of our work. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    (IoUT) 1. Introduction The internet of underground things (IoUT) aims to provide
    remote underground sensing and monitoring, and it has been widely applied in the
    field of geotechnical site investigation, precision agriculture (Vuran et al.,
    2018a, b; Salam and Shah, 2019a), mine/reservoir monitoring (Sun and Akyildiz,
    2010a, b), underground infrastructure monitoring (Salam and Shah, 2019b; Raza
    and Salam, 2020), landslide monitoring (Ramesh, 2014), and localization (Lin et
    al., 2017). The IoUT mainly consists of two components entirely or partially buried
    in soils: sensor nodes and communication modules. The sensor nodes collect relevant
    information about the underground environment, including soil composition, moisture
    content, temperature, and pore water pressure, etc. By interconnecting sensors
    with communication modules, real-time or near real-time data acquired from the
    field can be sent through the soil and eventually received by the end users. The
    performance of the underground communication modules is crucial to the success
    of the IoUT system. Like the conventional above-ground Internet of Things (IoT),
    communication among sensing nodes of an IoUT can be achieved with or without transmission
    wires. However, the complexity and cost of installation and maintenance of transmission
    wires would grow drastically with the number of the sensing nodes and the embedment
    depth. Therefore, the wireless option is more attractive for an IoUT, and the
    focus of this paper is on wireless underground communication (WUC). Conventional
    wireless IoT system relies on through-air communication, mainly using electromagnetic
    (EM) waves. WUC can also be transmitted through the air in some scenarios, such
    as in mines and tunnels. But for most IoUT applications, through-soil communication
    is unavoidable (Saeed et al., 2019). The heterogeneous nature of the soil, in
    which the soil composition varies with space and time, poses challenges to the
    success of underground wireless communication based on EM waves. As a result,
    the transmission range and effectiveness of EM waves in soil are limited (Akyildiz
    and Stuntebeck, 2006). In addition, large antennas are typically required to transmit
    and receive EM waves (Sun and Akyildiz, 2010b), which makes the installation process
    challenging. Alternatively, a recently proposed underground communication system
    based on magnetic induction (MI) overcomes some drawbacks of EM-based techniques
    (Sun and Akyildiz, 2010a, b; Lin et al., 2017). There are no significant differences
    in magnetic permeabilities between solid particles, water, and air; thus, the
    underground conditions cause little variations in the attenuation rate of the
    magnetic fields, and the MI channel is more robust to the underground environment
    than the channel for EM-based techniques. Moreover, the MI technique could also
    address the need for a large antenna by using a small coil of wire. However, the
    receiving power loss of the MI-based communication technique is a sixth-order
    function of the transmission range, indicating high path loss and a limited range
    of transmission (Sun and Akyildiz, 2010a). Using relay points can significantly
    reduce the path loss. But this limits the practicality and poses challenges for
    installation of the multiple nodes in field, especially it requires short distance
    between relay points (typically 1 m). In this study, an alternative WUC technique
    based on a mechanical wave approach inspired by subterranean animals is explored.
    Most subterranean animals and some surface-dwelling animals rely on vibrations
    for intraspecific communication, localization of prey, and detection of predators
    (Hill, 2001). It is conservatively estimated that over 230,000 arthropods species
    and a great number of vertebrates use substrate-borne vibrations for communication
    (Cocroft et al., 2014). One prominent example is the long-distance communication
    (as far as 16 km) used by Asian elephants, who are able to generate seismic waves
    when moving and can detect vibrational signals through somatosensory receptors
    (O''Connell-Rodwell, 2007). Although small animals cannot generate seismic waves
    that are as strong as those of elephants, they can still achieve long-distance
    underground communication using seismic cues. For example, spalacid mole-rats
    generate rhythmic, substrate-borne vibrational signals by thumping their heads
    against the ceilings of their tunnels. By doing this, these blind mole-rats are
    able to transmit information across many meters between territories (Heth et al.,
    1987; Nevo et al., 1991). Utilizing seismic waves is not new in geotechnical engineering
    and geophysics. Vibration-based testing methods, such as seismic reflection, seismic
    refraction, and surface wave measurements, are widely used to characterize subsurface
    conditions and to determine design parameters (Stokoe and Santamarina, 2000).
    Nevertheless, the potential of using seismic waves to carry information in communication
    systems has not been widely explored. The earliest documented study described
    a large thumping type transducer, which was mounted on a hilltop to induce seismic
    cues and was used to communicate with devices placed in an underground mine (Ikrath
    and Schneider, 1968). However, only unidirectional communication was allowed,
    and the data rates were low. More recently, a small-sized underground communication
    system that uses acoustic waves was proposed (Yang et al., 2020). In general,
    the concept of using mechanical waves for WUC has been validated; however, there
    is still room to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of such as system. The
    objective of this study is to develop a small-size, energy-efficient, and cost-effective
    vibration-based WUC system that can be used for IoUT applications. The following
    sections describe the components of the developed system, including a bio-inspired
    source, communication channel characteristics, receivers, and the encoding/decoding
    algorithms, as well as how the system performance is evaluated through laboratory
    tests. 2. System design and description Communication is the process of transferring
    information from a transmitter to a receiver. In a typical communication system,
    the input message which consists of texts, numbers, and/or images is first encoded
    and then converted into a source signal. Then it travels through the communication
    channel and is picked up by the receiver; the received signals are then decoded,
    and the message is restored. The schematic diagram in Fig. 1 highlights the major
    components of the proposed WUC system, including soil as the communication channel,
    a bio-inspired vibrational transmitter, and accelerometers as receivers. In the
    proposed communication system, messages, including text files and images, are
    first converted into binary streams. The binary streams are then translated into
    a series of vibrations generated by the developed transmitter. The vibrations
    travel through soil in the form of seismic waves and are picked up by accelerometers.
    The received signals are translated into binary streams and converted back to
    text files or images. Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Schematic of the developed bio-inspired underground communication
    system. 2.1. Communication channel characteristics Soil is a multiphase system
    that consists of solid particles, water, and air. It allows the propagation of
    both compression and shear seismic waves. The propagation of a seismic wave is
    primarily determined by transmission loss, noise, reflection, refraction, and
    tempo-spatial variability of the soil channel. Transmission loss and noise are
    the principal factors that determine the transmission range and the signal-to-noise
    ratio (SNR). The spatio-temporal variability, as well as the multipath propagation
    can influence the seismic signal design and processing, design of the architecture
    of the communication system, and performance of the system. Transmission loss
    is caused by geometric attenuation, material loss or intrinsic attenuation, and
    apparent attenuation (Santamarina et al., 2001). As the wavefront propagates,
    its size increases, causing a decrease in the wave amplitude with distance. Scattering,
    frictional losses due to particle contacts, as well as viscous losses due to the
    relative movement between the solid particles and fluid are responsible for material
    attenuation. Partial transmission and mode convention caused by the presence of
    the interface can also cause wave amplitude to decrease. Total attenuation of
    seismic waves depends on the degree of saturation, bulk density, stiffness of
    the granular skeleton, and bulk modulus of the fluid. In general, soil is inhomogeneous
    with irregular boundaries, and its characteristics vary with time and space. Reflection
    and refraction from soil layers can cause multipath propagation, which may result
    in inter-bit interference in a single-carrier digital communication system. As
    the degree of saturation is affected by rainfall, sunlight, and temperature, it
    may vary with time. Consequently, the time variability of soil properties can
    affect seismic wave attenuation. In addition, soil properties and soil profiles
    show spatial variation. The geometry of multipath propagation and its spatio-temporal
    dependence are especially important for a moving communication system. The effective
    transmission distance of seismic waves is limited not only by the attenuation
    phenomena but also by the noise level, as the noise level affects SNR and limits
    the transmission range and effectiveness of the signal. Noise observed in the
    underground environment consists of artificial noise and ambient noise. Artificial
    noise occurs near the ground surface and results from transportation and industry
    activities, and it significantly increases the noise level in this region. Most
    ambient noises are generated by environmental activities of natural processes.
    The characteristics of the communication channel require that the encoded signals
    generated by the source are insensitive to ambient noises and that the receivers
    are sensitive enough to accommodate various types of signal attenuation. 2.2.
    Bio-inspired source design To generate reliable seismic waves, animals use a variety
    of methods, including drumming (striking), tremulation (vibrating the entire body),
    stridulation (rubbing), and tymbal buckling (Hill, 2001; Hill et al., 2019). Drumming
    describes the behavior where body parts are used to strike the substrate in a
    percussive fashion. Although drumming produces broadband signals, the soil will
    filter the signals, causing spectral differences at the receiver''s end. Consequently,
    in drumming-induced vibrational signals, the temporal patterns are more important
    than the spectral details. Subterranean mammals that utilize drumming include
    spalacid mole-rats, Cape mole-rats, and African mole-rats (Nevo et al., 1991;
    Narins et al., 1992; Ema, 2012). The typical body length of a mature specimen
    of these blind mole-rats is from 10.5 cm to 16.5 cm, and their vibration communications
    have a range of several meters. Considering their small body size and the transmission
    range, these blind mole-rats employ an energy-efficient and effective method for
    underground communication. Tremulation describes the behavior where an animal
    vibrates its entire body against a substrate. Many species of termites (e.g. Coptotermesformosanus,
    Retkulitermes speratus, Zootermopsis nevadensis) shake themselves back and forth
    or right and left against the nest walls for communication purposes, and the frequency
    of the tremulation is around 25 Hz (Ohmura et al., 2009). Stridulation and tymbal
    buckling are mainly used by insects and involve vibration against plant parts.
    Since this study concerns vibrations through soils, the inspirations for the wave
    sources in the proposed system were mainly drawn from tremulation and drumming.
    Inspired by drumming and tremulation, two small-size, low-cost, energy-efficient,
    and controllable vibrational sources were designed and fabricated (Fig. 2). The
    drumming-inspired source consists of two push-pull solenoids (Adafruit 413) encased
    in a three-dimensional (3D) printed box. The solenoids are characterized by a
    6 N striking force at 12 V of direct current (VDC) and a push or pull-type throw
    of 10 mm (Fig. 2a). When activated, the plunger of the solenoids moves out of
    the solenoid''s body and strikes the 3D-printed box. When powered off, the plunger
    moves back to its original position due to the return force provided by the spring.
    The tremulation-inspired source consists of a micro vibration motor (8 mm in diameter
    and 15 mm in length), which is encased in an acrylic tube (Fig. 2b). The eccentric
    weight on the rotating shaft of the vibration motor generates centrifuge force
    when it rotates. When the vibration motor is activated, the induced unbalanced
    force results in whole body vibration. Download : Download high-res image (814KB)

    Drumming-inspired vibrational source based on push-pull solenoids; and (b) Tremulation-inspired
    vibrational source based on a vibration motor. To control the drumming or tremulation–induced
    vibrations, a microcontroller (Arduino Uno 3) and a motor driver (Adafruit v2.3)
    were used to convert the encoded binary streams and to regulate the voltage input
    to the solenoids or vibration motors. The accelerometers at the receiving ends
    were also connected to the microcontroller for data collection. 2.3. Receivers
    Coil-based geophones and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers
    are two major sensors used for acquiring seismic data. Geophones, a proven technology,
    usually do not require a power supply and can provide reliable velocity measurements.
    While geophones were mainly used in an earlier preliminary study (Zhong et al.,
    2021), MEMS accelerometers have many attractive attributes when compared with
    geophones. MEMS sensors are small and light in weight. Nowadays, a high-performance
    triaxial MEMS accelerometer can be much less than 1 cm × 1 cm and weigh less than
    1 g. The small size and highly integrated nature of MEMS sensors enable them to
    be implemented with other IoUT devices such as underground self-burrowing robots
    (Tao et al., 2020). MEMS accelerometers work below their resonant frequency, while
    geophones work above their resonant frequency. The resonant frequency of MEMS
    accelerometers is far above the seismic band, which makes it possible to record
    low-frequency signals (below 10 Hz) using MEMS accelerometers without attenuation.
    MEMS accelerometers can measure accelerations in three directions, while standalone
    geophones can only measure velocity in the direction along the axis of the coil.
    In addition, the gravity vector measured by the MEMS accelerometers also provides
    a reference for sensitivity calibration and tilting measurement. MEMS accelerometers
    were chosen as receivers in the proposed system due to their small size, better
    performance for recording low-frequency seismic signals, and their ability to
    obtain multi-directional and tilting measurements. In this study, the MEMS accelerometer
    MMA8452Q (NXP Semiconductors N.V., Netherlands) was selected based on its small
    size and low-power requirements. This triaxial capacitive MEMS accelerometer has
    a dynamically selectable full-scale (±2 g/±4 g/±8 g), a 12-bit digital output,
    and a sampling rate up to 800 Hz. 2.4. Coding and modulation The vibrations generated
    by the sources have to be controlled to contain information to be transmitted.
    The process of translating information (such as a string of numbers and letters)
    into a series of vibrations is called encoding and modulation, which describes
    the process whereby the frequency, amplitude, and/or phase of the vibrations are
    changed. Mole-rats are able to encode their biological information into seismic
    waves by changing the impulse amplitude and the time interval between impulses
    (Rado et al., 1987), as can be noticed in the bursts shown in Fig. 3. These mole-rats
    seem to use the most straightforward modulation scheme, which is called amplitude
    shift keying. On-off keying (OOK), which is the simplest form of amplitude shift
    keying, is used in this study to modulate the signal from the bio-inspired vibrational
    sources. In this binary modulation scheme, the presence of a signal for a specific
    duration represents “1”, while the absence of the same duration “0”. Download

    (the plots are directly reproduced from Rado et al., 1987): (a) Consecutive bursts
    performed by an individual mole rate; and (b) Individual head drums on an expanded
    time scale. Before being modulated using OOK, different types of messages (text,
    numbers, and images) need to be converted to binary streams. In information processing
    and communication, coding is a system of rules that are used when converting information
    to another form. In the encoding process, messages are converted into binary streams,
    while the reverse process (decoding) is used once the message is received. One
    of the most straightforward and well-known codes is Morse code. Our preliminary
    study showed that messages could be encoded using Morse code and then carried
    by modulated seismic waves for underground communication (Zhong et al., 2021).
    However, Morse code is a variable-length code and can only represent numbers and
    letters, but no special characters. To encode plain text in the proposed system,
    we selected Baudot–Murray code, a 5-bit coding method. The 5-bit series used to
    encode a character is also called a byte. The Baudot-Murphy code, or the International
    Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) code was introduced by Consultative Committee
    for International Telegraphy and Telephony or CCITT (now known as ITU-T, or Telecommunication
    Standardization Section of the International Telecommunications) in 1924 and the
    mapping between a character and a binary representation is usually presented as
    a table (Bruchanov, 2005). Baudot–Murray code can represent two sets of characters
    (one for letters and another for numbers and punctuation) using a series of 5-bit
    with the help of shift codes. For example, the string “CBBG” can be encoded as
    “11111 01110 11001 11001 11010”, and the string “CBBG 2021” can be encoded as
    “11111 01110 11001 11001 11010 00100 11011 10011 10110 10011 10111”. The bytes
    “11111” and “11011” are shift codes, “11111” represents the letter set of characters
    while “11011” indicates the number and punctuation set of characters. In addition,
    Hamming (7, 4) code is implemented in the proposed system to increase its robustness.
    Hamming code is an error correction code that can be used to autocorrect error
    bits. By adding three parity bits to 4-bits of data, this algorithm allows the
    correction of 1-bit errors without the detection of uncorrected errors. The Hamming
    code process can be understood as a mathematical translating process based on
    three matrices: the code generating matrix , parity-check matrix , and decoding
    matrix . (1a) (1b) (1c) For example, a 4-bit vector is shown in a vector column,
    and can be encoded into 7-bits transmitted code by taking the product of and followed
    by an operation of entries modulo 2: (2) When there is an error (for example,
    the received code is ) compared with the transmitted code , the error can be located
    using the parity-check matrix: (3) The vector is the same as the sixth column
    of the parity-check matrix, indicating that the error happens at the sixth bit.
    The error bit can then be corrected. The decoding process is similar to the encoding
    process, but by taking the product of and received bits after the correction :
    (4) Both the Baudot-Murphy ITA2 code and the hamming code were implemented in
    a python script, which was then interfaced with the microcontroller. 2.5. Evaluation
    test setup The performance of the bio-inspired vibration sources, as well as the
    entire WUC system, was evaluated in an acrylic tank having inside dimensions of
    92 cm in length, 60 cm in width, and 42 cm in height. Dry Ottawa F65 sands were
    poured into the tank and tamped to achieve a final global relative density of
    45%. When the sand thickness reached 20 cm, the vibration sources and the receiver
    were placed. More layers of sand were then poured and tamped until the vibration
    sources and the accelerometer were embedded at a depth of 10 cm (Fig. 4). Download

    in both subfigures indicates the drumming-inspired vibration source, while the
    blue block on the right indicates the accelerometer. The limited size of the sand
    box may indeed cause reflections of mechanical waves from the boundaries. It is
    extremely challenging to eliminate all the reflections from the boundaries. In
    this study, efforts were made to reduce the reflections in the transmitter-receiver
    direction, especially at the receiver end. A circular hole with 5 cm diameter
    was cut on the receiver side of the tank, and this hole was then covered using
    a piece of geotextile which was flexible and was able to absorb the mechanical
    energy and to prevent wave reflections. 3. Results 3.1. Source and channel evaluation
    3.1.1. Qualitative evaluation The performance of the two bio-inspired vibrational
    sources was first evaluated qualitatively. An input signal was generated as a
    square wave with a high amplitude of 3 V, a low amplitude of 0 V, and a duty cycle
    of 50%, as shown in Fig. 6a. The accelerometer was set initially 5 cm away from
    the sources. The distance between the accelerometer and the sources was increased
    gradually if the raw accelerometer data still appeared clear in x- (along the
    length of the tank), y- (along the width of the tank) or z- (vertical) direction
    (Fig. 5). For both vibration sources, all components of the accelerations were
    found to decrease with the distance between the source and the sensor. As the
    change in accelerations in z-direction was higher than that in the other two directions
    due to the shallow embedment depth, only the z component of the acceleration was
    analyzed and reported in this paper. Download : Download high-res image (128KB)

    (a) Periodic “on-off” signal input; and (b) Raw and filtered signals as received
    by an accelerometer embedded at the same depth but at a distance of 70 cm from
    the source. The two vibration sources showed distinct differences in terms of
    the acceleration signals. At a distance of 70 cm from the vibration source, the
    acceleration signals produced by the tremulation-inspired source remained measurable.
    However, it became difficult to recognize the signal pattern from the raw signal
    as the SNR level dropped below 1.2 (Fig. 6b). To improve the SNR, a band filter
    of 60–80 Hz was applied to the raw signal based on the result of a wavelet transform
    analysis. However, the filtered signal clearly shows the same pattern as in the
    input (Fig. 6). With the drumming-inspired source, the raw acceleration signals
    were always clear enough so no filter was needed to process the data further (see
    Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res image (388KB) Download : Download full-size

    from the source. The embedment depth of the source and accelerometer is 15 cm:
    (a) Responses under different excitation voltage levels; and (b) Response under
    an excitation voltage of 12 V on an expanded time scale. Another drawback of the
    tremulation-inspired source is that the vibrations of the source are suppressed
    when the source is embedded below 15 cm, due to the relatively high confining
    pressure and low output torque of the micromotor. The drumming-inspired source
    does not suffer from this problem, since the solenoids are encased in a large
    box and the plungers will always impact the inner wall of the box. Therefore,
    in the subsequent quantitative evaluation of the vibration source and the evaluation
    of the proposed system, only the drumming-inspired source was considered. 3.1.2.
    Quantitative evaluation of the vibration sources To quantitatively evaluate the
    attenuation of the generated seismic waves, different input voltages (9 V, 10.5
    V and 12 V) were supplied to activate the source while the source-to-sensor distance
    was changed from 5 cm to 80 cm gradually. The solenoids in the vibration source
    were activated under each input voltage, and activation lasted for 40 ms. Subsequently,
    the plungers struck the 3D-printed case five times, and sufficient time (about
    20 s) was allowed between activations so that subsequent impacts were not affected
    by the previous ones. At the maximum source-to-sensor distance of 80 cm, which
    was limited by sand tank dimensions, the signals remained clear at an input voltage
    of 9 V. Since a higher input voltage results in a higher impacting force for the
    solenoids, stronger seismic waves were produced, as expected (Fig. 7a). In terms
    of each activation, the amplitudes of each individual impulse were found to be
    consistent (Fig. 7b). The pattern of the induced seismic wave resembled patterns
    of those produced by mole-rats for underground communication (Fig. 3). The amplitude–distance
    relationship for the source with different input voltages under the mentioned
    experimental setup is plotted in Fig. 8. The dissipation of the waves is mainly
    attributed to geometric attention, material loss, and scattering. Download : Download

    response with distance from the drumming-inspired vibrational source and input
    voltage. Geometric attenuation corresponds to the decrease in amplitude with distance
    due to an increase in the size of the wavefront. Auersch and Said (2010) proposed
    that a power law can be used to describe the attenuation of a seismic wave with
    distance: (5) where is the acceleration amplitude, is the distance from the source,
    and is the attenuation exponent. For example, the attenuation exponent for geometric
    attenuation of cylindrical elastic waves is 0.5. The effect of material loss can
    be described using an exponential law: (6) where is the attenuation coefficient
    due to material damping. Similar to the effect of material damping, scattering
    attenuation also follows an exponential law. Attenuations due to both material
    damping and scattering are frequency-dependent, i.e. the attenuation becomes stronger
    as the frequency increases. Considering all frequency component of a broadband
    vibration, the mean attenuation caused by material damping and scattering tends
    to follow a power-law (Auersch, 2010; Auersch and Said, 2010). Therefore, combing
    the effect of frequency-independent geometric attenuation, material attenuation
    and scattering, the overall attenuation tends to follow a power law for a broadband
    vibration. The vibration induced by the drumming-inspired source is a series of
    impulses and is therefore considered to be a broadband signal. The amplitude–distance
    relationship for the vibration source is thus expected to follow a power law (Fig.
    8). The best-fitting attenuation exponent for the drumming-inspired vibrational
    source under the described experimental setup is found to be q = 0.63, which is
    similar to the one reported by Auersch and Said (2010) for vibratory compaction
    ( ) in the field. The difference can be caused by the difference in soil types
    and conditions and this particular fitting curve is only valid to the testing
    condition reported here. 3.2. System evaluation The performance of the underground
    communication system was evaluated through two demonstrations: one using a simple
    text file, and the other using an image file. More details about each demonstration
    and the corresponding results are presented in the following subsections. 3.2.1.
    Demonstration with a simple text file To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
    whole proposed communication system, a text file was first transmitted through
    dry sand. The source and the accelerometer were placed 70 cm apart at a depth
    of 10 cm. The plain text file contained the following information: “The current
    water temperature is 20 °C. The relative density of sand is fifty percent.” The
    plain text was first encoded into binary streams using the Baudot–Murry code and
    the Hamming code. To facilitate determination of the start and end of the file,
    a unique binary pattern was inserted before and after the converted binary stream
    for the text (Fig. 9b). The overall binary stream was sent to the microcontroller
    to regulate the on/off state of the source. Again, binary “1” corresponds to the
    activation of the solenoids and results in the compaction of the plunger on the
    box, while a binary “0” represents the off state and the deactivation of the solenoids.

    Fig. 9. Demonstration of the decoding algorithm: (a) Received raw signal of a
    plain text file sent through sand; the threshold used to identify the “on” state
    is indicated by red lines; and (b) The decoding of the starting segment of the
    signal. The starting pattern and the restored binary codes are highlighted. The
    time required for two solenoids to complete a push–pull cycle was around 60 ±
    10 ms. To minimize the impact of push–pull cycle period uncertainties and to avoid
    the inter-byte interference (between characters) caused by multipath propagation,
    a guard interval or guard time was introduced. The guard time corresponds to the
    time between two consecutive bytes. A greater guard interval time will result
    in cleaner signal but would also increase the overall transmission time, while
    a too-small guard interval time may not eliminate the overlap or interferences
    between two consecutive impacts. In this work, the guard interval of 40 ms is
    estimated based on the mechanical performance of the solenoids. Uncertainties
    exist in the mechanical control of the transmitter. During the calibration process,
    we observed that the average time for the solenoids to complete a push-pull cycle
    was about 60 ms, with a standard deviation of about 10 ms. The guard interval
    time was chosen to be 4 times of the standard deviation to ensure that the potential
    interferences between consecutive impacts are eliminated. The raw acceleration
    data recorded by the accelerometer are shown in Fig. 9a. When decoding the recorded
    signals, the signals between the starting and ending patterns were first identified
    and then intervening signal was automatically divided into subsequences. Each
    subsequence window includes one bit and represents a binary “1” or “0”. In each
    subsequence window, if the signals exceed a preset threshold, a binary “1” will
    be registered; otherwise, a binary “0” is registered (Fig. 9b). The selection
    of the threshold could affect the decoding quality: a threshold that is too high
    may leave some impulses undetected, while a threshold that is too low may mistake
    background noise as impulses. Since the received signals were clear and SNR was
    high when using the drumming-inspired source, the selection of an appropriate
    threshold value was straightforward. In this study, the threshold was set as two
    times the maximum amplitude of the background noise. As shown in Fig. 9b, the
    Hamming code is first decoded: each 7-bit sequence is decoded into a 4-bit sequence.
    As an example, the starting series, “1 1 1 1 1 1 1”, “0 1 1 1 1 0 0”, and “0 1
    0 1 0 1 0” were decoded as “1 1 1 1”, “1 1 0 0”, and “0 0 1 0” respectively. Next,
    the Baudot–Murray code is decoded into characters: each 5-bit sequence is decoded
    into a character. In the above example, “1 1 1 1 1” indicates a letter set, and
    the subsequent bit sequence “1 1 0 0 0” was decoded as the letter “T” (Fig. 9).
    After decoding the binary stream into a series of characters, the plain text message
    was perfectly restored. 3.2.2. Performance comparison with an image file To further
    illustrate the performance of the source, the encoding/decoding algorithms and
    the developed underground communication system (60 pixel × 30 pixel) portable
    network graphics (PNG)–encoded image (Fig. 10a) was transmitted using the same
    experimental setup when incorporating different hardware or software design options.
    The evaluation included six cases, and the parameters are summarized in Table

    to quantify the system performance: the bit error rate (BER), the bit rate, power,
    and transmission time. The BER is defined as the number of error bits normalized
    by the total number of bits, and the bit rate is the number of bits per second
    (bps). The power is evaluated based on the output of the power supply. The transmission
    time is the duration of file transmission. The restored images for each case are
    presented in Fig. 10, and the performance metrics are compared in Table 2. Table

    IV 3.86 10 0.9 12 V 3.19 16 3 7.5 VI 0.54 16 3 13 The effectiveness of the Hamming
    code was explored by transmitting two image binary streams: one with the implementation
    of the Hamming code and the other without. An apparent difference between restored
    images was observed (Fig. 10b and c) vs. Fig. 10f and g). By applying an error
    correction, the BER dropped significantly (Table 2) and the quality of the restored
    images was much better. A downside of implementing Hamming code is that it required
    more bits to be sent, resulting in higher energy consumption and a longer transmission
    time (Table 2). The bit rate of the developed system is limited by the mechanical
    operation of the solenoids and the length of guard interval. One solenoid required
    approximately 60 ms to complete a push-pull cycle, while two solenoids took several
    milliseconds more. The highest bit rate achieved was 17 bps when using a single
    solenoid without the use of a guard interval (Case III). Although one solenoid
    consumes less energy than two solenoids, it generates weaker and less stable seismic
    signals. This resulted in lower SNR, and created difficulties in selecting a proper
    threshold value, and it produced greater BER (Fig. 10d and f; Fig. 10e and b,
    see also Table 2). Introducing a guard interval could help solve the inter-byte
    interference problem, decreasing the BER (Fig. 10b and f; Fig. 10d and e; Table
    2). Although the bit rate decreased after applying guard intervals, the energy
    consumption remained the same because the solenoids were not operated during guard
    intervals. The performance difference caused by the guard intervals when two solenoids
    are activated is not as strong as when only one is activated. A possible explanation
    for this finding is that the amplitude of a pulse induced by a single solenoid
    may vary, even though it is consistent most of the time (Fig. 7b). When the generated
    pulse has a relatively large amplitude, the pulse may spread beyond its allotted
    time, causing it to interfere with neighboring pulses. Even after attenuation,
    this pulse may still be stronger than other impulses. When two solenoids are used,
    the generated impulses are more consistent; the resulting SNRs are higher, and
    the inter-bit interference is less pronounced. As shown in Table 2, the bit rate
    was mainly affected by whether or not guard intervals are used, and it was limited
    by the mechanical operation of the source. When a guard interval of 40 ms was
    used, the bit rate dropped to 10 bps. With the voltage input of 12 VDC, the measured
    current when activating a single solenoid was 250 mA, indicating that the power
    of one solenoid is 3 W. We assumed a 50% duty cycle, i.e. the binary streams contain
    50% “1” s and 50% “0” s. Without guard intervals, the power of a single solenoid
    is estimated as 1.5 W. The power of the vibration source decreased slightly with
    increase in the guard interval. However, the total energy consumption was not
    affected by the guard interval. It depended on the number of bits sent as well
    as the energy consumed to send each bit, which, in turn, depends on the number
    of solenoids used. With the use of Hamming code, the number of total bits increased;
    as a result, both the operation time and the energy consumption increased. 4.
    Discussion 4.1. Practical considerations and cost In practical applications, the
    optimal operation mode can be selected based on application requirements. When
    the accuracy of message transmission is most important, such as the transmission
    of important data obtained in the field, it is suggested to use both Hamming code
    and guard intervals to achieve a low BER (Case II). When transmission speed is
    the primary concern, the guard intervals and the Hamming code can be omitted (Case
    V). The BER for Case V when transmitting the image was 3.19%. The BER can be further
    decreased when sending plain text instead of images, by applying spelling correction
    techniques. The two-solenoid design also enhances the resilience of the system
    in that the system would still work if one solenoid should fail (Case IV). The
    underground communication system developed in this study was built using off-the-shelf
    components. The total cost of the system was less than US$100 (US$30 for two solenoids,
    US$10 for one accelerometer, US$22 for one microcontroller, and US$24 for one
    motor controller). The total cost of the system could be further reduced if the
    components are purchased or manufactured in bulk. 4.2. Limitations and future
    work Because the test setup was limited by the sand tank size, the maximum transmission
    range of the developed system in dry medium dense sand has not been determined.
    However, the relatively high SNR and the low path loss indicate that a transmission
    range of several meters could be achieved. The proposed system was also tested
    in saturated sand in the laboratory. It worked well but a systematic evaluation
    needs to be completed to analyze the effect of water content on the system performance.
    Due to the limitations by mechanical operation of the solenoids and the OOK modulation,
    the bit rate was less than 20 bps, which can be improved by making further modifications.
    One potential way to improve the current design is to shorten the gap between
    the solenoids and the 3D-printed case; this would reduce the travel distance of
    the plungers, reducing the mechanical operation time. Another potential improvement
    is to integrate the current communication system into a self-burrowing robot (Tao
    et al., 2020). Similar to mole-rats which rely on their heads and feet to burrow
    as well as to generate seismic signals, it is possible that vibrations used for
    data transmission may be generated during the robotic burrowing process. Robotic
    integration could also be more cost-effective and energy efficient, as no extra
    energy is required for communication specifically; the installation cost could
    also be reduced since the sources and sensors are integral parts of the robots;
    furthermore, the source and sensor nodes are mobile instead of static, allowing
    a reconfigurable dynamic underground IoT network to be established. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, an underground wireless communication system based on vibration
    was developed. Two vibrational sources, one inspired by biological tremulation
    and the other by drumming, were designed and fabricated using off-the-shelf components.
    It was found that the drumming-inspired source generated vibrational signals with
    higher acceleration amplitudes and higher SNR. Text files and image files were
    first encoded into binary streams with the option of using Hamming code for error
    correction. The binary streams were then used to control the on/off state of the
    source, and optional guard intervals were introduced between bytes. The resulting
    vibrations were measured using an MEMS accelerometer, and the signals were decoded
    to restore the information. The plain text file was perfectly restored, while
    the BER for the image transmission was as low as 0.1%. In general, the implementation
    of the Hamming code and guard intervals decreased the bit error ratio and bit
    rate while increasing the power consumption and operation time; using two solenoids
    instead of one in the drumming-inspired source further decreased the bit error
    ratio and enhanced the resilience of the system but increased the power and operation
    time. The proposed system can effectively transmit information as far as 80 cm
    in the laboratory in dry medium dense sand. Future large-scale and field-scale
    tests are needed to further evaluate the performance of the proposed system in
    different types of soils and under different soil conditions. Declaration of competing

    Introduction Precision agriculture, a modern agricultural management strategy
    and operational technology system based on spatial information management and
    mutation analysis, is of great significance for improving the efficiency of utilization
    of agricultural resources and ensuring sustainable agricultural development. In
    a precision agriculture system, numerous monitoring data need to be collected
    from the ginseng cultivation fields, including temperature °C, humidity %RH, ground
    temperature °C, ground humidity %RH, illumination Lux, CO₂ ppm, wind direction
    velocity m/s, and precipitation mm. The monitoring environment is diverse and
    complex. Besides, changes in channel conditions resulting from factors like occlusion
    are also inevitable during the ginseng growth. Hence, in precision agriculture
    systems, numerous scholars have focused on improving the energy utilization and
    network life-cycle in a complex communication context under limited energy conditions
    of sensor equipment. In broad terms, precision agriculture refers to an agricultural
    endeavor that aims to deliver management at an adequate time and location with
    the appropriate potency. It practices regulated inputs by partitioning the croplands
    into management blocks or zones rather than offering uniform management. Given
    the sustained or elevated yield at lower inputs, precision agriculture should
    mitigate environmental impacts and improve income for the peasants in theory [1].
    To achieve precision agriculture, it is necessary to understand the spatial changes
    in crop and edaphic parameters within croplands [2]. Data communication which
    serves as an intermediate link between data collection and platform application
    in precision agriculture, plays a vital role in the stable operation of the system
    [3]. However, since the sampling points of agricultural information are highly
    scattered, their geographical distribution is uneven, and power supply is difficult,
    the construction of wired networks is difficult. Thus, the wireless sensor network
    has become a basic communication technology in precision agriculture due to its
    low construction cost, small size, convenient deployment, and flexible network
    [4, 5]. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), capable of supporting diverse sectors,
    including manufacturing, education, agriculture, and environmental surveillance,
    have permanently changed all lives. However, the wireless presence disallows the
    replacement of the sensor node cells in case the deployment site is remote or
    unsupervised. To this end, a few studies have attempted to prolong the life expectancy
    of the nodes. Although cluster-based routing has greatly helped solve this problem,
    the cluster head (CH) selection can still be bettered through critical variable
    introduction [6]. However, to improve the flexibility of the network deployment,
    most devices in the wireless sensor networks use batteries as their main energy
    source [7]. B. Chatterjee et al. To minimize the network energy expenditure, a
    co-optimization strategy (real-time) has been formulated, achieving total life-cycle
    maximization for the batteries. The communication–computation energy tradeoffs
    for a meshed WSN structure are described by Chatterjee et al. [8], which is arranged
    throughout a college campus2400-acre in size to monitor the water nitrate content
    and temperature humidity for smart agricultural purposes via multiple sensors.
    Deng et al. develop, implement, and elucidate a hardware platform suitable for
    nodes of a self-powered WSN and mainly aims to prolong the service life of WSN
    nodes configured in the field context by offering a system for capturing hybrid
    energy. Apart from minimizing power expenditure through optimization of sensors,
    microcontrollers, radio frequency (RF) transceivers, etc., the energy sources
    also need to be taken into consideration, rather than habitual practices of cell
    replacements or recharges [9]. Exploiting the TENG-based direct sensory transmission
    (TDST), F. Wen et al. put forward a short-range self-powered (SS) WSN that is
    free of cells. Wen et al. [10] improved the output of TENG signals and strengthened
    their frequency through instantaneous short-term discharge by manipulating either
    a mechanical switch or a diode/switch combo. In this way, signals can be transmitted
    directly, where no external power supplier or extra wireless module is needed.
    For energy-harvesting underwater optical WSNs (EH-UOWSNs), N. Saeed et al. develops
    a localization strategy that is based on received signal strength (RSS), which
    though encounters great difficulty of predicting ranges due to the optical noise
    sources in optical devices and the seawater-induced disruption of channels. For
    viable nodes modeled by utilizing the features of optical communication channels
    (underwater), their RSSs are determined to achieve the localization of network
    [11]. In addition to satisfying the basic collection tasks, the device uses a
    large part of its energy for transmitting information to other devices. Therefore,
    in the agricultural environment, the topics of improving the energy utilization
    efficiency of the sensor devices in the communication process and improving the
    network life cycle have been rigorously researched by many scholars. In view of
    the complex and changeable wireless environment in the precision agriculture systems,
    this paper proposes a novel energy-efficient networking algorithm by dynamically
    adjusting the network architecture and the signal transmitting power of each node
    based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which fully considers
    the residual energy variation of nodes during communication. Compared to other
    algorithms, the present method extends the WSN life-cycle greatly. The remainder
    of this work is arranged as follows: Section II introduces a precision agriculture
    system with ginseng cultivation as an example. Section III describes the currently
    available networking algorithms for the nodes of wireless sensor networks in precision
    agriculture systems. Section IV describes the node model of the wireless sensor
    network and introduces the networking algorithm corresponding to the energy-saving
    wireless sensor nodes based on power control. Results of the validation performed
    on the algorithm have been presented in Section V by comparing them with the corresponding
    results obtained using the existing protocols. Section VI provides a summary of
    this study. The precision agriculture system for ginseng As a crucial ancient
    Chinese herbal material, Panax ginseng exerts prominent functions on a variety
    of diseases [12]. As an important Chinese medicinal material, ginseng has the
    functions of recovering meridians and astringing consciousness loss, replenishing
    the spleen and kidney, and calming the spirit with marked effects for relieving
    nerves and improving the immune system [13]. The main ginseng-producing areas
    are distributed in Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang in China and South Korea,
    and North Korea. As a perennial herb, Panax ginseng prefers a cold and sunny climate,
    and ginseng growth requires strict illumination conditions. In addition, in terms
    of its growth environment, the relative water content of the soil needs to be
    above 70–80%, and the pH value required is preferably 6.0–6.5. In order to ensure
    the sustainability of ginseng cultivation, China has undergone a major transformation
    from “cutting forest to grow ginseng” to “cultivating ginseng in crop fields”.
    Ensuring that the trace elements are available in sufficient quantities in the
    soil and the growth environment in the farmland meets the requirements for ginseng
    cultivation are the key aspects that impact the emergence rate and yield of ginseng.
    As the Internet of Things (IoT) and novel sensing technologies are evolving persistently,
    a good solution has been provided for ginseng cultivation in crop fields. As shown
    in Fig 1, the precision agriculture system consists of a sensing layer, a transport
    layer, as well as a platform for data application. The sensing layer consists
    of a series of sensing devices and mainly implements the collection of key information
    such as the soil moisture, its pH value, and the light intensity during growing
    ginseng in the crop fields. The transport layer is the main transmission path
    for connecting the collected data to the application platform with data forwarding
    and intermediate data processing functions. The application platform reprocesses
    the data according to actual needs and provides a series of targeted and professional
    functions of data application such as environmental monitoring systems and expert
    systems in agriculture. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original

    In the precision agriculture system for ginseng cultivation in a farm field, the
    influence of the cristate leaf on the transmission of wireless signals should
    not be ignored during its growing process due to the diversity of the collection
    parameters such as light, soil moisture, and pH value, and the deployment of sensors
    at different heights. Furthermore, the limited energy available to the devices
    in the wireless sensor network demands a set of efficient transmission strategies.
    In order to ensure the long-term durability of the devices under different pressures,
    extensive scholarly efforts have been devoted to the energy conservation in these
    devices from the aspects of hardware design, network routing, and data with compressive
    sensing. This study presents an energy-saving networking algorithm for a precision
    agriculture system that combines the characteristics of the wireless sensor devices
    and the advantages of the particle swarm optimization technique. Related works
    In the research studies conducted on the routing algorithms of wireless sensor
    networks based on precision agriculture systems, based on the concept of a mobile
    node, Prasad R et al. used miniature aerial vehicles as the receiver of regional
    data [14]. This reduces the energy consumption caused by multi-hop data transmission
    and ensures reliable network communication with low power consumption. However,
    periodic small-scale collection systems, such as ginseng growing, undoubtedly
    increase the equipment cost. In order to achieve balanced energy consumption by
    the network and to avoid the “premature death” of nodes caused by the “hot spot”
    problems, a scheme called energy-efficient load-balanced clustering (EELBC) has
    been formulated, which upgrades the network energy efficiency through number equilibration
    of cluster members [15]. Considering the shortcomings of the low-power adaptive
    clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol in the random cluster head mechanism. Kandris
    et al. have modeled the network as a linear system [16] and, starting from the
    current and future residual energy of the nodes, have proposed the equalized cluster
    head election routing protocol (ECHERP) that effectively improves the overall
    life cycle of the network. A differential evolution (DE)-based clustering strategy
    has been proposed [17] for WSNs, which inhibits the rapid channel (high-load)
    death to extend the network life-cycle. However, the wireless presence disallows
    the replacement of the sensor node cells in case the deployment site is remote
    or unsupervised. To this end, a few studies have attempted to prolong the life
    expectancy of the nodes. Although cluster-based routing has greatly helped solve
    this problem, the cluster head (CH) selection can still be upgraded through the
    critical variable introduction. Moreover, the main emphasis has been laid on the
    choice of CH or the inter-node transmission of data. For network efficiency optimization,
    the potential of meta-heuristic strategies can be bright [18]. Furthermore, the
    layout of sensors has been explored under restricted conditions of sensor and
    App communication ranges [19]. In Double-tiered WSNs, the algorithms are superior
    to the established clustering approaches, including Agglomerative Clustering,
    Minimum Energy Routing, PSO, Divisive Clustering, as well as Relay Node Placement
    and its Improved approach regarding mean performance [20]. On surface networks,
    the paths of varying homotopy types are calculated by developing an approach that
    is free of GPS and tessellation. According to the virtual planar coordinate calculations
    of nodes, a data package is sent by a source node to its destination in a greedy
    manner. Upon failure of an existing path, other greedy path options (varying homotopy
    types) are available for the source node to achieve the package delivery. The
    proposed distributed algorithms are scalable to the size of surface networks and
    their genus number. With the proposed design, a novel scheme of multichain routing
    can be generated for data package transmission in the energy-balanced WSNs. The
    multichain routing technique can compute the optimal inter-node distance of transmission
    through mathematical modeling. Regarding the design standard for optimal distance,
    the farthest sending node within a communication scope and the direction to sink
    are chosen so that the multichain architectures can be established with precise
    direction, distance, and multipath. Shorter chain routing allows cutting unwarranted
    energy consumption, thereby achieving life-cycle extension for the global network
    [21]. Initially, a framework for smart agriculture is designed based on SWIPT.
    The next step involves the exploration of an energy performance-optimizing strategy
    for green communication. In this process, the pairing of subcarriers is optimized
    together with their power allocation. A communication procedure comprises two
    stages. To tackle the optimization problem proposed, a Lagrangian dual formulation
    is utilized to put forward an efficient algorithm of iterative optimization [22].
    A composite routing measurement method has been proposed for combining energy
    sensing, reliability awareness, robustness awareness, and resource awareness,
    which increases the adaptability of the system to different scenarios [23]. Azharuddin
    et al. [24] adopted distributed clustering and routing ideas from the perspective
    of fault tolerance to solve the problem of network reorganization after the failure
    of cluster head nodes. Under a proposed model, a brand-new problem of sensor clustering
    is formulated, where the sensors are divided into varying clusters, and a sensor
    enabling transmission quantity maximization of redundant suppressed data is chosen
    for each cluster [25]. Li et al. [26] develop an effective routing scheme called
    DMARL for UOWSNs, which exploits multiagent reinforcement learning. Initially,
    the network is created as a distributed multiagent architecture through modeling.
    The design of the routing scheme takes into account the link quality and residual
    energy to better accommodate the dynamic environment and help better extend the
    network lifespan. For faster convergence of the algorithm for reinforcement learning,
    two additional optimization measures are developed as well. For the distributed
    system, they offer a reward mechanism on this basis. Cao et al. [27] put forward
    enhanced versions of distributed parallel algorithms after checking the prior
    knowledge-based and the stochastic grouping and an additional optimizer. Their
    algorithms are superior to counterparts in terms of performance, which exhibit
    remarkably shorter time expenditure than the serial algorithms owing to the distributed
    parallelism nature. Hence, within a considerably restricted time, a higher performance
    can be attained by their algorithms. An optimization problem is formulated by
    Baek et al. [28] to maximize the post-data transmission minimum residual sensor
    energy in UAV routing (energy-saving scheme), which depends on data collection
    and is constrained by the travel distance of UAV. Focusing on the life-cycle maximization
    of a WSN, Zhang et al. [29] develop a sensor configuration scheme called EDAGD,
    which comprises several algorithms. Its performance is superior to the classic
    random deployment algorithms. Künzel et al. [30] propose a Q-learning reliable
    routing strategy, which has a weighting agent for achieving weight adjustment
    of a most-advanced graph-routing algorithm. The sets of weights are denoted by
    the agent state, and in the process of network operation, the weights are altered
    by actions. Upon shortening of mean network latency or extension of a network
    life expectancy, the agent is rewarded accordingly. Liu et al. [31] develop TPE-FTED,
    a fault-tolerant algorithm for event region detection, where the faulty nodes
    are recognized based on the extraction of trajectory patterns. By learning the
    probabilistic model online, the sensing value distributions in varying sensing
    states are elucidated by individual nodes. A trajectory can be generated with
    a particular group of probabilistic models, which is indicative of the occurrence
    of a special event. TPE-FTED performs the pattern matching and examines the spatiotemporal
    restraints by utilizing the implicit information from the trajectories, so that
    the faulty node declaration can be recognized. For efficiency enhancement of network
    having QoS parameters (multi-constrained), the problem is modeled as a multi constrained
    optimal path issue and preserved by developing an algorithm based on distributed
    learning automaton (DLA). Exploiting the pros of DLA, the proposed method finds
    the minimum number of nodes to conform to the QoS requirements. A few QoS routing
    constraints are considered during path selection, such as end-to-end delay and
    reliability. Algorithm outperforms existing advanced algorithms regarding energy
    efficiency and end-to-end delay [32]. Given above, the use of UAVs for data acquisition
    in dense WSNs is proposed, where the compressive data gathering (CDG)based on
    projections serves as a new solution technique. Data en-route are gathered from
    a big sensor node set by CDG to choose the projection nodes working as cluster
    heads (CHs), so that the number of required transmissions can be lowered to remarkably
    save energy and prolong the network life-cycle [33]. By fusing analysis of edge
    data with that of cloud data, a brand-new method for automated detection of anomalies
    in heterogeneous WSNs is developed. The edge data analysis exploits an entirely
    unsupervised algorithm of artificial neural network, while with the cloud data
    analysis, the multi-parameterized edit distance algorithm is utilized [34]. However,
    none of the abovementioned algorithms take the transmit power tunability of wireless
    sensor devices into consideration, resulting in insufficient utilization of the
    device performance during network construction. In this study, taking the characteristics
    of power control and wireless sensor networks into consideration, the network
    has been established from three aspects, namely, device performance, energy consumption,
    and location information. When wireless communication is inadequate, it is necessary
    to increase the transmission power of the high-energy devices to reduce the unnecessary
    data forwarding nodes. On the other hand, when wireless communication is adequate,
    it is necessary to decrease the transmission power of the neighboring devices
    for reducing the overall increased energy consumption in the network caused by
    the data loss or retransmission resulting from the interference of the adjacent
    communication channels. The proposed algorithm This section describes the algorithm
    proposed herein for an energy-efficient WSN that is applied to ginseng cultivation
    in the precision agriculture system. The algorithm incorporates power control
    into the network construction by adjusting the communication radius of each sensor
    node to achieve balanced energy consumption in the network. In addition, the proposed
    algorithm preferentially selects the forward and high-energy nodes as the cluster
    heads or the data forwarding nodes, so that the transmission orientation and energy
    expenditure of the nodes can be taken into account. Abstraction of the network
    model Fig 2 shows a schematic of the network structure of the precision agriculture
    system based on the clustering model. Devices in the network can be divided into
    three types: central node, cluster head node, and cluster member node. The central
    nodes, having a fixed power supply and strong information processing capabilities,
    provide data interaction between the wireless sensor network and the internet.
    The same hardware structure is employed for the cluster head nodes and the cluster
    member nodes in the network with the battery power statically distributed in a
    certain area. The cluster member node is mainly responsible for responding to
    the collection instruction and sending the response information to the corresponding
    cluster head node. In addition to the abovementioned functions, the cluster head

    Energy-based model for the network For energy expenditure analysis of the wireless
    sensor nodes in the WSN, the widely acknowledged energy expenditure model for
    wireless communication is adopted in this study [16]. (1) Where Etx and Erx represent
    the energy expenditures from transmission and reception of data, respectively,
    l is the length of the transmitted data, Eelec denotes the energy expenditure
    by the node for each bit of forwarded/received data, and d denotes the distance
    between sending and receiving nodes. In case the distance is below the threshold
    dc, we use a free space model; otherwise, we use a multipath model. εfs and εtwo-ray
    are the power magnifications in the different models. dc can be calculated using
    the following formula: (2) Because Eelec depends on the hardware, such as a digital
    coder, modulator, and filter, the default value of this system is fixed in this
    study. Description of the proposed algorithm In order to facilitate research and
    analysis in this study, a wireless sensor network has been abstracted with a two-way
    communication function as an undirected connectivity graph, G = (V, E), where
    V represents a set of all wireless sensor devices, and E is a possible set of
    communication paths between all devices. The transmit power can be altered for
    all wireless sensor devices by changing the communication radius. For a unified
    analysis of energy consumption in the network, the network life cycle is defined
    as the ratio of the number of transfers from the commencement of data transmission
    to the “death” of the first network node. In order to quantitatively represent
    the transmit power of the device, the “power adjustment factor” for each wireless
    sensor device is set according to the following expression: (3) And its value
    is in the range of [0.5, 1.5]. With the introduction of the “power adjustment
    coefficient”, the wireless network construction becomes a non-deterministic polynomial
    problem. In order to achieve rapid optimization of the network structure, particle
    swarm optimization has been introduced as the main solution algorithm. Fig 3 illustrates
    the flowchart of our algorithm. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image

    Phase I: Initialization of the proposed algorithm. Suppose the number of particles
    in the PSO algorithm is m, the maximum number of cycles is p, and the network
    optimization index is f = max(Life), where Life is the value of the life cycle
    of the network. The position update formula of each particle is given by (4) Where
    W is the “power adjustment factor” matrix, W = {wi |i = 1,…,N}, N is the number
    of nodes in the sensor network, λ is the inertia coefficient, C1, and C2 are the
    self-learning factors, and Wp and Wg represent the individual optimal value and
    the group optimal value, respectively. Phase II: Network construction under particle
    condition. (1) Cluster head selection phase Step 1: The central node sends a request
    for route creation to the nodes within the communication range in a broadcast
    form, and each node obtains the information of the minimum hops, hmin, between
    the central node and itself. Step 2: The communication radius, Ri, of each node
    is calculated according to the “power adjustment factor” matrix, and the degree
    of discretization, DisRatio, among a node and its adjacent nodes is obtained as
    follows: (5) where dis(j, CHi)denotes the communication distance between node
    i and its adjacent node j, and N denotes the number of neighboring nodes. The
    smaller the index, the higher is the concentration of the neighboring nodes and
    the cluster heads. Step 3: Within the current communication radius, the maximum
    number of data transfers, Count (i), is estimated considering the node i as the
    cluster head node: (6) Where E(i) refers to the residual energy of the current
    node, N denotes the number of adjacent nodes, η is the data fusion coefficient,
    and Riis the estimated communication distance when data is sent. Step 4: The “fitness
    factor”, fitness(i), is calculated considering the node i as the cluster head:
    (7) whereα and β are the proportional coefficients of each item, and the system
    assumes their values to be –1 and1, respectively. Step 5: Among the neighboring
    nodes, the one with the largest “fitness factor” is voted as the cluster head
    node by all the nodes in the network. (2) Networking phase Step 6: The selection
    coefficient, C(j, i), of each cluster head node from the neighboring nodes is
    calculated using the cluster member node j, and the cluster head node with the
    larger coefficient is selected for networking. (8) where E0(i) refers to the residual
    energy of cluster head node i, Etx(j,i) represents the communication loss between
    the nodes, and h(j)min/h(i)min guarantees that the cluster head, which is closer
    to the central node is selected for networking. φ and γ are the proportional coefficients
    of each item, and the system assumes their values to be –1 and1, respectively.
    Step 7: The aggregate information of the adjacent cluster heads obtained from
    the cluster head node (with m as an example) is used for calculating the selection
    coefficient CH(m, n) of the candidate forwarding node, and the cluster head node
    with maximum coefficient is chosen as the data forwarding node. (9) where count(n)
    is the maximum number of data transmissions that can be performed after the node
    n is selected as the cluster head, h(m)min/h(n)min guarantees that the cluster
    head, which is closer to the central node, is preferentially selected to forward
    data, θ is the proportionality factor for this item, and its value has been taken
    to be 1 in this study. Phase III: Particle update phase. Step 1: From the abovementioned
    procedure, the life cycle values of each network are calculated under the condition
    of m different particles, along with a record of the individual optimal value,
    Wp, and the group optimal value, Wg, in the objective function as well as their
    corresponding “power adjustment factor” matrices, with the number of cycles increased
    by one. Step 2: The particle position is updated using the particle update formula,
    and the steps in Phase II are repeated until the program termination conditions
    are met. In the clustered network structure, the functional characteristics of
    the cluster head node determine whether its energy consumption is much larger
    than the cluster member nodes. In this study, the cluster head rotation mechanism
    has also been used for optimizing the network. The rotation threshold of the cluster
    head is set to q. When 1/5 of the network life cycle is greater than q, either
    1/5 of the life cycle of the nodes in the network or q instances of data transmissions
    are used as the trigger conditions for the network reconstruction. Performance
    analysis of the algorithm Description of the experimental parameters For verification
    analysis of our algorithm, the MATLAB is used for conducting the simulations in
    the range of 500 × 500 m2 and a comparison has been made between the results obtained
    using the proposed algorithm and the typical LEACH [35], BCDCP [36], and ECHERP
    [37] algorithms. During the simulations, each wireless sensor node in the WSN
    is identical regarding initial energy and performance of wireless communication
    and is randomly fixed in the entire area. The physical structure of the precision
    agriculture system network is as follows: The central node is located outside
    the measurement area equipped with an independent power supply. The physical position
    of wireless sensor equipment in the WSN cannot be changed, but it has the function
    of transmitting power adjustment using multi-hop as the method of transmission.
    The parameter settings in the experiment are shown in Table 1. Download: PPT PowerPoint
    slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Parameter settings. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263401.t001
    As shown in Table 1, 50 to 300 wireless sensors are deployed in the network at
    random; and their physical position cannot be changed, but such equipment has
    the function of transmitting power adjustment; and power consumption of the node
    for transmitting/receiving 1bit data Eelec = 50nJ/bit. In the proposed algorithm,
    Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is taken as the basis of algorithm optimization;
    and in the particle update rules, the number of particles m = 10, selected self-learning
    factors C1 and C2 = 0.5, inertial coefficient λ = 0.5, and the maximum number
    of optimizations of the particle p = 30. Performance analysis of the networking
    algorithm Effect of the network size. The number of network nodes, which is an
    important factor that affects the communication distance between the network nodes,
    has an important effect on the network life cycle. For networking performance
    verification of our algorithm over varying sizes of the network, the LEACH, BCDCP,
    and ECHERP algorithms were used in the simulations with 50–300 nodes selected
    in an area of 500 × 500 m2. The simulation results are shown in Fig 4. With the
    gradual addition of the network nodes, the network life cycle for different algorithms
    is observed to increase gradually, and the proposed algorithm exhibits superior
    performance in improving the network life cycle. The algorithm comparison on network
    life cycle under different numbers of nodes is shown in Table 2. Download: PPT

    Effect of the position of the central node. In the precision agriculture system,
    the location of the host determines whether the central node should be deployed
    outside the monitoring range of the wireless sensor network or not. As an important
    part of the sensor network, the distance of communication between the central
    node and the sensing equipment greatly affects the size of the network life cycle.
    To confirm how this factor affects the network life cycle, a distance of 50 ~
    170 m from the edge of the monitoring range was selected for the simulation and
    the results thus obtained are shown in Fig 5. As the distance between the device
    and the position of the central node increases gradually, the network life cycle
    is observed to decrease gradually. When the position is greater than 130 m, the
    downward trend becomes steeper. The role of the distance between sensing and central
    nodes appears crucial. The algorithm proposed in this work exhibits a lower decline
    rate and downward trend than the compared algorithms. The algorithm comparison
    on network life cycle under different distances of the central node is shown in
    Table 3. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig

    Analysis of transmission frequency of the network node. The analysis of the data
    transmission process of all nodes in the network requires verification of the
    balance in the energy consumption during data transmission by the network. In
    this study, 200 sensor nodes were selected in the range of 500 × 500 m2 in the
    simulation, and the central node was assumed to be 100 m away from the edge of
    the monitoring range. The failure time of the network node for different algorithms
    is shown in Fig 6. Compared to the other algorithms, the large-scale failure of
    the network nodes in the algorithm proposed in this study and the breakdown in
    its communication occur later with the increasing frequency of data collection.

    the central node and other nodes is shown in Table 4. Download: PPT PowerPoint

    In order to enable limited energy usage by the wireless sensors in the precision
    agriculture system, an algorithm for high-efficiency wireless sensor networks
    for a ginseng field has been proposed in this study. Exploiting sensor nodes’
    adjustable transmission power, the particle swarm optimization technique has been
    used to achieve the communication range adjustment of sensing devices in the network.
    From the aspect of reliable communication, the optimal deployment of the limited
    energy of the devices in the network has been achieved. The simulation results
    show that compared to the existing LEACH, BCDCP, and ECHERP algorithms, the proposed
    algorithm has a higher life cycle for different network sizes with good performance
    at different deployment locations of the central node. Therefore, the environmental
    growth variables and indices of farm fields in Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang
    in China, and the remote mountainous areas in South Korea and North Korea, have
    been monitored in real-time using the proposed algorithm. The optimal growth environment
    of the ginseng fields has been improved using the sensing nodes of the wireless
    sensor network, which has a significant application value in increasing the yield
    of ginseng and reducing labor costs. References 1. Mulla DJ. Twenty five years

    India SECTION I. Introduction Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a combination
    of various sensor nodes. Each sensor node in a network is integrated with transceiver
    and receiver for sending and receiving data. WSNs is classified into two types
    i.e. structured WSNs and unstructured WSNs [1]. In structured WSNs, sensor nodes
    are deployed in a well-defined manner, whereas in unstructured WSNs, the sensor
    nodes are deployed in randomly order. WSNs have large number of applications in
    real world scenario like military, airlines, underwater survey, agriculture, healthcare,
    transportation and many more. The different communication technologies are developed
    for communication between nodes and base station such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
    GSM/GPRS, and LoWPAN. In present time WSNs are widely adopted in diverse of field
    such as precision agriculture, health, transportation, monitoring, tracking, security
    system etc. The monitoring applications can be described as field''s surveillance,
    environmental conditions, water level, body organs status etc., while tracking
    applications can be described in terms of animal detection in agriculture, intruders
    in restricted area, and disease in human body. It is noticed that agriculture
    has a significant impact on human life as well as for wealth creation. It is also
    observed that agriculture sector is one of important component in the economy
    of many countries. But, it is observed that farmers are faced different issues
    with respect to agriculture. These issues are summarized as less information regarding
    crops, irrigation environmental parameter for crops, intruders etc. The precision
    agriculture (PA) is a promising solution for the aforementioned problems as well
    as better production and protection of crops. The solution of aforementioned issues
    is precision agriculture (PA). Further, it can be described as management of the
    crop that includes different technologies such as IoT, WSN, drone surveillance,
    water management, remote sensing etc. In agriculture, WSNs plays vital role the
    sensor nodes deploy in agriculture field sense the moisture of soil, temperature
    of surrounding, content of water present in the field, requirement of water in
    field, detection of intrusion in farms and requirement of fertilizers. By using
    WSNs in agriculture sector wastage of many resources like water, fertilizer, man
    work power, management and farming cost are reduced. By using sensor nodes in
    agricultural field farmers can easily: Study the soil condition. Get real time
    information. Provide smart irrigation. Analyse growth of plant. Detection of intrusion
    in field. Furthermore, several techniques are considered for achieving the precision
    agriculture. These techniques are storage, perception, transmission, process and
    control. The role of precision agriculture is twofold- (i) optimizing the production
    and (ii) maximum profitability. First point can be achieved by considering the
    uncertainties and variability. While, second is achieved through reduction in
    fertilizers and environmental issues. The aforementioned techniques are integrated
    to design the sensing system. Such system contains several actuators and sensors
    to determine various environmental impacts for PA. These sensors also gather the
    data in real time scenario form agriculture field. The collected data includes
    several real time information such as EC, temperature, humidity, luminance and
    PH. WSNs is adopted for transmitting such information and AI techniques are considered
    for analyzing the collected information. In turn, useful information is retrieved
    from collected data regarding the growth of crops. Fig. 1 illustrates the sensor
    nodes deployment in the agriculture field and its working. The real time data
    is collected through different sensors and it is sent to users with the help of
    global network. Initially, data is collected on the sink node through different
    sensor nodes using communication technologies such Wi-Fi and ZigBee etc., and
    further, transferred to base station. In this work, a WSNs based model is developed
    for measuring the environmental parameters and collect real time information of
    rose plants. The proposed model is tested for the period of three months to measure
    the growth of rose crop. Rest of paper is arranged as section II presents the
    recent works on WSNs in precision agriculture. Section III discusses the proposed
    system for achieving precision agriculture. The results are discussed into section
    IV. Section V conclude the outcome of the proposed work. SECTION II. Related Works
    This section describes the recent works reported on PA using WSNs. To monitor
    agriculture field, Sanchez et al. [2] developed an integrated model for video
    surveillance to detect intruders as well as monitoring of crops. For preventing
    crops from animal attacks, Bapat et al. [3] proposed a cost effective WSNs based
    system which is integrated with PIR sensors, RF module, sound producing devices
    and light flashers. Nikolidakis et al. [4] developed an energy efficient system
    based on ECHERP protocol for smart irrigation in agricultural fields. To reduce
    the wastage of water in agricultural fields, Gutierrez et al. [5] designed an
    automatic irrigation system based on WSNs and GPRS module which is feasible and
    cost effective. For collecting real time information of agricultural fields, Zhang
    et al. [6] developed a remote monitoring system based on WSNs by using ZigBee
    communication technology. To monitor the soil property of field, Li et al. [7]
    developed a system which is based on WSNs. The designed system helps in providing
    real time field data to the users. Jahnavi et al. [8] developed an automatic system
    for measuring the environmental parameters in a greenhouse. The system is integrated
    with various hardware components like CC2530 chip, ZigBee stack, Humidity sensor,
    Temperature sensor and soil moisture sensor. To monitor greenhouse vegetables
    by WSNs, Li et al. [9] proposed a monitoring system using JN5139 micro- processor,
    Zigbee, ARM7 microprocessor, ZKOS operating system. For real time frost monitoring
    in vineyard, Valente et al. [10] designed a collaborative system made up of WSNs
    and aerial robot. The proposed system assesses the viability of frost in spring
    season. For better agricultural production, Keshtgari et al. [11] provides WSNs
    based solution for precision agriculture. The proposed system is composed of sensor
    nodes which collect real time information of field and by using Zigbee communication
    technology data is transferred. Liu et al. [12] proposed a WSNs based prototype
    to monitor the environmental condition of greenhouse. By using several sensor
    nodes temperature, moisture of soil and light condition were measured and with
    the help of GSM module data is remotely transmitted to the users system. To investigate
    the effects of environmental conditions in a greenhouse, Mendez et al. [13] designed
    a Wi-Fi based agricultural monitoring system. Proposed system monitors various
    environmental parameters like temperature, humidity and the information was transmitted
    to the users by using Wi-Fi communication technology. For precision agriculture,
    Lin et al. [14] reported a WSNs based model chip model for monitoring and Zigbee
    for data communication. The proposed system was constituted by three parts that
    are sensing unit for collecting environmental parameters, Zigbee transceiver for
    data communication and web-site unit by which remotely users can access data.
    WSNs based model is adopted for measuring the progression in valeriana jatamansi
    plant [15]. Akhter and Sofi presented explored the capabilities of WSNs, data
    analytics and machine learning for achieving the precision agriculture [16]. Anguraj
    et al. presented a CNSVMHC for the effective management of irrigation issue [17].
    It''s claimed that proposed classifier get rid off the weekly irrigation and plant
    can be irrigated on the bases of moisture content of soil in automatic manner.
    Moreover, a control mechanism is also developed to stop the irrigation process.
    Sanjeevi et al. presented a WSNs based architecture to monitor and investigate
    the growth of plants using IoT devices for PA and remote farming [18]. The irrigation
    issues is effectively handled through different IoT devices. The results claimed
    that proposed architecture achieves at par results than conventional model. This
    study presented a prediction model for apple orchids and task of the prediction
    model is to find the disease in apples. In this work, different environmental
    parameters are measured which are responsible for the growth of valeriana jatamansi
    plant. Fig. 1: Sensor nodes in agricultural field Show All SECTION III. Propsoed
    Model for Precision Agriculture (pa) This section describes the various hardware
    and software requirements for the proposed model. • Node Hardware The proposed
    system for PA consists of variety of hardware''s that are integrated on a single
    platform and works simultaneously. The proposed system is the combination of variety
    of sensors like temperature, soil, PIR, humidity, Arduino board, water pump, Wi-Fi
    and breadboard. Fig. 2 illustrates the model of proposed system. • Arduino Board
    It is open source platform that can be adopted for integrating the different electronic
    and IoT devices. The aim of this platform is to send and receive the data through
    different sensors. This platform is operate on 5 volt and contains ATmega 328
    microcontroller. It consists of fourteen digital pins that are connected to different
    IoT devices. These pins are illustrated in Fig. 3. USB socket (1): It connects
    the Arduino board with computer to embed code. Fig. 2: Illustrates the proposed
    system for pa Show All Microcontroller (2): This work considers the ATmega328
    microcontroller to send and receive data. Barrel jack (3): It provides the power
    to Arduino board. Reset Button (4): It can be used to erase all embedded code.
    Voltage regulator (5): It controls the power to Arduino board. Power pins (6,
    7): regulates the voltages. GND (8): Describes as ground circuit. Analog pins
    (9): used to read the data and can be described through A0-A5. • Digital pins
    (10): These pins can be used for digital information and described through 0 to
    13. Fig. 3: Arduino uno board Show All • Temperature and Humidity Sensor The proposed
    system consists of DHT11 sensor and this sensor is used to measure the temperature
    and humidity. The reason behind the selection of DHT 11 over linear temperature
    sensor because it provides the temperature in Celsius rather than Kelvin and its
    can be measured the temperature in the range of −40°c to 110°c. The minimum voltage
    for this sensor is 3V, but this sensor works better at 5V. Furthermore, it consists
    of V CC , Data and GND pins. The voltage supply is controlled through V CC pin
    and set to 5V. The results are provided through data pin and ground the circuit
    through GND pin. • Soil Moisture Sensor The task of this sensor is to determine
    the water content in the soil based on electrical conductivity. This sensor is
    worked on the resistance principle. This principle stated that amount of water
    content depends on the resistance among two different location in the soil. The
    lower value of resistance directly proportional to higher water content. The working
    of moisture sensor is described through two parts such as probe and circuit. Probe
    consists of two metal rods separated through a block of foam. Further, probes
    insert into the soil for measuring the water content and it can be measured using
    flow of current which passes through probes and compute the total resistance for
    measuring the water content. Circuit board consists of several different devices
    such as power LED, LM293 comparator, potentiometer, output and 4 pins. The significance
    of LM293 comparator is to provide single supply over different voltage range.
    Potentiometer can be acted as voltage divider in soil moisture sensor. The four
    pins are VCC, GND, A 0 , and D 0 . The voltage is regulated through VCC and it
    requires 5V. GND pin can be described as ground the circuit and connected to Arduino
    board. The analog data is transferred through A 0 to A 1 Arduino board and digital
    data is transferred through Do. • Pir Sensor It is passive infrared sensor that
    can be responsible to detect the intruders in agriculture land. This task is accomplished
    through HC-SR501 sensor. This sensor is operated in the range of 5V-20V and consists
    of three pins. These are Vcc , GND, OUT; V cc is for voltage supply, Ground sensor
    is through GND and output is obtained through OUT pin. • Water Pump The irrigation
    task in agriculture land is accomplished through water pump. The proposed system
    also contains a mechanism for water pump and consists of two pins for this task
    such as V CC and GND. V CC requires 3v to connect the Arduino and ground the circuit
    through GND pin. The water pump can be started automatic manner on the basis of
    environmental reading and stopped after achieving the threshold value. • Wi-Fi
    Module This work considers the Wi-Fi module to send the collected data from agriculture
    land to remote users. The proposed system consists of ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and
    having four pins. These are R X , T X , CH and V CC The data is received through
    R X pin and transferred through T X pin. V CC is responsible for voltage supply
    and control. • Breadboard It is electronic device responsible for connecting the
    different IoT devices of the proposed system. These devices are connected to breadboard
    through holes. Further, it is noticed that Arduino board consists of three pins,
    one for voltage supply and rest of are GND. So, each sensor cannot connect to
    Arduino board, hence breadboard is considered. • Working Procedure The working
    behavior of proposed system is demonstrated into Fig. 4. It is seen that different
    IoT and electronic devices are integrated into Arduino board to get the real time
    information. Furthermore, to avoid interrupted power to sensors, a Breadboard
    is integrated with sensing system. The continuous power supply is maintained through
    5V pin of Arduino board. It is also noted that only two pins are presented on
    the Arduino board. Hence, it is quite complicated task to connect all sensors
    with Arduino board. In turn, these sensors are connected to Arduino board with
    the help of breadboard. Moreover, the desired voltage is obtained through inserting
    the V CC pin of DHT11 sensor in breadboard hole. The digital data received and
    transferred through data pin and it is connected to Arduino D 13 pin. The connection
    of GND pin is same row in breadboard and Arduino board. Moreover, soil moisture
    sensor also requires the power supply for measuring the water content and it is
    connected to Arduino board through breadboard using V CC pin. The analog data
    is collected by connecting A 0 and A 1 pin of Arduino board. The similar process
    is adopted in case of PIR sensor. The digital data is collected through OUT pin
    of PIR sensor and D 2 p in of Arduino board. For receiving and transmitting of
    the data, R X and T X pins of ESP-8266 sensor are connected to D 0 and D 1 pins
    of Arduino board. CH and V CC pins are connected with 3.3V pin of Arduino board.
    Water pump is also connected to Arduino board through breadboard using V CC and
    GND pins. Finally, the system diagram consists of variety of sensors like DHT11,
    PIR sensor, Wi-Fi module, Water pump, Soil moisture sensor and battery that are
    integrated on Arduino board. Further, Arduino 1.8.5 software installed to set
    the respective pin with different sensors. The working of the pins are started
    with void setup () and void loop () functions. It the soil moisture is less than
    20, then water pump starts in automatic manner and it is stopped if moisture level
    is 90. Using Wi-Fi module, all processed data is sent to cloud layer. SECTION
    IV. Experimental Results The proposed model is used to monitor the growth of rose
    plant and deployed in a real world greenhouse which is depicted in Fig. 5. Initially,
    the performance of the proposed model is over three months such as to collect
    the real time data of moisture, intruders and irrigation. Fig. 6 illustrates the
    nodes deployment in the rose greenhouse, and the soil moisture sensor deployment.
    The sensing range of water content insoil is set to 5m. The water pump can be
    strated in automatic manner, if moistures in soil less than 20 and stopped until
    it cannot reached upto 90. Fig. 7(a) depicts the smart irrigation for the rose
    plants. To achieve the same, a arrow dipper is used with the waterpump to gives
    the water to rose plants. The real time information of intrusion or occurence
    of animal or insects near the rose plant is detected through PIR sensor. Fig.
    7(b) shows the deployment of the PIR sensor in rose green house and the range
    of these sensor is set to 10 meters. Further, a Wi-Fi communication technology
    is used to transmit the data from rose green house to user. In the proposed system
    ESP-8266 Wi-Fi module is used and it can be illustarted in Fig. 7(c). The real
    time information of the the rose greenhouse is collected on base station with
    the help of ESP-8266. Fig. 4: System diagram of proposed pa model Show All Fig.
    5: Illustrations of the greenhouse for experimentation. Show All • Results and
    Discussion The proposed model is installed in a greenhouse for a time period of
    three months. Further, real time data is collected and sent to user with the help
    of Wi-Fi module. In this subsection, few real time reading of the proposed model
    is described. Fig. 8 shows the real time collected through the proposed model
    for rose''s plants. The collected data is not readable for remote users. This
    data is converted into. CSV file using some python scripts. The python script
    which is used for this conversion is shown in Fig. 9. This data can easily read
    through the remote users. Further, some sample data of rose greenhouse is used
    to illustrate the temperature readings, moisture content, and detection of motion
    and humidity level of rose plant using Figs. 10–13. Fig. 10 depicts the moisture
    content of soil for rose plants. It is noticed that on day 4, the moisture content
    is below than significant level. Hence, to maintain the moisture level in rose
    green house, water pump is automatically start and it works until the moisture
    level is not reached up to 90. In proposed model, if the moisture of soil less
    than 20, water pump starts automatically and works up to 90. The reading of the
    PIR sensor to detect the motion in the rose greenhouse is illustrated in Fig.
    11. The PIR sensor can detect the motion in binary form. If motion is detected,
    then it is represented using 1 otherwise 0. It is observed that through PIR sensor,
    user can easily get the information about intrusion detection in the greenhouse.

    presents a prototype model for rose crops. The proposed model incorporates different
    hardware''s and software entities to achieve the precision agriculture, smart
    irrigation and intrusion detection. The proposed model is implemented in rose
    crops to monitor the growth of plants, smart irrigation and intrusion detection.
    The proposed system effectively collects the real time information of different
    environmental parameters such as moisture content, humidity level, temperature
    etc. The designed system also sends the collected information to remote users.
    Smart irrigation feature is also incorporated in the proposed system to reduce
    the water wastage. It is also observed that PIR sensors can be used for the detection
    of intruders near the rose field. Further, the collected information is sent to
    the remote user through Wi-Fi module. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

  description: When designing an agricultural intelligent water resources management
    platform, plant growth information, temperature and humidity, and other environmental
    information have an important impact on the effect of precision irrigation. How
    to build a more accurate agricultural irrigation control system and design an
    intelligent water resources management platform need to be further studied. This
    paper introduces the definition and characteristics of Internet of Things technology,
    explains the principle of the PID control algorithm in detail, and uses the method
    based on digital image processing to analyse crop growth information. Before image
    analysis, the image needs to be preprocessed, and the soil temperature and humidity
    measurement control algorithm model is constructed. By using fuzzy control logic,

    agricultural intelligent water resources management platform, plant growth information,
    temperature and humidity, and other environmental information have an important
    impact on the effect of precision irrigation. How to build a more accurate agricultural
    irrigation control system and design an intelligent water resources management
    platform need to be further studied. This paper introduces the definition and
    characteristics of Internet of Things technology, explains the principle of the
    PID control algorithm in detail, and uses the method based on digital image processing
    to analyse crop growth information. Before image analysis, the image needs to
    be preprocessed, and the soil temperature and humidity measurement control algorithm
    model is constructed. By using fuzzy control logic, the precision irrigation strategy
    is designed according to the collected temperature, humidity, and plant water
    shortage. This paper analyses the requirements of the platform, designs functional
    modules such as data sensing modules, communication transmission modules, central
    processing modules, and mechanical control modules, and introduces the hardware
    system and software system of the platform. Finally, the response time of temperature
    and humidity sensors under different acquisition modes is tested and analysed.
    Through a multi-hop network experiment, the relationship between success rate
    and distance, communication distance, and RSSI value is tested, which verifies
    the stability and reliability of the communication network of the whole system.

    The Internet of things Technology has been applied in all aspects of daily life,
    including agriculture, industry, transportation, manufacturing, and medical treatment
    [1]. At present, the Internet of things has been promoting technological development
    in various fields. At present, in agriculture, the grain output can no longer
    meet the increasing needs of the population. If the irrigation methods in the
    agricultural field are not further improved, it will not only wastewater resources
    but also reduce the grain output [2]. Under the background of China''s Rural Revitalization
    Strategy, the research on the intelligent water resources management platform
    for precision irrigation agriculture based on Internet of Things technology for
    agricultural production technology can not only help the intelligent development
    of irrigation equipment in the agricultural field but also improve the efficiency
    of grain production and the quality and safety of agricultural products, and lay
    the foundation for agricultural modernisation [3, 4]. In the early stages, agriculture
    used sprinkler irrigation, drip irrigation, and other irrigation methods, but
    now it has gradually changed to automatic irrigation. At present, the technical
    content of the automatic irrigation management platform is relatively low, mainly
    from the basic growth factors of plants for data collection and information analysis,
    so as to realise precision irrigation [5]. However, this technology cannot meet
    the more accurate intelligent irrigation control system. It still needs to comprehensively
    consider plant growth information and environmental factors to further improve
    the content of science and technology [6]. According to a large number of experimental
    studies, it can be seen that in order to realise precision irrigation, we not
    only need to control water volume but also need to design all kinds of information
    in the process of plant growth and temperature and humidity in the environment
    in the system, so as to realise intelligent precision irrigation [7, 8]. Based
    on this, this paper realises automatic and intelligent irrigation through real-time
    collection of plant growth status, soil humidity, environmental temperature, and
    other information, and reasonable and timely irrigation according to the optimal
    water demand of plant growth [9]. The intelligent water resource management platform
    for precision irrigation agriculture designed in this paper can not only accurately
    control the amount of water but also sense the water shortage state of plant growth,
    collect information such as temperature and humidity in the soil and environment,
    regulate the amount of water based on the growth characteristics of plants, and
    finally realise automatic control. The system uses knowledge extraction and fuzzy
    logic methods in its mathematical model, so as to solve the problem of plant nitrogen
    fertiliser demand in the agricultural field. The literature also uses fuzzy decision
    support systems to study the development of the spatial surface of wheat. The
    input values are soil nutrients and farming time. After applying fuzzy logic,
    the input values are transformed into fuzzy values, and finally the fertiliser
    surface is generated. Based on wireless sensor networks, this paper constructs
    an intelligent control system for a vegetable greenhouse, which can monitor the
    environmental temperature, humidity, light, and other information parameters in
    real time, realise the intelligent cultivation and planting of vegetables, and
    reduce the management cost of the vegetable greenhouse at the same time. A new
    greenhouse temperature control system is designed in the literature. Finally,
    the comparison results of different control strategies are obtained. In the literature,
    a precise and intelligent agricultural monitoring system based on Internet of
    Things technology is designed. The system can represent the real-time monitored
    soil temperature and humidity and other information in the form of charts. When
    the soil water pressure reaches the critical value, it sends alarm information
    in the form of a mobile phone short message. The fuzzy logic system proposed in
    the literature can reduce fertiliser consumption and improve the productivity
    of agricultural products. The system analyses and makes decisions on air parameters
    and soil information and designs a cultivation programme for cultivated horticultural
    plants. 2 Related work With the improvement of intelligent automation of agricultural
    equipment, it can not only improve the production efficiency and quality safety
    of agricultural products, but also further solve the increasing demand for grain
    by the population. Therefore, continuously improving the technical content of
    agricultural equipment is an important factor in realising the modernisation of
    intelligent agriculture. The literature suggests that the Internet of things technology
    has been widely used in the agricultural field, which has greatly improved the
    equipment intelligence in the agricultural field [10]. However, the application
    of Internet of things technology is not mature enough in the current agricultural
    field, and there are many problems that need to be further solved, such as the
    high cost of equipment, low stability, intelligent automation, and room for improvement
    [11]. At present, more and more scholars at home and abroad have applied emerging
    technologies such as the Internet of things, fuzzy logic, and artificial intelligence
    to irrigation control systems. An agricultural intelligent irrigation controller
    has been developed in the literature, and the system has realised automatic judgement.
    The multi-channel irrigation system can monitor the soil temperature and humidity
    in real time according to different irrigation environment characteristics so
    that users can only control the multi-channel irrigation system at the same time
    [12]. Based on the soil humidity sensor, the literature can essentially collect
    the soil humidity data of plant roots, transmit the data to the controller, and
    compare it with the initially set value, so as to realise the accurate control
    of irrigation water volume. Experiments show that this irrigation method can help
    improve the yield and quality of agricultural products and realise automatic and
    accurate irrigation [13]. Based on the fuzzy logic method, this paper proposes
    an irrigation controller, solves the general problems and control model of the
    irrigation system, designs and constructs an irrigation control system with simple
    operation, and explains the advantages and characteristics of using fuzzy logic
    in the system [14]. The literature combines fuzzy decision support technology
    in the design of a specific nitrogen fertiliser implementation system [15]. The
    greenhouse uses geothermal energy as heating energy, adopts fuzzy logic control,
    artificial neural network control, and other technologies to accurately adjust
    the temperature in the greenhouse to the set temperature value, and carries out
    experimental simulation on different types of controllers [16]. 3 Internet of
    things technology 3.1 Basic principles According to the analysis of equipment
    applications in the field of agriculture, the composition structure of the Internet
    of things includes three parts: the information acquisition module, transmission
    module, and processing module. Among them, the equipment for collecting information
    in the front section is generally a sensor device, GPS positioning device, infrared
    sensor, laser scanner, and RFD device. Information transmission equipment is the
    equipment that transmits all the information collected by the front-end information
    collection equipment to the back-end information processing equipment. The commonly
    used information transmission technologies include modbus, ZigBee, Lora, 3G, 4G,
    and GPRS. Information processing equipment generally refers to various remote-control
    platforms based on different working environments. Users can control and process
    information through the platform. PID control controls the relevant objects by
    adjusting the parameters of proportion, integral, and differential. The characteristics
    of the controlled objects determine the parameters of the PID controller. The
    controller system has the characteristics of simple structure, easy operation,
    high stability, and simple adjustment of parameters. The control system has two
    components: a PID controller and a controlled object. Its principle is to subtract
    the given value R (T) from the output response y (T) to calculate the error, then
    adjust the parameters through the PID controller to obtain the control quantity,
    which is used for the controlled object, and finally output feedback information
    to continuously eliminate the error. According to the structure of the three parts
    of the PID controller, the control quantity u(t) can be calculated as follows:
    $$ u\\left( t \\right) = K_{p} \\left( {e\\left( t \\right) + \\frac{1}{{T_{i}
    }}\\mathop \\int \\limits_{0}^{t} e\\left( t \\right){\\text{d}}t + T_{d} \\frac{{{\\text{d}}e\\left(
    t \\right)}}{{{\\text{d}}t}}} \\right) $$ (1) The transfer function corresponding
    to the PID controller is: $$ D\\left( s \\right) = \\frac{U\\left( s \\right)}{{E\\left(
    s \\right)}} = K_{p} \\left( {1 + \\frac{1}{{T_{i} s}} + T_{D} s} \\right) $$
    (2) To realise control through PID, it is necessary to adjust the three parameters
    of proportion, differentiation, and integration. Because the sampling time of
    the system is very short, it is necessary to discretize the analogue PID into
    a difference equation. The discretised digital PID has two forms: position type
    and incremental type. For the convenience of calculating the position Eq. (1),
    the following difference equation can be taken: $$ \\mathop \\int \\limits_{0}^{t}
    e\\left( t \\right)dt \\approx \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i}^{k} Te\\left( i \\right)
    $$ (3) $$ \\frac{{{\\text{d}}e\\left( t \\right)}}{{{\\text{d}}t}} \\approx \\frac{{e\\left(
    k \\right) - e\\left( {k - 1} \\right)}}{T} $$ (4) where, T is the sampling period;
    k is the sampling sequence number. From Eqs. (1), (3) and (4), the digital PID
    position control formula is: $$ u\\left( k \\right) = K_{p} \\left[ {e\\left(
    k \\right) + \\frac{T}{{T_{i} }}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 0}^{k} e\\left( i
    \\right) + T_{d} \\frac{{e\\left( k \\right) - e\\left( {k - 1} \\right)}}{T}}
    \\right] $$ (5) The position control algorithm is not simple. It not only takes
    up a lot of memory space but also has very complex programming. Therefore, Eq.
    (5) is further improved to obtain the expression of u (k-1): $$ u\\left( {k -
    1} \\right) = K_{p} \\left[ {e\\left( {k - 1} \\right) + \\frac{T}{{T_{i} }}\\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 0}^{k - 1} e\\left( i \\right) + T_{d} \\frac{{e\\left( k
    \\right) - e\\left( {k - 2} \\right)}}{T}} \\right] $$ (6) The digital PID incremental
    control formula is: $$ \\Delta u\\left( k \\right) = u\\left( k \\right) - u\\left(
    {k - 1} \\right) = K_{p} \\left[ {e\\left( k \\right) - e\\left( {k - 1} \\right)}
    \\right] + K_{i} e\\left( k \\right) + K_{d} \\left[ {e\\left( k \\right) - 2e\\left(
    {k - 1} \\right) + e\\left( {k - 2} \\right)} \\right] $$ (7) 3.2 Data analysis
    method 3.2.1 Soil moisture data processing Temperature and humidity sensors are
    installed in the experimental area to obtain the soil temperature and humidity
    data in the experimental environment. Through the processing of the collected
    soil temperature and humidity data, it can be obtained that the soil temperature
    and humidity show the characteristics of heterogeneity and continuity in spatial
    distribution. In this paper, the experimental area is divided by the K-means clustering
    algorithm, which continuously updates the value of each clustering centre through
    iterative calculation until the optimal clustering analysis result is obtained.
    The main calculation methods are initialisation, allocation, correction, and calculation
    deviation. The deviation of each cluster state is calculated according to formula
    (8): $$ D = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\left[ {\\min_{{r = 1, \\ldots
    ,k^{{d\\left( {x_{i} ,c_{r} } \\right)^{2} }} }} } \\right] $$ (8) Finally, convergence
    is tested. If the D value converges, the termination algorithm is returned to
    complete the division. Otherwise, return to reassignment. When the heterogeneity
    of soil temperature and humidity in local areas is small, it shows that the soil
    temperature and humidity in the measurement area are highly consistent, and the
    sampling points can be reduced accordingly. On the contrary, more sampling points
    should be arranged in this area. Calculate the number of sampling points for soil
    temperature and humidity in the measurement area and obtain the optimised number
    of sampling points. The calculation formula for Ni is as follows: $$ N_{i} = \\left[
    {\\frac{{t_{i} CV_{i} }}{D}} \\right]^{2} $$ (9) After completing the optimization
    of the number of sampling points in the measurement area, determine the deployment
    strategy of sampling points in each measurement area. Starting from the centre
    point (0, interval: $$ \\alpha = 360^{^\\circ } /\\left( {n - 1} \\right) $$ (10)
    However, this calculation method is not applicable to the case where there are
    fewer than 4 sampling points. Therefore, this study follows the principle of maximum
    regional coverage, and the layout method of sampling points is as follows: When
    the number of sampling points is 1, the sampling point is placed at the centre
    point 0; When the number of sampling points is 2, the sampling points are arranged
    at both ends of the longest line segment in the measurement area, and the distance
    between the sampling points and the centre point is equal; When the number of
    sampling points is 3, the centre point of the measurement area is removed and
    no sampling point is set; Other sampling points continue to be set according to
    the above method. 3.2.2 Crop growth information analysis Through the spatial image
    enhancement technology, this paper analyses the pixels in the image. That is,
    according to the grey mapping transformation of the image, the spatial image enhancement
    method formula is as follows: $$ g\\left( {x,y} \\right) = T\\left[ {f\\left(
    {x,y} \\right)} \\right] $$ (11) Two cameras are used to collect information about
    crop growth, including height and diameter. The three-dimensional information
    of the crop is obtained by correcting the data image, stereo matching, and three-dimensional
    reconstruction. The measurement of crop height is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Stereoscopic
    measurement of crop height Full size image In the stereo vision monitoring system,
    the optical axes of the two cameras are parallel to each other, perpendicular
    to the binocular baseline, and have the same focal length at the same time. At
    this time, the horizontal coordinate difference (i.e. parallax) of the projection
    points in the images taken by the two cameras is: $$ d = x_{L} - x_{R} $$ (12)
    Then the distance L from the binocular baseline to the highest point P of the
    crop can be calculated according to the triangulation principle. $$ L = \\frac{wf}{{x_{L}
    - x_{R} }} = \\frac{wf}{d} $$ (13) Based on the crop growth data from digital
    image analysis, combined with the crop growth model, the crop water shortage index
    is: $$ N = \\left( {1 - \\frac{{L^{\\prime } }}{L}} \\right)\\frac{{H_{0} + p
    - E_{c} - C}}{{H_{z} }}\\frac{{T_{S} T_{e} }}{{H_{e} }} $$ (14) 3.2.3 Soil temperature
    and humidity control algorithm Compressed sensing is a method that mainly depends
    on the sparse characteristics of data and the low rank characteristics of original
    data. Under the condition of less than a certain sampling rate, it can reconstruct
    the original signal by obtaining a small number of discrete signal samples and
    using a nonlinear reconstruction algorithm. The compressed sensing equation is
    as follows: $$ y = \\Phi_{X} = \\Phi \\Psi_{S} $$ (15) S is a sparse vector and:
    $$ \\left\\| s \\right\\|_{0} = K $$ (16) Although the change in soil temperature
    and humidity is basically continuous, when the soil temperature and humidity are
    measured at intervals, the measured soil temperature and humidity will be a series
    of discrete data points. Therefore, we abstract the measurement of soil temperature
    and humidity into a discrete model. Real data sequence: $$ T = \\left\\{ {t_{i}
    } \\right\\} $$ (17) $$ H = \\left\\{ {h_{i} } \\right\\} $$ (18) According to
    the data reconstruction method R, the reconstructed complete data sequence is
    generated: $$ TR = \\left\\{ {tr_{1} ,tr_{2} , \\ldots ,tr_{N} } \\right\\} $$
    (19) $$ HR = \\left\\{ {hr_{1} ,hr_{2} , \\ldots ,hr_{N} } \\right\\} $$ (20)
    The smaller the difference between the reconstructed and original data sequences,
    the better, and the number of measurements in the measurement control scheme must
    not exceed the set threshold. $$ \\min _{{S,R}} {\\text{Error}}\\left( {\\left\\langle
    {TR,HR} \\right\\rangle ,\\left\\langle {T,H} \\right\\rangle } \\right),s.t.n/N
    \\le \\alpha $$ (21) 3.3 Irrigation strategy design The precision irrigation water
    resources management platform adopts fuzzy control logic to control the irrigation
    time based on the collected ambient temperature and humidity and soil humidity.
    The structure of the fuzzy controller is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Structure of
    fuzzy controller Full size image The fuzzy control system converts the accurate
    variables into fuzzy variables of different levels, converts the accurate quantity
    x into the fuzzy quantity y in the [−4,4] interval, and takes it as an integer
    to obtain the corresponding levels of soil humidity E and air temperature T: $$
    y = \\frac{2n}{{b - a}}\\left( {x - \\frac{a + b}{2}} \\right) $$ (22) Among them,
    a is the maximum value of accurate variables, b is the minimum value of accurate
    variables, x is the accurate variables to be converted in the system, y is the
    fuzzy variable after the conversion, and n is the upper or lower limit of the
    fuzzy variable. The input variables of the precision irrigation system are soil
    humidity E and air temperature T, and the output variable target irrigation humidity
    uses a triangular membership function. The fuzzy control rules are shown in Table
    1. Table 1 Fuzzy control rules Full size table The system uses a PID algorithm
    to control soil humidity. With the precision irrigation water resources management
    platform, the soil humidity is kept in the best range for crop growth over a long
    period of time, and the parameters are changed quickly to respond to weather data
    and other information. This is how precision irrigation is done. $$ U\\left( t
    \\right) = K_{p} \\left( {{\\text{err}}\\left( t \\right) + \\frac{1}{{T_{I} }}\\int
    {\\text{err}}\\left( t \\right){\\text{d}}t + \\frac{{T_{D} {\\text{derr}}\\left(
    t \\right)}}{{{\\text{d}}t}}} \\right) $$ (23) $$ U\\left( k \\right) = K_{p}
    \\left( {{\\text{err}}\\left( k \\right) + \\frac{T}{{T_{i} }}\\sum {\\text{err}}\\left(
    j \\right) + \\frac{{T_{D} }}{T}\\left( {{\\text{err}}\\left( k \\right) - {\\text{err}}\\left(
    {k - 1} \\right)} \\right)} \\right) $$ (24) In addition to using the differential
    coefficient, the PID controller also needs to pay attention to the possibility
    of feedback transmission delay. The differential coefficient can eliminate or
    reduce the influence of the delay of the control object so as to improve the stability
    of the control system. The specific formula is as follows: $$ \\Delta u\\left(
    t \\right) = K_{p} \\left( {{\\text{err}}\\left( k \\right) - {\\text{err}}\\left(
    {k - 1} \\right)} \\right) + k_{i} {\\text{err}}\\left( k \\right) + k_{d} \\left(
    {{\\text{err}}\\left( k \\right) - 2{\\text{err}}\\left( {k - 1} \\right) + {\\text{err}}\\left(
    {k - 2} \\right)} \\right) $$ (25) The precision irrigation water resources management
    platform designed in this paper improves the calculation accuracy of integration
    by using trapezoidal integration instead of rectangular integration in order to
    reduce the integral residual error of the PID controller: $$ \\mathop \\int \\limits_{0}^{t}
    e\\left( t \\right){\\text{d}}t = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 0}^{i} \\frac{{e\\left(
    i \\right) + e\\left( {i - 1} \\right)}}{2}T $$ (26) 4 Design of intelligent water
    resources management platform for precision irrigation agriculture 4.1 Demand
    analysis of management platform The management platform needs to realise precision
    irrigation, collect real-time soil humidity, ambient temperature, and other information,
    and transmit it to the control software in real time through the Internet of things.
    Users can view it in real time through the software on their computer or mobile
    phone. The wireless node of the management platform can automatically open or
    close the solenoid valve according to the preset value to control the irrigation
    time. The control software on the computer or mobile phone can record the soil
    humidity and ambient temperature in the irrigation area. The software can automatically
    and accurately irrigate through manual operation or according to the growth characteristics
    of plants. The equipment''s power supply uses solar energy to prevent inconvenient
    power consumption in the field or reduce the damage to the built irrigation area.
    The platform should be designed according to the following four principles. First,
    it should be able to detect the soil moisture in the crop growth environment in
    real time and achieve accurate data; Second, it is convenient and practical to
    meet the needs of users as much as possible. After simple learning, you can operate
    skillfully, and the platform software should not be too complex. Third, the equipment
    is flexible. The platform can carry out precision irrigation independently of
    manual operation. At the same time, it should also realise independent maintenance
    and detection, so as to reduce the workload of later maintenance as much as possible.
    Fourth, the equipment cost is low. Only if the cost of the equipment goes down
    can the marketing reach be wide and the application be used by many people. 4.2
    Function module design of management platform 4.2.1 Data sensing module The system
    can access more than eight kinds of sensor devices. The data sensing module is
    mainly the sensor for data acquisition of soil and environmental temperature and
    humidity. It can realise the environmental information acquisition of real-time
    detection irrigation areas and ensure the accuracy of data. The module is the
    basic component of the whole water resources management platform. It works by
    taking an accurate sample of the soil and the surrounding environment and turning
    that sample into the original electrical signal. 4.2.2 Communication transmission
    module The working principle of the module is to transmit the data information
    collected by the data sensing module to the data server wirelessly through a certain
    transmission protocol. The server side is provided with a data receiving programme
    and a data analysing program. The data transmission communication of the module
    is mainly realised through the communication processor. By working with the data
    sensing module, the module sends the data it has collected and gives the central
    processing module basic data. 4.2.3 Central processing module The module consists
    of two parts: data analysis and data processing. The data analysis is mainly to
    analyse the plant growth information and water shortage. This management platform
    mainly adopts image acquisition, image preprocessing, feature extraction, analysis,
    processing, and other technologies when analysing plant growth information. When
    evaluating the water shortage of plants, it is mainly through the dynamic monitoring
    of water, combined with the plant growth information, and compared with the expected
    values of plant height and diameter in different growth periods, analysing the
    actual plant height and diameter data, and finally determining the water shortage
    of plants. The data processing function is mainly to complete the sending and
    receiving of multi-channel remote environment data and data storage. At the same
    time, it can carry out signal feedback to remote-control equipment and interact
    with users. Furthermore, daily operation and maintenance tasks such as data backup
    and data cleaning of the management platform must be completed. In actual use,
    the module must make it possible for different modules to work together and for
    data to be processed in parallel, as well as manage the data resources through
    the central database. 4.2.4 Mechanical control module The working principle of
    the module is to receive various instructions from the central processing module
    and complete the execution so as to control the switch of the relay, close or
    open the corresponding solenoid valve, and realise accurate irrigation. According
    to the set workflow, when the mechanical control module receives the instruction
    from the central processing module, it will automatically process the data information
    collected by the data sensing module, summarise and analyse the data. If the collected
    value is smaller than the preset value in the platform, the module will send a
    closing instruction to the relay to start irrigation of the plants. The type of
    soil, the type of plants, and the temperature and humidity of the environment
    will directly affect the irrigation. So, the time and frequency of watering that
    this module controls are not certain, and the exact data can be found by using
    the algorithm model above. 5 Hardware and software design of management platform
    5.1 Hardware design The hardware structure of intelligent water resources management
    platform mainly includes the following parts, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 System
    hardware structure Full size image The control centre chip of the management platform
    selects the single chip microcomputer of the stc15f2k60s2 model. In addition,
    the data processing module of the platform uses the MSP430 chip, which is the
    core chip. It can not only convert the temperature and humidity detected by the
    data sensing module into voltage signal and then into digital signal output, but
    also send the signal to the transmission control module by the wireless module.
    The mechanical control module can perform data analysis according to the actual
    needs of plants and then drive the solenoid valve to control irrigation. This
    workflow greatly reduces the functional consumption of the management platform.
    In addition, the display module is a 320 * 240 large LCD, which can display data
    such as soil and environmental temperature and humidity in real time. 5.2 Software
    design The wireless transmission module needs to be initialised. The specific
    operation modes are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Main operation modes Full size table
    After receiving the command from the central bus, each acquisition module can
    immediately transmit the data to the central bus as a single data acquisition
    module. After data acquisition, the acquisition equipment will respond to the
    data according to its own address and finally store it in the central processor.
    This working mechanism can ensure unified data collection and sequential query
    response. In order to further improve the accuracy of command sending and receiving
    and data transmission and storage on the bus, a CRC verification mechanism is
    introduced in this paper. By constructing the CRC calculation data model, the
    acquisition equipment can verify the signal sent by the central end and feedback
    the verification results to the central end to complete the data comparison. If
    the comparison result is correct, continue to forward the instructions; if the
    comparison result is wrong, resend the instructions. This mechanism can ensure
    the accuracy of data communication on the bus. After many experiments, it can
    be obtained that the time required for humidity data acquisition and signal conversion
    of one soil humidity sensor SM3002B is about 600 ms, and the time required for
    bus transmission is about 200 ms. One temperature and humidity sensor SHT30 takes
    about 20 ms for temperature and humidity acquisition and signal conversion, and
    about 5 ms for bus transmission. In order to verify the superiority of the data
    processing mechanism, this experiment compares the soil humidity sensor SM3002B
    and the air temperature and humidity sensor SHT30 with different acquisition methods.
    The acquisition methods are the single bus acquisition method and the 485-bus
    acquisition method. The response time results of temperature and humidity sensors
    under different acquisition methods are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Response time
    of temperature and humidity sensor under different acquisition modes Full size
    table The response time results of soil moisture sensor under different acquisition
    methods are shown in Table 4. Table 4 Response time of soil moisture sensor under
    different acquisition methods Full size table From Tables 2, 3 and 4, it can be
    concluded that the single bus acquisition mode and digital bus data processing
    achieve the goal of shortening the measurement and control time of the acquisition
    equipment, which will ensure that the precision irrigation system can complete
    large-scale environmental parameter acquisition in a short time and further improve
    the work efficiency and the measurement and control efficiency of the irrigation
    system. 5.3 System test and analysis The circuit of the acquisition system is
    simulated, in which the voltage and water pressure can directly affect the stability
    of the irrigation system. Since water pressure and voltage are the most prone
    to potential safety hazards, strict monitoring and accurate control should be
    carried out. In practical application, this experiment adopts the method of parallel
    potentiometer, which can achieve the best matching degree of the resistance at
    both ends of the optocoupler, and the current limiting resistance will also show
    the best effect. At the same time, it can also fine tune the voltage in a complex
    environment so as to achieve the demand value during agricultural irrigation,
    and the voltage regulation will not be affected by factors such as ambient temperature
    or mechanical equipment. The sampling resistance value is a high-precision resistance
    of 100 ohms. Adjust the potentiometer to R47 = 75 K. After inputting the current
    and voltage, the specific data are shown in Table 5. Table 5 AD acquisition input
    and output Full size table A multi-hop network experiment is designed in order
    to verify whether the irrigation system communication network of the management
    platform is stable. Compared with point-to-point transmission and communication
    networks, the reliability of wireless transmission networks is relatively low
    and prone to failure. The main reason is that when a node of one link in multiple
    network communication fails, the whole link cannot transmit signals normally.
    However, in the point-to-point communication network, even if a node fails, it
    will not have a great impact on the whole communication system, and the error
    rate is low. In addition, the internal timer arranges the task sequence of each
    node. When the coordinator receives data from multiple nodes at the same time,
    it is very easy to cause the problem that some lines cannot communicate. Therefore,
    in order to solve this problem, this experiment sets different start-up times
    for each node. If the node sends data at different times, it can avoid the phenomenon
    of data loss caused by a node''s having received multiple signals. This experiment
    is divided into two groups to measure the relationships between the success rate
    and distance of each point in a multi-hop network, and the relationship between
    communication distance and RSS I value. Firstly, randomly select a coordinator
    node and five router nodes, arrange all nodes in a straight line according to
    the word \"one\", and the distance between each node is 100 m. Measure the RSSI
    number of all nodes and the number of data frames received within the specified
    time. Among them, the measurement results of the success rate and distance of
    each point in the multi-hop network are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Relationship between
    success rate and distance of each point in multi-hop network Full size image The
    relationship between multi-hop network communication distance and RSSI value is
    shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Relationship between multi-hop network communication distance
    and RSSI value Full size image It is shown in Figs. 4 and 5 that the longer the
    link length, the lower the communication quality of the communication network;
    that is, the link length is inversely proportional to the network communication
    quality. If there are more and more nodes in the communication network, the burden
    of the network will increase, which will lead to a decline in the communication
    quality of the network. From another perspective, reducing the number of nodes
    as much as possible can improve the quality of network communication, but it will
    also reduce the coverage. 6 Conclusion Intelligent agriculture is developing more
    and more rapidly, and the Internet of things is becoming more and more widely
    used in the field of agriculture. In order to further improve the yield and quality
    of crops and to solve the food demand caused by the increase in the population,
    this paper designs an intelligent agricultural management platform for precision
    irrigation based on the Internet of Things technology. Firstly, the basic principles
    of Internet of things technology and PID control algorithms are introduced, and
    the algorithm models of soil moisture data processing, crop growth information
    analysis, and soil temperature and humidity data control are constructed. Then
    it analyses the design requirements of the management platform, introduces the
    composition and structure of the management platform, including data sensing modules,
    data communication modules, central processing modules, and mechanical control
    modules, and introduces the working principle of each module. The management platform''s
    hardware and software structures are designed, the temperature and humidity acquisition
    mode are tested, and it is confirmed that the CRC verification mechanism can ensure
    the accuracy of data communication on the bus. Finally, a multi-hop network experiment
    is designed to verify whether the communication network is stable, and the relationship
    between link length and communication quality is analysed, which provides a theoretical
    basis for the development of intelligent agriculture. Data availability The data

    agriculture has always played a “cornerstone” role. However, due to the industrial
    structure, agriculture has the problem of low industrial efficiency. Blockchain
    technology has a very good role in promoting the high-quality development of agriculture.
    Moreover, the current agricultural industry and social structure have obvious
    characteristics of weak centralization and decentralization. This fits well with
    the characteristics of the blockchain, and it also has application integration
    points. Therefore, the blockchain will be used as a crucial factor to lead the
    reform and development of agriculture [ 1]. Poverty alleviation work is imperative,
    but there are still a series of problems that need to be resolved before poverty
    alleviation is truly achieved. How to “accurately identify“ the impoverished population,
    avoid poverty alleviation that varies from person to person, how to trace the
    flow of poverty alleviation funds, how to build data sharing, and a unified poverty
    alleviation management system are all the issues that need to be solved urgently.
    In the end, we discovered in research and practice that blockchain technology
    occupies the advantages of real-time data processing and monitoring, and decentralization
    in the process of precise poverty alleviation. The emergence of blockchain technology
    will provide new ideas for global technological innovation. Regarding wireless
    communication networks, blockchain, and agricultural poverty alleviation, there
    have been many related studies at home and abroad. Lee et al. proposed a novel
    framework for computing using wireless mobile miners (MMs) in blockchain systems.
    Emulation results validate the analysis and derivation and show that using a larger
    number of MMs can reduce energy expenditure by up to 95% compared to a blockchain
    system with a single MM [ 2]. Wei H analyzed the key factors that affect the efficiency
    of the blockchain. Wei H considers this problem from a communication perspective.
    In particular, Wei et al. proposed a coordinated satellite ground network to create
    an efficient blockchain [ 3]. Guo et al. proposed a blockchain-based mobile edge
    computing (B-MEC) framework for adaptive resource allocation and computing offloading
    in future wireless networks. Among them, the blockchain serves as an overlay system
    to provide management and control functions [ 4]. Lee J H discusses how blockchain
    will revolutionize the consumer electronic market. Lee and Pilkington analyzed
    the current winds of change in the booming global consumer electronic (CE) industry
    worth billions of dollars. Lee J H finally pointed out that blockchain technology
    has the ability to make the CE industry a more transparent, safer, and more honest
    place [ 5]. Yeoh aims to study the major regulatory challenges affecting blockchain
    and innovative distributed technologies in the European Union (EU) and the United
    States. The survey results (intelligent regulatory noninterference methods adopted
    by the European Union and the United States) to a large extent predict the future
    innovative contribution of blockchain in financial services and related fields
    and the enhancement of financial inclusion [ 6]. Khaqqi et al. proposed a new
    ETS model customized for Industry 4.0 integration. The case study shows the internal
    workings of a reputation-based trading system, where reputation represents the
    performance of participants and their commitment to emission reduction [ 7]. The
    data of these studies are not perfect, and the experimental conclusions are not
    applicable to some basic and important fields such as agriculture and the internet
    of things, so they cannot be accepted and adopted by the public. The innovation
    of this study is that the technical characteristics of the blockchain are very
    compatible with the needs of poverty alleviation and alleviation in the agricultural
    field. Blockchain not only provides a good technical support platform for the
    development of the agricultural field but also solves many problems that exist
    in agricultural poverty alleviation today, such as “precise identification” of
    the poor, fund traceability, data security, and other issues. The agricultural
    platform formed by combining blockchain technology and wireless network technology
    can not only promote the improvement of agricultural industry efficiency but also
    achieve effective and accurate poverty alleviation. It provides a series of guarantees
    for people who are out of poverty and truly achieves “precise poverty alleviation.”
    2. Wireless Communication Network and Blockchain This study involves blockchain
    and wireless communication networks. The specific overall model of the blockchain-based
    precision poverty alleviation innovation mechanism is shown in Figure 1. The next
    experimental process will be carried out according to the model, mainly analyzing
    the core of blockchain technology, such as technical framework, asymmetric encryption,
    and consensus mechanism. [ 8– 10].    Figure 1  Overall model of blockchain-based
    innovation mechanism for precise poverty alleviation. 2.1. Blockchain Blockchain
    technology cannot be separated from algorithms, and the more important algorithms
    are symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption, and this study applies to
    elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) in asymmetric encryption. What follows is an
    introduction to asymmetric encryption and digital signatures. 2.1.1. Asymmetric
    Encryption and Digital Signature Asymmetric encryption means that the key used
    by the sender to encrypt the data does not need to be kept secret, while the key
    used by the receiver to decrypt the data cannot be disclosed, i.e., both parties
    use two different keys. If asymmetric encryption is used to encrypt the key of
    symmetric encryption, the key of symmetric encryption can achieve secure transmission.
    The equation of the elliptic curve encryption algorithm in the asymmetric encryption
    algorithm is as follows [ 11– 13]: An elliptic graph based on the graph of a limited
    domain GF (p) is a set of sites (x, y) determined by the equations. The arc equation
    of the elliptic curve is as follows: with p being a prime with s > 3 and a, b,
    x, and y depending on GF (p) fulfilling the following: The creation of the double
    key K in the elliptic curve method depends on the base is dependent on the base
    point G (multiplying G and the order n gives the infinity point O, the unit circle):
    the value of K is less than n: Public key encryption [ 14]: where t is any number,
    W represents the message, and C is the ciphertext. Private key decryption [ 15]:
    The elliptic curve encryption algorithm applied to the blockchain must be discretized,
    so the elliptic curve equation that is actually applied is as follows: The details
    of the contracting process are as follows: (1) An integer i from 1 to n – 1 is
    randomly selected. (2) According to the elliptic curve multiplication rule, the
    following is calculated (3) Calculation (4) Computing the hash of the information
    M, H. HASH is a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-2 [ 16]. (5) The left-most
    Ln bits of H are taken and marked as h, where Ln is the binary bit length of the
    sequence n [ 17]. (6) Calculation (n is the order), if s = = 0, go back to step
    1. (7) S = (r, s) is the signature. (8) Private key signature: The specific verification
    process of the signature is as follows: (1) Whether the r and s of the signature
    are both in the interval [1, n − 1] must be verified. (2) Similarly, the original
    message must be calculated. (3) Order (4) Order And, (5) A point on the curve
    is calculated. (6) If It means that the signature is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
    Public key verification: Let it be compared with tG, if they are equal, and the
    signature verification is successful [ 18]. The principle is as follows: 2.1.2.
    Blockchain Technology Architecture As a highly dynamic and innovative technical
    architecture, the blockchain has developed to this day. Most blockchain-based
    application systems have the characteristics of decentralization, distribution,
    free reciprocity, retrospective anti-counterfeiting, and legal execution. These
    characteristics extend from the connotation of the blockchain to the extension
    and complement each other [ 19, 20]. Blockchain technology establishes a safe
    and reliable database and establishes a trust mechanism for transaction parties
    through a perfect asymmetric encryption mathematical solution. Specific verification
    mechanisms and smart contracts and other protocols make the blockchain possible
    to be applied to actual transactions [ 21, 22]. The main features of blockchain
    are as follows: (1) Distributed Bookkeeping. Multiple participants collectively
    check and maintain the data. (2) Traceability. The data recorded using blockchain
    technology can be effectively accessed and traced for a long time. (3) Untamperable.
    The data cannot be tampered with during the process of transmission and storage
    to ensure the permanent preservation of data. (4) Consensus Mechanism. The consistency
    of data interaction and process makes it a consensus mechanism. According to the
    degree of openness, blockchain can be divided into three types: public chain,
    consortium chain, and private chain [ 23, 24]. The comparison table of the three
    blockchains is shown in Table 1. Table 1  Comparison of three types of blockchains.
    The public chain establishes a trust mechanism through cryptography, such as bitcoin.
    Only the chain with the largest workload and that is longest will be recognized
    and linked to the previous chain [ 25]. In the shared blockchain system, anyone
    can freely enter and exit, and there are corresponding incentive mechanisms to
    encourage people to participate, such as bitcoin. When people mine, there will
    be bitcoin rewards. Consortium chain is a new model extended from public blockchain
    [ 26, 27]. The alliance chain is multicentralized, that is, each node participating
    in the alliance is the center of the alliance chain. Compared with the public
    chain, it has the advantages of high efficiency, cost optimization, and strong
    adaptability, such as the R3 Banking Union formed by many internationally renowned
    banks [ 28]. The private chain is a fully private blockchain where write access
    is controlled by only one single entity. This is because an institution does not
    need to exchange information with other institutions and is only based on the
    blockchain system that it needs to establish, such as the Deloitte audit blockchain.
    Compared with other chains, the private chain has the characteristics of self-endorsement
    and complete centralization. It guarantees the transparency and traceability of
    institutional data, and the operation of the private chain does not require an
    incentive mechanism [ 29]. The blockchain technology system framework is composed
    of the data layer, network layer, consensus layer, incentive layer, contract layer,
    and application layer from bottom to top, as shown in Figure 2:    Figure 2  Schematic
    diagram of the blockchain technology system. Block is the core unit of blockchain
    [ 30]. Blockchain is formed by interconnecting blocks. The nodes participating
    in the system generate and record the transaction data of the system over a period
    of time into blocks by cryptographic methods. Each data block contains not only
    the data but also a block header that records the block meta-information, which
    contains information such as the block hash and the previous block hash, thus
    linking the blocks together. The schematic diagram of the blockchain data structure
    is shown in Figure 3:    Figure 3  Schematic diagram of blockchain data structure.
    Figure 4 shows a schematic of storing data in chunk leaders in the form of Merkle
    roots.    Figure 4  Schematic diagram of storing the data in the block header
    in the form of Merkle root. Merkle tree is also known as the hash tree, which
    is a tree constructed based on hash data. Merkle tree is represented as a binary
    tree in the blockchain. First, the hash value of each transaction is calculated
    to get Hash1, Hash2, Hash3, and Hash4, and then, Hash1, Hash2, Hash3, and Hash4
    are combined into one string, respectively. To get the subhash, Hash12 and Hash34
    are calculated, then Hash12 and Hash34 are combined to calculate the hash, and
    it is pushed up to get the Merkle Root. To verify whether the two pieces of data
    are consistent, it only needs to compare whether the Merkle roots of the two pieces
    of data are consistent. If they are the same, it means that the two pieces of
    data are the same; otherwise, it can look down from the root of the tree where
    the data have changed. Using the Merkle tree in the blockchain can record all
    transaction information. This transaction information is related to each other,
    and any modification of transaction information will affect the change of Merkle
    root, thereby effectively preventing information tampering. The performance comparison
    table of the SHA family algorithm in the hash algorithm is shown in Table 2. Table
    2  SHA family algorithm performance comparison. 2.1.3. P2P Network P2P network
    is also one of the key technologies in the blockchain. Each node in the P2P network
    mainly uses sockets for network communication programming. P2P network models
    are mainly divided into the following types, centralized, purely distributed,
    hybrid, and structured P2P networks. The centralized structure is simple and easy
    to implement. The purely distributed structure, as the name implies, removes the
    central node and randomly establishes a network between nodes in the P2P network.
    In this way, there will be no problems such as poor scalability and a single point
    of failure in a centralized network. However, it also has problems such as flooding
    circulation and response to storms in the process of message dissemination. A
    hybrid network is actually a hybrid of a collective network and a purely distributed
    network. The bitcoin network also currently uses a hybrid network. The random
    distribution of nodes in a structured network is different from a pure distributed
    network. It is distributed according to a certain structure, such as forming a
    tree network or a mesh network. At present, structured networks are basically
    constructed based on the idea of distributed hash tables. It was mentioned that
    the bitcoin network is composed of hybrid P2P. Each node in it contains the function
    of routing. However, not every node includes functions such as wallet, mining,
    and storage of blockchain data. Among them, the node containing the complete transaction
    data of the blockchain is called the master node. In addition, nodes that store
    part of the data in the blockchain database become light nodes. A schematic diagram
    of the P2P network architecture is shown in Figure 5. P2P networks can provide
    higher security than the traditional client-server model. A large number of distributed
    nodes on the blockchain makes them virtually immune to denial-of-service (DoS)
    attacks.    Figure 5  P2P network architecture. 2.1.4. Consensus Mechanism At
    present, there are mainly the following types of consensus mechanisms: PoW, PoS,
    DPoS, and PBFT. The existing consensus mechanism will be introduced in detail.
    The proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism is the main mechanism, and the computing power
    of the system is provided by each node. Through the competition mechanism, nodes
    with strong computing power are more likely to be rewarded by the system. In bitcoin,
    miners calculate the SHA-256 hash value twice in the block header to find a random
    value that matches the target. If successfully found, the miner releases the block
    it packs, retrieves, verifies other nodes, and sends it to another block account.
    The advantage of PoW is that nodes can freely enter and exit, allowing more users
    to participate in mining and improving system stability. The downside is that
    it consumes more energy and more electricity. As the cost of mining increases,
    more miners leave the system, and the lack of computing power directly affects
    the security of the system. The essence of PoW is that other nodes coordinate
    the content of the chain by calculating the hash value to match its attributes
    to obtain account permissions and add transmission information to the blockchain.
    Although POW can align the nodes in the bitcoin system, this method wastes a lot
    of energy and computing power and is inefficient. To support the continuous operation
    of the chain, the potential “51% attack” risk is that some nodes may obtain more
    than 51% of the computing power. It is more likely to obtain accounting rights
    than other nodes, thus threatening the normal process of bitcoin transactions.
    Proof-of-stake (POS) mechanism does not require computing power to mine. The PoS
    mechanism introduced the concept of “coin age” for the first time. Whoever owns
    the older the currency, the greater the probability of who gets the right to bookkeeping.
    By keeping the blockchain product client online, users will be able to obtain
    additional currency. The PoS mechanism is relatively energy efficient and does
    not need to spend a lot of electricity and energy. Proof of stake is a voting
    mechanism. Compared with the excessive waste of computing resources in the PoW
    consensus mechanism, the PoS consensus algorithm only needs to perform a small
    amount of calculations to ensure the normal operation of the blockchain. Its advantage
    is energy saving, and it is more decentralized than the PoW consensus mechanism,
    saving a lot of computing resources. But at the same time, because of its nature,
    it is still mining, which cannot be commercially used. The comparison between
    PoW and PoS consensus mechanism is shown in Table 3. Table 3  Comparison of PoW
    and PoS consensus mechanisms. A raft cluster typically contains five server nodes,
    which allow two nodes to simultaneously crash. Server nodes have three states:
    leader, follower, and candidate. There is only one leader in a term, and the leader
    is responsible for handling all customer requests. DPoS first appeared in BitShares.
    Shareholders vote for a certain number of trusted accounts based on the percentage
    of the number of cryptocurrencies they own, and the trusted accounts generate
    blocks in order. If the block cannot be generated within a given time, then the
    accounting right will be transferred to the next person. Shareholders can vote
    to replace these trusted accounts at any time. If these accounts gain illegal
    benefits or have unstable computing power, they will be kicked out of the system
    and other representatives will replace them. The DPoS mechanism makes transaction
    confirmation and verification faster. However, blockchain products based on the
    DPoS mechanism will have the problem that shareholders are not motivated to vote.
    PBFT is suitable for application scenarios where consensus needs to be reached
    when there are byzantine nodes (faulty nodes) in a distributed system. Assuming
    that there are at most f byzantine nodes, when the total number of nodes N is
    greater than or equal to 3f + 1, PBFT can still maintain the consistency of information.
    PBFT is used in alliance chains or private chains where byzantine nodes exist.
    The byzantine problem mainly involves consistency and correctness, and each node
    of the blockchain is not able to globally obtain unique data from that centralized
    object, and to ensure the consistency of data across the network; then, the whole
    system must have a unified protocol and mechanism, i.e., consensus mechanism.
    The consensus algorithm is compared in the following aspects, and the results
    are shown in Table 4. Table 4  Comparison of six consensus algorithms. The schematic
    diagram of the consensus protocol of the PBFT algorithm is shown in Figure 6.    Figure
    6  PBFT algorithm consensus process. 2.1.5. Introduction to Mainstream Blockchain
    Platforms There are many ways to implement blockchain. The two mainstream blockchain
    platforms are Hyperledger and Ethereum. (1) Hyperledger. Hyperledger (Hyperledger)
    does not allow unknown identities, and participating members must be registered
    through MSP (Membership Service Provider). The certainty of membership lays a
    foundation for the network environment of mutual trust for the cooperation of
    all parties involved and the credibility of data. Hyperledger provides a flexible
    and extensible framework based on modularization and supports pluggable components.
    Users can replace and upgrade components according to actual application scenarios
    and project requirements. The unique “channel” concept of Hyperledger allows some
    participants to create separate chains. The data between the chains are isolated
    from each other, and the data can be stored in different chains according to the
    rules. Maintained by the corresponding participants, the “channel” takes into
    account the sharing and confidentiality of data. Because of the advantages of
    Hyperledger''s alliance chain attributes and user authentication mechanism, channel
    design, and modular architecture, it can provide better data security and system
    flexibility. (2) Ethereum. Ethereum (Ethereum) is a resonance network composed
    of member computers worldwide. Its ultimate goal is to allow the world to use
    this as a carrier to more quickly realize the establishment of a blockchain platform.
    For this, it created “Ether” (also known as “Bitcoin 2.0”) as an incentive currency
    to support the operation of the application. Ether is a technology that sends
    cryptocurrency to anyone by paying a small fee. Based on it, you can also create
    various applications that are never down and available to everyone. It is a programmable
    blockchain that belongs to the whole world. Ether builds on the innovations brought
    by bitcoin while making many improvements. While both allow you to use the digital
    currency without the support of a payment service provider or bank, Ether is programmable,
    so you can build other different digital assets—even bitcoin—based on it. The
    Ethereum architecture diagram is shown in Figure 7.    Figure 7  Ethereum architecture
    diagram. The blockchain platform used for this study is the Hyperledger Fabric,
    which is a licensed member and supports rich queries to immutable distributed
    ledgers, modular architecture with support for plug-in components, and protection
    of digital keys and sensitive data. 2.2. Wireless Communication Network As one
    of the mainstream communication methods nowadays, the wireless communication network
    can not only save a lot of hardware equipment but also can transmit over long
    distances, which brings great convenience to people. Moreover, in the construction
    of this blockchain system platform, it is indispensable to use the wireless communication
    network, and the transmission of data and the interaction of information also
    play an important role in the platform. Therefore, the wireless communication
    network determines whether the data can be transmitted, displayed, and interacted
    in real time. When selecting a wireless communication network, a safe, reliable,
    and efficient wireless communication network should be deployed according to the
    characteristics and design requirements of the system. The wireless communication
    network used this time is a wireless mesh network. Generally, wireless mesh networks
    can be divided into the following three network structures: flat network structure,
    multilevel network structure, and hybrid network structure. Among them, the planar
    network structure is mainly composed of interconnections between various terminal
    nodes. The multilevel network structure is mainly composed of routing nodes directly
    interconnected with terminal nodes. The hybrid network structure has not only
    the interconnection between terminal nodes but also the interconnection between
    routing nodes and terminal nodes. The relationship diagram between wireless network
    and wireless local area network, ad hoc network, and WBAN is shown in Figure 8.    Figure
    8  The relationship diagram between wireless mesh network and WLAN, ad hoc network,
    and WBAN. The nodes in the wireless mesh network are interconnected with high
    broadband and high utilization, the APs are self-configuring and self-healing,
    and the mesh is compatible with wireless client terminals. The network is easy
    to install, non-line-of-sight transmission, and robust network. 3. Targeted Poverty
    Alleviation Methods in the Agricultural Sector In the process of precise poverty
    alleviation, there are still problems of poor population identification accuracy,
    insufficient data authenticity, nontransparent use of poverty alleviation funds,
    and imprecise poverty alleviation assessment. In response to these problems, this
    study gives some methods of precise poverty alleviation and poverty eradication.
    3.1. Methods of Precision Poverty Alleviation in the Agricultural Sector In any
    case, the primary task for the agricultural sector to achieve targeted poverty
    alleviation and alleviation is to resolve the identification and identification
    of the poor. For this purpose, the blockchain system will combine various information
    for analysis and evaluation, such as the causes of poverty and bank information.
    It achieves the accuracy and truthfulness of poor household data collection. The
    real realization of the accurate identification of the poor needs to rely on the
    consensus mechanism of blockchain technology. The information on the poor is not
    static after entering the database. Since the poor always have the opportunity
    to get rid of poverty, the storage information of the poor must be adjusted while
    ensuring that the poor can maintain their living conditions after getting out
    of poverty. Moreover, after the poor people enter the treasury, regular audits
    and rechecks must be performed so as to accurately identify the poor. After the
    poor have been lifted out of poverty, “Internet + Education” programs should be
    established while maintaining the status quo. Through online distance education
    and training, life skills can be improved and poverty alleviation can be made
    more effective. To overcome poverty, we should support wisdom and ambition and
    use education to stop the intergenerational transmission of poverty. In terms
    of food safety, embedding the entire agricultural product supply chain into a
    blockchain-driven system can combine farms with intelligent agricultural systems
    to collect and save first-line data on agricultural production. Each product has
    its own unique traceable source code. The quality management and protection of
    agricultural products involve a wide range of areas, including the production,
    storage, transportation, and use of agricultural products. At present, there are
    quality management and safety systems for all types of agricultural products at
    home and abroad. However, because these systems and the actual process of organic
    product production, storage, transportation, and use are discrepant the response
    of supervisors is very weak. The full implementation of a reliable blockchain
    in workflow and farm management can avoid this discrepancy problem. This is particularly
    useful for work sharing and collaboration between producers and customers. First,
    the blockchain-based agricultural quality management system is the “natural” result
    of the widespread application of block chain in the agricultural production process
    and management. Second, because production factors such as land, capital, and
    human resources involve all aspects of labor and agricultural management, they
    are all registered in the “chain,” and the various links in the production, storage,
    circulation, and use of the internet-of-things supply chain. The “chain” storage
    is inconspicuous, ensuring the traceability of agricultural product information
    in all links. Automatic quality control of agricultural products must be implemented,
    early warning must be given, and problems must be solved in advance. 3.2. Experimental
    Test Results We use throughput as a measurement index and use two block generation
    time intervals of 10 s and 20 s to evaluate the performance of the PBFT and raft
    algorithms, respectively. By using the Java implementation of these two algorithms
    in this project, running 20 times, the results obtained are shown in Figures 9
    and 10.   (a)     (a)  (b)     Figure 9  PBFT algorithm performance test.   (a)     (a)  (b)     Figure
    10  Raft algorithm performance test. It can be seen that in basic blockchain project,
    the throughput of the unoptimized PBFT and raft algorithms can reach 1–3 thousand
    transactions per second, which has satisfied most agricultural scenarios. However,
    generally speaking from the principle of the two algorithms, there are mainly
    the following two fatal shortcomings, which make it impossible to apply to the
    blockchain. (1) Each message is written to the log in node. PBFT and raft are
    consensus algorithms for databases (logs). The blockchain application system is
    mainly transaction oriented, which is a lower-level technology of the blockchain.
    (2) PBFT and raft do not consider the byzantine problem, and they are based on
    the trust mechanism for all nodes. If the leader maliciously tampered with the
    transaction information, the entire cluster will store the wrong information,
    which is intolerable to the transaction system. This study uses the RBFT consensus
    algorithm, which is a combination of the raft algorithm and the PBFT algorithm,
    which is only applicable to permissioned systems (private chains) and can only
    accommodate faulty nodes (CFT), not evil nodes. In the case of a single node,
    when the system nodes are normally operating, the TPS comparison results of various
    blockchains when using different consensus algorithms are shown in Figure 11(a).
    Figure 11(b) shows the CPU usage of running POW, PBFT, and the improved RBFT consensus
    algorithms in the case of a single node.   (a)     (a)  (b)     Figure 11  TPS
    and CPU usage of different consensus algorithms. It can be seen from Figure 11(a)
    that the RBFT algorithm''s time to reach is reduced, so the TPS of the algorithm
    is greatly improved compared to the PBFT algorithm. It can be seen from Figure
    11(b) that the CPU usage rate of the POW algorithm quickly reached 100%, that
    is, the CPU is running at full capacity, while the RBFT algorithm uses the master
    node to generate blocks. Therefore, there is no need for computing power competition,
    and the CPU usage rate is significantly reduced. The client uses the testing tool
    Agile to send simulated transactions to the consensus node with different throughputs:
    it is sent in multiple rounds, and each round uses a sending rate to send the
    simulated transaction to the consensus node for 1 minute and records the response
    data of the formula node. The sending rate between multiple rounds is increased
    to obtain the data of the system under different transaction volumes and obtain
    the performance inflection point. The test tool Agile will record the number of
    confirmed transactions he has received, and the time is 60 s to calculate the
    RBFT throughput, as shown in Figure 12(a).   (a)     (a)  (b)     Figure 12  RBFT
    performance test chart and comparison chart of data recovery speed between RBFT
    and PBFT. In order to test the time required for the consensus node to return
    to normal after failure, we designed the following scenarios: (1) Start the Platform
    (2) Disconnect one of the nodes. (3) Send messages to the surviving nodes to generate
    n blocks. (4) Restart the disconnected node and calculate the recovery time based
    on the log timestamp. We tested the blockchain platforms equipped with RBFT and
    PBFT consensus algorithms, respectively, and the test results are shown in Figure
    12(b). It can be seen that RBFT has a greater advantage than PBFT in the recovery
    of failed nodes. For the data recovery of the same size node, taking the data
    recovery of a block as an example, PBFT takes about 25 seconds and RBFT only takes
    about 9 seconds, which is a time reduction of more than 60%. Moreover, as the
    number of blocks to be recovered increases, the recovery time more slowly increases
    than PBFT. When restoring 32 blocks of data, PBFT already takes about 50 seconds,
    while RBFT only takes about 12 seconds. The time consumed is only 25% of the original
    algorithm, which reflects higher recovery efficiency. 4. Discussion This study
    is based on blockchain technology and wireless communication network technology
    to achieve precision poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation methods in the
    agricultural field. Through the understanding of wireless communication network
    technology and blockchain technology, this study has discovered the advantages
    of blockchain applications in the agricultural field. Next, this study proposes
    a series of solutions combining blockchain technology to solve the problems in
    precision poverty alleviation, food safety, and management in the agricultural
    field, so as to truly realize “precise poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation.”
    This study has developed the traditional distributed consensus algorithm and the
    PBFT algorithm with polynomial execution time. On this basis, the PBFT algorithm
    was improved to address the shortcomings of the PBFT algorithm, and the RPBFT
    algorithm in the blockchain application field was formed. After experimental testing,
    the algorithm has the advantages of high throughput, low latency, and strong fault
    tolerance, which is very suitable for blockchain applications in the agricultural
    field. 5. Conclusions The application of blockchain in agricultural modernization
    covers many aspects such as agricultural product trade and precision agriculture.
    In today''s agricultural modernization, there are still many poor groups, and
    the blockchain can better integrate all the links involved in the agricultural
    field based on its own advantages. In this way, it is not only conducive to the
    circulation of agricultural products but also can save a lot of manpower and material
    resources and bring a huge improvement to the efficiency and economic benefits
    of the entire agricultural field. The core of blockchain technology lies in the
    consensus mechanism, and nowadays, the consensus mechanism algorithm is relatively
    complete. Therefore, the use of one or more consensus mechanism algorithms during
    research is worthy of serious consideration, and new algorithms can even be innovated
    according to the needs of design research. This can also provide a good idea for
    future blockchain technology research. However, the adoption of blockchain technology
    to achieve poverty eradication faces many challenges in terms of concept, technology,
    and law. Data Availability No data were used to support this study. Conflicts
    of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest. Acknowledgments

  description: 'Conventional extensive irrigation of paddy fields has posed a great
    challenge on crop growth, natural rainfall, and water resources. It is highly
    demanding for networked intelligent irrigation systems, with the increase in the
    area of paddy fields during agricultural modernization. However, the current irrigation
    system is still lacking in the deployment flexibility of underlying equipment,
    connectivity, and energy consumption of communication networks, as well as the
    intelligence decision-making of the whole system. Particularly, the energy consumption
    of equipment inevitably impacts the serving life of the equipment. In addition,
    the wired information transmission is used in most irrigation systems, where a
    large number of cables need to be erected. As such, great difficulties have been
    brought to the deployment and maintenance of equipment, due mainly to the complex
    environment in paddy fields. In this study, a precision irrigation strategy was
    proposed to fully utilize the natural precipitation using the sensor, embedded
    system, wireless networking, and artificial intelligence. Firstly, a networked
    precision irrigation system was designed for paddy fields using smart agricultural
    technology. Specifically, five modules were included: data collection node, irrigation
    control node, handheld control terminal, PC control terminal, and intelligent
    communication node. The wireless communication was used to flexibly deploy in
    the paddy fields with the solar power generation devices. Secondly, the fuzzy
    control was utilized to establish some of the models, including the most optimal
    deployment model of communication nodes, the most optimal irrigation decision-making
    model, a prediction model of crop water consumption and precipitation, as well
    as a decision-making system of precision irrigation. The design strategy was adopted
    in the decision-making system using the MATLAB+LABVIEW platform, in order to control
    the system by mutual cooperation. A new deployment model was proposed to optimize
    the deployment of communication nodes in the irrigation using the improved moth
    flame optimization and the Voronoi diagram, thereby improving the communication
    efficiency of the irrigation network, while reducing the energy consumption of
    communication. As such, the status and network meteorological parameters in the
    paddy fields were used as the input of the precision irrigation decision-making
    system. Finally, the irrigation equipment of the paddy field was adaptively controlled
    for precision irrigation after the decision-making of the system. Taking the rice
    fields in Jiangsu, China as an example, a field test was carried out to compare
    with the simulation. It was found that the intelligent irrigation system reduced
    the action frequency of irrigation equipment by 26.67%, while the irrigation volume
    of the system reduced by 40.82%, and the drainage volume reduced by 33.89%, compared
    with the traditional. Consequently, the operating life of the equipment was improved
    significantly, while the waste of water resources was reduced under the optimal
    growth water level of paddy field crops. The hardware and software parts of the
    system also performed well to meet the requirements of design indicators.'

    The need to drive the technologies across the boundaries and to address the abundance
    of useful social applications and services in terms of business benefits is the
    vital reason for the integration of reliability and low latency in communication
    networks. The automated flying or driving, automation of factories, haptic communications,
    real-time healthcare using remote, and control in the industries are the major
    challenging applications of the ultra-high reliable low latency communication
    (URLLC). The URLLC is predicted to produce revolutionary advancements in the fields
    like smart grid, smart cities, trading using algorithms, smart farming, and remote
    manufacturing. Though some critical applications require short packets and low
    data rate transmission as predominant, the future data rate requirements can be
    fulfilled by the URLLC. The blooming of the services like virtual reality (VR)
    and augmented reality (AR), consumer robotics, high-precision broadband networks,
    gaming, and other entertainment at high definition made is operated at very low
    latencies of few milliseconds (ms). To cope up with the highly developing environment,
    there has been a valid and significant understanding found in the theoretical
    and practical development of the URLLC system’s implication. With the trade-off
    occurring between the throughput, probability of error, and delay in wireless
    networks, a strong interest and best understanding of the theoretical implications
    of URLLC are needed. The error trade-off includes queuing and coding delays. Though
    many analytically proposed approaches are available, there is not enough mathematical
    theory and fundamental limits to understand the low latencies in communication.
    The traffic in the network is heterogeneous and unpredictable. Thus, the overhead
    associated with the conventional theoretical framework for communication should
    be incorporated. The URLLC is like a roadblock for engineers, as it produces numerous
    challenges in network deployment, interface design, allocation of resources, and
    application layer core. The main requirement of reliable, efficient, and guaranteed
    low latency is 1. Designing of the system with throughput along with the holistic
    view is 2. Powerful network optimization algorithms are required for efficient
    and fast network functioning. The scenarios of the typical characteristics of
    the traffic are varying in terms of arrival models, QoS, and packet size in URLLC.
    Thus, in the development of the URLLC, these parameters should be considered Fettweis
    and Alamouti (2014), Steinbach and Liu (2016). The URLLC services that require
    low latency support are being provided using the long-term evolution (LTE) performance
    [LTE R14, 2016]. The reduction in long-term evolution (LTE), semi-persistent scheduling,
    grant-free access, and processing time reduction are found to the remedial parameters.
    There are many aspects of technically adding the cellular network that needs a
    careful design, and it includes symbol length, frame structure, scheduling policy,
    and subcarrier spacing and multiple-access scheme and link adaptation strategy
    URLLC (2016a, b), (3GPP TSG 1610366, 2016), and (3GPP TSG RAN WG1, 2016). Agriculture
    needs automation in the field of agriculture. There have been several types of
    research carried out in automation which is involved in irrigation and fertilizer
    automation. The automation of agriculture involves the application of wireless
    sensor network (WSN). The sensor network is the only resolution for precision
    agriculture realization using information technology (IT). The wireless sensor
    network contains mainly three components, namely, 1, gateways; 2, software; and
    3, sensor nodes. The sensor nodes are responsible for providing the data conditions
    from the environment. The data is transmitted to the processor wirelessly via
    gateways, and thus, they are displayed on the monitor with the help of the software
    [Susana et al. 2016]. The IoT application involves the IT and WSN’s basic principle.
    The internet acts as the intermediate medium for connecting the shared information
    and IoT. Thus, the IoT’s limitation is made to overcome by integrating the IoT
    along with cloud computing. This sharing of the data process involves the communication
    protocols LDhirani et al. (2017). IoT supporting protocol for the communication
    purpose includes the Message Queuing Telemetry (MQTT) transport. MQTT has some
    beneficial features in comparison with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This
    protocol is found to be simple and modern, capable of running in the low bandwidth
    providing low latency when compared to HTTP. The HTTP has an overhead protocol
    that is low Yokotani and Sasaki (2016). Literature survey There are many pieces
    of research being performed for automation in the field of agriculture. This involves
    the development of a smart irrigation system, smart fertilization techniques,
    smart farming system, etc. The pacing parameters of the subcarrier scalability
    for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing’s (OFDM) length of the symbol and
    slots minimizing involve compromising of numerous symbols [(TR 36.802, 2017),
    (TR 36.881, 2017)]. The enhancement in mobile broadband and numerous innovative
    ideas on URLLC is for utilization of the resource efficiently [(Multiplexing,
    2016), (eMBB & URLLC 2016a, b)]. The idea of the multiple-access protocols with
    the two-way grant-free access involves the reduction in the latency during uplink
    of the protocol [(NR Page, 2016), (Grant, 2016) & (M-sequences, 2016)]. The current
    3GPP LTE utilizes a fitting booking to use multi-users, adaptive modulation, and
    coding (AMC) as per channel quality data estimated at a recipient and hybrid automatic
    repeat and request (HARQ) for proficient retransmission to give high dependability
    just as high otherworldly productivity [Dahlman et al. 2011]. Nonetheless, such
    a methodology requires delays for channel quality measure and criticism, booking,
    and retransmission that it gets improper for conveying delicate data, even though
    it is the most proficient approach to convey inactivity uncaring data. Though
    some variety schemes and quick HARQ plans for better dependability at a low latency
    are thought of, for example, in Channel (2016), Uplink (2017), and Yeo et al.
    (2017), their unwavering quality levels and the subsequent otherworldly efficiencies
    are a long way based on what is needed for viable URLLC administrations. Further,
    the design of the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) layer innovations
    for URLLC needs to think about the wide range of traffic qualities and the QoS
    of URLLC administrations. Since 2015, the creators had framed a joint URLLC research
    group and zeroed in on growing frightfully productive convention and numerous
    entrance innovations that ensure both tight low-idleness and ultra-reliability
    necessities for URLLC. With no instant channel content feedback or retransmission
    in obscuring networks, a lot of variation derived from massive amounts of opportunity
    is essential for ultra-reliability. In this regard, considering a large-scale
    receiving apparatus structure (LSAS) [or a large-scale various knowledge different
    yield (MIMO) system] is a typical outcome Marzetta (2010), Lim et al. (2015).
    In this article, several novel different accessibility plans for URLLC based on
    the LSAS are discussed, as well as signal multiplexing and full-duplex communication
    techniques to improve the unearthly competence and reduce inertness. Furthermore,
    by combining a structure-level evaluation method and a light following apparatus
    with computerized maps on real-world environments, another evaluation methodology
    is offered, as well as the demonstration assessment findings. System model The
    proposed system utilized ultra-reliable low latency communication techniques to
    provide a better communication convince in agricultural farms. Agricultural data
    are treated, collected, and monitored using wireless sensor networks. The sensor
    collects the informational data and transfers it to the cloud server. The information
    is shown on the web page that can be access with permission to the customers.
    A sensor node along with the actuators can control the unwanted environmental
    conditions. The update in the web content information in regard to an agricultural
    field can be notified to the users. The proposed framework is shown in Fig. 1.
    Fig. 1 The proposed receiver filter framework Full size image Wireless sensor
    networks are the most preferred in most of the contemporaneous applications, namely,
    micro-electromechanical system technological field, digital electronics, and wireless
    communications. The wireless mode of communication is achieved only using the
    wireless sensor networks that include the sensor interacting with the environmental
    conditions to collect, process, and communicate. Since very less amount of wiring
    is carried out for the wireless sensor network, therefore the cost of wiring is
    also low. The essentially important data are stored in the cloud service of the
    Internet of Things via the wireless sensor networks with the Internet source.
    A wireless sensor network with the Internet of Things includes sensing units,
    processing units, transmission units, and power units. Algorithm of the proposed
    system: Step 1: Placement of sensors SHT3x – Humidity and temperature monitoring
    TSL 2561x – Light intensity TDS – Plant Level Step 2: Store sensed data in memory
    unit Step 3: Sensor - MCU Link establishment Step 4: Enter operational mode Step
    5: Transmit and Receive data Step 6: Continuous logging and Monitoring Step 7:
    Calculate yield and quality In the sensing unit, environmental provision is monitored
    using the sensor nodes. The proposed architecture consists of three sensors, namely,
    SHT3x, TSL2561 sensor, and TDS sensor. The temperature and humidity are predicted
    using SHT3x, TSL2561 is used to predict the light intensity, and plant nutrients
    level is determined using a TDS sensor. The processing unit is also known as a
    memory unit. The microcontrollers inbuilt in the processing unit consist of a
    large memory space in which the program is loaded to transfer the corresponding
    commands to the other devices that are linked with it. The configuration of the
    connected devices is sensors and actuators. The microcontroller controls the sensor
    nodes and enables the communication interaction with the Internet of Things, whereas
    the actuators control the surrounding environment. The transmission and receiving
    of data from wireless sensor network devices are monitored and controlled in the
    transmitting unit. In the proposed system, a Wi-Fi hotspot router is used for
    an Internet source to connect the sensor nodes with the cloud service. Wireless
    sensor network-based agricultural farms installed AC power for energy source and
    come under the power unit. Actuator devices required AC power, whereas DC power
    is needed for processing devices. A sustainable wireless sensor network framework
    system performs efficiently using an AC power source. A wireless sensor network-based
    agricultural farm acquires an optimal and sustainable benefit. Environmental changes
    such as climate, plant physiology, hydrology, and pest are regularly monitored
    in agricultural farms using wireless sensor network devices. The sensor nodes
    in WSN suggest the farmers use a limited range of fertilizers, pesticides for
    an input seed. The agricultural machinery data are collected and controlled using
    WSN. The proposed system is applicable for many contemporaneous applications,
    namely, monitoring plant status, fertilizer management, irrigation pattern, controlling
    pest, and promoting autonomous harvesting. The structure of wireless sensor network
    is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Wireless sensor network Full size image The Internet
    of Things allows the user in accessing the tools from anywhere at any time by
    connecting the user’s devices with cloud service via the continuous Internet source.
    The constraints of IoT devices are handled via the cloud on an IoT platform that
    enables the storage space and computation of resources. The protocols available
    in the cloud communication system require only a minimum level of bandwidth and
    low-energy consumption. Clients, servers, subscribers, publishers, and topics
    are handled by the protocol. As per the request from the user, the protocol is
    responsible in receiving and transferring the messages. The publisher complains
    about the issues faced through the server, whereas the subscribers are also known
    as a client who receives the requested topics from the server. Ultra-reliable
    low latency communication technique is utilized in agro-meteorological wireless
    sensor networks in acquiring information to handle the farm efficiently. The sensor
    nodes in wireless sensor networks provide a limited level of preprocessing, and
    this blocks signal conditioning, filtering, and detection. This applies to agro-meteorological
    attributes and their corresponding relationships. The implementation of this technique
    improves the network lifespan. The proposed system model in the agricultural field
    can identify the disease of the plant. Ultra-reliable low latency communication
    technique efficiently handles a huge amount of data obtained from the wireless
    sensor networks in farms supporting the farmers in deciding about the concern
    in informational data. Rainfall pattern, water supply to the plants, and fertilizers
    usage can be analyzed through the proposed system. This promotes the increased
    yield production and the quality of plant crops. Result and discussion The performance
    of the proposed system model is attained using the two-dimensional regular cells
    along with the 2-D stochastic wireless fading channel. The proposed technique
    is more apt for various contemporaneous applications due to the installation of
    more antennas and small cells. The evaluation of long-term evolution (LTE) technologies
    is attained using the 3GPP 3-D spatial channel model. This 3-D is obtained from
    the 2-D channel model using stochastic channel parameters. The transmitter and
    receiver pairs are selected depending based on scenario-dependent parameters via
    the 2-D regular layout. Depending on the desired pair and interfering sources,
    the sensor nodes are placed. Enlarged agricultural land area is provided with
    the continuous network with some geographical characteristics goal including landforms,
    shape, and other surrounding factors. The map-based channel model is enhanced
    using the ray-tracing tool brought attention to all contemporaneous applications.
    The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the hardware test calculation
    in association with the link-level simulations (LLSs) and SLSs. UL multiple-access
    and DL waveform multiplexing performance are evaluated using a high-resolution
    digital map. The placement of antennas at a respective height at a tilting angle
    is considered for generating information to the users about each part of the agricultural
    farm through digital mapping. With the parameters of the 3-D channel, a digital
    camera installed in the farm using the ray-tracing tool is known as wireless sensor
    networks. As per the deterministic model with the specified transmitter and receiver
    pair or a stochastic model, a 3-D wireless channel is provided. Synchronization
    of frequency and time is manipulated with the permission provided to all individual
    users of downlink (DL). Various methodologies and filtering waveform along with
    the multiplexing waveform perform the synchronization process on the sub-bands.
    Thus, the synchronization for downlink has increased performance efficiency. A
    long-term evolution for enhanced mobile broadband and low latency communication
    (URLLC) services requires a steady synchronization time for a closed-loop system.
    URLLC services require a high-frequency band and mobility rate as the synchronization
    time error, and offset frequency arises due to Doppler shift reduces the performance
    rate of URLLC services. Sporadic access is required to have an increased reliability
    rate of URLLC services, and therefore, the receiver is provided with the interference
    cancellation approach. Multiple users in closed-loop time synchronization are
    estimated with the various time and offset frequencies. To overcome the challenges
    in time and frequency offset caused due to the interference of multi-users with
    the high mobility rate, sporadic access, and the receiver filter, the evaluation
    of time and frequency offsets is necessary. For this would maximize the signal-to-interference
    ratio (SIR), which has improved the performance in comparison with another approach.
    The downlink agonizes from interference which is caused by the uplink (UL) in
    a full-duplex cellular communication. Proper management of interference is required
    to improve the performance of the user’s rate distribution. Self-interference
    cancellation (SIC) is the basis in association with the management of interference.
    Uplink interference in code-division duplexing spatial division multiple-access
    (CDD-SDMA) in null space orthogonal is arranged. Downlink multiuser multi-input
    multi-output (MU-MIMO) is arranged in a signal subspace via the enhancement of
    antenna configuration and orthogonal codes among downlink and uplink. With the
    support of this alignment, uplink interferences are converted into a downlink
    single dimension space signal. The feasibility of communication in an agricultural
    farm is achieved using a spatial channel model. The frequency range for the uplink
    communication users is also attained using the adjacent channel interference along
    with the in-band blocking. An analog to digital converter and interference co-channel
    is inbuilt in resource block producing a finite resolution output. The contemporaneous
    agricultural application system practically achieves an increased spectral efficiency.
    Even in non-ideal effects, the proposed system shows improved performance, doubling
    the rate of spectral efficiency with the simultaneous reduction in delay among
    uplink and downlink. The comparative analysis of CDD-SDMA with half-duplex is
    shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Comparative analysis of CDD-SDMA with half-duplex Full
    size image Ultra-reliable low latency communication technique for agricultural
    wireless sensor networks is shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7 to 8. These graphs display
    information acquired from agricultural fields to consumers or farmers through
    communication, allowing them to avoid planting crops, improve output rates, and
    connect with consumers. Waveform with effective synchronization strategy is required
    for radio resource communication. To improve the spectral efficiency, delay spread
    and mobility with multiplexing concept are required. The different types of waveforms,
    namely, filtered orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and generalized frequency
    division multiplexing, are multiplexed with cyclic prefix length, filter length,
    and subcarrier spacing. Fig. 4 Performance evaluation of generalized frequency
    division multiplexing Full size image Fig. 5 Performance evaluation of generalized
    frequency division multiplexing with weighted parallel interference cancellation

    multiplexing with filter Full size image Fig. 7 Performance evaluation of orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing with filter Full size image Fig. 8 Performance
    evaluation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing Full size image The proposed
    system provides the communication with the wireless sensor network requiring Internet
    sources. For an effective URLLC performance, waveform multiplexing with the frequency
    offsets and time synchronization is introduced. Thus, the proposed system is feasible
    in providing a URLLC Internet service in the agricultural field. Figure 6 gives
    a clear view on the performance of the proposed system using the frequency division
    multiplexing. The spectral efficiency of the system increases linearly when the
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is increased. Figure 7 shows the clear view that when
    using the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with filter, the spectral
    efficiency of the system increases linearly up to SNR of 20 dB and remains constant
    with higher SNR. This shows that the proposed system’s efficiency becomes constant,
    thus providing constant stability and reliability. Figure 8 shows the spectral
    efficiency of the proposed system when using the orthogonal frequency division
    multiplexing. The spectral efficiency of the system increases linearly up to SNR
    of 15 dB and provides very less increase with higher SNR. This shows that the
    proposed system’s efficiency becomes constant, thus providing constant stability
    and reliability. Thus, by using the OFDM in the proposed system for transmitting
    the data collected in the transmitting unit, the system’s efficiency is found
    to be improved. Figure 9 shows the comparison of the above discussed techniques.
    Among them, OFDM variants and generalized FDM with filter produces higher spectral
    efficiency. Since filter component introduces further complexity and introduces
    latency, a trade-off has been made to select OFDM variants for SDD-CDMA techniques
    for URLLC link communication. Fig. 9 Comparison SDD-CDMA techniques Full size
    image Conclusion In this paper, novel URLLC procedures were presented for acknowledging
    Tactile Internet administrations in sensible conditions. The traffic attributes
    and required QoS of regular URLLC (or Tactile Internet) administrations in writing
    were summed up and characterized from the viewpoint of planning the PHY and MAC
    layers of a cell framework. Examinations on traffic in ordinary use cases defended
    the need of characterizing new client states and conceiving conventions for multiplexing
    of various access plans over radio assets to meet a wide range of traffic attributes
    and QoS of URLLC administrations and the improvement of ideal radio asset of the
    executive techniques to amplify the proficiency while ensuring the inactivity
    and dependability necessities. The MQTT convention merits suggested as a correspondence
    convention for the utilization of remote sensor networks for accuracy. This is
    identified with information correspondence continuously. In this examination,
    the MQTT convention can send sensor information roughly 1 s. This time relies
    upon the capacity to download and transfer from each organization supplier. To
    execute the proposed conventions and different access plans in a frightfully effective
    manner, more PHY innovations on waveform multiplexing and synchronization procedure,
    channel codes for low latency and high unwavering quality, and a novel DL/UL MU-MIMO
    idea joining obstruction arrangement for a functional full-duplex cell correspondence
    were additionally presented. Change history 11 November 2023This article has been

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, humans
    have been increasingly removed from the surveillance loop in favor of a connected
    ecosystem of edge devices performing vision-based tasks [1]. Automatic analysis
    is the only viable option given the huge amount of data continuously collected
    from different IoT edge devices. For example, resource-constrained unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) or image sensors can be used as surveillance devices for detecting
    forest fires [2] or infrastructure damages after natural disasters [3]. In these
    scenarios, autonomous UAVs or edge devices collect data that may be sent to other
    edge devices or to the cloud for automated machine learning (ML)-based analysis.
    According to the 2019 Embedded Markets Study [4], 43% of IoT applications incorporating
    advanced technologies are using embedded vision and 32% are using ML. However,
    using these IoT devices often requires meeting the tight storage, energy, and/or
    communication bandwidth constraints, while maintaining the effectiveness of surveillance.
    Image compression can address these needs in edge devices that operate in constrained
    environments and at the same time reduce network traffic [5]. Compressed images
    are easier to store and more energy efficient to transmit long range. An ideal
    image compression technique for IoT applications should: optimize for machine-to-machine
    communication and machine-based interpretation in diverse IoT applications—i.e.,
    pattern recognition or feature extraction on the image; visual perception by human
    users should be given less importance; aim for minimizing the communication bandwidth
    as IoT is creating 1000X more dense networking requirements [6], [7], often driven
    by image/video communication; gear toward minimizing the overall energy and space
    requirement on resource-constrained edge devices. The standard image compression
    methods, such as JPEG [8], JPEG 2000 [9], and WebP [10] are tailored to maintain
    good human-perceivable visual quality and were not designed with IoT applications
    in mind. Properties of IoT applications that can be leveraged to obtain increased
    compression are as follows. The image domain is biased based on the application
    and on each specific edge image sensor device. The bias can be divided into two
    categories: a) color distribution bias and b) common pattern bias. We define patterns
    as segment outlines in an image. This information can be learned and utilized.
    Depending on the application, specific entities of the images may hold greater
    value with respect to the rest of the image. Such applications, therefore, have
    a region-of-interest (ROI) bias that can be learned and utilized. We define ROI
    as regions that contain entities of importance in an image. The location of this
    region can vary across images. Coarse-grained ML tasks prevalent in IoT applications
    can tolerate extreme levels of compression. Building on these observations, we
    propose MAGIC, a ML-guided image compression framework for achieving extreme levels
    of image compression in IoT systems while maintaining sufficient accuracy for
    coarse-grained AI tasks. MAGIC consists of three major steps: 1)knowledge acquisition;
    2) encoding; and 3) decoding as shown in Fig. 1. During knowledge acquisition,
    different application and domain-specific information, such as color distribution,
    common pattern bias, and ROI bias can be extracted in the form of: 1) a color
    quantization dictionary; 2) a common pattern dictionary; and 3) an ML model which
    can intelligently represent image segments as a set of common pattern dictionary
    entries, respectively. Fig. 1. Overall flow of the MAGIC framework. Show All During
    the encoding stage, an image is segmented into nonoverlapping triangles using
    an efficient Delaunay triangulation (DT) method. The ML model, we name pattern
    prediction model, and the common pattern dictionary from the knowledge acquisition
    stage are used to guide the image segmentation process. Finally, the colors are
    assigned by averaging the pixel colors within each triangle and quantizing them
    based on the color quantization dictionary, which is constructed by analyzing
    the color distribution from the domain using k -means. The decode phase operates
    similarly by reconstructing the segments using DT and assigning colors from the
    color quantization dictionary. We have implemented MAGIC as a completely configurable
    framework that can be used to compress images from a given data set. We evaluate
    MAGIC extensively using two publicly available data sets: fire detection [11]
    and building crack detection [12] and observe promising performance. For the building
    crack detection data set, at a 1.06% accuracy loss, we obtained 22.09× more compression
    with respect to the source images. For the fire detection data set, at a 2.99%
    accuracy loss, we obtained 42.65× more compression with respect to the source
    images. We highlight the flexibility of MAGIC by showing ∼167× more compression
    than source at a higher accuracy loss (~13%). Furthermore, we analyze the variability
    in compressed image size and the energy requirements of MAGIC. remainder of the
    article is organized as follows. Section II discusses background of vision in
    IoT and related works in compression. Section III provides motivations for this
    work and Section IV introduces the proposed methodology. Section V presents evaluation
    and comparison of MAGIC with JPEG 2000 and WebP. Section VI discusses possible
    extensions and improvements. Section VII concludes this article. SECTION II. Background
    and Related Works In this section, we will give a brief introduction to vision
    tasks in IoT applications, and discuss state-of-the-art compression techniques.
    A. Computer Vision in IoT Applications IoT applications are gaining popularity
    in several spheres such as industry, home, healthcare, retail, transport, and
    even security [16]. Many applications in these domains involve capturing images
    at the edge device and transmitting the image to the cloud or other edge devices
    for analysis. For example: UAV-based fire detection techniques have been proposed
    which uses optical remote sensing [17]; detecting infrastructure damage in a post-disaster
    scenario using UAV imaging is also being looked into [18], [19]; IoT image sensors
    and computer vision techniques are widely used for flood monitoring, warning,
    and damage mitigation [20]. Image sensors and intelligent data analysis are two
    key aspects of surveillance-based IoT applications. Additionally, security-oriented
    IoT surveillance applications actively rely on computer vision to detect anomalies
    [16]. B. Need for Image Compression in IoT Vision Different IoT applications require
    sensing image data at the edge and transmitting them over to other edge devices
    or the cloud for analysis. These edge devices operate with strict space, energy,
    and bandwidth requirements. Compressing images not only has the direct effect
    of reducing the space and network traffic requirement but also can reduce energy
    consumption. IoT-based communication is expected to reach 50% of network traffic
    by 2025 [6]. For example, a typical 4G network is designed to support thousands
    of devices worth of traffic in a region. However, with the increase in the number
    of IoT devices being connected to the network, it may become impossible to efficiently
    serve all devices simultaneously. Therefore, compression at the edge can help
    reduce network stress. The energy required to transmit data increases with distance
    [21]. For long-range transmission devices such as MaxStream XTend (at 500-mW transmit
    power), the energy required for 1 B of transmission can be higher than 1 million
    clock cycles worth of computation [21]. Hence, even with the cost of additional
    computation, compression can ultimately lead to less overall energy expenditure.
    Due to all these reasons, image compression is a vital step for any IoT vision
    application. C. State-of-the-Art Image Compression Techniques Several image compression
    techniques proposed over the years can be divided primarily into two categories:
    1) lossless compression techniques and 2) lossy compression techniques. Lossless
    compression techniques, such as arithmetic coding [22], [23] and Huffman coding
    [24] aim to completely preserve the content under compression, but generally at
    the cost of significant mathematical computations [25]. For coarse-grained ML
    tasks, such quality is not needed, therefore, lossy compression techniques are
    preferred. As the name suggests, lossy compression allows for variable data loss
    to achieve higher rates of compression. The data lost is generally not perceivable
    by humans. Some lossy compression techniques include, JPEG [8], JPEG 2000 [9],
    and WebP [10] which perform quantization in the frequency domain using techniques
    such as discrete wavelet transform and discrete cosine transform. Another class
    of lossy compression performs quantization in the spatial domain, such as triangulation-based
    image compression most recently proposed in [15]. This compression technique relies
    on the DT of a set of points in the image matrix to construct the image out of
    nonoverlapping triangles during both encoding and decoding. In this way, triangulation
    allows for a reduction in data transmission size at the cost of slightly more
    encoding/decoding time. While we use DT, our compression algorithm and compression
    goals are vastly different than [15]. For example, when selecting the points before
    DT, we use a pattern prediction model instead of a heuristic-guided algorithm.
    Moreover, the goal of our approach is to: 1) capture domain knowledge for extra
    compression and 2) compress with coarse-grained ML tasks in mind. ML has been
    used to further improve compression [26]–[29]. In all these works, the goal is
    to maximize visual quality metrics (PSNR, MS-SSIM, and remove artifacts) all while
    minimizing bits per pixel (BPP). However, complex, large neural networks (NNs),
    are not ideal for use in edge devices. More recently, people have been targeting
    image compression optimized for ML accuracy over human perceived quality. Liu
    et al. propose DeepN-JPEG [13] which modifies JPEG’s quantization table for deep
    NN accuracy over human visual quality. DeepN-JPEG is targeted for generalized
    AI-models and can achieve only 3.5× compression compared to source images. However,
    our approach can achieve up to 42.65× more compression than the source. Similarly,
    Liu et al. [30] modified JPEG 2000 to extract frequencies relevant for NN-based
    segmentation of 3-D medical images. Weber et al. [14] developed a recurrent NN-based
    compression with the aim of maximizing the accuracy of generalized classifiers
    and investigated the accuracies of several classifiers for images compressed for
    human perception versus machine perception. In Table I, we qualitatively compare
    MAGIC with different state-of-the-art relevant image compression techniques. MAGIC
    distinguishes itself as the only image compression technique to be targeted for
    coarse-grained ML vision tasks in IoT applications. The compression range of MAGIC
    is higher than other techniques because it is designed to leverage domain knowledge.
    TABLE I Qualitative Comparison of MAGIC With Different State-of-the-Art Image
    Compression Techniques SECTION III. Motivation Most IoT applications designed
    to perform a particular automated vision task will have some bias in the images
    being captured and analyzed. The amount of bias will depend on the application
    and the sensory edge device in use. For a given application the images will have:
    1) a pixel color distribution bias depending on the environment where the image
    occurs and 2) a pattern bias due to the prevalence of certain common objects in
    the images. Apart from the image set bias, the IoT application may have its own
    biases for certain objects and features relevant to the ML analysis task which
    are explained as follows. A. Color Distribution Bias Image color bias will exist
    to an extent in any IoT domain-specific application. Apart from the application
    level color distribution bias, there may be bias attributed to the physical location
    of the device. For example, the objects and colors in view of a stationary camera
    or drone covering a routine path, will in most cases be consistent and, therefore,
    dominate the color space. Harnessing the bias for each device separately may be
    beneficial but in this article, we limit our study to the application level image
    color distribution bias. We plot the pixel color distributions for the forest
    fire data set [11] and the building crack data set [12] as shown in Fig. 2. The
    plot illustrates the number of occurrences (frequency) for each 8-b color channel
    (red, green, and blue) across all pixels in the images. We can clearly observe
    that certain regions of the red, green, and blue spectrum are more represented
    than others. For example, the building crack data set shows clear bias for Red,
    Green, and Blue 8-b values of 151–201. If we could take advantage of this bias
    by limiting the color space tuned for the specific application then we may be
    able to compress more. Fig. 2. Red-Green-Blue Pixel color distribution for forest
    fire and building crack detection data sets [11], [12]. The channel intensity
    bins range from 0 to 255 (8-b per color channel). Red, Green, and Blue lines represent
    R, G, and B channels, respectively. The frequency is reported in millions (Mil).
    Show All B. Common Pattern Bias The images captured and analyzed by task-specific
    IoT applications will have a pattern (image segment outlines) bias because of
    the nature of the objects that are present in the images. For a building crack
    detection application, the images will consist of cracked and uncracked surfaces
    (Fig. 3) and for a forest fire surveillance application, the images will consist
    of trees and occasional fires (Fig. 4). Just like color distribution bias, common
    pattern bias will also exist both at the application level and at the device location
    level. If we could capture and store these domain-specific repeating patterns
    in a dictionary, for example, then we could potentially save space by storing
    dictionary entry indices instead of concrete data. Fig. 3. DT-guided segmentation
    for a sample building crack detection image [12]. Show All Fig. 4. DT-guided segmentation
    for a sample forest fire detection image [11]. Show All C. Region-of-Interest
    Bias Certain objects/regions in the image may hold more importance depending on
    the IoT task. If the image can be compressed based on the application-specific
    requirement then we will be able to save important regions at higher quality while
    sacrificing other regions. For example, let us assume that we have an IoT application
    that is designed to identify all green cars in a parking lot. The image regions
    other than the ones with green car(s) can be subject to extra compression without
    hampering the application task performance. The ROIs for this scenario are the
    regions containing green car(s). This task-specific knowledge can be learned and
    exploited for further compression. SECTION IV. Methodology In this section, we
    present our learning-guided compression technique (MAGIC) targeted for coarse-grained
    ML vision tasks in intelligent IoT ecosystems. Fig. 1 illustrates the overall
    flow. Just like any other compression technique, there is a procedure for encoding
    the image and a procedure for decoding the image. Additionally, to take advantage
    of the bias present in the application domain, we propose a knowledge acquisition
    procedure. In this article, we focus on the first aspect of domain knowledge learning,
    namely, color distribution bias. The common pattern dictionary (for segmentation
    bias) is statically generated and the pattern prediction model (for ROI bias)
    is trained based on automated supervision. The algorithms are implemented such
    that future inclusion of human supervision and learning in the other two domain
    knowledge areas can be easily performed. We will now describe the three major
    steps of MAGIC in greater detail. A. Knowledge Acquisition Before compression
    is carried out, the knowledge acquisition procedure is used to analyze a set of
    sample images from the given use-case and learn common features that can be reused
    during compression. This learning stage allows for more efficient image compression.
    To capture the application-specific domain knowledge we use the following constructs
    and techniques. 1) Color Quantization Dictionary: We construct a dictionary of
    the most frequently occurring colors for a specific application. Colors are now
    represented as entries in the dictionary instead of the standard 24-b RGB value.
    The number of entries in the dictionary can be controlled by the user. To construct
    the color dictionary, we first extract the color distribution from a set of domain-specific
    sample images and then apply unsupervised ML ( k -means) to extract the colors
    which are strong representatives of the entire color space. The color quantization
    dictionary will be used during the encoding and decoding phase for representing
    the image. Algorithm 1 describes in details how the color quantization dictionary
    is constructed. Algorithm 1 Knowledge Acquisition 1: procedure Learn( bDim,iterLimit,pw,imgList,grid,th,cb
    ) 2: Initialize colorFreq=∅,trainX=∅,trainY=∅ 3: patDict=generatePatternDict(imgList,bDim)
    4: for each img∈imgList do 5: pointArr=∅ 6: pointArr=gridSpray(pointArr,grid,img.rows,img.cols)
    7: edgePoints=cannyEdgeDetection(img) 8: pointArr.append(edgePoints) 9: iter=0
    10: while iter<iterLimit do 11: pointArr=split(pointArr,img,th) 12: iter=iter+1
    13: prunePoint(pointArr,pw) ▹ In every (pw X pw) window, 14: keep maximum 1 point
    15: triangleList=delaunay_triangulation(pointArr) 16: for each t∈triangleList
    do 17: avg_color=findAvgColor(t,img) 18: if avg_color in colorFreq then 19: colorFreq[avgColor]=colorFreq[avgColor]+1
    20: else 21: colorFreq[avgColor]=1 22: blockList=tiling(img,bDim ) 23: j=0 24:
    while j<length(blockList) do 25: dictInd=assignDictInd(blockList,j,pointArr,patDict)
    26: trainX.append(blockList[j]) 27: trainY.append(dictInd) 28: j=j+1 29: colorDict=weighted_kmean(colorFreq,k=
    2 cb ) 30: model=train_Point_Prediction_Model(trainX,trainY) 31: return colorDict,model,patDict
    2) Common Pattern Dictionary: Compressing an image with MAGIC involves segmenting
    an image into representative triangles using DT. The triangle segments are determined
    from the points sprayed on the 2-D image plane. Hence, patterns in an image segment
    can be represented as a set of points in a 2-D plane. The forest fire images in
    Fig. 4 illustrate this process. The common pattern dictionary is a data structure
    for saving the regularly occurring spray point patterns that occur in an image
    segment. The patterns are indexed in the dictionary such that a higher index is
    associated with more complex details. The pattern dictionary can be statically
    generated to increase compression robustness across different image domains or
    learned during the knowledge acquisition phase to be in more tune with the application
    domain. In this article, we focus on the former approach. 3) Machine Learning
    Model for Pattern Prediction: We train an ML model that learns to represent the
    segments of an image as a set of patterns from the common pattern dictionary.
    Similar to other compression techniques, we operate on “blocks” of an image and
    must partition the image. Each block needs to be assigned a point spray pattern
    entry from the common pattern dictionary during encoding. The assignment can be
    based on how much texture details the image block has or the importance of the
    image block for a given application. In this article, we focus on detecting regions
    with higher information density and training the model (using the data from the
    automatic supervision technique described in Algorithm 1) to retain more details
    in those regions. MAGIC employs the trained ML model (pattern prediction model)
    for assigning an image block to an entry from the common pattern dictionary. Iterative
    heuristic-driven DT segmentation methods have time complexity O(IMlogM) , where
    I is the number of iterations and M is the maximum number of points used for computing
    DT. Our pattern prediction model can provide the points in O(1) followed by a
    single DT of complexity O(MlogM) . Therefore, the pattern prediction model has
    two benefits: 1) the ML-guided assignment of an image block to a specific pattern
    dictionary entry is faster than determining the segmentation pattern of the image
    block using iterative heuristic means and 2) the ML model can be trained to retain
    more details for specific image blocks which may be important for the specific
    visual task. 4) Knowledge Acquisition Algorithm: Before communication can start
    between a sender entity and a receiver entity, we must construct the above three
    components during the knowledge acquisition phase. The pattern prediction model
    (1) must reside on the sender (encoder) side. The common pattern dictionary (2)
    and color quantization dictionary (3) should reside on both sender and receiver
    sides. Algorithm 1 defines the knowledge acquisition process which can be used
    to construct these components. We collect a set of sample images (learning data
    set) that can approximately represent the nature of images that are to be communicated.
    In line 3, the common pattern dictionary is generated. For this iteration of MAGIC,
    the generation is such that entry indexed i has exactly i points sprayed randomly
    in a ( bDim×bDim ) block. For each image, we construct the pointArr (set of points
    on the 2-D image plane) which determines the segmentation. The pointArr is initially
    populated with grid points sprayed uniformly based on the parameter grid (line
    6 using Algorithm 3) and edge points determined by an edge detection algorithm
    (line 7). In our case, we use canny edge detection. We add more points to the
    pointArr by repeatedly splitting triangles with a standard deviation of pixel
    intensity greater than th (lines 10–12 using Algorithm 2). This process is done
    to capture more information, but we note that this may in some cases result in
    unnecessary details and ultimately less compression. Therefore, we keep at most
    1 point in the pointArr for every ( pw×pw ) nonoverlapping window (line 13). A
    lower value of pw will lead to the construction of a pattern prediction model
    that captures more details at a cost of image size. We then perform DT to obtain
    the triangle list (line 15). Algorithm 2 Triangle Split 1: procedure Split( pointArr,img,th
    ) 2: triangleList=delaunay_triangulation(pointArr) 3: for each t∈triangleList
    do 4: stdDevColor=calculate_Color_Std_Dev(img,t) 5: if stdDevColor>th then 6:
    pointArr.append(barycenter(t)) 7: return pointArr Algorithm 3 Grid Spray Points
    1: procedure GridSpray( pointArr,grid,rows,cols ) 2: i=0 3: while i<rows do 4:
    j=0 5: while j<cols do 6: pointArr.append((i,j)) 7: j=j+grid 8: i=i+grid 9: return
    pointArr For each triangle in the triangle list, we obtain the average color and
    update the colorFreq . The colorFreq holds the frequency of each triangle color
    encountered across all the images (lines 16–21). cb (number of bits for representing
    colors) is a user input to control the size of the color quantization dictionary.
    We divide the image into blocks of dimension ( bDim×bDim ) and compute the common
    pattern dictionary ( patDict ) entry index which best corresponds to the point
    spray pattern of each block (line 25). The dictInd and the RGB block ( blockList[j]
    ) act as the label and input data (respectively) for training our pattern prediction
    model (lines 26 and 27). We cluster the entries (weighted by their frequency)
    in the colorFreq using the k -means algorithm [31]. The number of clusters is
    2 cb . The cluster representatives are assigned an index and collectively form
    the color quantization dictionary ( colorDict ). In this way, we employ unsupervised
    ML to leverage domain-specific color distribution information. The pattern prediction
    model training process (line 30) depends on the ML model architecture selected
    for the task. After the knowledge acquisition phase completes, the application
    is ready to encode (compress) and decode images. B. Encoding Procedure Algorithm
    4 defines the image encoding process at the sender side. For the given image,
    we divide it into blocks based on the dimension specified by bDim (line 2). For
    each block, we predict the pattern dictionary entry to use with the help of the
    pattern prediction model (line 5). The label predicted by the ML model is divided
    by the input d , a tunable parameter that allows for dynamic image quality. Higher
    values of d are associated with higher compression rates. The predicted labels
    for each block are appended to the labelsArr (line 6). For a label predicted for
    a specific block, we fetch the associated point spray pattern from the common
    pattern dictionary ( patDict ) and append the points to the pointArr after computing
    their absolute position with respect to the image (lines 8–11). pointArr is next
    populated with grid points sprayed uniformly based on the parameter grid (line
    13 using Algorithm 3). We perform DT to obtain the triangleList in line 14. For
    each triangle in the triangleList we compute the average color ( avgColor ) and
    find its closet match ( quantColor ) from the color quantization dictionary (
    colorDict ). The quantColor is appended to the colorList . The final encoded image
    consists of the following converted and packed as bits. img.rows : The number
    of pixel rows in the image (16 b). img.col : Number of pixel columns in the image
    (16 b). grid : Number of pixels to skip between two grid points sprayed (16 b).
    bDim : Dimension of the image block to use (16 b). labelsArr : log 2 ( patDict
    size) bits for each entry. colorDict : log 2 ( colorDict size) bits for each entry.
    The encoded image ( encImg ) is returned as the output of this procedure. Algorithm
    4 Image Encoding 1: procedure Encode( bDim,d,img,model,colorDict,patDict,grid
    ) 2: block_list=tiling(img,bDim ) 3: Initialize pointArr=∅,labelsArr=∅,bIndex=0

    20: encImg=cast_to_bits(img.rows,img.cols,grid,bDim , 21: labelsArr,colorList
    ) 22: return encImg C. Decoding Procedure Algorithm 5 defines the image decoding
    process at the receiver side. Based on the encoding format, rows , cols , grid
    , bDim , labelArr , and colorList are extracted from the encoded image ( encImg
    ) in line 2. For each label in the labelArr , we fetch the associated point spray
    pattern from the pattern dictionary and append the points to the pointArr after
    computing their absolute position with respect to the image and the block index
    ( bIndex ) (lines 6–8). The pointArr is next populated with grid points sprayed
    uniformly based on the parameter grid (line 11 using Algorithm 3). We perform
    DT to obtain the triangleList in line 12. We initialize a blank image with the
    obtained dimensions in line 14. For each triangle in the triangleList , we obtain
    the RGB color ( trueColor ) from the color quantization dictionary using the corresponding
    entry from the colorList (line 16). We color the pixels in recImg for the given
    triangle using trueColor (line 17). The final decoded/recovered image ( recImg
    ) is returned from this method. Algorithm 5 Image Decoding 1: procedure Decode(

    autonomous task-specific IoT applications where the analysis of the images is
    done by ML models. To quantitatively analyze the effectiveness of MAGIC for IoT
    applications we pick two use-cases. Forest fire surveillance [11]. Infrastructure
    analysis [12]. In the next few sections, we describe the experimental setup and
    compare the accuracy of MAGIC compressed images to JPEG 2000 and WebP under different
    quality factor (QF) settings. QF is a tuneable parameter that controls the level
    of compression. We use ImageMagick’s convert command for JPEG 2000 and WebP compression
    techniques, which has QF from 1 to 100, with 1 resulting in the highest compression
    [32]. We explore the effect of the MAGIC input parameters pw (prune window size
    used in Algorithm 1), d (degradation parameter used to reduce the number of sprayed
    points, used in Algorithm 4), and cb (number of bits required to represent each
    color quantization dictionary entry, used in Algorithm 1) have on the rate of
    compression and accuracy. Finally, we introduce a computation, transmission energy
    cutoff for analyzing the energy efficiency of MAGIC. A. Experimental Setup The
    Neural Network (NN) architecture for the domain-specific ML models is shown in
    Fig. 5. We obtain separate model weights by training on each data set and knowledge
    acquisition parameters (controlling the level of compression) using Keras [33].
    The input to the NN is the flattened per-pixel local entropy features of the 64×64
    image blocks. The entropy of a pixel is defined as the number of bits required
    to represent the local gray-scale distribution of a defined neighborhood [34].
    A higher entropy value is correlated to higher diversity and higher information
    density. We use a neighborhood of 5 pixels to train our models. In Fig. 6, we
    see the visual representation of the entropy feature of a sample image. The output
    of the NN domain-specific pattern prediction model is used to compute the entry
    in the common pattern dictionary that is to be assigned for the input image block.

    Fig. 6. Entropy feature of a sample forest fire data set [11] image visualized
    by scaling the values between 0 and 255. Brighter pixels have higher entropy.
    Show All For both the building crack detection and forest fire detection task,
    we use a statically generated point spray pattern dictionary containing 4096 entries
    such that entry i has exactly i points sprayed randomly in a 64×64 block. Hence,
    using an entry with a high value of i is equivalent to capturing more information
    in the image block. B. Evaluation Up to Lowest Quality Factor 1) Infrastructure
    Analysis: We construct two randomly sampled, disjoint sets of 2000 images for
    both knowledge acquisition and evaluation, respectively. 1000 images from the
    positive (with crack) class and another 1000 images from the negative (no crack)
    class are present in each of these sets. For knowledge acquisition parameters
    (Algorithm 1), we use block dimension ( bDim ) 64, number of iteration ( iterLimit
    ) 10, prune window size ( pw ) (4 and 8), grid dimension ( grid ) ceil((rows+cols)/20)
    , triangle standard deviation splitting threshold ( th ) 5, and cb 8 . We compress
    the sampled 2000 evaluation images using MAGIC with compression parameters (Algorithm
    4) block dimension ( bDim ) 64, d (1 up to 12 in separate instances), grid dimension
    ( grid ) ceil((rows+cols)/20) along with the domain-specific pattern prediction
    model ( model ) and the color quantization dictionary obtained from the knowledge
    acquisition stage. To compare with MAGIC, we compress the same images with JPEG
    2000 and WebP (QF 1–10). We obtain a separate data set for each JPEG 2000, WebP,
    and MAGIC setting. Fig. 7 shows sample images from the compressed data sets. For
    each data set, we extract the features from the second fully connected (fc2) layer
    of pretrained VGG-16 [35] to train and test a support vector machine for the classification
    task using 30-fold cross-validation (20/80 test/train splits). We observe from
    Fig. 8, MAGIC was able to compress beyond JPEG 2000 QF = 1 while maintaining almost
    similar classification accuracy. The MAGIC images in the data set compressed with
    d=12 and pw=8 are on average 22.09× smaller (1.06% accuracy loss) than source
    data set (ACC =98.97 %, BPP =0.9479 ), 2.51x smaller (0.24% accuracy loss) than
    JPEG 2000 QF = 1 (ACC =98.15 %, BPP =0.1080 ), and 1.98× smaller (1.69% accuracy
    loss) than WebP QF = 1 (ACC =99.60 %, BPP =0.0851 ). Fig. 7. Comparison of source,
    WebP, JPEG 2000, and MAGIC compressed building crack images. Show All Fig. 8.
    Comparison of building crack detection accuracy (Acc) versus BPP of JPEG 2000,
    WebP, and MAGIC (proposed). Show All 2) Forest Surveillance: From the forest fire
    data set [11], we extract 643 images of which 227 have fire and 416 have no fire.
    We ignore the images which are not relevant to forests. We use 20 images from
    the data set (10 from each class) to perform the knowledge acquisition procedure.
    As knowledge acquisition parameters (Algorithm 1) we use block dimension ( bDim
    ) 64, number of iteration ( iterLimit ) 10, prune window size ( pw ) (5 and 8),
    grid dimension ( grid ) ceil((rows+cols)/20) , triangle standard deviation splitting
    threshold ( th ) 5 and cb 8 . The domain-specific pattern prediction model is
    trained in the same manner as for the infrastructure analysis task. We compress
    the remaining 623 images (excluding the knowledge acquisition learning set) using
    MAGIC with compression parameters (Algorithm 4) block dimension ( bDim ) 64, d
    (1 through 12), grid dimension ( grid ) ceil((rows+cols)/20) along with the domain-specific
    point prediction model ( model ) and the color quantization dictionary obtained
    from the knowledge acquisition stage. Again, we obtain a separate data set for
    each JPEG 2000 (QF 1–10), WebP (QF 1–10), and MAGIC settings. Fig. 9 shows sample
    images from the fire data set for JPEG 2000, WebP, and MAGIC. We extract the features
    for each data set similar to the building crack data set and carry out classification
    using a support vector machine with 30-fold cross-validation (20/80 test/train
    splits). As seen in Fig. 10, we observe the same trend from the previous data
    set. The MAGIC images compressed with d=8 and pw=8 are on average 42.65× smaller
    (2.99% accuracy loss) than source data set (ACC =97.17 %, BPP =1.864 ), 2.32×
    smaller (1.20% accuracy loss) than JPEG 2000 QF = 1 (ACC =95.38 %, BPP =0.1014
    ), and 5.85× smaller (3.18% accuracy loss) than WebP QF = 1 (ACC =97.36 %, BPP
    =0.2559 ). Fig. 9. Comparison of source, WebP, JPEG 2000, and MAGIC compressed
    forest fire detection images. Show All Fig. 10. Comparison of fire detection accuracy
    (Acc) versus BPP of JPEG 2000, WebP, and MAGIC (proposed). Show All C. Evaluation
    Beyond Lowest Quality Factor WebP and JPEG 2000 are unable to compress beyond
    QF = 1 without some level of preprocessing. On the other hand, MAGIC naturally
    can achieve a very large compression range. In Table II, we evaluate MAGIC at
    extreme levels of compression using smaller cb bit sizes. We can compress ∼167x
    more than source at ~13% accuracy loss for the fire data set and ∼69x more than
    source at ~6% accuracy loss for the building crack data set. Depending on the
    application requirements, MAGIC can gracefully tradeoff accuracy for lower BPP
    using the parameters exposed to the user. This extreme level of compression is
    possible due to MAGIC’s ability to leverage domain knowledge. TABLE II Classification
    Results for Forest Fire Detection [11] and Building Crack Detection [12] at Low
    and Ultra Low BPP for MAGIC D. MAGIC Time and Energy Analysis MAGIC, as per its
    current implementation, takes longer time to compress images as compared to JPEG
    2000 and WebP. However, as shown above, MAGIC can achieve a higher compression
    rate while still performing well when it comes to coarse-grained machine vision
    classification tasks. To explore the potential energy savings of MAGIC compression,
    we introduce a threshold, C/T Cutoff (inspired by Sadler and Martonosi [21]),
    for determining the sufficient computation and transmission energy consumption
    ratio beyond which MAGIC will be beneficial for overall energy consumption in
    a given resource-constrained computing system. With C/T Cutoff, we are comparing
    the time it takes to compress an image, with the resulting new image size. The
    C/T Cutoff for MAGIC compression (for a specific set of parameters) can be computed
    using Equation 1 where E 1 is the average MAGIC encoding time, E 2 is the average
    encoding time of the competitor method (JPEG 2000, WebP), I 1 is the average image
    size of MAGIC, I 2 is the average image size of the competitor method (JPEG 2000,
    WebP), and f is the CPU clock frequency. The resulting calculation, in clock cycles
    per byte, provides a comparison point between two compression techniques relating
    the energy required to compress an image and the energy required to transmit the
    compressed image. As an example, we have two compression techniques C 1 and C
    2 , with C 1 taking on average 2 s and resulting in 25-B images and C 2 taking
    1 s on average and resulting in 50 byte images. Using Equation 1 and a system
    with 3-GHz clock, we get a C/T Cutoff of 120. The setup time during encoding is
    due to loading the libraries and initializing the Python environment. In an amortized
    analysis for a batch operation, the setup time can be considered negligible. For
    MAGIC compression (for a specific set of parameters) to save energy when compared
    to other compression standards, the operating device must have a C/T value greater
    than MAGIC’s C/T Cutoff. In Tables III and IV, we see the C/T Cutoffs for different
    MAGIC compression settings for the building crack detection and forest fire detection
    data sets, respectively. We use f=3.7 GHz for computing the C/T cutoff values.
    Any device with C/T value greater than the cutoff will benefit (in terms of operational
    power consumption) from using MAGIC with respect to the method being compared
    against (JPEG 2000, WebP). For example, in Table IV, with MAGIC (pw = 8, cb =
    2, and d=1 ) the JPEG 2000 (JP2K) C/T cutoff is 0.492. Therefore, for MAGIC to
    be more energy-efficient than JPEG2000 compression in a given system, the energy
    for transmitting 1B of image data must be greater than the energy for executing
    492000 clock cycles. C/T_Cutoff= ∥ ∥ ∥ E 1 − E 2 I 1 − I 2 ∥ ∥ ∥ ∗f. (1) View

    Dataset [11] SECTION VI. Discussion In this section, we investigate the properties
    of the current embodiment of MAGIC. We note that the MAGIC framework can be improved
    across many dimensions. We make preliminary studies of these possibilities and
    explore future extensions of MAGIC in this section. A. Variation in Compression
    Ability The image compression technique being used must generate images of less
    size variability for maintaining consistent overall system performance. We compress
    the images using JPEG 2000, WebP and MAGIC to generate box plots showing the variation
    of BPP for the sampled distributions in Figs. 11 and 12. We observe that MAGIC
    provides low variation in BPP as compared to JPEG 2000 and WebP images. Due to
    different parameters in the knowledge acquisition and encoding phase, specifically
    pw , MAGIC has fine control over the compressed image size. Hence, MAGIC can provide
    steady performance even in biased scenarios, where other techniques may not give
    good compression. Fig. 11. Comparison of BPP variance for MAGIC, JPEG 2000, and
    WebP for building crack data set. Show All Fig. 12. Comparison of BPP variance
    for MAGIC, JPEG 2000 and WebP for forest fire data set. Show All B. Improving
    Prediction Accuracy Post-processing the MAGIC images or using a more powerful
    pattern prediction model can improve the prediction accuracy by about 1%–2%. Images
    compressed using MAGIC consist of triangulation artifacts. One way to remove the
    artifacts is to recursively subdivide the triangles and compute the approximate
    color of each sub triangle based on the colors of the triangle and its neighbors.
    Using this technique, we were able to increase the classification accuracy. However,
    there will be extra computation due to post-processing in the decoder end. If
    the decoder system resides in the cloud, then this step can be considered to squeeze
    out extra performance. As explained earlier, we use entropy features for training
    and using our NN models, but we have noticed that VGG-16 fc2 features perform
    slightly better. Using a VGG-inspired large convolution NN for carrying out the
    domain-specific pattern prediction task also improves the performance slightly.
    However, we intentionally use simple entropy features and a small NN to boost
    speed, and help reduce energy consumption and space requirements. In an application
    where time, space, and energy are not constrained, we can opt for more complex
    feature extraction methods and larger NN architectures for domain-specific pattern
    prediction. C. Time Complexity and Performance Improvements Time complexity analysis
    of encoder (Algorithm 4) and decoder (Algorithm 5) algorithms simplify to O(N+MlogM+TR)
    . The major contributors in encoding are O(N) for tiling (line 2), O(MlogM) for
    DT (line 14), and O(TR) for triangle color calculation (line 17, the pixels associated
    with a triangle are determined by searching in a rectangle circumscribing the
    triangle), where N is the number of pixels in the image, M is the number of points
    sprayed, T is the number of triangles, and R is the dimension of the bounding
    rectangle of the biggest triangle. For decoding, the contributors are O(N) for
    predicted point absolute position computation (lines 6–8), O(MlogM) for DT (line
    12), and O(TR) for triangle color assignment/drawing (line 17). In both algorithms,
    we expect the O(MlogM) DT step to consume the most time. Time complexity analysis
    of the knowledge acquisition algorithm (Algorithm 1) simplifies to O(KNlogN+KIMlogM+KITR+SVC+PQ)
    . The major contributors are O(KNlogN) for canny edge detection for all K images
    (line 7), O(KIMlogM+KITR) for the split operation across all K images (line 11),
    O(SVC) for color dictionary computation using k -means algorithm (line 29), and
    O(PQ) for training the pattern prediction model (line 30). N , M , T , and R hold
    the same meaning as before and additionally K is the number of images in the imgList
    , I is the iterLimit , S is the iteration limit for k-means algorithm, V is the
    number of points in the colorFreq map, C is the number of centroids specified
    for k -means, P is the number of training samples in trainX and trainY , and Q
    is the number of training epochs for the pattern prediction model. The runtime
    performance of both decoder and encoder can be improved through parallelization,
    hardware implementation, and code tweaking. Many of the block operations such
    as block feature extraction and point spray pattern prediction can be easily parallelized.
    Hardware implementation can provide the most speed up and may help reduce energy
    consumption as well. In future works, we will focus on improving the time and
    energy performance of MAGIC using different means. D. Manual Region-of-Interest-Guided
    Compression As previously described, ROI bias can be automatically captured by
    training the pattern prediction model with human supervised images. Beyond learning
    the ROI bias, MAGIC offers manual ROI-based compression. With this feature, users
    can specify additional regions of an image that can be retained at a higher quality.
    In Fig. 13, we see an example ROI-guided image compression where the fire region
    is designated manually as a ROI. Note that the image region with the fire maintains
    much higher information than the remaining regions. Fig. 13. ROI-guided MAGIC
    compression on a sample forest fire image [11]. Show All E. Extension of MAGIC
    to Video Compression A video can be thought of as a collection of images. To this
    end, MAGIC can be extended to process videos as well. Depending on the sampling
    rate of the image sensor, we noticed that adjacent video frames have very little
    content difference. Taking this into consideration, we can save more in terms
    of space, computation, and transmission. The two main components of a MAGIC encoded
    image are the labelsArr and the colorDict . We can represent frame[ N ] by reusing
    the colorDict and the labelArr of frame[ N−1 ]. In Equation 2, OP is the set of
    obsolete point spray patterns that are no longer present in the new frame and
    NP is the set of new point spray patterns that are introduced in the new frame.
    Similarly, as shown in Equation 3, colorDict [ N−1 ] can be modified by removing
    the obsolete triangle colors and introducing the colors of the new triangles in
    frame N . Future works will investigate and formalize the MAGIC flow applied to
    video labelsArr[N]=labelsArr[N−1]−OP+NP colorDict[N]=colorDict[N−1]−OC+NC. (2)

    devices in diverse IoT applications, specifically for a multitude of computer
    vision tasks, calls for innovation in an image compression technique that meets
    the unique requirements of these applications. They primarily require a high compression
    ratio while maintaining machine vision accuracy at an acceptable level. The MAGIC
    framework we have presented in this article addresses this need. We have shown
    that effective use of domain knowledge learned with ML can provide high compression
    in resource-constrained edge applications while keeping appropriate features for
    machine vision. The proposed framework is flexible for application in diverse
    domains and scalable to large image sizes. Our experiments for coarse-grained
    ML tasks using two data sets highlight the effectiveness of MAGIC. We achieved
    42.65× higher compression than the source (beyond JPEG 2000 and WebP) while achieving
    similar accuracy. We computed the transmission computation energy cutoffs to demonstrate
    at what level MAGIC compressed images can be more energy efficient than standard
    techniques. Furthermore, we showed low compression variance compared to standard
    image compression techniques. With the use of a common pattern dictionary, the
    proposed ML-based compression procedure can be easily extended for recognizing
    coarse-grain patterns in edge devices. Moreover, it can potentially be extended
    to video compression where domain knowledge is expected to play an even stronger
    role. Future work will investigate these extensions as well as further improvement
    in the performance of MAGIC in a variety of edge applications. Authors Figures

    © 2023 1 Introduction Internet of Things (IoT) is a powerful communication concept
    related to various areas, namely smart grids, e-health and monitoring applications
    (such as agriculture, WSN and military system). IoT is a network of interconnected
    smart devices, namely smart vehicles, smart watches, smart phones, etc., which
    are accessible by Internet [1, 2]. The smart objects integrate smart sensors to
    collect information. As this concept touches sensitive areas, many challenges
    in IoT should be overcome [3]. The present work focuses on the security of IoT
    system which is a huge challenge. A strong security and light mechanism is required
    to preclude spiteful interaction in the system. Confidentiality and privacy of
    exchanged data, authentication of users, anonymity and confidence are crucial
    needs for IoT applications that require new adequate solutions. Some solutions,
    proposed to secure Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), could be easily applied to
    IoT which is generally represented as a network of sensors. In the literature,
    many solutions that improve security challenge in IoT use different cryptographic
    methods such as Identity Based Encryption (IBE), Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC),
    Pseudonym Based Cryptography (PBC) [4], Attribute Based Encryption (ABE), Diffie
    Hellman (DH) and Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) [5, 6]. In these works [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],
    the authors discussed some solutions that use cryptographic tools to secure data
    transit in the network and overcome some security challenges in IoT and WSN. In
    what follows, we discuss other solutions that aim to secure the architecture of
    IoT and WSN. Security architecture for smart water management systems was designed
    in [18]. The architecture leverages existing security solutions and design patterns.
    Furthermore, in [19], a platform for IoT middleware solutions was provided to
    achieve connectivity of sensors and actuators to the Internet. A cloud platform
    for IoT was designed based on Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and Datagram
    TLS (DTLS) protocol [20]. The solution based on Raw public key and certificate-based
    asymmetric cryptography was dedicated for resource-constrained IoT devices. In
    [21], Ben said et al. propose a novel collaborative approach for key establishment.
    Authors proved that their collaborative key establishment leads to a reduction
    in energy consumption at the constrained device. In a previous work in 2015, a
    secure architecture for IoT and WSN areas was designed [22]. A lightweight key
    agreement, describing several scenarios of communication and how data could be
    transited between nodes was provided. In the proposed architecture, the anonymity
    of communicating nodes was emphasized. For instance, the requirements for military
    applications, such as eavesdropping, spoofing and data integrity, was discussed
    in [23] and some solutions based on cryptographic tools had been proposed to secure
    them in [24,25,26]. A bulk of research work had been proposing for mutual authentication
    in different scenarios for IoT architecture (user server or user–user) [27,28,29,30,31,32]
    which used basic cryptographic tools such as ECC, hash function and symmetric/asymmetric
    encryption. In [27], Arij et al. proposed a solution, which lied on that the fog
    user and the fog server authenticate each other anonymously. But it did not include
    a secure mechanism to ensure user intractability. Hong et al. focused on anonymous
    mutual vehicle-to-vehicle authentication [28]. Based on ECC, they had exploited
    the user of tamper proof device and achieved advanced security feature of anonymity
    and resilience to Road Side Units (RSU) compromise. However, they were hardly
    directly applied to IoT devices due to the heavy computation execution time. In
    [29], Bilal et al. presented efficient key exchange and authentication protocol
    called the Secure Mobile Sensor Network (SMSN) Authentication Protocol, which
    cannot preserve user’s anonymity and renewing identity, was not considered. Recently,
    Xin et al. [30] proposed authentication scheme with continuously updated information
    for vehicle-to-roadside unit communication. Their approach was adopting the continuously
    updated information in the authentication process. However, in their scheme, the
    key was known by the intermediate nodes which could introduce a danger to the
    system. Sowjanya et al. [32] presented a scheme which involves a new end-to-end
    authenticated algorithm for healthcare system using ECC.However, their solution
    is also hardly applied to IoT constrained devices due to the heavy computation
    execution time. The aforementioned works take into consideration either authentication,
    or key agreement, or user intractability, or exchange data, or update of network.
    To the best of our knowledge, until the time of writing this paper, the proposed
    scheme is the first that aims to support full secure lightweight IoT architecture.
    Our scheme ensures aforementioned requirements. Moreover, the mutual anonymous
    authentication and the key agreement establishment between user and server are
    guaranteed in a lightweight algorithm. The present work aims at enhancing the
    previous solution by proposing a lightweight secure algorithm based on IoT system.
    Our scheme achieves fully dynamic trust anonymous communications between entities
    with shared lightweight session key. It also fulfills the dynamic link direction
    anonymity. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Sect.  2, we
    describe our proposed scheme. We prove that our solution fulfills the majority
    of security requirements in Sect.  3. In Sect. 4, we validate our protocol’s security
    with AVISPA tools and BAN method. Section 5 illustrates the performance of our
    solution. In Sect. 6, some use cases are discussed. A conclusion ends the paper.
    2 Proposed Secure and Lightweight Algorithm for IoT System In this paper, we define
    a lightweight algorithm, which provides fully secure and safe communication for
    IoT applications such as e-health, monitoring, and military system, etc. We are
    interested in defining the security requirements for flexible critical IoT applications.
    Table 1 summarizes the parameters used in the proposed solution. Our architecture
    is composed of three entities: 1. Authority management, in which a PKG server
    containing the real identities (\\(ID_i\\)) and the \\(h(ID_i)\\) of each node
    in the system is installed. 2. The Base Station (BS): can appear as a normal node
    in our architecture. It must choose a virtual identity (\\(VID_i\\)) to communicate
    with other nodes. 3. The nodes which are denoted as (\\(N_i\\)). Each of which
    must be previously registered in the database of PKG server and then choose a
    virtual identity \\(VID_i\\). Table 1 summarizes the parameters used in the proposed
    solution. Table 1 Architecture parameters Full size table We classify all the
    security needs into two types: network security and data security. The former
    includes authentication, anonymity of node identities and secure localization
    of smart nodes. However, the latter takes account of privacy of transited information
    and data freshness. Therefore, in order to meet the security requirements, we
    propose a trusted lightweight key agreement with a fully anonymous communication.
    Table 2 PKG parameters Full size table 2.1 Network Security Our system consists
    of three phases: 1. In the first phase, a registration and mutual authentication
    algorithm will be set between the PKG server and the node. The latter must verify
    that the server is not impersonating. Also, the server needs to confirm the legitimacy
    of the node. In this phase, a lightweight-shared session key based on ECDH protocol
    is established between the server and each node. 2. The second phase is the anonymous
    authentication phase, in which data transmission between two nodes takes place
    only after verifying their legitimacy. 3. In phase three, the two communicating
    nodes create a shared session key without any preceding exchanged messages. Therefore,
    the objectives of our scheme are as follows: To achieve trust authentication property.
    To achieve anonymity property. To achieve secure link direction property. To defeat
    eavesdropping attacks which presents a big issue for IoT system. To reduce computation
    overhead. In what follows, our anonymous authentication protocol is described
    in detail. (1) Phase I (Registration phase) Note: Upon receiving any message in
    phases (I and II) at time \\(T_r\\), each entity verify the condition \\({\\varDelta
    T} < (T_r-T_t)\\). If this verification holds, the entity continue the communication
    and follow the steps mentioned below. The authority’s management (PKG) chooses
    its parameters, which are indicated in Table 2. Each node joining the network
    must send a request message \\(M_0\\) to the server in order to get its parameters
    (P,E and \\(K_{pub}\\)). \\(M_0\\) is as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} M_0:\\{T_1
    , h(ID_i \\parallel T_1), h(ID_i)\\} \\end{aligned}$$ (1) After receiving the
    message from the node, the server verifies if \\(h(ID_i)\\) is well registered
    in the database , gets \\(T_1\\), checks \\({\\varDelta T}\\) and computes \\(h(ID_i
    \\parallel T_1)\\). If that is the case, the server sends message \\(M''_0\\)
    to the node as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} M''_0:\\{T_2 , E, P, K_{pub}\\parallel
    Y \\} \\end{aligned}$$ (2) with $$\\begin{aligned} Y=h(K_{pub} \\parallel ID_i
    , T_2) \\end{aligned}$$ (3) The node will get \\(T_2\\) and computes Y. If it
    is equal with the received value, N generates two secret random numbers \\(x_i\\),\\(r_i\\)
    and then computes its public key (\\(Pub_i\\)): $$\\begin{aligned} Pub_i=x_iP
    \\end{aligned}$$ (4) and the shared key \\(K_{is}\\) with the server: $$\\begin{aligned}
    K_{is}=h(x_i* K_{pub})=h(x_isP) \\end{aligned}$$ (5) Then, as shown in Fig. 1,each
    node i sends a message \\(M_1\\) which contains its public key concatenated with
    the encrypted message using \\(K_{is}\\) which contains the node’s \\(ID_i\\),
    \\(VID_i\\)and \\(r_i\\). $$\\begin{aligned}&M_1: node \\quad i \\rightarrow Server
    \\end{aligned}$$ (6) $$\\begin{aligned}&M_1:\\{Pub_i \\parallel enc_{K_{is}}\\{ID_i
    \\parallel VID_i \\parallel r_i \\} \\end{aligned}$$ (7) Hence, the server will
    get the public key \\(Pub_i\\) and compute the session key \\(K_{is}\\): $$\\begin{aligned}
    K_{is}=h(s* Pub_i)=h(sx_iP) \\end{aligned}$$ (8) Fig. 1 Verification of trust
    communication with mutual authentication) Full size image Next, the server decrypts
    \\(M_1\\) using the shared session key and checks again if the \\(ID_i\\) is well
    registered in the database. Then, to be sure that \\(M_1\\) was not disclosed
    or altered, the server computes \\(h(Pub_i)\\) and compares it with the value
    received in the encrypted message. If they are equal, the communication is well
    established. If not, the server refuses the communication. Finally, the server
    gets the \\(VID_i\\) and r and keeps a copy of them for each node ( \\(r_i\\)
    will be used to update the \\(VID_i\\) in its database). (2) Phase II (Verification
    of trust communication with mutual authentication) The problem in critical IoT
    systems is how to verify that the transit data is delivered from a trusted node?
    This phase helps to resolve this problem. Each node even the BS will provide its
    VID to the node which wants to establish a communication with it. Then, each node
    will send an encrypted message \\(M_2\\) which contains the VID of the corresponding
    node (the node can send more than one VID) to the server in order to get its public
    keys (see Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Verification of trust communication with mutual authentication)
    Full size image $$\\begin{aligned} M_2:\\{VID_i \\parallel enc_{K_{is}}\\{VID_j
    ,T_3\\}\\} \\end{aligned}$$ (9) The server has to check if the VID is registered
    in the database. In that case, the PKG sends an encrypted message \\(M''_2\\)
    to the node which contains the public key of each corresponding VID. $$\\begin{aligned}
    M''_2:\\{enc_{K_{is}}\\{VID_j \\parallel Pub_j , T_4\\}\\} \\end{aligned}$$ (10)
    In addition, if one of VID delivered to the server does not match the ones stored
    in the database, the server will immediately broadcast a warning message containing
    this malicious VID to all nodes. Therefore, during this phase we ensure an anonymous
    mutual authentication between entities. (3) Phase III (Lightweight shared key
    agreement protocol) After verification of trust, a key agreement based on ECDH
    protocol is proceeded to secure future communication between each two nodes using
    the public key received from the server (see Fig.  2). This phase consists of
    the following two steps: Step 1 each node \\(N_i\\), even the BS, computes a session
    key \\(K_{ij}\\) with its neighbor j as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} K_{ij}=h(x_i*
    Pub_j)=h(x_ix_jP) \\end{aligned}$$ (11) Step 2 each node \\(N_i\\) will compute
    its anonymity of link direction \\(LA_{ij}\\) which will be used to conceal the
    intractability of communication relationship with node j. The usefulness of this
    parameter will be explained in the next subsection. $$\\begin{aligned} LA_{ij}=h(VID_i
    \\oplus VID_j) \\end{aligned}$$ (12) 2.2 Data Security Data security is a basic
    requirement for our systems. How can we ensure that the server receive the unaltered
    data from the nodes? How do we ensure data security in network? In this part,
    we discuss two scenarios that can occur in our architecture: Scenario 1 (see Fig.
    3) the communication is established between two nodes. In order to achieve data
    privacy and the data freshness with less computational overhead, we encrypt the
    data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) scheme. Fig. 3 Scenario
    1 communication between two nodes Full size image Therefore, the format of transited
    message \\(M_3\\) will be as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}&M_3: \\text {node} \\quad
    i \\rightarrow \\text {node} \\quad j \\end{aligned}$$ (13) $$\\begin{aligned}&M_3:\\{LD_{ij}
    \\parallel LA_{ij}\\parallel enc_{K_{ij}}\\{data \\parallel \\alpha _{i-j} \\}\\}
    \\end{aligned}$$ (14) where \\(\\alpha _{i-j}\\) is a random number generated
    by the first node sending data (this random number will be used to update the
    value of \\(LA_{ij}\\) after each transmitted message). \\(LD_{ij}\\) is the location
    identifier link, for example it can for example represent the physical connection
    between node i and j as indicated in Table 3. (Here we just give an example the
    node can tagged its neighbors as it want) Table 3 Location identifier link Full
    size table After receiving the message \\(M_3\\), the receiver node gets the \\(LD_{ij}\\)
    and identifies the sender node. For example, if \\(''''LD_{ij}=00''''\\), the
    smart node will deduce know that the sender is the node under it. Thus, the node
    will: Deduce the sender node \\(VID_j\\). Verify \\(LA_{ij}=h(VID_i \\oplus VID_j)\\)
    Decrypt the message using the corresponding shared key \\(K_{ij}\\) and retrieve
    the data and \\(\\alpha _{i-j}\\) Update the value of \\(LA_{ij}\\) using \\(\\alpha
    _{i-j}\\) :\\(LA_{ij}^*= h(LA_{ij} \\oplus \\alpha _{i-j}\\)) and revokes the
    previous value. We note that upon receiving the request message from the node
    \\(N_i\\), the destination node j must send an encrypted ACK message to the sender.
    The goal of using the LA is to provide a secure localization to the nodes and
    ensure the intractability of messages because an attacker who does not know the
    link direction of each message cannot eavesdrop the network. In sensitive IoT
    domains, keeping the same VID for nodes in the network can help realize a dangerous
    attack on a system. Therefore, we need to update the whole network. The PKG server
    will randomly choose timer \\(T_0\\), which delivered to all intervening nodes
    in the network to update their \\(VID_i\\). After computing the new VID, it must
    be sent to other nodes in the network using the shared key. The server will update
    its database of virtual identities using the random \\(r_j\\) which is delivered
    in \\(M_0\\). The server and each node will compute the new \\(VID^*\\): $$\\begin{aligned}
    VID_i^*=h(VID_i \\oplus r_i) \\end{aligned}$$ (15) After sending a new \\(T_0\\),
    the recursive updated new value will be: $$\\begin{aligned} VID_i^{**}=h(VID_i^*
    \\oplus r_i) \\end{aligned}$$ (16) Scenario 2 in this scenario (see Fig. 4), the
    communication is between a node and the server ( in the case when sensitive data
    must be delivered directly to the server). This scenario can be applied in monitoring
    systems or cluster networks Firstly, we assume that each node finds the link direction
    to the BS (hop by hop). Fig. 4 Scenario 2 Full size image The node \\(N_{i}\\)
    sends message \\(M_4\\) to the closest neighbor on its path to the BS. Consequently,
    the format of transit message will be as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}&M_4: \\text
    {node} \\quad i \\rightarrow \\text {node} \\quad j \\end{aligned}$$ (17) $$\\begin{aligned}&M_4
    \\qquad :\\{LD_{ij} \\parallel LA_{ij} \\parallel enc_{K_{ij}}\\{SVID_i \\nonumber
    \\\\&\\quad \\parallel enc_{K_{is}}(data \\parallel N \\parallel SVID_i) \\parallel
    \\alpha _{i-j}\\}\\} \\end{aligned}$$ (18) We note: N is a special nonce created
    by the node for the server to overcome the replay attack. Source Sender node \\(SVID_i\\)
    must be concatenated in each forwarded message. After receiving \\(M_4\\), the
    node will follow the same steps as in scenario 1. After decrypting the message,
    the node j will find another encrypted message. In this case, it will prepare
    a new message \\(M''_4\\) with the same form and send it to its closest neighbor
    on the BS path. $$\\begin{aligned}&M''_4 \\qquad : \\text {node} \\quad j \\rightarrow
    \\text {node} \\quad r \\nonumber \\\\&\\quad \\text {(BS must be appear as normal
    node)} \\end{aligned}$$ (19) $$\\begin{aligned}&M''_4 \\qquad : \\{LD_{jr} \\parallel
    LA_{jr} \\parallel enc_{K_{jr}}\\nonumber \\\\&\\quad \\{SVID_i \\parallel enc_{K_{is}}
    (data \\parallel N \\parallel SVID_i) \\parallel \\alpha _{j-r}\\} \\} \\end{aligned}$$
    (20) Finally, if the message reaches the BS, it decrypts the message \\(M''_4\\)
    with the shared key \\(K_{jr}\\). After that, when the BS finds that the data
    is encrypted, it will automatically send the message to the server using its shared
    session key. $$\\begin{aligned}&M_5: \\text {node} \\quad r \\text {(BS)} \\rightarrow
    \\text {server}: \\end{aligned}$$ (21) $$\\begin{aligned}&M_5 \\qquad : \\{VID_r
    \\parallel enc_{K_{rs}}\\{SVID_i \\parallel enc_{K_{is}}\\nonumber \\\\&\\quad
    (VID_i \\parallel data \\parallel N \\parallel SVID_i)\\}\\} \\end{aligned}$$
    (22) After receiving \\(M_5\\), the server will: Decrypt the message using \\(K_{rs}\\)
    Find the sender node \\(SVID_i\\) Use the corresponding session key \\(K_{is}\\)to
    encrypt the inside message and send an encrypted ACK message which contains the
    nonce N. 3 Security Analysis In this section, we will demonstrate that our proposed
    architecture can achieve the most IoT’s security requirements. 3.1 Server Impersonation
    Attack In this attack, an adversary can masquerade as a server and try to respond
    to the node by sending (E,P and \\(K_{pub}\\)). Our scheme can resist this attack
    because: In the registration phase, the node must send the \\(h(ID_i \\parallel
    T_1)\\) to the server before getting \\(K_{pub}\\) which will be used to generate
    the shared key. The server must reply with \\(M''_0:(E,P,K_{pub},h(ID_i \\parallel
    K_{pub}\\parallel T_1)\\)). So even if an attacker gets the public key, he/she
    cannot get the \\(ID_i\\) which is a pre-shared secret between the server and
    a legitimate node. 3.2 User Impersonation Attack In such an attack, an adversary
    may try to masquerade as a legitimate user to the server. However, our proposed
    scheme resists this attack because firstly each node previously registers its
    real ID in the PKG. Secondly, in the registration phase we send the \\(ID_i\\)
    using hash function which is considered as a collision-resistant one-way hash
    function. So, it hard for an attacker to get the real ID of a node. 3.3 Known
    Key Secrecy In our scheme, it is hard to disclose the shared session key \\(K_{ij}=h(x_ix_jP)\\)
    for the following reasons: each node \\(N_i\\) gets the public parameter \\(Pub_j\\)
    from the server to construct a valid session key. Accordingly, there is no previous
    exchanged data before establishing the key. Moreover, the attacker cannot guess
    the two nodes which will establish a future communication. Each session key is
    hashed with one-way hash function. Therefore, no information can be retrieved
    from the session key. Our proposed scheme achieves the known key secrecy property.
    3.4 Accomplishment of Authentication In the proposed scheme, each node authenticates
    its neighbor node by checking its virtual identity, which is sent in the encrypted
    message \\(M_2\\), where only a legitimate node can form \\(M_2\\) which requires
    a valid shared Key \\(K_{is}\\).Furthermore, the establishment of the shared key
    \\(K_{ij}\\) requires \\(Pub_j\\), this is possible only if the node receives
    the message \\(M''_2\\) from PKG to confirm the legitimacy of corresponding node.
    Besides, in case a malicious node (MN) joins the network, the server will be informed
    by MN’s neighbors. Therefore, the two communicating nodes can authenticate their
    legitimacy in the network. In this way, our proposed architecture satisfies the
    mutual authentication property. 3.5 Accomplishment of the Anonymity In the proposed
    scheme, thanks to the use of PBC, the security challenge of anonymity is granted.
    We take advantage of the use of a random number \\(x_i\\) to allow the intervening
    nodes to create their own virtual identity \\(VID_i\\) and \\(Pub_i\\) which is
    equivalent to the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). As ECDLP
    is considered to be a computationally hard problem [33, 34], the adversary cannot
    retrieve a valid \\(x_i\\). Hence, our scheme preserves the user anonymity property.Therefore,
    smart nodes always remain anonymous to their neighbors because they never use
    their ID during the communication. Moreover, the execution of dynamic timer (\\(T_0\\))
    to update users’ virtual identities ensures that an attacker, even when he/she
    uses the eavesdropping attack, could never retrieve the node’s virtual identity.
    This can be realized using message \\(M''_2\\) which contains the new \\(VID_i\\).
    This cannot be concealed, because it is encrypted with a trusted shared key. Thus,
    our proposed scheme is quite effective for privacy against active attacks because
    the nodes verify their neighbors’ identities by sending an encrypted message to
    the server. Moreover, when a node updates its virtual identity; the node can verify
    the legitimacy of sender node by calculating the LA, which is derived from the
    first virtual identity used in the communication. Therefore, a malicious node
    cannot intervene in the network. 3.6 Accomplishment of the Secure Localization
    Concealing node’s location is very important. Our proposed anonymous scheme can
    easily resolve this issue. If the attacker wants to discover the node location,
    he/she must first recognize the identity of the target node and then eavesdrop
    the link direction of transited message. Furthermore, the intractability of transit
    message is fulfilled due the use of updated Anonymity of link direction (LA),
    target Link identifier (LD) and updated Virtual Identity (VID). It is worth mentioning
    that the value of LA is updated after each forwarded message. Thus, discovering
    the target node location is impossible. 3.7 Resistance to Man in the Middle (MITM),
    Replay and Forgery Attacks All messages in the registration phase include the
    timestamps. Since the maximum transmission delay \\({\\varDelta T}\\) is very
    short, an adversary cannot repeat the messages. Therefore, the registration phase
    resists the MITM attack. The attacker cannot replay the same messages \\(M_3/M_4/M_5\\)
    between two communicating nodes since the LA parameter in each forwarded message
    cannot be sent twice. Hence, if the attacker tries to intercept and resend the
    same request message using the same LA, the receiver can easily detect the repeated
    values. Similarly, if the attacker attempts to send the same response message
    to the node, the node can easily detect that the value of LA is not be equal to
    the updated value \\(LA_{ij}^*= h(LA_{ij} \\oplus \\alpha _{i-j})\\). In conclusion,
    our proposed protocol can resist replay attacks. Furthermore, an attacker may
    also attempt to intercept and modify the first \\(LA_{ij}=h(VID_i \\oplus VID_j)\\)
    which is derived from the first sender node. In that case, the attacker, who wants
    to play the role of the first sender node, needs to construct a valid request
    message with a valid session key \\(K_{ij}\\) to in order to send the parameter
    \\(\\alpha _{i-j}\\). However, to do that, he/she needs to use a valid virtual
    identity and follow the aforementioned steps mentioned previously (in phases 1
    and 2). He/she must be authenticated to the server and. Since this is not the
    case, the node can detect that the sender of the message is a malicious node.
    If the attacker is a receiver node, it needs to know the shared secret key \\(K_{ij}\\)
    to get the parameter \\(\\alpha _{i-j}\\), which is quite impossible for him/her
    to figure out. In that case, the attacker needs to form a valid response message
    and also to know the secret key \\(K_{ij}\\). Therefore, our proposed scheme can
    resist forgery attacks. 3.8 Accomplishment of the Data Security The exchanged
    data in our proposed network cannot be easily altered by the adversary. It is
    worth noticing that every transmitted message is encrypted with AES-128 using
    the trust session key \\(K_{ij}\\) whose secrecy has been proved above. 4 Validation
    Results 4.1 Formal Security Analysis Using BAN Logic We apply the BAN logic [35,
    36] in order to proof the validity of authentication between a legal node \\(N_i\\)
    and PKG-Server. Using the BAN logic, we show that the node and server determine
    whether the exchanged information are secure and trust worthy against eavesdropping.
    It comprises the verification of the message origin, the message freshness and
    the origin’s trustworthiness. In order to well describe the BAN logic in formal
    terms, we use the following rules: Rule 1The message meaning rule for the shared
    secret keys is given by \\(R_1\\): $$\\begin{aligned} R_1: \\frac{P| \\equiv Q
    \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{K} P,P\\lhd \\{X\\}_{K}}{P|\\equiv
    Q| \\sim X} \\end{aligned}$$ (23) P believes that Q once said X, if P believes
    that K is shared with Q and sees X is encrypted under K. Rule 2The nonce verification
    rule is given by \\(R_2\\): $$\\begin{aligned} R_2: \\frac{P|\\equiv \\# (X),P|\\equiv
    Q| \\sim X}{P|\\equiv Q| \\equiv X} \\end{aligned}$$ (24) P believes that Q believes
    X, if P believes that X has been uttered recently (freshness) and P believes that
    Q once said X. Rule 3The jurisdiction rule \\(R_3\\) is as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    R_3: \\frac{P|\\equiv Q |\\equiv X,P|\\equiv Q\\Rightarrow X}{P|\\equiv X} \\end{aligned}$$
    (25) P believes X, if P believes that Q has jurisdiction over X, and P believes
    that Q believes a message X. Rule 4The freshness rule is given by \\(R_4\\): $$\\begin{aligned}
    R_4: \\frac{P|\\equiv \\# (X)}{P|\\equiv \\# (X,Y)} \\end{aligned}$$ (26) If one
    part of the message is known to be fresh, then the entire message must be fresh.
    4.1.1 Validation Results of Registration Phase (Phase1) In the proposed scheme,
    the node must prove the correctness of the message. Lemma 1 The node can correctly
    verify the authenticity of the server. Proof The node generates time stamp \\(T_1\\)
    and send \\(M_0\\). The PKG receive \\(T_1\\) verify if \\(h(ID_i)\\) is well
    registered and compute \\(h(ID_i \\parallel T_1)\\). Then, the server send \\(M''_0\\).
    The generic form of the exchanged messages between the node and the PKG are as
    follows: $$\\begin{aligned}&N_i: \\rightarrow PKG :M_0: T_1, h(ID_i),h(ID_i \\parallel
    T_1) \\end{aligned}$$ (27) $$\\begin{aligned}&PKG: \\rightarrow N_i :M''_0 : T_2,
    E,P,K_{Pub}, h(K_{pub} \\parallel ID_i \\parallel T_2) \\end{aligned}$$ (28) Subsequently,
    we translate the messages \\(M_0\\) and \\(M''_0\\) into their idealized forms
    as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}&N_i: \\rightarrow PKG :M_0:T_1,(PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i,T_1)_{(PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{ID_{i}}
    N_i)} \\end{aligned}$$ (29) $$\\begin{aligned}&PKG: \\rightarrow N_i : M''_0 :E,P,K_{Pub},
    T_2,(K_{pub},PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i,T_2)_{(PKG
    \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i)} \\end{aligned}$$ (30)
    Recall that in our proposed scheme, the ID must be previously registered in the
    data base of server PKG. We make the following assumptions about the initial state
    of the proposed algorithm: Assumptions: \\(A_0: N_i| \\equiv PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i\\) \\(A_1: PKG| \\equiv PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i\\) \\(A_2: PKG| \\equiv \\# (T_1)\\) \\(A_3: N_i| \\equiv
    \\# (T_2)\\) \\(A_4: N_i| \\equiv PKG| \\Rightarrow (K_{pub},PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i,T_2)\\) Goals: \\(G_1: PKG| \\equiv PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i\\) \\(G_2 : N_i| \\equiv PKG| \\equiv K_{pub}\\) \\(G_3
    : N_i| \\equiv K_{pub}\\) According to \\(M_0\\) and \\(A_1\\), we get directly
    (Goal1): $$\\begin{aligned} P_0 :PKG| \\equiv PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i . \\end{aligned}$$ (31) According to \\(A_3\\), \\(M''_0\\)
    and rule 4 we get : $$\\begin{aligned} P_1: \\frac{N_i|\\equiv \\# (T_2)}{N_i|\\equiv
    \\# (K_{pub},PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i,T_2)}
    \\end{aligned}$$ (32) According to \\(P_1\\) and \\(M''_0\\), we apply the nonce
    verification rule (Rule 2) to get (Goal2): $$\\begin{aligned} P_2: \\frac{N_i|\\equiv
    \\# (K_{Pub},PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i,T_2),N_i|\\equiv
    PKG| \\sim (K_{Pub},PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{ID_{i}} N_i,T_2)}{N_i|\\equiv
    PKG| \\equiv (K_{Pub})} \\end{aligned}$$ (33) According to \\(P_2\\), \\(A_4\\)
    and \\(R_3\\), we get (Goal3): $$\\begin{aligned} P_3: \\frac{N_i|\\equiv PKG
    |\\equiv K_{Pub},N_i|\\equiv PKG\\Rightarrow (K_{Pub})}{N_i| \\equiv (K_{Pub})}
    \\end{aligned}$$ (34) This shows that node can correctly verify the legitimacy
    of the server PKG. \\(\\square\\) 4.1.2 Validation Results of Mutual Authentication
    Phase (Phase2) In our proposed scheme, the node \\(N_i\\) asks the server about
    the correctness of a legal node \\(N_j\\) which wants to establish communication
    with it. Lemma 2 The node verifies the legitimacy of communicating node. Proof
    the node send an encrypted message \\(M_2\\) using \\(K_{is}\\) which contain
    the \\(VID_j\\). The server PKG responds with encrypted message \\(M''_2\\) ,
    which includes time stamp \\(T_4\\), \\(VID_j\\), and \\(Pub_j\\). The generic
    form of the exchanged messages between the node and the PKG are as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}&N_i:
    \\rightarrow PKG :M_2:enc_{K_{is}}\\{VID_j ,T_3\\} \\end{aligned}$$ (35) $$\\begin{aligned}&PKG:
    \\rightarrow N_i :M''_2:enc_{K_{is}}\\{VID_j \\parallel Pub_j ,T_4\\} \\end{aligned}$$
    (36) Subsequently, we translate the messages into their idealized forms as follows:
    $$\\begin{aligned}&N_i: \\rightarrow PKG :M_2:(VID_j,T_3)_{(PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{k_{is}}N_i)} \\end{aligned}$$ (37) $$\\begin{aligned}&N_i: \\rightarrow
    PKG :M''_2:(VID_j,Pub_j,T_4)_{(PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{k_{is}}
    N_i)} \\end{aligned}$$ (38) Assumptions: \\(A_5: PKG| \\equiv \\# (T_3)\\) \\(A_6:
    N_i| \\equiv \\# (T_4)\\) \\(A_7: N_i| \\equiv PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{k_{is}} N_i\\) \\(A_8: PKG| \\equiv PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{k_{is}} N_i\\) \\(A_9: PKG| \\equiv N_i \\Rightarrow (VID_j,T_3)\\)
    \\(A_{10}: N_i| \\equiv PKG \\Rightarrow (VID_j,Pub_j,T_4)\\) Goals: \\(G_4:PKG|\\equiv
    N_i \\sim (VID_j)\\) \\(G_5:N_i|\\equiv PKG |\\equiv (VID_j,Pub_j)\\) \\(G_6:N_i|\\equiv
    (VID_j,Pub_j)\\) The PKG verifies the correctness of \\(M_2\\) as follows: According
    to \\(A_8\\), \\(M_2\\)and rule 1 (Goal 4): $$\\begin{aligned} P_4: \\frac{PKG|
    \\equiv PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{k_{is}} N_i,PKG\\lhd \\{VID_j,T_3\\}_{PKG
    \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow }\\limits ^{k_{is}} N_i}}{PKG|\\equiv N_i| \\sim
    (VID_j)} \\end{aligned}$$ (39) The node \\(N_i\\) identifies the legitimacy of
    \\(VID_j\\) as follows: According to \\(A_7\\) ,\\(M''_2\\) and rule 1 we obtain:
    $$\\begin{aligned} P_5: \\frac{N_i| \\equiv PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{k_{is}} N_i,N_i\\lhd \\{VID_j,Pub_j,T_4\\}_{PKG \\mathop {\\longleftrightarrow
    }\\limits ^{k_{is}} N_i}}{N_i|\\equiv PKG| \\sim (VID_j,Pub_j,T_4)} \\end{aligned}$$
    (40) According to \\(A_6\\) and rule 4, we get: $$\\begin{aligned} P_6: \\frac{N_i|
    \\equiv \\#(T_4) }{N_i|\\equiv \\#(VID_j,Pub_j,T_4)} \\end{aligned}$$ (41) According
    to \\(P_5\\), \\(P_6\\) and rule 2, we get (Goal 5): $$\\begin{aligned} P_7: \\frac{N_i|
    \\equiv \\#(VID_j,Pub_j),PKG|\\equiv N_i| \\sim (VID_j,Pub_j)}{N_i|\\equiv PKG
    |\\equiv (VID_j,Pub_j)} \\end{aligned}$$ (42) According to \\(A_{10}\\), \\(P_7\\)
    and rule 3, we obtain (Goal6): $$\\begin{aligned} P_8: \\frac{N_i|\\equiv PKG
    |\\equiv (VID_j,Pub_j),N_i|\\equiv PKG\\Rightarrow (VID_j,Pub_j)}{N_i|\\equiv
    (VID_j,Pub_j)} \\end{aligned}$$ (43) This shows that node can correctly verify
    the legitimacy of nodes. \\(\\square\\) 4.2 Formal Security Analysis Using AVISPA
    In order to demonstrate the security performance of our solution, we used the
    Automatic Validation of Internet Protocols and Application (AVISPA) analyzer [37].
    We verify in this phase the secrecy of \\(SK_{is}\\) and \\(SK_{ij}\\). Moreover,
    we prove that our transmitted messages: \\(M_0, M''_0, M_1, M''_1, M_2,M''_2,
    M_3, M_4, M''_4\\) and \\(M_5\\) are transited in a secure way. The automatic
    validation demonstrates that the proposed keys and architecture are safe and no
    attacks were found. The security goals of AVISPA are fulfilled. The output of
    On-the-fly-Model-Checker (OFMC) is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 The OFMC output Full
    size image 5 Security Performance As can be seen in Table 4, our proposed architecture
    fulfills most of the security challenges in IoT applications such as sender/receiver
    anonymity, BS anonymity, link direction anonymity and mutual authentication, which
    provides trust between communicating nodes as well as the secrecy of transited
    data. Therefore, our solution gives important enhancement of security compared
    to some existing solutions. Table 4 Security performance Full size table In the
    remainder of this section, we will evaluate the time performance to create the
    shared key and encryption/decryption time needed for the proposed solution. The
    most important parameter influencing the IBE performance, which is the most critical
    point that can judge the feasibility of deploying our solution, will be the speed
    of the cryptographic operations (private/public parameters generation time). In
    this performance analysis, we mainly measure the speed of the cryptographic operations
    without considering the underlying network architecture at this phase. We implemented
    the PKG, through employing the IBE demo provided within Miracl library [38] using
    the elliptic curve \\(''''k2ss.ecs''''\\) with p is 512 bits prime number. In
    what follows, all the measures are real measures from the implementation realized
    using a computer with Intel Core (TM) 2 Duo CPU @ 2.4GHz in the server side and
    a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B ARM Cortex-A53 CPU 1.2 GHz 64-Bit Quad-Core 1GB RAM running
    Ubuntu 16.04 IOS in the node side (see Fig. 6). Fig. 6 Implementation of the testbed
    platform Full size image We choose SHA-256 which takes an arbitrary length message
    in blocks of 512 bits as input and produces a SHA-256 output of 256 bits. Moreover,
    we also utilize AES-128 as enc(.) and dec(.). We calculated the time cost for
    different operations in protocol. Suppose \\(T_H\\), \\(T_{enc}\\), \\(T_{dec}\\),
    \\(T_F\\), \\(T_{mul}\\), \\(T_{hmac}\\) denote respectively time cost for one
    hash function operation, one encryption operation, one decryption operation, one
    Fuzzy extractor operation, one-point multiplication, one pairing operation, one
    MAC operation which are as indicated in Table 5. Table 5 Definition and execution
    time of computational operations Full size table 5.1 Computation Complexity Until
    this work is proposed, there is no contribution that has completely the same architecture
    that guarantees and covers all security steps: registration, mutual authentication,
    setting up session keys, exchanging information, updating of identity and the
    anonymity of link direction. By analyzing our scheme, the user/IoT device performs
    light computation. In Phase I, we only need two hash operations (see \\(M_0\\))
    to submit necessary information and one hash operation to receive security parameters
    such as E, P and public key of server(see \\(M''_0)\\). The setup of session key
    between node and server need only one hash operation. In Phase II, both node and
    the server need one symmetric encryption and decryption operation. The server
    is receiving many requests from different nodes. In our architecture, the server
    has nearly unlimited computation resources which make the computation consumption
    affordable. In the proposed solution, we do not need exhaustive previous exchanged
    message to create the shared session key between two nodes. To the best of our
    knowledge, our scheme is the only one considering the invocation of Anonymity
    of Link direction (LA) to fulfill intractability with a simple hash operation.
    Also,in our scheme, we took into account the update of the VID of nodes. This
    process requires only one hash operation. 5.2 Computation Time and Comparison
    with Closely Related Work For the overhead, we compare our proposed scheme with
    others in the aspects of registration /mutual authentication, session key, Anonymity
    of link Direction and renewing of VID phases. In Table 6 , we only compare the
    time cost in the registration and mutual authentication phase between node and
    the server. Table 6 Computation comparisons Full size table We discuss closely
    related work [27,28,29,30, 32]. where the mutual authentication and registration
    phase takes 370.43 ms 200 ms, 120.258 ms , 90.086 ms , 13.916 ms , which are 36.57,
    20 , 11.87 , 1.98 , 1.3 times consumption respectively compared with ours using
    raspberry card (see Fig. 7). Also, when we use Intel core, our scheme still more
    less computation cost as indicated in Table  7 and Fig 7. Fig. 7 Comparison of
    computation time Full size image Table 7 comparison of the execution time Full
    size table 6 Use Cases In this section, we demonstrate that our scheme can be
    applied in Wireless Sensor network (WSN) and Internet of Things (IoT) critical
    applications as monitoring in military systems and e-health. The main issue in
    these applications is to have fully secure environments,to guarantee the privacy
    of users real identities and to ensure secrecy of data . In IoT applications as
    e-health: we consider the node i as a patient and the node j as a doctor and the
    authority management (PKG server) in the ministry of health. By applying our architecture,
    patient guaranteed that he communicates with legitimate doctor. Moreover, all
    information between patient and doctor will be exchanged in safely. Further, patient
    will be sure that his identity cannot be concealed by the doctor. In the case
    of WSN, we consider ,as application, a military monitoring system. In this system,
    denote The authority management can be the ministry of defense, where a PKG server,
    containing the identities of military forces such as soldiers’ identities or air
    forces identities or navy identities. The military equipment fitted with different
    smart sensors is denoted as node i. The Base Station (BS)can appear as a normal
    sensor node in our architecture to keep the BS anonymity. In this case, our proposed
    guarantee a mutual anonymous authentication between nodes. Moreover,the scheme
    fulfill the confidentiality of transmitted data and can resist several attacks
    which are mentioned above. 7 Conclusion Security is a big challenge in IoT in
    several areas. To date, the benefits of a fully lightweight safe IoT system have
    not been studied in depth. The main objective in this article is to build a fully
    secure lightweight and trust architecture. Moreover, to overcome the tractability
    problem, we integrated the anonymity of link direction and dynamic virtual identities.
    Our approach ensures trust, authentication, anonymity and confidentiality. To
    demonstrate the resistance of our algorithm against several attacks, AVISPA tools
    and BAN method were used. The results of the system’s evaluation using MIRACL
    library, Raspberry cards, show that the execution time is adequate to the constrained
    IoT devices. References Miorandi, D., Sicari, S., De Pellegrini, F., & Chlamtack,

    IEEE Conference Location: Denver, CO, USA SECTION I. Introduction As wireless
    technologies are gaining a strong foothold in agriculture, more tasks can be accomplished
    through connected devices such as cameras, sensors, drones and robots, thus facilitating
    rapid access to reliable data in decision making which can have significant financial
    implications. This influx of connected devices available to farmers coupled with
    ag data analytics form precision agriculture. On average, the farmers spend a
    lot of their time monitoring crop development and analyzing how the crops respond
    to their crop management practices. With advanced wireless technologies, farmers
    can remotely observe the development of their crops without being in the field.
    Timely periodical reports summarizing data collected from a variety of sensors
    monitoring the fluctuation of soil moisture, tree foliage, temperature, nitrogen,
    humidity, pH, CO2 can be forwarded to a Farm Management System through radio links.
    While these substantial advances in farming aim at assisting farmers in maintaining
    good crop growing conditions, they also enable farmers to predict and prevent
    plant diseases, detect bugs, geolocate the right parcels that will help to optimize
    yields, decide which fertilizers to use, control irrigation systems, and develop
    new agricultural practices. Advanced agricultural practices coupled with IoT-based
    technology [1],[2] aim at growing crops in controlled environments in order to
    enhance yields. With the recent advances in genetic improvement via breeding,
    phenotyping is emerging as a promising crop engineering based technique in agriculture.
    Phenotyping is the process of analyzing traits to select more productive and less
    input-demanding genotypes. High-resolution RGB imaging enables the identification
    of favorable phenotypic traits (e.g., leaf arrangement) and thus more productive
    genotypes. Implantable plant nanosensors not only enable breeders to identify
    hybrids requiring less agricultural inputs but also enable farmers to optimize
    functions such as fertilization and irrigation. The selection of an appropriate
    wireless technology depends on agricultural application requirements. For instance,
    some applications may require low data rate and low energy consumption (e.g.,
    sensor-based measurements) while others will require high data rates and can accommodate
    more power consumption (e.g., video streaming). For the connectivity between sensors,
    Zigbee is typically used for short range communications, Bluetooth Low-Energy
    (BLE) for applications that have low-power requirements, LoRa for applications
    with low data rates and long range requirements, and narrowband technology (e.g.,
    NB-IoT, SigFox) for applications where a large number of sensors transmit a small
    amount of data at the same time. For long-range communications between in-field
    devices (wireless sensors, UAVs, robots) and the Cloud, existing solutions employ
    LTE or WiFi. LTE does not scale well since it involves a subscription fee which
    can be costly for large farms [3]. As for WiFi, signals operating in the 2. 4GHz
    band may suffer from attenuation, scattering, absorption and diffraction caused
    by vegetation [4]. IEEE ratified the 802.11af standard also known as TVWS that
    uses spare channels in the low frequency radio spectrum traditionally allocated
    to television: 470MHz to 698MHz (UHF and VHF bands). One advantage of the TVWS
    band is an extended range of 10 to 15 km, or more in good conditions (up to 30
    km in flat terrain). Signals at TVWS band can more easily spread over rugged areas,
    through forests or buildings, where higher-frequency signals experience interference.
    Thus, TVWS communication is ideal in near-line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight
    scenarios. Another benefit is that only TV signals are potential interferers.
    Because TVWS uses lower frequencies that can penetrate obstacles and enable the
    use of applications with different bandwidth requirements [3], it is an appealing
    candidate for smart agriculture. However, only a few TVWS measurement campaigns
    exist and they have only focused on rural [5] and indoor environments [6]. Assessing
    TVWS performance in harsh agricultural settings has yet to be done. In this paper,
    we present a measurement campaign of TVWS wireless channels at Curtiss Farm, a
    research farm located in Ames, Iowa, USA. We deploy an end-to-end TVWS network
    between the farm office and the fields, and perform an extensive measurement study
    of TVWS channels by taking into consideration antennas’ placement, variations
    of temperature and humidity, crop diversity (soybean vs. corn), height and density
    of corn fields. Some past studies analyzed the impact of crops [7],[8],[9] and
    the impact of weather [10],[11],[12] on the signal propagation. However, they
    focused exclusively on IEEE 802.15.4 WSNs. To date, there is no comprehensive
    study of TVWS in such agricultural settings. This measurement campaign provides
    unique insight into the spatiotemporal behaviour of TVWS channels in corn fields.
    Particularly, the contributions from our measurement campaign are as follows:
    We perform a detailed real-world measurement analysis of the spatiotemporal behaviour
    of TVWS channels subject to a variety of environmental factors such as weather
    components, antenna heights, crop varieties, crop densities and distance from
    the TVWS Access Point. We measure Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Received
    Signal Strength (RSS), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), noise and throughput using
    actual OpenWrt-based TVWS radios from HuWoMobility, and we assess how aforementioned
    metrics are impacted by environmental factors. Representative key findings of
    this study are summarized in Table I. We investigate which path loss model is
    most applicable to TVWS in agricultural environments according to the empirical
    path loss computed for different antenna heights. We find out that, when antennas
    are close to the ground, the path loss is better modeled by the Okumura-Hata (suburban)
    path loss model, and, for higher antenna heights, it is better modeled by the
    Plane Earth path loss model. TABLE I 95% Confidence Intervals of the Impact of

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we take a look at
    the current context and environment in which this measurement campaign was conducted.
    Then, Section III covers the methodology and tools used for this study. The measurement
    results are presented and analyzed in Section IV. Finally, we conclude this study
    by a summary on our key findings in Section V. SECTION II. Preliminaries CyNet
    wireless living lab. CyNet [13] is an end-to-end software-defined cyberinfrastructure
    integrating advanced field-deployed wireless networks for agriculture and transportation
    research. It is a joint effort between the ISU Department of Electrical and Computer
    Engineering (ECE), ISU Institute for Transportation (InTrans) and ISU Plant Science
    Institute (PSI). Due to its wireless resource virtualization through whole-stack
    slicing [14], it is an ideal platform for prototyping and deploying new PHY and
    MAC layers in the field, as well as Predictable, Reliable, Real-time, and high-Throughput
    (PRRT) algorithms for research and education in smart agriculture and smart transportation.
    CyNet consists of two cellular RANs deployed at the Iowa State University (ISU)
    Curtiss Research Farm and Research Park in the City of Ames, Iowa, USA. Each RAN
    targets a specific use case: the former is aimed at smart agriculture while the
    later is aimed at smart transportation. The Curtiss Research Farm RAN is composed
    of LTE and TVWS technologies. This study focuses on the TVWS technology. CyNet
    agriculture use case. The ISU Plant Science Institute (PSI) is a leader in plant
    phenotyping, genotyping, and nanosensors. In recent years, Schnable’s team and
    their collaborators have deployed Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) with high-definition
    cameras, ∼ 100 implantable nitrate sensors and ∼ 1,000 stationary cameras for
    phenotype analysis in the ISU Curtiss Research Farm (see Figure 1). Each camera
    records an image of an individual row of 6 corn plants every 5 minutes and each
    sensor records a reading every 10 seconds. In the current solar-powered deployment,
    the cameras and sensors are controlled by Raspberry Pi single board microcomputers,
    and the Raspberry Pis are connected to a field-deployed server via WiFi Access
    Points. The server collects, renames, and stores photos on a local hard drive.
    The server also displays information about the system’s health, to help diagnose
    any potential problems with the system. As part of the connectivity use cases,
    interconnecting the in-field PSI server to the farm to access and analyse data
    anytime, anywhere is crucial. Fig. 1: Stationary field cameras for phenotype analysis
    Show All In-field TVWS Radio Access Network. To establish connectivity between
    different in-field devices (UAVs, UGVs, cameras) and the farm office, we have
    secured an FCC experimental license in the TVWS spectrum bands. A 18m pole has
    also been installed at Curtiss Farm, and it is equipped with TVWS Access Points,
    Tower Mounted Boosters (TMBs), directional and omnidirectional antennas in order
    to provide connectivity from the farm office to the in-field devices. An overview
    of the in-field TVWS network is presented in Figure 2. Fig. 2: CyNet TVWS network
    Show All The in-field TVWS network considered in this study is composed of two
    TVWS devices: The TVWS AP (Access Point) mounted on the 18 m pole is plugged to
    directional antennas as depicted in Figure 3. This TVWS AP is connected to a Cisco
    Catalyst switch in an enclosure inside the farm office. The switch interconnects
    the farm to the ISU Durham data center through an optical backhaul link. The TVWS
    CPE (Customer Premise Equipment) is used to cover several location points for
    measurement data collection. It is connected through SMA cables to 2×2 MIMO antennas
    and through Ethernet to a Dell Laptop that runs an automation script sending probes
    to the TVWS AP and storing measurements for further analysis. SECTION III. Methodology
    In this section we discuss the rationale behind the selection of in-field location
    points, the devices used during the measurement campaign along with their configurations,
    the spatial coverage of the TVWS directional antennas and the relevance of the
    metrics collected to characterize the TVWS channel quality. Finally, we describe
    the tools and overall process used to conduct all the measurements. A. In-field
    location points Figure 4 shows the probed area in Curtiss Farm. The map indicates
    the location points denoted by LPX. We carefully selected the location points
    that exhibit high diversities such as crop type, crop density, and crop height.
    To demonstrate the impact of crop types on channel quality, we picked pairs of
    location points close to each other where one is within a corn field and the other
    in a soybean field (i.e., LP25-LP26, LP10-LP11). Due to space limitations, this
    paper focuses only on a representative subset of the location points listed in
    Table II. Specifically, those location points have been selected for their diverse
    characteristics such as their distance to the TVWS AP, the crop type, the density
    and height of the corn plants, and whether or not they are in the line-of-sight
    of the TVWS AP. One notable exception is the group composed of LP12 and LP13.
    Those location points are close to the corn field but not inside, instead they
    are on the roadside obstructed by tree leaves. Fig. 3: TVWS AP mounted on pole
    (red-circled) and TVWS bow-tie antennas (blue-boxed) facing the field Show All
    B. NWS system TVWS devices. We carry out our TVWS measurement campaign with HuWoMobility
    HL3210 TVWS devices. Those TVWS devices use an integrated Qualcomm Atheros QCA9533
    System-On-Chip and their TVWS configuration is shown in Table III. Two TVWS APs
    have been installed at the Farm Site, each being connected through jumper cables
    to directional bow-tie antennas. In this study, we use the TVWS AP that is connected
    to antennas pointing to the farm fields. Since we had CLI access through SSH to
    the TVWS devices operating under OpenWrt, we create a set of automation scripts
    that automatically collect metrics with the desired sampling frequencies to be
    discussed shortly. TVWS antennas. The two TVWS antennas used at the AP are bow-tie
    antennas, mounted on the pole, facing the fields. They have a 14dB gain with a
    60 o horizontal beamwidth. The omnidirecitonal antennas used at the CPE also have
    a 14dB gain. The distance between the antennas is λ 0 2 (i.e.: 1 2 wavelength)
    where λ 0 is the free space wavelength obtained by the following formula: λ 0
    = c 0 f where c0 is the speed of light in free space (i.e.: 3× 10 8 m/s ) and
    f the frequency (i.e.: 578MHz). Hence, the separation between the two MIMO antennas
    is ∼26cm . TABLE II Selected Location Points In Curtiss Farm TABLE III TVWS Parameters
    C. Automation scripts for data collection In order to minimize in-field time and
    collect as much data as possible, we implement automation scripts that collect
    on-the-fly average and per-antenna metrics for each location point. All the metrics
    are collected when UDP traffic is transmitted/received in the background with
    the iperf tool. To probe a particular location point, we start the main script
    from the laptop connected to the TVWS CPE. The main script instructs the TVWS
    CPE to start recording iperf throughput measurements of the TVWS link with a sampling
    interval of 100 ms. Then, the main script spawns a remote shell instance on the
    TVWS AP which collects average link quality statistics such as Noise, RSSI (Received
    Signal Strength Indicator) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) available from the
    CLI frontend iwinfo. Finally, another shell instance is spawned on the TVWS CPE
    that collects per-antenna Noise, RSSI and SNR gathered by the Atheros kernel driver
    (ath9k) debug traces. Fig. 4: Location Points in Curtiss Farm fields Show All
    Those channel metrics help to characterize spatiotemporal behaviour of the TVVWS
    channels. The script collects the following channel metrics: Average MIMO SNR
    and per-antenna SNR: indicator of link reliability between the AP and CPE; Average
    MIMO RSSI and per-antenna RSSI: received signal power at CPE side; Noise power:
    quantifies the amount of noise on the channel. End-to-end performance metrics
    are also collected. They include downlink throughput and packet loss at the CPE
    along with delay and jitter of the TVWS link. D. Data collection process This
    measurement campaign has been conducted during the summer of 2019 (July-August
    period) before the harvest season in September-October. This was the period where
    most of the plants were tall with a high water content, regardless of the corn
    variety. Since we had a wet summer in 2019, there was no drought stressed plants.
    The corn fields and soybean fields were either composed of commercial or experimental
    hybrid plants. Experimental corn plants were planted much denser than commercial
    ones. In order to obtain reliable data that account for diverse factors (e.g.,
    humidity, temperature), we repeated data collection several times at each location
    point during the early morning, when the humidity was high (~90%) and the temperature
    between 11− 14 ∘ C , and during the early afternoon, when the humidity was ~60%
    and the temperature between 28− 30 ∘ C . Plants contain more water during morning
    hours than during the afternoon, and the soil moisture does not vary much during
    daytime. As part of this study, we analyze the effect of changing the MIMO antenna
    height of the TVWS CPE. Figure 5 shows a 214 cm fiberglass ladder that we used
    during the measurement campaign. For each location point and time of day, we collected
    data for different antenna heights: when antennas are located at the bottom (∼20
    cm above the ground), in the middle ( ∼110 cm above the ground) and on top of
    the ladder ( ∼214 cm above the ground). Each measurement runs for a duration of
    4 minutes. We captured one sample every 100 ms for the throughput and one sample
    every 20 ms for other metrics. In total, we collected 232 MB of raw data. Fig.
    5: MIMO antennas mounted of top of the ladder Show All SECTION IV. Measurements
    and Results A. Impact of weather We begin by considering the impact of temperature
    on the TVWS RSS, SNR and noise. The RSS (Received Signal Strength) is different
    from the RSSI and is computed as follows: RSS = RSSI - noise [dBm]. For this first
    set of measurements, we focus on one pair of location points (LP25-LP26), one
    in the corn field composed of commercial corn and the other one in the soybean
    field composed of commercial soybeans. The choice of these location points is
    motivated by the fact that they are in the LOS of the pole antennas, exhibit dense
    foliage and high density. Thus, we end up collecting data during morning and daytime
    for different CPE antenna heights in order to assess the impact of weather components
    (i.e., temperature and humidity) and antenna height variability on link quality.
    This analysis allows us to determine if temperature and humidity have a significant
    impact depending on multiple factors. Here we present the data for the location
    point LP25 in a dense corn field where corn plants are 2.5 m tall, located 474m
    away from the TVWS AP. Similar behavior has been observed for LP26 in a dense
    soybean field composed of 30cm tall commercial soybean plants; details can be
    found in the technical report [15]. Fig. 6: Impact of humidity and temperature
    on RSS at LP25. Show All Figure 6a and Figure 6b show the temporal behaviour of
    the RSS in the early morning when the temperature is around 12 ∘ C and the humidity
    slightly above 90% and in the afternoon (i.e., Daytime) when the temperature is
    around 29 ∘ C and the humidity below 60%. In the early morning, the mean RSS is
    -94.8dBm when MIMO antennas are on top of the ladder, -97.6dBm when antennas are
    located at mid height of the ladder and 113 dBm when antennas are located just
    20 cm above the ground. Consequently, the RSS increases when the antenna height
    increases. In the early afternoon, the RSS is negatively impacted by the rise
    in temperature. This negative correlation between RSS and temperature was also
    observed for IEEE 802.15.4 links in the ISM bands [11] and for indoor sensors
    using sub-GHz bands [12]. In both cases (morning and daytime), we notice that
    the RSS increases with the antenna height but not proportionally to the relative
    height. This can be explained by the fact that the signal suffers from a greater
    attenuation at Ground and Mid antenna heights due to the presence of corn biomass
    surrounding the antennas. Fig. 7: Average SNR and Noise at LP25: SNR decreases
    with humidity while noise increases with humidity. Show All Conversely, while
    the RSS dropped for all antenna heights in the afternoon, Figure 7a shows that
    the SNR increases when the temperature increases for all antenna heights. This
    is because the noise decreases when temperature increases as depicted in Figure
    7b. We observe this trend at other location points as well, independently of the
    crop type. Figure 8 clearly shows that temperature and humidity have a stronger
    impact than antenna height variability on TVWS RSS. Moreover, in the morning,
    the density plot width is reduced especially outside the interquartile range.
    Interestingly, the RSS measured during daytime exhibits similar distribution shapes
    for all antenna heights, with RSS values being concentrated around the lower and
    upper adjacent values (i.e., first and third quartile). In the morning, the major
    RSS gap between Ground and Mid antenna height is due to the high humidity that
    induces a higher corn leaf water content. Therefore, the high concentration of
    water molecules on leaves surrounding antennas close to the ground tends to attenuate
    the signal. Fig. 8: RSS distribution and probability density for LP25. Show All
    B. Impact of tree foliage The south of Curtiss Farm is bordered by a forest composed
    of trees with dense foliage. Due to the height of those trees, we will be able
    to see how performance are impacted in NLOS scenarios for different antenna heights.
    Roadside location points (LP12-LP13). The pair of location points LP12-LP13 along
    the roadside are located 563 m and 370 m from the TVWS AP, respectively. They
    are in NLOS due to the heavy tree foliage along the roadside. At LP12, a dense
    foliage obstructs the line-of-sight while at LP13 the foliage is less dense but
    the ladder is close to the tree. We investigate the temporal behaviour of the
    RSS in Figure 9a and Figure 9b. For the sake of readability the curves have been
    smoothed out, but the fluctuations can be seen in Figure 10 that shows a side-by-side
    comparison of LP12-LP13 RSS distribution. From Figure 9b, we observe that for
    LP13, the RSS margin between Ground and Top antenna height is relatively small
    (i.e.: 4 dBm). LP13 exhibits an average RSS of-111 dBm, -114dBm, -115dBm at Top,
    Mid and Ground antenna height, respectively. Since the foliage is equally dense
    from Ground to Top but present small gaps at Top antenna height, there is no significant
    gains from placing the antennas on top of the ladder. While the signal is stronger
    at Top antenna height, it fluctuates a lot as shown by the wide interquartile
    range in Figure 10. At LP12, a section of the tree is directly obstructing the
    line-of-sight at Ground and Mid antenna height. This clearly impacts the received
    signal: the average RSS for Top antenna height is -117dBm while for Mid and Ground
    antenna height it ranges between -123dBm and -124dBm, which is a 7 dBm RSS margin.
    Figure 11 shows the average SNR at LP12 and LP13. The SNR at LP12 for Ground and
    Mid antennas is poor (i.e.: below 5dB). The SNR doubles when antennas are located
    on top of the ladder. As for LP13, the average SNR is comprised between 14 dB
    and 18 dB which indicates that a decent link quality can be expected even under
    tree foliage obstruction. Fig. 9: Impact of tree foliage on RSS at LP12-LP13.
    Show All Fig. 10: RSS distribution at LP12-LP13: LP13’s RSS oscillates between
    -128 and -109dBm due to the presence of dense foliage at Top antenna height. Show
    All Fig. 11: Average SNR at LP12-LP13. Show All Throughput fluctuations in Figure
    12 confirms the previous observations. At LP12, the average throughput is of 18.1
    Mbps for Top antenna height and of 0.19 Mbps and 0.79 Mbps for Ground and Mid
    antenna height, respectively. At LP13, the stable RSS and decent average SNR of
    Mid antenna height translate to a stable temporal behaviour of the throughput
    and an average throughput of 14.6 Mbps. At Top antenna height, the average throughput
    is 21 Mbps. Due to the close proximity of antennas and tree foliage, the throughput
    exhibits rapid fluctuations over time. Finally, at Ground antenna height the throughput
    remains stable around 2.31 Mbps. Fig. 12: Downlink throughput at LP12 and LP13.
    Show All C. Impact of crop type In order to capture the TVWS channel behaviour
    for different crop types (corn, soybean), we collect measurements for the pair
    of location points LP10-LP11 which are located more than 800 m from the TVWS AP.
    LP10 is located in a moderately dense corn field with tall corn plants, and LPII
    is located in a dense soybean field. They are located at 830 m and 822 m from
    the TVWS AP, respectively. Figure 13 presents the RSSI of MIMO antennas. As we
    can notice for Antenna 1, the RSSI gap between Mid and Ground antenna height is
    of 10 dBm at LP10, much more that the gap between Mid and Ground antenna height
    at LPII. We also notice for Ground antenna height that the RSSI at LP10 is 10
    dBm weaker than the one at LPII. We can infer that the thickness of corn has a
    negative influence on the radio signal, the attenuation is less important for
    soybean plants even though they tend to be much more concentrated as the distance
    along row and the distance between rows is much smaller than that of corn plants.
    Interestingly, we observe different trends between antennas: Antenna 0 exhibits
    more fluctuations and a weaker RSSI regardless of the antenna height which highlights
    the importance of antenna placement. In Table IV we can notice that the RSSI standard
    deviation is higher at Ground antenna height and that the RSSI standard deviation
    decreases with antenna height for both LP10 and LPII. Fig. 13: RSSI of MIMO antennas
    at LP10 and LPII. Show All TABLE IV Per-Antenna RSSI Standard Deviation At LP10
    and LP11. In Figure 15, it is worth mentioning that the throughput for the corn
    field at LP10 shows more fluctuations over time than the throughput for the soybean
    field at LPII. Especially at Top antenna height, we can notice a strong deviation
    from the mean throughput over time. Fig. 14: Average SNR at LP10 and LPII. Show
    All Fig. 15: Downlink throughput at LP10 and LPII. Show All D. Impact of crop
    density Dense vs Sparse corn field (LP4-LP5). To show the impact of corn density
    on TVWS performance, we select the pair of location points LP4-LP5. They are located
    at 1.086 km and 1.074 km from the TVWS AP, respectively. LP4 is located inside
    the field where the density is high. On the other hand LP5 is located in a path
    in-between two rows of corn plants (i.e.: low density). Figure 16 shows the per-antenna
    RSSI of both location points. Even though TVWS has superior penetration characteristics
    than WiFi, the penetration loss is exacerbated when the signal has to penetrate
    through the trunks and kernels of mature corn plants. Therefore, due to the high
    corn density at LP4, the signal was lost when antennas were located close to the
    ground. At LP4, we notice an important gap of 10 dBm between Ground and Top antenna
    height for Antenna 1. There is also a 10 dBm difference between LP4 (i.e.: -76dBm)
    and LP5 (i.e.:-66dBm) RSSI at Mid antenna height. The RSSI gap is reduced at Top
    antenna height where LP4 exhibits an RSSI of -66dBm and LP5 of -60dBm. Similarly
    to LP10-LP11, we witness lower RSSI values for Antenna 0 and a less significant
    gap between antenna heights. Fig. 16: RSSI of MIMO antennas at LP4 and LP5. Show
    All Table V shows once again that the RSSI standard deviation is stronger in the
    presence of dense vegetation and that it decreases with antenna height. TABLE
    V Per-Antenna RSSI Standard Deviation At LP4 and LP5. SNR results are shown in
    Figure 17. At top antenna height, LP5 SNR is 2.07 dB higher that the SNR at LP4,
    and at Mid antenna height it is 3.21 dB higher than the SNR at LP4, confirming
    the link quality degradation due to high corn density. Fig. 17: Average SNR at
    LP4 and LP5. Show All The performance metrics collected in Table VI for LP4 and
    LP5 also reflect the SNR discrepancies. Propagation at LP4 is dominated by scattering,
    thus the signal amplitude decreases with crop density. Performance measured at
    LP4 are on average 41% worse than LP5 due to corn plant penetration. Still, LP4
    exhibits a throughput that is sufficient to accommodate video streaming at Top
    antenna height. The throughput for LP4 and LP5 is shown in Figure 18. At LP4 for
    Top antenna height, even though the throughput reaches 20 Mbps, it oscillates
    frequently between 3 Mbps and 20 Mbps. At LP5 on the other hand, the throughput
    is more stable toward the mean value of 20.7 Mbps. TABLE VI LP4-LP5 Performance
    Metrics. Fig. 18: Downlink throughput at LP4 and LP5. The signal is lost at Ground
    antenna height for LP4. Show All Results collected for the pair LP22-LP23 can
    be found in the technical report [15]. We summarize collected measurements (RSS,
    RSSI and SNR) in Table VII for each antenna height. The table also includes measurements
    for distant location points LP2 (corn) and LP3 (soybean). E. NWS empirical path
    loss Since path loss depends on antenna height, distance, and frequency, we compare
    the empirical TVWS path loss measured at Curtiss Farm with existing path loss
    models to see which existing model best predicts the loss of TVWS systems in agricultural
    settings. We select well-known path loss models typically used in wireless mobile
    communications such as Plane Earth, Okumura-Hata for open and suburban environments
    and COST231-Hata. Compared to the free-space path loss model, the plane earth
    model includes the effect of ground reflection. Okumura-Hata is a widely used
    propagation model and its correction factor for suburban environments targets
    terrains with trees and houses. The COST231-Hata model is an extension of the
    Okumura-Hata model and is aimed at urban environments with CPE antenna heights
    up to 10 m and AP antenna heights between 30 m and 200 m. Figure 19 shows the
    empirical path loss for Ground antenna height. Since the loss at Ground antenna
    height is mainly due to ground reflection and vegetation (trunks, kernels, stems)
    the Okumura-Hata model for suburban environments approximately models the TVWS
    empirical path loss measured at Curtiss Farm. On the other hand, at Top antenna
    height (Figure 20), the empirical path loss is better modeled by the Plane Earth
    model. TABLE VII Average RSS, RSSI and SNR Measurements of Location Points For
    Each Antenna Height. Fig. 19: Empirical path loss (Ground antenna height). Show
    All Fig. 20: Empirical path loss (Top antenna height). Show All SECTION V. Conclusion
    This paper explored the impact of farm crops on the spatiotemporal behaviour of
    TVWS channels. We observed that while the SNR is negatively correlated with humidity,
    noise and RSS are positively correlated with humidity. While humidity can be beneficial
    to the RSS for long distances beyond 1 km, it can be detrimental to the TVWS performance
    at short distances if either the TVWS CPE Rx gain or the TVWS AP transmit power
    are not controlled. Moreover, the per-antenna RSSI standard deviation decreases
    with antenna height which indicates that the link suffers less from RSSI fluctuations
    when MIMO antennas are distant from the ground. Notably, crop diversity tends
    to influence the signal propagation. The thickness of trunks/stems played only
    a minor role in signal attenuation. However, factors such as crop density and
    tree foliage depth have a stronger negative impact on TVWS performance than crop
    trunk thickness. This measurement campaign also highlights that the antenna height
    has a positive influence on TVWS performance if the TVWS system lies in a steady-state
    regime where the received signal is not too strong. Even though fading and scattering
    affect the TVWS performance, throughput beyond 30 Mbps can be achieved intermittently
    in harsh agricultural conditions. Finally, we show that, when MIMO antennas are
    placed close to the ground, the Okumura-Hata model for suburban environments can
    be utilize to predict the pass loss of TVWS systems in crop farms, while for 7-feet
    antenna height the plane earth model is the best candidate to predict the path
    loss. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This Temperature

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction Sensor
    nodes are quite popular and used at multiple ways in Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) but they are known for their hardware constraints which makes energy efficiency
    quite an attractive area to discuss about in terms of WSN networks. A large number
    of sensor nodes are deployed over a sensor field to measure and report certain
    physical parameters like temperature, relative humidity, light intensity etc.,
    in a (WSN). Gateway nodes in a WSN are responsible for data transmission to the
    sinks. Further data processing takes place at the sinks, which includes data gathering
    and analysis, in order to take appropriate decisions. High end computation and
    communication is possible at the sinks, as they are equipped with larger memory
    space, higher computational capabilities and connectivity with the power socket.
    Sensor nodes on the other hand are different in terms of communication, memory
    size, computation and source of power. Any sensor node is comprised of four basic
    units: a power unit, transceiver unit, processing unit and sensing unit, in one
    single package which is generally of size as one centimeter cube. As a result
    of this, a constraint comes on memory units, expenditure of energy, computational
    power etc. This creates an issue in certain outdoor application areas like environment
    monitoring and military surveillance, where the replacement of battery is practically
    impossible. Thus, it has become an interesting area for scientist and researchers
    across the globe to come out with a solution which can increase the lifetime of
    network and reduce the cost of deployment of network in any kind of applications.
    There is a difference between WSN and traditional ad-hoc networks as transmission
    rate is low and little amount of bandwidth is enough for data transmission, sensor
    nodes are basically static in nature and very less amount of nodes are of mobile
    nature. However, as sensor nodes are of limited energy capacity, it presents a
    challenge in front of the researchers to come out with energy efficient lifetime
    prolonging routing techniques whereby, the running cost of the network may be
    amortized. There are certain fundamental differences between the tradition approach
    i.e., MANET and WSN on the basis of following attributes: Identification: global
    level of identification is not available in WSN as there is a large number of
    applications and nodes are there but the same is not required in MANET. Scalability:
    Huge number of nodes are required to be deployed in any kind of application for
    e.g. The aim of USA is to use sensor nodes in various projects like smart road
    project, security monitoring for people in the country which results into high
    density of network and differentiate it from MANET. Quality of Service: the limitation
    of capacity of batteries in sensor nodes which makes it unlikely for the replacement
    process and increases the need for it to be more energy efficient in WSN and also
    the need of service quality parameters is quite different for both the approaches
    as reliability is more in the traditional approach Data: WSN is data centric which
    makes it redundant whereas the same concept is avoided in MANET until some data
    sharing process is required. Traffic: conventional approaches are followed by
    MANET where as WSN follows low traffic rate for long time which contains flow
    of data and high data rates are of frequent nature in some of the events. Software:
    WSN have simple software due to its memory limitation and less processing capabilities
    where as traditional method is of complex in nature so routing protocols of heavy
    nature can be used Fault-Tolerant: here attention goes on the WSN network as limitation
    of battery capacity makes it compulsory to work if any failure occurs in large
    no. of nodes in comparison to the traditional approach of MANET. A. Significance
    of WSN In recent world-wide usage there are many applications where WSN has proved
    to be of great usage like military applications, precision activities in agriculture,
    Forest Fire detection, Habitat monitoring, Weather forecasting etc. which promises
    of better quality of service parameters such as energy efficiency, reliable communication
    needs, security. Basic working of WSN includes distribution of small sensing devices
    over a geographical area where any changes in the parameters are captured and
    communication with other devices are done. Nodes in WSN itself do the monitoring
    process and they deploy a mechanism inside the nodes itself. Operational and economic
    limitations make the nodes low cost and simple which also makes them vulnerable
    to various kind of attacks. SECTION II. Routing Protocols in Wsn In a WSN, nodes
    and sinks are distributed spatially where the process of data transmission happens.
    A single routing protocol is not enough to fulfil the needs for all kind of applications
    because of unrealizable link with computer. Due to which there are various type
    of protocols which are studies further and realized for the data transmission
    process in WSN, all these routing protocols are grouped together and can be categorized
    in majorly five categories which are as follows Hierarchal based Data Centric
    Based Fermat Point Based Geographic position based QoS-based The same can be observed
    in a figure format for better understanding in fig 1. This categorization contains
    various protocols which are used in WSN for various kind of data transmission
    and routing mechanisms. Generally, the WSN architecture contains of sensor nodes
    where various sensor nodes are connected to analog to digital converter which
    are further connected to a processor and a memory which is linked with transceiver
    unit, a GPS or location finding system and a memory unit which is quite optional
    and a battery source which provides power to the complete process. Fig. 1. Energy
    allied routing in WSN Show All WSN architecture we have one communication architecture
    which consist of various layers such as physical layer, data link layer, network
    layer, transport layer and application layer with a task management plane, mobility
    and power management plane as well. Hierarchal Based In these kinds of protocol
    nodes are linked to form a network path. Collection of data and aggregation of
    data in terms of reduced cost of transmission is done by clustering of nodes.
    Example of such protocols are LEACH[1], [7] which is used on a widely basis where
    the main purpose is to continuously pick a cluster node for power consumption
    and to enhance the network lifecycle. This protocol contains two stages data transfer
    stage and preparation of cluster stage. There are also some more protocols which
    have been proposed such as LEATCH which is stated as Low Energy Adaptive Tier
    Clustering Hierarchy which is of less latency and reduced consumption of power.
    Other protocols are such as TEEN[2] protocol, PEGASIS[3] protocol where LEACH
    is upgraded by the PEGASIS. [30] present a clustering algorithm for selecting
    CHs using grey wolf optimizer (GWO). GWO is a swarm intelligence algorithm that
    is based opon the behavior of grey wolves and have shown impressive results. [31]
    focused on the heterogeneity of the nodes. The authors deployed three kinds of
    nodes: advance nodes, super nodes, and normal nodes. The paper proposes a multilevel
    stable and energy efficient clustering approach through TABU-GA search mechanism.
    It carries out two neighborhood generating operations for detecting an optimum
    path in order to prolong network lifetime to maximum. Butterfly Optimization Algorithm
    (BOA) is employed in [32] for choosing an optimal cluster head from a group of
    nodes. Four different criteria were considered here for cluster head selection:
    residual energy of the nodes, distance to the neighbors, distance to the base
    station, node degree and node centrality. Data Centric Based As the name suggest
    it is based on data transmission process where information is requested and information
    is named for the transmission process. Interactions are based on single node and
    learnings are focused within the system which further reduces the complexity and
    redundancy of the information. Mostly the storage of information happened on a
    local level. SPIN[6] i.e. Sensor Protocol for information via negotiations is
    used for elimination of flood and vulnerabilities of gossip. Each node contains
    a monitor for resources and notices the changes or modification of nodes behavior.
    Data collection is network is accomplished by ADV, DATA and REQ three kind of
    messages where whenever a broadcast happens in network or a data transmission
    needs to be done ADV packets contain data attributes, nodes send a REQ request
    who are interested and data transmission process is done after the acknowledgment
    of REO. Fermat Point Based Among various application areas where WSN is being
    deployed is Fermat Point Based Routing Protocol as it addresses to multiple sinks
    as well as reduces the consumption of energy with reduction in overall distance.
    A Fermat point is a point in a triangle from where sum of distances is minimized
    when considered from three vertices. KPS [8] routing protocol which is an energy
    efficient method based on data aggregation in multi-sink environment. It improves
    the network lifetime and energy efficiency. I-Min [9] is an intelligent and energy
    efficient Fermat point based packet forwarding technique having basis on geographical
    location based technique. This method reduces the delay in packet delivery making
    it time sensitive as well as reduces the energy consumption in transmission of
    data packets. Location Based Calculation of distance between two sensor nodes
    is done on the basis of location information. GEAR[10] uses GIS (geographical
    Information System) for location finding. It contains two phases one where packets
    are forwarded to the targeted region after receiving of packet closes neighbor
    node is searched and in phase 2 packets are forwarded within any region and if
    in case reached restricted flooding or forwarding by geographical means is accomplished.
    GOAFR[10] routing protocol is an ad hoc routing protocol. It uses greedy approach
    to select the closest neighbor for routing but it can stick to some minimum at
    local level which means no neighbor is available closer to the current node. SPAN[12]
    is another location based less energy efficient routing protocol as it maintains
    two coordinators one is new and other is existing and both need not be neighbors
    and this increases the need to maintain the positions which makes it less energy
    efficient as well as complex in nature. Qos Based In this kind of protocol, a
    balance is maintained between consumption of energy and quality of data. SAR[13]
    [14] is one of its first kind of QoS routing protocol. Energy of Resources, each
    path QoS parameter and priority on each level is considered for routing. Main
    objective is to minimize the QoS metric to enhance the network lifetime which
    makes it further fault tolerant and easily recoverable. Another routing protocol
    is SPEED[13] [14] which estimate end-to-end delay for packets by dividing the
    distance and routing module in this method is known as SNFG(Stateless Geographic
    Non-Deterministic Forwarding) however no other energy metric is considered except
    total transmission delay because of its simple nature. In Table 1 we have discussed
    about all routing methods in a tabular format for better understanding. Table
    I. Comparative study of energy allied routing in wsn SECTION III. Application
    of Energy Allied Routing There are various application areas where these methods
    and techniques can be applied for data transmission as well as data gathering
    and analysis process. Nowadays in every device now a days sensors are widely used
    of its easy availability and low cost which makes it more of usage of its kind.
    Few of the application areas are as follows military applications, precision activities
    in agriculture, Forest Fire detection, Habitat monitoring, Weather forecasting
    Military Applications Precision Activities in Agriculture Forest Fire Detection
    Habitat Monitoring Weather Forecasting These are the various areas where WSN can
    be deployed easilt but not limited to because some wireless sensor networks are
    quite easy to install and comes with good mobility making them adjustable to environment
    whenever needs in any application changes. SECTION IV. Open Research Opportunities
    With the same aim to enhance the lifetime of network as well as increasing the
    energy efficiency the future direction of WSN routing will be allied all together.
    Here we discussed thoroughly further research opportuinites available which are
    redundancy exploitation, density of sensor architecture needs to be considered
    to make the network of simpler of its kind, to increase the adaptability emphasis
    need to be given on localized algorithms, enhancement of computation needs to
    be done in the network, with globalization perspective networks are made vulnerable
    so a need of security comes to our point which needs to be addressed. These are
    few of the research areas where researchers can further work and enhance their
    knowledge. SECTION V. Conclusion Sensors are widely deployed in many of the areas
    nowadays because of its low cost and easy availability which makes it of popular
    usage in the Networking Process. WSN comes with the wireless nature of network
    which makes it popular and one of its kind. Here in this paper, we have discussed
    the difference between traditional approach and WSN networking with various protocols
    which are readily available for routing process with a comparative study of those
    protocols. Also, we have discussed various future direction or research areas
    which can be addressed by various researchers to work further in this field. Authors

    Drones are being used in a wide variety of applications like surveillance, disaster
    management, communication, weather forecast, wildlife monitoring, aerial photography,
    shipping and delivery, 3D mapping [1]. With an increasing number of applications,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as Drones, will soon be densely populating
    the low-altitude air space. These UAV deployments are expected to provide highly
    reliable communication in various scenarios [2]. To ensure autonomous UAV operations,
    one of the key requirements is reliable communication links with ground infrastructure.
    Communication with UAV is broadly divided into two components [3]. One of them
    is the Control and Non-payload communication (CNPC) link and the other is the
    Payload data link. The CNPC link plays a key role in delivering telecommand and
    telemetry information such as flight control, status monitoring, location, etc.
    The Payload data link delivers the data to both the parties, i.e., from the GRS
    to the UAV and vice versa. A reliable CNPC link is essential to ensure the secure
    integration of UAVs into national air space (NAS). Hence, this paper deals with
    the CNPC links. In recent years, a considerable amount of work has been done in
    the area of CNPC channel modelling. In [5]–[7], the authors have published a series
    of works related to CNPC channel modelling for different environments. In [5],
    the channel model has been developed for over-water settings. In [6] and [7],
    the authors have analysed channel in hilly and mountainous settings, and suburban
    and near-urban environments, respectively, in the frequency bands allotted by
    World radio conference-12 (WRC-12) [3] for CNPC operation. In [8], the authors
    have presented UWB channel modelling for air-to-ground propagation channels. In
    [9], UAV air-to-ground channel model has been developed for mmWave systems. In
    [10], [11], the authors have analysed the Doppler effect on the air-to-ground
    channel and the methods to mitigate the same. Several works like [12]–[19] have
    considered UAV deployment as the aerial base station and considered coverage analysis,
    optimal altitude deployment, user association etc. However, resource allocation
    and energy efficiency for UAV communications have not been considered. The secure
    integration of UAVs into NAS is not possible without analysing the GRS network.
    The GRS is an important part of the network which aids in establishing communication
    with the UAV and allocates resources to the UAVs accordingly. GRS is the most
    energy consuming unit in the UAV communications like Base station (BS) in cellular
    network. Base station sleeping (BSS) is a known technique for energy efficient
    operation in cellular network [20]. In general, every network is designed for
    a nominal number of users (here UAVs). Like any other network [20], we expect
    in a UAV network also the UAV density would vary with time and falls below certain
    threshold at multiple instants. In such scenarios, we investigate whether some
    GRSs can be moved into sleep mode to conserve energy while still maintaining QoS.
    Motivated by it, this is the first work that explores GRSS for energy efficient
    UAV communication network. Coverage and throughput issues with BSS have been addressed
    in [20] and [21] using CoMP with JT and NOMA, respectively. Motivated by this,
    we consider CoMP with JT and NOMA with GRSS in this paper. We use CoMP with JT
    interchangeably with CoMP throughout the text. The trade-off between energy, coverage,
    throughput for GRSS, joint GRSS and CoMP, and joint GRSS and NOMA considering
    the mobility of the UAV has not been much discussed in the literature. This is
    the motivation of our work. The major contributions of this paper are as follows:
    We formulate the GRS sleeping optimization problem which ensures quality of service
    (QoS) to each UAV when GRS is in sleep mode. We design a dynamic GRS sleeping
    algorithm that ensures QoS to each UAV when GRS is in sleep mode. We propose a
    joint GRSS and CoMP algorithm to compensate for the coverage loss due to GRSS.
    We propose a joint GRSS and NOMA algorithm to compensate for the throughput drop
    due to GRSS. We present extensive simulation results of the proposed algorithms
    and provide a comparative study of these results with the benchmark system, benchmark
    with CoMP, and benchmark with NOMA. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section II describes the System model. Section III includes the problem formulation.
    Section IV and Section V, respectively, give the details of CoMP and NOMA considered
    in this paper. The proposed algorithms are presented in Section VI. Extensive
    numerical results are presented in Section VII. Section VIII gives the concluding
    remarks. SECTION II. System Model We consider a randomly deployed homogeneous
    OFDMA based GRS network in which the set of GRSs and UAVs in the network are denoted
    using G={1,2,3,…,G} and U={1,2,3,…,U} , respectively. We consider that the UAVs
    and GRSs are deployed randomly with density λ u per km2 and λ g per km2, respectively.
    In Fig. 1, we present the system model considered in this work [22]. In this paper,
    we focus on the downlink, however, similar results can also be obtained for uplink.
    Without loss of generality, here we assume that the GRSs are divided into clusters
    of size n. However, this framework can be extended to varying cluster sizes. We
    consider a clustering based on distance among the GRSs. Alternatively, any other
    clustering mechanism can also be considered. There are various other ways of clustering
    like K-means clustering [23] etc. Let M={1,2,3,…,M} denote the set of sub-channels
    available in the network. All important mathematical notations used in this paper
    are summarized in Table 1. Next, we discuss the spectrum allocation for UAV communication
    considered in this paper. TABLE 1 Mathematical Notations FIGURE 1. System model.
    Show All A. Spectrum Allocation for UAV Communications Since CNPC carries telecommand
    and telemetry information, the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) has
    decided to operate these links in secure bands designated by International Telecommunications
    Union (ITU). The designations [3] are as follows: Aeronautical mobile (route)
    service (AM(R)S) for terrestrial CNPC. Aeronautical mobile-satellite (route) service
    (AMS(R)S) for satellite CNPC for Beyond line of sight BLOS) CNPC. The spectrum
    requirements for the Unmanned aircraft systems CNPC (UAS CNPC) are officially
    defined by the ITU radio-communications sector (ITU-R) considering the data requirements
    and UAV density estimated for the year 2030. The bandwidth allocation [3] is as
    follows: 34 MHz for the terrestrial-based LOS CNPC. 56 MHz for satellite-based
    BLOS CNPC. World radiocommunication conference in 2012 recommended a new spectrum
    for AM(R)S for UAS CNPC. The spectrum assigned is as follows [3]: 5030 MHz - 5091
    MHz (C-band). 960 MHz - 1164 MHz (L-band). In this paper, we consider L-band for
    numerical analysis. However, the algorithms which we propose further are equally
    valid for other bands. Next, we present the power allocation and UAV association
    considered in this work. B. Power Allocation and Physical Channel Model Let P
    g denote the total power transmitted by a GRS. We consider the power allocated
    per subchannel m by the GRS g as follows. P m g = P g M ,∀m∈M. (1) View Source
    The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of a UAV u from a GRS g , denoted
    by γ m u,g , on a subchannel m is given as γ m u,g = P m g h m u,g ∑ g ^ ≠g g
    ^ ∈G P m g ^ h m u, g ^ + σ 2 , (2) View Source where, P m g is the power allocated
    to the subchannel m by the GRS g as in (1), ∑ g ^ ≠g g ^ ∈G m P m g h m u, g ^
    is the interference on the subchannel m , and σ 2 is the noise power. h m u,g
    denotes the channel gain between the UAV u and the GRS g and it is given as follows.
    h m u,g = 10 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ −PL(u,g)+ G g (ϕ)+ G u −υ−ρ 10 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ , (3) View Source where,
    G u is the antenna gain, υ is the penetration loss, ρ is the loss due to small
    scale fading as in [24], G g (ϕ) is the directivity gain, and PL(u,g) is the path
    loss for the distance d between u and g . The pathloss between UAV and GRS as
    in [7] is written as follows. P L (u,g) = F u,g +10nlog( d d min )+X, View Source
    where, n is the path loss exponent, d is the propagation distance, d min is the
    minimum distance of a UAV from the GRS, and X is the shadowing variable. F u,g
    is the free space path loss term with center frequency f c and is as follows [7].
    F u,g =92.45+20log( f c )+20log( d min ). View Source We consider Line of sight
    (LOS) probability, P LOS as in [22] and it is expressed as P LOS(u,g) ( θ d 0
    )= 1 1+Cexp(−B( θ d 0 −C)) , (4) View Source where, θ d 0 is the elevation angle
    which is expressed as θ=ta n −1 ( h 0 / d 0 ) , h 0 is the altitude of UAV, and
    d 0 is the horizontal distance between UAV u and GRS g . B and C are environment-dependent
    constants. Similarly, the NLOS probability can be expressed from (4) as P NLOS
    ( θ d 0 )=1− P LOS ( θ d 0 ) . Next, we discuss the UAV association considered
    in this paper. C. UAV Association Given P m g as the power allocated by the GRS
    g to the UAV u on the subchannel m , we consider the UAV association with the
    GRS based on the maximum received power. Let x m u,g denote the binary association
    of UAV u with GRS g on the subchannel m and is given as x m u,g ={ 1, 0, if g=arg
    max g { P m g h m u,g , otherwise, ∀u∈U, ∀g∈G, (5) View Source where, h m u,g
    is the channel gain between UAV u and GRS g on the subchannel m as in (3). The
    binary variable x m u,g is 1 when the UAV u associates with GRS g and is 0 otherwise.
    Next, we discuss link rate of the UAV considered in this paper. D. Rate Computation
    We consider adaptive modulation and coding scheme (MCS) which is summarized in
    Table 2 for mapping SINR to spectral efficiency as in [25]. Let, η( γ m u,g )
    denote the spectral efficiency of a UAV u on a subchannel m in bits/symbol from
    GRS g . The link rate of UAV u from the GRS g with the spectral efficiency η(
    γ m u,g ) is r u,g = η( γ m u,g )S C OFDM S Y OFDM T sc M, (6) View Source where,
    S C OFDM , S Y OFDM , and T sc represent the number of subcarriers per channel,
    number of symbols used per subcarrier, and time duration of a subframe, respectively.
    M represents the number of subchannels. TABLE 2 Modulation and Coding Scheme We
    consider an α -fair time-based scheduler at each GRS which allocates all the M
    subchannels for a downlink UAV scheduling time fraction denoted by β u,g to a
    UAV u associated with it. We have considered the maximum received power based
    association of UAVs with the GRSs as in 5. Thus, for a UAV u , β u,g is non-zero
    for only one GRS g . The resultant downlink rate for any UAV u is given as R u
    = ∑ g∈G β u,g r u,g . (7) View Source Next, we present the UAV distribution considered
    in this work. E. UAV Distribution We denote the area under consideration as Δ
    . The UAVs are assumed to be distributed randomly using PPP in the considered
    area with an average UAV density of λ u per km2. The set of UAVs associated with
    GRS cluster k at time t is represented by U k and the number of UAVs associated
    with this cluster be denoted by Ω . As already mentioned, CNPC links carry critical
    information pertaining to UAV navigation. Compromising with QoS in such scenarios
    can be disastrous. So, GCS should keep track of the SINR of UAVs and update the
    sleeping patterns accordingly. The GCS would update the sleeping patterns periodically
    using the recently updated SINR estimates. Next, we present the GRS distribution
    and sleeping patterns considered in this work. F. GRS Distribution and Sleeping
    Patterns The GRSs are deployed randomly using Poisson point process (PPP) in the
    area Δ with an average density of λ g per km2. The set of GRSs in a cluster k
    is represented by G k . As shown in Fig. 1, a GCS which consists of an air traffic
    controller (ATC) and other necessary equipment would control all the GRSs currently
    being operated in its jurisdiction. However, to focus on GRS sleeping we do not
    represent GCS in the figures after Fig. 1 in this paper. Whenever a UAV enters
    into the coverage area of a cluster, the trajectory information of that particular
    UAV will be shared with the GCS handling that cluster. With the trajectory information
    and log files of all UAVs currently operating in that cluster, a dynamic energy-saving
    procedure can be initiated by the GCS. The GRS can estimate the SINR and rate
    of any UAV in its coverage. The GRS shares this information with the GCS which
    can then decide based on the UAV load in the network which GRS to be in sleep
    mode. These parameters will be updated at regular intervals as well as whenever
    a new UAV enters the coverage area. While estimating whether a GRS goes to sleep
    mode or not, QoS constraints such as coverage and rate of UAV should be taken
    care of. Maintaining these QoS constraints, at any given point of time, following
    sleeping patterns are possible within a cluster of size n : A n−1/n , A n−2/n
    , A n−3/n ,\\ldots, A (n−(n−1))/n which in general can be represented as A n−i/n
    , where, i=1,2,3,…,n−1 . A n−i/n means n−i out of n GRSs operating in the cluster
    are in sleep mode. Let A 0 denote the nominal system where no GRS is in sleep
    mode. For example, in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5, we have considered a
    limited number of GRS sleeping patterns for a cluster size of 4. However, this
    framework can be extended to any number of possible GRS sleeping patterns. Fig.
    2 corresponds to A 0 where all 4 GRSs in the cluster are active, Fig. 3 corresponds
    to A 3/4 scenario, Fig. 4 corresponds to A 2/4 scenario, and Fig. 5 corresponds
    to A 1/4 scenario. Next, we present the Utility function considered in this work.
    FIGURE 2. When all GRSs in the cluster are active. Show All FIGURE 3. When 3 out
    of 4 GRSs in the cluster are in sleep mode. Show All FIGURE 4. When 2 out 4 GRSs
    in the cluster are in sleep mode. Show All FIGURE 5. When 1 out of 4 GRSs in the
    cluster is in sleep mode. Show All G. Utility Function The utility function for
    an α -Fair UAV scheduler with the variable x is expressed as [25] U α (x)= ⎧ ⎩
    ⎨ x 1−α 1−α , log(x), α>0,α≠1, α=1. (8) View Source Next, we present the performance
    metrics used to characterize the QoS in this work. H. Performance Metrics There
    are three key performance metrics, namely, coverage probability, throughput, and
    energy efficiency considered in this work. The coverage probability is defined
    as the probability that a UAV u receives SINR γ m u,g greater than the minimum
    SINR threshold S as specified in MCS [25] from at least one GRS g . We consider
    α -fair throughput over the set of UAVs and is expressed as follows [20]. T α
    = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎛ ⎝ 1 | V g | ∑ u∈ V g R 1−α u ⎞ ⎠ 1 1−α
    , ( ∏ u∈ V q R u ) 1 | V g | , α>0,α≠1, α=1, (9) View Source where, α is the fairness
    parameter, R u as in (7), and V g is the set of UAVs associated with the GRS g
    . We denote energy efficiency by E S a1/a2 (%) and it is defined as the percentage
    of energy saved via GRS sleeping. Each value of E S a1/a2 (%) corresponds to a
    particular GRSS pattern A a1/a2 . Let the energy consumed per unit time by a GRS
    be denoted by E . Then, nE is the energy consumed by the nominal system, A 0 ,
    since all n GRSs are on. The energy consumed E would be approximately constant
    irrespective of the number of UAVs associated with the GRS. Thus, a suitable measure
    of energy efficiency for a GRSS pattern A a1/a2 in percentage when compared to
    the nominal system is given by [20]. E S a1/a2 (%)= a1 a2 ⋅100, (10) View Source
    where, a1 is the number of GRS sleeping and a2 is the total number of GRS considered.
    The joint optimization problem for resource allocation and energy efficiency is
    presented in the following section. SECTION III. Joint Resource Allocation and
    Energy Efficiency Optimization We consider A a1/a2 , the sleeping pattern as in
    Section II-F where, a1 is the number of GRSs sleeping and a2 is the total number
    of GRSs considered in the cluster. Similarly, the binary variable y g denotes
    whether the GRS g is sleeping ( y g =0 ) or active ( y g =1 ). Let ξ a and ξ s
    denote the active and sleeping mode power consumption by GRS, respectively. Since
    we consider homogeneous GRSs, the power consumed ξ a and ξ s GRS are equal for
    all GRSs in the respective mode. The ξ s is significantly smaller as compared
    to ξ a . Further, we consider the data rate of every UAV u in the system should
    be greater than the operator fixed rate threshold τ k . Given the binary association
    of UAV u with GRS g on the subchannel m , y m u,g as in (5), SINR as in (2) at
    a time instant t , the joint resource allocation and energy efficiency problem
    for a cluster k ( U k , G k ) is formulated and presented as follows. P1: max
    { x u,g , y g , τ k , β u,g } ∑ u∈U U α ( R u ) ∑ g∈G ( y g ξ a +(1− y g ) ξ s
    ) ,  s.t.  ∑ g∈ G k y g ≥1, y g ∈{0,1}  R u = ∑ g∈ G k x u,g y g β u,g r u,g ,∀u∈
    U k ,  R u ≥ τ k ,∀u∈ U k ,  ∑ u∈ U k y g x u,g β u,g ≤1,∀g∈ G k  x u,g ={ 1,
    0, if g=arg max g { y g P m g h m u,g , otherwise, ∀u∈ U k , ∀g∈ G k ,  γ m u,g
    ≥S,  β u,g ≥0,∀u∈ U k , ∀g∈ G k , (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) View
    Source where, (11) is the overall objective function for maximizing throughput
    and energy efficiency of the system with respect to the operator threshold τ k
    and the UAV scheduling time constraint. (11) increases with increase in the utility
    function of the UAVs which in turn increases the throughput. Thus, (11) increases
    with increase in the throughput of the cluster. Since ξ s ≤ ξ a , as more number
    of GRSs go into sleep mode, the denominator of (11) decreases, and thus, increasing
    the energy saved. Given the set of GRSs in cluster G k , the constraint on (12)
    specifies that at least one GRS should be active in the cluster k . The data rate
    of the particular UAV u is computed in (13) and the minimum rate constraint on
    the UAV’s data rate R u is specified in (14). Every cluster k can have its own
    rate threshold τ k . If each UAV in the system has the data rate R u greater than
    its corresponding τ k , then GRS sleeping in a particular pattern is feasible.
    Otherwise, all GRS are active over the cluster to maintain the QoS of UAVs. The
    overall time fraction allocated to associated UAVs with the GRS g should not exceed
    one and it is shown in constraint (15). The UAV association is subject to change
    with every GRS sleeping pattern. Therefore, the constraint on UAV’s association
    with only active GRS is given in (16). The constraint in (17) specifies that the
    SINR of UAV γ m u,g should be greater than certain threshold S , i.e., no UAV
    should lose coverage after GRSS. The SINR and the positive time constraint are
    specified in (2) and (18), respectively. The overall system problem can be solved
    for a cluster. However, the same optimization problem formulated is applicable
    for all the clusters with varying cluster size. The given Problem P1 in (11) is
    mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and is hard to solve in real-time
    for the binary variable y g , discrete rate threshold τ k , and the UAV scheduling
    time fraction β u,g . Therefore, the problem is decomposed into UAV scheduling
    problem and joint UAV scheduling with GRS sleeping problem. Given the GRS sleeping
    pattern A a1/a2 , i.e., y g , the decomposed UAV scheduling problem formulated
    for a cluster k with QoS threshold τ k is as follows. P2: max β u,g  ∑ u∈ U k
    U α ( R u ), s.t. (13), (15), (16), (17), (18). (19) (20) View Source The decomposed
    optimization problem in (19) is convex with respect to the variable β u,g . This
    can be solved using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) [26] method using the Lagrangian
    function given as follows. L= − ∑ u∈ U k 1 1−α ( ∑ g∈ G k x u,g y g β u,g r u,g
    ) 1−α + ∑ g∈ G k ( ∑ u∈ U k Y g x u,g y g β u,g −1) − ∑ u∈ U k ∑ g∈ G k D u,g
    β u,g . (21) View Source The KKT conditions necessary to find the optimal solution
    for the aforementioned problem are as follows. dL d β u,g = ∑ g∈ G k ( ∑ u∈ U
    k Y g x u,g y g β u,g −1)= D u,g β u,g = 0, 0, 0, (22) (23) (24) View Source where,
    (22) is the first-order necessary condition for optimal β u,g . The complementary-slackness
    conditions are specified in (23) and (24). Applying (21) in (22), we get − ∑ u∈
    U k β −α u,g x u,g r 1−α u,g + Y g − D u,g = ∑ u∈ U k β −α u,g x u,g r 1−α u,g
    = 0, Y g − D u,g . (25) (26) View Source The optimal β u,g should satisfy the
    condition β u,g >0 as in (18) and the complementary-slackness condition as in
    (24). Therefore, we consider D u,g =0 in (26) and on further simplification, β
    u,g = ( x u,g y g r u,g ) 1−α α Y 1 α g . (27) View Source Substituting (27) in
    (15), we get, Y 1 α g = ∑ u∈ U k x u,g y g r 1−α α u,g . (28) View Source On substituting
    (28) in (27), the optimal β u,g is β ∗ u,g = x u,g y g r 1−α α u,g ∑ u∈ U k x
    u,g y g r 1α α u,g . (29) View Source The similar UAV scheduler for α=1 is computed
    by maximizing ∑ u∈U log( R u ) in the objective function as in (8). The proportionally
    fair UAV scheduling time fraction with α=1 is written as follows. β ∗ u,g = x
    u,g y g ∑ u∈U x u,g y g . (30) View Source Given this UAV scheduling time fraction,
    the joint UAV scheduling with GRS sleeping problem is presented as follows. P3
    min y g ∑ g∈G y g , s.t. (12), (16), (17), (30), R u = ∑ g∈G x u,g y g β ∗ u,g
    r u,g ,∀u∈ U k , (31) (32) (33) View Source where, the objective function in (31)
    is minimizing the number of active GRS. This is equivalent to maximizing the number
    of GRSs sleeping. (33) computes the data rate of the UAV u over the active GRS
    using the (30). The data rate of the UAV u should be greater than the threshold
    τ k . We use the optimal β ∗ u,g computed in (30) for our GRS sleeping problem.
    Since y g is binary, in order to find the GRSS pattern with maximum energy savings,
    we need to check for all possible combinations of y g in the set G k . UAVs are
    subjected to varying mobility conditions. This varying mobility leads to varying
    QoS due to GRS sleeping. Thus, we next evaluate CoMP and NOMA for enhanced coverage
    and throughput, respectively, during GRSS. SECTION IV. Coordinated Multi-Point
    Coordinated multi-point with the joint transmission which hereafter is referred
    to as CoMP is a proven technology to enhance coverage and provide better QoS in
    cellular scenario [20]. This is the motivation to consider CoMP along with the
    GRSS. We consider that the GRSs in a cluster can cooperate and perform CoMP [20].
    Let each cluster formed while clustering the GRS be CoMP clusters as well. Without
    loss of generality, we focus on cluster k . The set of UAVs and GRSs in cluster
    k is U k and G k , respectively. We consider that the CoMP based system allocates
    a fraction of resources to CoMP UAVs in which all the GRSs within the CoMP cluster
    transmit jointly on the downlink to the CoMP UAVs. Whenever a UAV u in the CoMP
    cluster k receives the SINR less than a predetermined threshold denoted by χ then
    that UAV is served as a CoMP UAV. Let the time fraction in which all the GRSs
    within the CoMP cluster k transmit jointly on the downlink be denoted by θ k .
    Then (1− θ k ) will be the time fraction in which the GRSs serve their corresponding
    non-CoMP UAVs individually. Note that each CoMP cluster k can have its own θ k
    . Let U k,c and U k,nc denote the set of CoMP and non-CoMP UAVs in the cluster
    k . The SINR received by the CoMP UAV u , where, u∈ U k,c in the downlink time
    fraction θ k from the CoMP cluster k over the sub-channel m is denoted by γ m
    u,k and given by γ m u,k,c = ∑ l∈ G k P m l h m u,l ∑ l ^ ∈G l ^ ∉ G k P m l ^
    h m u, l ^ + σ 2 , (34) View Source where, ∑ l∈ G k P m l h m u,l is the power
    received by the UAV u from all GRSs in the CoMP cluster, k and ∑ l ^ ∈G l ^ ∉
    G k P m l ^ h m u, l ^ is the interference from all other GRSs in the system which
    are not part of CoMP cluster k . Similarly, the SINR of non-CoMP UAVs in the cluster
    k is computed as in (2). The link rate for the CoMP UAV is computed as follows.
    r u,k = η( γ m u,k )S C OFDM S Y OFDM T sc M. (35) View Source Similarly, the
    link rate of non-CoMP UAVs is computed as in (6). The resultant data rates of
    the CoMP UAV u in cluster k based on [20] is given as R u = θ k β u,k r u,k ,∀u∈
    U c,k , (36) View Source where, θ k is the total CoMP time fraction available
    for all CoMP UAVs in the cluster k , β u,k is the UAV scheduling time fraction
    allocated for a CoMP UAV u by the cluster k , and r u,k is the link rate as in
    (35). The optimal UAV scheduling time fraction β u,k allocated to a CoMP UAV u
    by the cluster k as in [20] is given as follows. β u,k = r 1−α α u,k ∑ u∈ U c,k
    r 1−α α u,k , View Source Similarly, the optimal CoMP time fraction for a cluster
    k , θ k based on [20] is θ k = ( ∑ u∈ U c,k β u,k r u,k ) 1 α ( ∑ u∈ U nc,k ∑
    g∈ G k β u,g r u,g ) 1 α + ( ∑ u∈ U c,k β u,k r u,k ) 1 α . View Source The resultant
    rate of non-CoMP UAV u from GRS g is given as follows. R u =(1− θ k ) ∑ g∈ G k
    x m u,g β u,g r u,g ,∀u∈ U nc,k , (37) View Source where, x m u,g , β u,g , and
    r u,g are computed as in (5), (29), and (6), respectively. Next, we present the
    other key technology, Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) considered in this
    work. SECTION V. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access High throughput and spectral efficiency
    are two key aspects that motivated us to look into Non-orthogonal multiple access
    (NOMA). When a GRS is in sleep mode there will be some loss in the coverage and
    throughput. The coverage is compensated by CoMP while the throughput can be compensated
    by adopting NOMA. We consider a NOMA system [21] for all GRSs where superposition
    coding (SC) is used to multiplex the signals of UAVs associated with a GRS and
    assume successive interference cancellation (SIC) is implemented at the receivers
    to separate the signals. Without loss of generality, we consider the k th cluster.
    For each GRS g in the k th cluster, let N g be the number of UAVs associated with
    it. For NOMA, all the UAVs are sorted with respect to their channel gains as |
    h m u 1 ,g | 2 >| h m u 2 ,g | 2 >| h m u 3 ,g | 2 >…>| h m u N g ,g | 2 . Given
    this arrangement, the UAVs are divided into two groups. Let U k,g be the set of
    UAVs associated with GRS g in cluster k . U 1 k,g be the first group of UAVs and
    U 2 k,g be the second group of UAVs. If N g is even, then U 1 k,g ={1,2,3,…, N
    g /2} and U 2 k,g ={ N g /2+1, N g /2+2, N g /2+3,…, N g /2+ N g /2} . The pairing
    is such that UAV 1 from U 1 k,g is paired with lowest channel gain UAV which is
    nothing but ( N g /2 ) th UAV in the set U 2 k,g , UAV 2 from U 1 k,g is paired
    with ( N g /2−1 ) th UAV in the set U 2 k,g and so on. In this way, all UAVs from
    U 1 k,g are paired with the UAVs in the U 2 k,g . Thus, all UAVs associated with
    the GRS g are paired when N g is even. Similarly, when N g is odd U 1 k,g ={1,2,3,…,⌊
    N g /2⌋} , U 2 k,g ={⌊ N g /2⌋+1,⌊ N g /2⌋+2,⌊ N g /2⌋+3,…,⌊ N g /2⌋+⌈ N g /2⌉}
    , where UAV pairing is the same as before. The only difference is that, the ⌈(
    N g /2 ) th ⌉ UAV is left unpaired. This will be served as OMA UAV. Let a NOMA
    pair be denoted by the ordered pair (p,q) where, p∈ U 1 k,g and q∈ U 2 k,g . Let
    N g denote the set of all NOMA ordered pairs associated with GRS g . When N g
    is odd, the unpaired UAV is not included in the set N g and such UAV be denoted
    by N 0,g . Hence, N g ={(p1,q1),(p2,q2),…,(p⌊ N g /2⌋,q⌈ N g /2⌉)} . Let B denote
    the number of pairs formed for the GRS g in cluster k . Here, we consider P-NOMA,
    where GRS allocates power to each NOMA pair based on their channel gains. In a
    pair, the UAV with a larger channel gain is allocated lesser power in comparison
    to the UAV with a small channel gain. Thus, both UAVs receive the superimposed
    signal from the GRS g . The SINR of the strong UAV p in the b th NOMA pair over
    sub-channel m is given as γ m p,b,g = ζ b P m g h m p,g ∑ g ^ ∈G∖g P m g ^ h m
    p, g ^ + σ 2 , (38) View Source where, the power from the GRS g over a sub-channel
    m , P m g is given in (1), the channel gain h m p,g is given in (3), ∑ g ^ ∈G/g
    P m g ^ h m p, g ^ is the aggregate interference received by the UAV p on the
    sub-channel m from all other GRSs, and ζ b is the fraction of total power allocated
    to higher channel gain UAV by the GRS g in NOMA pair b . We need to note that
    UAVs in a b th NOMA pair share same resources in time domain and successive interference
    cancellation is done at strong UAV, i.e., p th UAV. Similarly, the SINR for weak
    UAV q in the same NOMA pair b is given as follows. γ m q,b,g = (1− ζ b ) P m g
    h m q,g ζ b P m g h m q,g + ∑ g ^ ∈G∖g P m g ^ h m q, g ^ + σ 2 , (39) View Source
    where, h m q,g is the channel gain of the weak UAV in the b th noma pair, σ 2
    is the noise power, ∑ g ^ ∈G∖g P m g ^ h m q, g ^ is the interference received
    by the weak UAV from all other GRSs, and (1− ζ b ) is the total power fraction
    assigned to the weak UAV in the b th NOMA pair. Given the SINR of strong UAV p
    and weak UAV q , the link rate, r b u,g of the respective UAVs are computed based
    on (6). The resultant data rate of UAV u with NOMA based on [21] is given as follows.
    R u = ∑ g∈G x b u,g β b u,g r b u,g , (40) View Source where, β b u,g is the time
    fraction allocated to the b th NOMA pair by GRS g and r b u,g is the link rate
    of the UAV u in b th NOMA pair by GRS g . The optimal UAV scheduling time fraction
    β b u,g allocated to the b th NOMA pair by GRS g for α=1 based on [21] is given
    as follows. β b u,g = 1 ∑ u∈U x 0 u,g + ∑ b≠0,b∈ N g ∏ u∈ U g,b x b u,g , View
    Source where, U g,b is the set of UAVs associated with GRS g present in b th NOMA
    pair, ∑ b≠0,b∈ N g ∏ u∈ U g,b x b u,g is the total number of UAVs in the NOMA
    pair b , and x 0 u,g is binary variable represents the association of unpaired
    UAV u in GRS g . The optimal power allocation scheme for ζ b has been discussed
    in [27] for cellular scenario and the same can be applied here. In the following
    section, we propose three algorithms to dynamically solve the problem mentioned
    in (31). SECTION VI. Dynamic GRS Sleeping Algorithm With UAV Mobility We propose
    a Dynamic GRS sleeping algorithm for the UAV network which simultaneously ensures
    energy efficiency and coverage. The presented optimization problems in (11), (19),
    and (31) are for a time instant t , whereas, UAV’s position varies with every
    time instant t . The decision of GRS sleeping is taken based on QoS constraint
    as in (14) and (17). The proposed dynamic sleeping algorithm is hereby illustrated
    for the cluster k . However, the same can be applied to all the clusters. This
    algorithm searches for the sleeping pattern A t,∗ a1/a2 which maximizes the energy
    savings at time instant t while ensuring that the QoS constraints in (14) and
    (17) are satisfied. Each GRS in the cluster estimates the SINR of UAVs associated
    with it at discretized (with step size δ ) time intervals and shares this information
    with the GCS. The step size δ can be varied up to the desired accuracy level.
    Let the SINR vector of UAVs associated with cluster k at time t be Γ Ω×1 . With
    this SINR vector, rates of UAVs are calculated using (6) and (7). Let that rate
    vector be Ψ Ω×1 . The GRS computes an estimate of SINR vector Γ a1/a2 and the
    corresponding rate vector Ψ a1/a2 using (2) and (7), respectively, for different
    sleeping patterns at each time instant t . The proposed algorithm searches for
    a GRS sleeping pattern in the descending order of their energy saving. Hence,
    initially, these vectors are calculated for A n−1/n configuration as this configuration
    results in the maximum energy savings. If no UAV loses coverage, i.e., no element
    of the SINR vector Γ a1/a2 should be less than S dB, then the corresponding rate
    vector Ψ a1/a2 is calculated. In case the rate of no UAV doesn’t drop below the
    threshold τ k , i.e., no element of the vector Ψ a1/a2 should be less than τ k
    , then this sleeping configuration is optimal for the time instant t , i.e., A
    t,∗ a1/a2 = A n−1/n . If either of the aforementioned conditions (QoS constraints)
    fail, then the Γ a1/a2 and Ψ a1/a2 are updated for the next maximum energy savings
    configuration, i.e., A n−2/n . In case A n−2/n configuration also doesn’t satisfy
    the above conditions, then the algorithm checks for A n−3/n configuration. In
    this way, the algorithm checks until the configuration, A 1/n if the configurations
    A n−1/n to A n−(n−2)/n fail to satisfy the QoS constraints. If the configuration
    A 1/n also fails to satisfy the QoS constraints, then the algorithm gives the
    output as A 0 , i.e., no sleeping is possible and all GRS in the cluster should
    be active. Whenever a new UAV enters or leaves the coverage area of the GCS, Ω
    gets updated and at the same time all other parameters mentioned in the algorithm
    are recomputed. The proposed algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1. Next, we present
    Dynamic GRS algorithm with CoMP considered in this paper. SECTION Algorithm 1
    Dynamic GRS Sleeping 1: INPUTS: { P m g , h m u,g ,η( γ u,g ),M, U k , G k , V
    u ,τ,{ A j a1/a2 },S} 2: OUTPUTS: A (t,∗) a1/a2 3: Sort A a1/a2 in the descending
    order of energy saved 4: Initialize: J =|{ A j a1/a2 }| , A t,∗ a1/a2 = A 1 a1/a2

    s.t R u ≥ τ k &∀u s.t γ u,g ≥S then 10: A (t,∗) a1/a2 = A j a1/a2 11: break 12:
    else if j == J then 13: A (t,∗) a1/a2 = A 0 14: else 15: j = j +1 16: end if 17:
    end while A. Dynamic GRS Sleeping With CoMP The GRS sleeping can result in energy
    saving at the cost of coverage and UAV’s data rate. Given any GRSS pattern A a1/a2
    , UAVs SINR and data rate are computed as in (2) and (7), respectively. If any
    of the UAV’s SINR falls below the threshold S , then we perform CoMP for cluster
    k . The updated SINR vector Γ ^ a1/a2 is computed as in (34) and (2). In case
    SINR of any UAV in the Γ ^ a1/a2 is below the threshold S , then the heuristic
    presented in Algorithm 2 increments the value of j (index of the GRSS pattern
    after sorting the patterns in the descending order of their energy savings as
    shown in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2) and check for the next GRSS pattern. If
    the SINR of all UAVs is above the threshold S , then the updated rate vector Ψ
    ^ a1/a2 is computed with CoMP as in [20]. Thus, the heuristic now considers the
    updated rate vector Ψ ^ a1/a2 for the selection of configuration A a1/a2 . Please
    note that CoMP is performed only if at least two GRSs are active. For example,
    CoMP is not applicable for the configuration in Fig. 3. The detailed algorithm
    for dynamic GRS sleeping with CoMP is presented in Algorithm 2. In the following
    subsection, we present dynamic GRS sleeping with NOMA. Algorithm 2 Dynamic GRS
    Sleeping With CoMP 1: INPUTS: { P m g , h m u,g ,η( γ u,g ),M, U k , G k , V u

    γ u,g )M}) as in (36) ∀u∈ U k , denoted as Ψ ^ a1/a2 11: if ∃u s.t Γ ^ a1/a2 <S
    or Ψ ^ a1/a2 < τ k then 12: j = j +1 13: else if Γ ^ a1/a2 ≥S & Ψ ^ a1/a2 ≥ τ
    k then 14: A (t,∗) a1/a2 = A j a1/a2 15: break 16: end if 17: else 18: Calculate

    = A 0 25: else 26: j = j +1 27: end if 28: end if 29: end while B. Dynamic GRS
    Sleeping With NOMA After sleeping configuration is determined using either Algorithm
    1 (without CoMP) or Algorithm 2 (with CoMP), i.e., given the GRSS pattern A t,∗
    a1/a2 , the UAVs in the cluster k are paired based on Section V using NOMA. In
    this work, NOMA pairing is done without considering CoMP while determining the
    appropriate sleeping configuration. Please note that the UAVs that are associated
    only with the GRSs in cluster k are paired using NOMA. Given the NOMA UAV pairing,
    the SINR and data rate of UAVs for NOMA are computed as in (38), (39), and (40),
    respectively. The throughput of the system with NOMA is now computed using this
    updated SINR vector Γ ~ a1/a2 and rate vector Ψ ~ a1/a2 . The detailed algorithm
    is presented in Algorithm 3. Given the GRSS pattern, the inclusion of CoMP and
    NOMA increases coverage and the throughput of the system, respectively. The detailed
    numerical results for the three algorithms are presented next. Algorithm 3 Dynamic
    GRS Sleeping With NOMA 1: INPUTS: { P m g , h m u,g ,η( γ u,g ),M, U k , G k ,

    we present numerical results to validate our analysis. We first verify the average
    throughput of the benchmark system for various λ u and λ g . We then show that
    considering CoMP along with the benchmark system results in an increase of coverage
    at the expense of the decreased throughput. We also present the results for NOMA
    along with the benchmark system and show that the average throughput of the system
    increases by considering NOMA. Further, we present the numerical results of the
    discussed algorithm for GRS sleeping. The energy saved when GRS sleeping is performed
    with and without CoMP, and the corresponding throughput results are also presented.
    The increase in the throughput by adding NOMA for GRS sleeping is also presented.
    In this section, we do not directly compare the performance of the proposed algorithms
    with those of the existing works on UAV communications. This is because the existing
    works on UAV communications [3]–[24] focused on channel modelling for CNPC links
    and did not study the infrastructure and energy consumption related issues. We
    present the advantages of the proposed framework in energy savings and the gain
    in throughput using Monte Carlo simulations performed using MATLAB_R2021a. We
    consider a system where, GRSs are deployed randomly using Poisson point process
    (PPP) [20]. Results are plotted for multiple GRS densities, namely, {6,8,10,12,14}
    per km2 and for multiple UAV densities, {10,20,30,…,100} per km2.The parameters
    used in the simulation are summarized in Table 3. The UAV densities and GRS densities
    are varied to study the impact of sleeping, NOMA, and CoMP on low, average, and
    high densities. An area of 10 km2 is considered for the simulation. However, results
    presented focus on the center area of 1 km2. The simulation for each GRS density
    and for each UAV density is averaged over 103 location realizations as well as
    fading and shadowing realizations. Simulation results are presented for the center
    cluster and the cluster size in the simulation is considered to be 4. Clustering
    of GRS is done based on the distance among the GRSs. Euclidean Distance from one
    GRS to the other GRSs is calculated and 3 GRSs which are close to the GRS from
    which distance has been calculated are grouped under one cluster [28]. We have
    ensured that a GRS doesn’t belong to two or more clusters simultaneously. TABLE
    3 Simulation Parameters The trajectory of all UAVs is calculated using the Random
    waypoint mobility model. Random waypoint mobility model [29] is defined as follows:
    R(t)={ θ(t), ν(t), (0,2π], (0, ν max ]. (41) View Source In the Random waypoint
    mobility model, the nodes change their velocity and direction at each time interval.
    Here nodes represent UAVs and minimum velocity is not zero. Here velocity ranges
    from 32 m/s to 120 m/s . It is assumed that each UAV moves with a uniform velocity
    which is chosen uniformly randomly from the range mentioned. At each time interval,
    t UAV chooses an angle from the set (0,2π] and moves in that direction with already
    chosen uniform velocity ν . So, during this time interval, UAV moves with a velocity
    vector (νcosθ(t),νsinθ(t)) . Following these rules, if any UAV moves out of the
    boundary then it is bounced back into the simulation field with an angle of π−θ(t)
    . The random waypoint mobility model is a memoryless model. Hence, the current
    angle of the traverse is independent of the previous one. Fig. 6 shows a part
    of the trajectory of a UAV generated using a random mobility model. FIGURE 6.
    A part of the trajectory of a UAV generated using Random mobility model. Show
    All The variation of throughput for different λ g and λ u are presented in Fig.
    7. It is observed that for a particular λ g by increasing λ u throughput of the
    cluster is gradually decreasing. The increase in λ u makes the α -fair scheduler
    allocate less fraction of time to each UAV and this attributes to the reduction
    in overall throughput of the cluster. However, by increasing the λ g , the throughput
    curve is moving up which indicates the increase in the throughput of the system.
    Increasing the λ g increases the overall time fraction allocated to each UAV due
    to which there is a rise in throughput of the system. FIGURE 7. Throughput for
    varying λ u given λ g ={6,8,10,12,14} per km2 for Benchmark system. Show All The
    throughput of the system is also calculated by considering NOMA and CoMP individually
    with GRSS. It is observed that the system performance in terms of throughput improves
    after using NOMA. On the other hand, CoMP improves coverage at an expense of decreased
    throughput. For a given λ g and λ u system with NOMA has more throughput than
    benchmark while the system with CoMP has less throughput than the benchmark. Fig.
    8 shows the throughput variation of NOMA and CoMP comparing it with the benchmark
    system for λ g =6/ km2. The throughput of the system when NOMA is considered is
    the highest because of the pairing between UAVs. Due to this pairing, more time
    fraction is available to each UAV to transmit its data than that of the benchmark
    system. When CoMP is considered, there is a system level requirement of CoMP and
    non-CoMP time fraction. This decreases the amount of time fraction available to
    each UAV when compared with that of benchmark system. Hence, the throughput of
    the system with CoMP is less than that of the benchmark system. As mentioned that
    CoMP increases the coverage, the result validating this observation is presented
    in Fig. 9. We can see that the coverage with CoMP in both cases is better than
    without CoMP. The coverage of the system with GRSS is less than that of the benchmark
    system because in the benchmark system, all the GRSs in the cluster are in active
    mode but when GRSS is considered, few GRSs in the cluster are in sleep mode. However,
    when CoMP is considered in both the systems, all active GRSs in the cluster jointly
    transmit the signal to UAVs whose SINR is below a certain threshold. Thus, more
    UAVs come into the coverage. This is the reason for increased coverage of the
    CoMP based system in Fig. 9. Fig. 10 shows the trends of throughput when GRSS
    alone is performed, GRSS with NOMA, and GRSS with CoMP is performed. From the
    trends, it is observed that the throughput drop due to GRS sleeping can be compensated
    using NOMA. However, at lower UAV densities, it can be seen that there is no significant
    difference among the three curves in Fig. 10. with the increase in the UAV density
    NOMA gives better throughput. FIGURE 8. Throughput for varying λ u when NOMA and
    CoMP are considered along with Benchmark system given λ g =6/ km2. Show All FIGURE
    9. Illustration of coverage with/without CoMP and with/without GRSS for λ g =6/
    km2 and λ u =50/ km2. Show All FIGURE 10. Throughput for varying λ u for GRSS,
    GRSS with NOMA, and GRSS with CoMP given λ g =6/ km2. Show All Fig. 11 shows the
    energy savings. The advantage of CoMP during GRSS is seen in energy savings. It
    can be observed from the plot that average energy saved is decreasing with an
    increase in the UAV density for a constant GRS density. There are two energy saving
    bars shown against each UAV density. One bar is without CoMP and the other is
    with CoMP. Using CoMP while deciding GRS sleeping pattern, significantly increased
    the average energy savings but at a cost of slight reduction in the average throughput.
    For a given GRS density, at lower UAV density, energy-saving with and without
    CoMP doesn’t show much difference. However, there is an approximate difference
    of 10% seen as UAV densities reach 40 per km2. At higher UAV densities GRSS with
    CoMP is shown to be more energy efficient. Hence, performing GRSS along with CoMP
    significantly increases energy savings. However, from the throughput perspective,
    NOMA is seen performing better even in GRSS. FIGURE 11. Illustration of energy
    savings with GRSS and with GRSS considering CoMP given λ g =6/ km2. Show All Fig.
    12 shows a detailed comparison of the average throughput of the benchmark system
    with NOMA, CoMP, with GRSS, with GRSS and NOMA, with GRSS and CoMP. From the bar
    graph in Fig. 12, it is observed that when GRSS is performed, the throughput of
    the system is dropped and thereby applying NOMA has compensated a part of the
    throughput drop. The order of the throughput seen is Benchmark with NOMA ≥ Benchmark
    ≥ GRSS with NOMA ≥ GRSS ≥ GRSS with CoMP ≥ Benchmark with CoMP. The throughput
    of the Benchmark system with CoMP is less than the throughput of the system with
    GRSS and CoMP because after GRS sleeping some UAVs are offloaded to the other
    clusters. Hence, the scheduling time fraction is increased for the remaining UAVs
    resulting in a higher throughput. The throughput of the benchmark system with
    CoMP is the least among all scenarios. However, CoMP significantly increases the
    coverage as seen in Fig. 9. On the other hand, the throughput of the benchmark
    system with NOMA is higher in all other scenarios. Motivated by this in future
    we plan to investigate a joint CoMP-NOMA system for UAV communications. FIGURE
    12. Illustration of throughput trade off for different scenarios given λ g =6/
    km2. Show All SECTION VIII. Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed algorithms
    for maximizing the energy efficiency of the UAV infrastructure through a dynamic
    GRS sleeping subject to coverage and rate constraints. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first study of energy efficiency done in the area of CNPC links for
    UAV communication. We have formulated the GRS sleeping as an optimization problem.
    Then, we have proposed a dynamic GRS sleeping algorithm with UAV mobility to solve
    the optimization. We have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves significant
    energy efficiency through numerical results. Further, we have shown that CoMP
    with GRSS achieves significant energy savings and NOMA compensates for the throughput
    loss due to GRSS. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    Location: Pitesti, Romania SECTION I. Introduction In the context of climatic
    changes and population growth, the use of modern electronic technologies in the
    agricultural domain for improving the efficiency of this industry has become almost
    mandatory. Precision agriculture based on electronic automation modules and distributed
    sensor networks represents a very efficient solution for solving many problems
    regarding the farming resources optimization. In the broad spectrum of applications
    that are specific to the precision agriculture, the irrigation systems occupy
    a very special place because the water is a key resource that can significantly
    influence the efficiency of the farming systems. Although the irrigation systems
    were constantly improved over the years, only in the late period was realized
    a real progress in the implementation of the complex control systems for agriculture,
    by using powerful informatic systems, microcontrollers and new transmission technologies
    for the sensors. Precision irrigation technology allows the implementation of
    a new management methods for the water resources to meet the need of the soil
    and plants. In this context, this paper presents the structure of an enhanced
    automation module for testing the concept of precision irrigation. The design
    is based on an Arduino Uno development board and GSM/GPRS module for long distance
    data transmission [1], [2]. SECTION II. Precision Irrigation Systems Precision
    irrigation systems represents a technology applied in agricultural industry with
    the purpose to improve the utilization of the water and soil resources, without
    compromising the productions. A precision irrigation system must acquire and analyze
    data from a distributed network of sensors and, based on a predefined program
    and generate commands in a feedback loop for activating different types of control
    devices. The predefined program can contain elaborated algorithms that can operate
    in accordance with soil characteristics and with the local climatic conditions.
    Because usually the control algorithm of the precision irrigation system is implemented
    in software, it is obtained an enhanced flexibility and configurability. Also,
    a precision irrigation system can operate with multiple software models and algorithms
    that can be easily interchanged depending on the needs. This create conditions
    for a great reusability of the automation part of the system, including also the
    hardware elements [3]. In Fig. 1 is presented a typical structure of a precision
    irrigation system. As can be observed, the system is structured in multiple sections.
    The monitoring area is the first section of the system which comprise sensors
    for specific parameters (moisture, temperature etc.) and actuators for performing
    various commands like dripping activation, electro-valves control etc. The second
    section is represented by the local data acquisition and processing module that
    usually contains also wireless communication capability. Finally, the last section
    is composed by a gateway that connects all system to the Internet for additional
    data processing, adaptive control, decision support and cloud computing [4]. Fig.

    diagram of the automation module used for the implementation of the precision
    irrigation systems. Show All SECTION III. The Structure of the Automation Module
    The simplified block diagram of the proposed system is presented in Fig. 2. The
    proposed design contains a section of automation and control, realized with the
    microcontroller ATmega328P, a section containing the sensors and the execution
    elements, and a section responsible with the transmission of the acquired data.
    Dedicated sensors are used for measure the humidity in the soil and the water
    quantity that is provided to the sprinklers. As can be observed in Fig. 2, the
    system uses a water tank as buffer for alleviating the variable character of the
    supply sources that are existent in the site where the system is installed [5].
    The level of water in the tank is permanently monitored and the information is
    sent to the automation module through a conditioning circuity. A key parameter
    that is used by the automation module in the process of decision-making process
    is soil and air humidity. In this case, both parameters are constantly monitored
    and the acquired information is sent to the microcontroller through a set of conditioning
    circuits that are connected to its analog inputs (AIO-AI7). The water quantity
    that is sent to the irrigation system is accurately measured with a flowmeter
    based on turbine principle. The output signal of the flowmeter is a train of impulses
    with the frequency proportional with the volume of the water that passthrough
    the flowmeter. In order to accommodate the impulses from the flowmeter with the
    logical levels of the microcontroller, a dedicated circuit is used. The same circuit
    realizes also the galvanic insulation between the internal circuit of the flowmeter
    and the board containing microcontroller. Observing the Fig. 2 can be seen that
    the GSM/GPRS SIM800L communication module and the local display are connected
    with the ATmega328P microcontroller through the digital ports denoted C and D
    respectively. For ensuring the local connection between the automation module
    and a PC is used the internal USART block of the ATmega328P microcontroller and
    the circuit CH340G which operates as a bidirectional USART to USB to converter.
    The operation of the software application that was programmed into the memory
    of the ATmega328P microcontroller can be analyzed by looking to the simplified
    state diagram presented in Fig. 3. As can be observed this figure, the program
    starts with a general initialization of microcontroller''s internal variables
    and registers. In the next step are read the outputs of the sensors and a user
    menu displayed on the local LCD. Subsequently, this data will also be sent to
    a remote location via the GSM module. If the user wants to establish new threshold
    values for parameters of the automation module then the application enters in
    a specific loop that allows to realize this procedure [6], [7]. Fig. 3. The simplified
    state diagram of the software application for the automation module. Show All
    SECTION IV. Implementation and Results For verifying the correct operation of
    the proposed automation module, a small-scale precision irrigation system was
    implemented. The electrical diagram of the board containing the Atmega328P microcontroller,
    the local LCD and the interface circuits for sensors is detailed in Fig. 4. The
    air humidity was measured with H25k5A resistive sensor that is capable to operate
    in a range of 20-90% relative humidity, has a relatively small hysteresis of only
    3% at full-scale and can realize accurate determination in the temperature domain
    0-60°C. The moisture in the soil was measured with SEN-13637 sensor [8]. This
    device consists of two pads that operate as a variable resistor, depending on
    the conductivity of the soil, which in turn is proportional with the water content
    in the soil. The water volume transferred from the local tank to the irrigation
    system is monitored by the PRZ-1800/L flowmeter which has a precision of 2% and
    can operate with liquids having a maximum temperature of 65°C. The measurement
    resolution of the flowmeter is of 1880 impulses/liter [9]. The data transmission
    from the automation system to a remote PC is realized through the SIM800L quad-band
    GSM/GPRS module. The device is integrated in a dedicated extension board (shield)
    for the Arduino Uno development system contains the ATmega328P microcontroller.
    The wireless transmission is made at a relatively low speed of 85,6kbps, according
    to General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), but taking into account the extended availability
    of the mobile network, the automation module can be monitored virtually from everywhere.
    In Fig. 5 is presented the practical realization of the experimental prototype
    of the automation module and the reduced scale irrigation system. After tests
    realized with this reduced scale model it was found that the implemented system
    operates in accordance with the designated parameters. The flexibility in operation,
    scalability and the rapid reconfiguration offered by the proposed design is also
    due to the software application used to control the automation module. These characteristics
    represents major advantages of the proposed design. [10], [11]. Fig. 4. The electronic

    V. Conclusions Although it has always been an important issue, the management
    of water resources has now become, in the context of climate change, of vital
    importance for the development of a modern, much more efficient agriculture. Precision
    irrigation systems are a modern solution for optimizing the use of water in agriculture.
    Although the technology has many advantages, it is not widely adopted due to the
    initial development costs that are required for implementation and at the same
    time due to the requirements for the use of qualified personnel to operate the
    systems. This paper presented an enhanced design for implementing a reliable and
    efficient automation module for precision irrigation systems. Because is based
    on microcontroller and software programming, the proposed module is suitable for
    adaptive control and can be integrated in a larger system due to its communication
    capability using GSM network. Also, due to the implementation of the control algorithm
    in software, the proposed module has intrinsic flexibility in operation, scalability
    and allows rapid reconfiguration to suit any specific application. Tests realized
    with the reduced scale model of the automation module revealed that the implemented
    system operates in accordance with the designated parameters. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This

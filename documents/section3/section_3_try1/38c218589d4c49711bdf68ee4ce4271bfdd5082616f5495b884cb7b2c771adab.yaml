    concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and
    its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section
    III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves
    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.
    The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details
    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno

    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) has been applied in many areas, such
    as smart farming [1], smart home [2], wearables [3], smart city [4], connected
    health [5], connected car [6], connected drones [7], among other areas. The IoT
    allows physical objects to communicate together, share information and coordinate
    decisions. The IoT transforms traditional objects into intelligent objects by
    exploiting its enabling technologies such as communication technologies, Internet
    protocols, application, and sensor networks [8], [9]. The global smart agriculture
    market is expected to reach 15.3billionbytheendof2025comparedto 5 billion in the
    year 2016 [10]. Smart agriculture will become an important IoT application area
    in agri-products exporting countries. Recently, the IoT application has been deployed
    for smart agriculture using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) such as irrigation
    sensor network [11], prediction of frost events [12], precision soil farming [13],
    blind entity identification [14], smart farming [15], and precision agriculture
    [16]. To develop a green IoT-based agriculture solution, there are six main challenges,
    including, hardware, data analytics, maintenance, mobility, infrastructure, data
    security, and privacy [17]. The hardware challenges concern the choice of sensors
    and meters for IoT devices. Therefore, there are various kinds of sensors types
    that can be used in IoT application (e.g., temperature sensor, proximity sensor,
    pressure sensor, water quality sensor, chemical sensor, gas sensor, humidity sensor…etc.).
    The data analytics challenge concern the application of predictive algorithms
    and machine learning (e.g., deep learning approaches) in IoT data to obtain a
    nutritive solution for smart agriculture. The maintenance challenge concerns regular
    sensors checks of all IoT devices since they can be easily damaged in the agriculture
    field. The mobility challenge concerns the type of wireless communication (e.g.,
    4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan, LoRa) that can connect sensors distributed over a large
    area in the agriculture field. The infrastructure challenges concern the installation
    and development of IoT networking architecture using new technologies such as
    fog computing, cloud computing, network virtualization…etc. The main problem in
    the development of green IoT-based agriculture is not located at the physical
    support but mainly in reassuring both security and privacy. With the adaption
    of green IoT-based agriculture, an adversary may find more ways to penetrate into
    the system (e.g., via a false data injection attack), raising new security and
    privacy issues and asking for more secure communications in the smart agriculture
    filed. According to Cha et al. [18], privacy-enhancing technologies in IoT application
    can be classified into seven categories, including, enforcement, control over
    data, personal data protection, anonymization or pseudonymization, partial data
    disclosure, anonymous authorization, and holistic privacy preservation. Therefore,
    security requirements [19] in IoT application can be classified into authentication,
    confidentiality, non-repudiation, integrity, and access control. These security
    and privacy requirements should be achieved by the security protocols for green
    IoT-based agriculture. There are related survey papers [9], [20]–[23] that focused
    on various aspects of IoT-based agriculture, as presented in Tab. I. Brewster
    et al. [20] presented a review on developing IoT-based large-scale pilots in agriculture.
    Ray [21] presented a systematic survey that covers the IoT deployment for improved
    farming. Recently, the surveys [22], [23] discussed the fundamental structures
    of IoT and its impact in the field of green IoT-based agriculture. However, these
    surveys are very limited regarding research challenges on security and privacy.
    In the literature, there are different related surveys that deal with IoT security.
    As shown in Table 2, we classify the IoT security surveys with respect to the
    following criteria: Threat model: It indicates whether the survey considered the
    threats against the IoT network. Security & Privacy: It indicates whether the
    survey focused considered the security and privacy countermeasures to protect
    the IoT network. Blockchain: It indicate whether the survey considered bloackanin-based
    solution for IoT security. Target IoT application: It indicates whether the survey
    focused on specific or general IoT applications. TABLE 1 Related Surveys on Green
    IoT-Based Agriculture TABLE 2 Related Surveys on IoT Security Most of the IoT
    security surveys [24]–[31] describe the required security and privacy countermeasures
    and target without focusing on any particular application. Some of them restrict
    their covered countermeasures to IoT security taxonomy [26], IoT frameworks [27],
    [30], security communication protocols [24], [25], or trust-based solutions [31].
    Some of the surveys describe the threat models that could comprise the security
    of IoT networks [26], [28], [29], [31]–[33]. Recently, blockchain-based solutions
    for IoT security have attracted more attention in [29], [34]–[36]. Kouicem et
    al. [35] present their security solutions and blockchain-based security solutions
    with respect to five IoT applications: Smart Grid, EHealth, Transportation, Smart
    city, and Manufacturing. Other surveys focused on industrial IoT [32], Smart Grid
    [37], or Smart Home [34]. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the first
    that thoroughly covers threats models, secuirty and privacy countermeasures, blockchain-based
    solutions for IoT security, and focuses only on Green IoT-based agriculture applications.
    Our contributions in this work are: We present a four-tier green IoT-based agriculture
    architecture. We present the threat models against green IoT-based agriculture
    and provide a classification into five categories, including, attacks against
    privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity properties.
    We review the security and privacy solutions for IoT applications and how they
    will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. We analyze the privacy-oriented
    blockchain-based solutions for IoT applications and how they will be adapted for
    green IoT-based agriculture. We provide the consensus algorithms for blockchain-based
    solutions and how they will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. We emphasize
    the security and privacy challenges solutions for green IoT-based agriculture.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the four-tier
    green IoT-based agriculture architecture. In Section III, we present the threat
    models against green IoT-based agriculture and provide a classification into five
    categories. In Section IV, we provide the new trends of security and privacy solutions
    for green IoT-based agriculture. In Section V, we clearly highlight the pros and
    cons of the existing privacy-oriented blockchain-based solutions. Then, we discuss
    the security and privacy challenges solutions in Section VI. Lastly, Section VII
    presents conclusions. SECTION II. Green IoT-Based Agriculture Smart agriculture
    based on IoT technology has enabled farmers to improve crop yields, optimize irrigation
    efficiency, and reduce farming costs. It is an intelligent agricultural solution
    combining agriculture with modern information technology. The IoT technology has
    contributed to the emergence of the three aspects: Precision agriculture: is a
    technology which uses advanced technology to improve crop yield, among them, Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) is the main driver for the development of it [40]. It effectively
    reduces the potential risks in the production process and helps farmers making
    accurate and controlled farming practices by deploying a large number of low-power,
    multi-function, wireless communication sensors in environments (such as fields
    and open poultry and livestock breeding) and collecting relevant data in agricultural
    production (such as environment data, crop growth data, livestock health data
    [41]–[44]). The main modern information technology used in precision agriculture
    is “3S” technology, including Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System
    (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS). The most remarkable application of
    GPS in precision agriculture is agricultural drones, they are used in the agriculture
    industry to enhance the different farming practices [45]. The ground and aerial
    drones are used for assessment of crop health, crop monitoring, planting, crop
    spraying, and field analysis. Furthermore, with the integration of IoT and “3S”
    technology in open poultry and livestock breeding, it is possible to collection
    information about the location and health of cattle by attaching sensors to them,
    which allows to identify sick cattle and isolated them. The farmers can also reduce
    time and effort needed to locate their animals [46]. Generally, Precision agriculture
    constructs an expert decision system for agriculture production management to
    replace the subjective traditional agricultural production management method,
    thereby, (1) reasonable using of pesticides to reduce environmental pollution;
    (2) improving the efficiency of agricultural irrigation and reducing the waste
    of resources; (3) Planting crops in an environment suitable for their growth,
    improving the land usage; (4) analyzing the growth law of crops and livestock,
    maintaining their best growth state and greatly improving the output and quality
    of agricultural products. Facility agriculture: is an industrialized agricultural
    production mode that aims at good quality and high yield, belongs to a high-input,
    high-output, capital-intensive, technology-intensive and labor-intensive industry
    [47]. It provides a crop production protection facility created by engineering
    technology to achieve the goal that agricultural production is not restricted
    by environmental factors and automatic and efficient; frees traditional agriculture
    from the shackles of nature; breaks the seasonal characteristics of traditional
    agricultural products; meets the multi-level consumption demand derived from social
    development [48]. Facility agriculture can be divided into facility horticulture
    and farming in terms of types, they mainly use biotechnology, engineering, meteorological
    environment, IoT, computer technology and other technologies. Its core lies in
    the prediction model and decision management control system based on the historical
    data collected by IoT sensors. Facility agriculture has become a mainstay industry
    in some developed countries such as America, Netherlands and Japan, the most prominent
    example is the intelligent greenhouse. IoT sensors can be used to automatically
    monitor and control the internal climate parameters of the greenhouse [49]. The
    sensors collect and transmit real-time data to the farmer. If the values of parameters
    deviate from normal condition, some actions like automatic irrigation can be performed
    without, which helps in reducing the labor cost as no human intervention is needed.
    Aquaculture, poultry and livestock farming are similar with it, the difference
    is different environment factors require deployment of different IoT sensors and
    set up specific computer control cultivation schemes. The current development
    goal of facility agriculture is intelligent plant factory, it enables continuous
    and efficient crop production under fully enclosed and intelligent control conditions.
    Moreover, it frees crop growth from geographical constraints, shortens the production
    cycle of agricultural products and improves product quality and yield. It is one
    of the symbols of the combination of agriculture and industry, and also the development
    direction of agriculture in the future. Contract farming: is a new model of agricultural
    production and management. With the advancement of Urbanization in the world,
    the gap between rural and urban development is gradually widening. According to
    the statistics, 80% of the extreme poor and 75% of the moderate poor live in rural
    areas [50]. Relatively backward agricultural infrastructure, hidden dangers in
    the quality and safety of agricultural products and information isolation in agricultural
    products trading are the main reasons. To solve these problems, contract farming
    emerges as the times require. It outsources the production demand of some agricultural
    products to farmers in advance through customers, reduces the planting and breeding
    risks of growers and avoid blind production, is an effective market-oriented production
    and marketing model [51]. Contract farming includes supply chain management of
    agricultural products, traceability of agricultural products safety, agricultural
    products trading system, agricultural products logistics and the like. The IoT
    technology has been used in tracking the food supply chain (i.e., farm-to-fork
    traceability) [52]. For example, it has been employed to provide information about
    the product to the final consumer [53]. An IoT framework is proposed in [] to
    assess the freshness of fruits in e-commerce deliveries. In [54], IoT is used
    to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, in order to help consumers
    in making better purchase decisions. In [55], an early-warning system, which monitors
    food safety and warns about deterioration of product quality, is proposed. An
    IoT-based monitoring system is developed in [56] to provide geo-location information
    about food storage and transportation. Fig. 1 illustrates the four-tier green
    IoT-based agriculture architecture, which is based on the following four layers:
    1) Agriculture sensors layer; 2) Fog layer; 3) Core layer; 4) and Cloud layer.
    The layers are discussed as follows: FIGURE 1. Four-tier green IoT-based agriculture
    architecture. Show All A. Agriculture Sensors Layer This layer consists of IoT-enabled
    devices (e.g., sensor nodes, smartphones, …etc.) equipped with Global Positioning
    System for creating different types IoTs for smart agriculture, including, IoTs
    for field agriculture, IoTs for the greenhouse, IoTs for the photovoltaic farm,
    IoTs for the solar insecticidal lamp, and others. Therefore, the integration and
    adaptation of IoT devices into various levels of agriculture aim to provide two
    goals. The first goal is to provide the reliability of manufacture as well as
    the distribution of the nutrient solution. The second goal is to provide better
    control in term of consumption, which gives the costs low and reduces losses in
    term of solution. In addition to the economic impact, the environmental impact
    will be significantly reduced. The farmer in the green IoT-based agriculture uses
    a digital control system (e.g., Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA))
    for process control to meet agriculture control requirements. To integrate IoTs
    for greenhouse, we propose the sensor and meters nodes for each equipment as follows:
    IoT devices for the water pumping system which takes into consideration the surfaces
    to be irrigated, the pressures to be expected, and the flow rates of drippers.
    Water meters for water storage in order to show real-time updates. IoT devices
    adapted for each filtering equipment (e.g., sand filter) which takes into consideration
    the physical properties of water as well as drippers. Fertilizers meters for the
    storage and injectors of fertilizers (e.g., NPK fertilizers) in order to provide
    real-time updates. IoT devices for controlling the pH and electrical conductivity
    to meet the desired value in term of nutrient solution. Small solar panels with
    IoT sensors for controlling moisture levels and temperature. These IoT devices
    and meters communicate via 5G cellular and satellite communication networks with
    the fog computing layer. B. Fog Computing Layer Since some agriculture IoT data
    need to be processed closer to IoT devices and meters, the fog computing layer
    is proposed especially for this task, which can significantly reduce the processing
    time. This layer is also termed as Edge computing layer. The fog nodes receive
    agriculture IoT data via geo-distributed devices that are managed in a distributed
    network, including, access points, gateway, router, and switch. The fog computing
    layer provides several advantages, such as reduces the traffic overhead and reinforcement
    of agriculture IoT data security [57]. Therefore, there are three hierarchical
    architectures [58] that can be used for fog computing layer in the green IoT-based
    agriculture. The first hierarchical architecture is three-tier (including, Tier
    1-Things/End Devices, Tier 2-Fog, Tier 2-Cloud), which is the basic architecture
    of fog computing. The second hierarchical architecture is four-tier combined fog-cloud
    architecture [59]. The last hierarchical architecture is based on Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN) [60]. For example in the IoT use case in greenhouse, the nutrient
    solution can be processed and calculated at the fog computing layer. This nutrient
    solution uses the IoT data (e.g., the composition of water, temperature, and humidity)
    captured from the agriculture sensors layer. C. Core Network Layer The core layer
    is responsible for the transport of data over green IoT-based agriculture from
    fog computing layer to cloud computing layer. This layer is also termed as the
    foundation or backbone network. To ensure that packets are securely routed over
    the network, the core layer includes high-speed cables (e.g., fiber optic cables)
    and high-end switches (e.g., Cisco switches 12000) [61]. In addition, the core
    network layer is responsible for routing by delivering a strategies-based network
    interconnection such as strategy of QoS, strategy of control broadcast and multicast…etc.
    D. Cloud Computing Layer This layer is a centralized system consists of data centers
    and traditional cloud servers, which they have sufficient computing resources
    and sufficient storage. The cloud computing layer is responsible for delivering
    storage, data access, and synchronization [62]. SECTION III. Threat Models Generally,
    the classification of attacks for IoT application is done using the following
    two criteria: 1) Internal or external and 2) Passive or active, as discussed in
    [19]. Therefore, according to the property that the attack trying to compromise
    nodes in green IoT-based agriculture (i.e., IoT devices, Fog nodes, and Cloud
    nodes), we classify the threat models into the following five main categories,
    attacks against privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity
    properties, as presented in Fig. 2. FIGURE 2. Threat models in green IoT-based
    agriculture. Show All FIGURE 3. The blockchain data structure. Show All FIGURE
    4. An illustration of blockchain working methodology for green IoT-based agriculture
    architecture. Show All FIGURE 5. Blockchain-based solutions for green IoT-based
    agriculture. BPKI: Blockchain-based PKI solution; BML: Blockchain-based machine
    learning solution; BDKM: Blockchain-based distributed key management solution;
    BAC: Blockchain-based access control solution; BRT: Blockchain-based reputation
    and trust solution; BAI: Blockchain-based authentication and identification solution;
    BSDN: Blockchain-based secure SDN solution. Show All FIGURE 6. The consensus process
    based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) algorithm for blockchain-based
    agri-products distribution. Show All A. Attacks Against Privacy This category
    of attacks is based on learning the precise location and identity of IoT devices
    at agriculture sensors layer to get privacy data and compromise the privacy of
    the system. In green IoT-based agriculture, the IoT data (e.g., the composition
    of water, temperature, and humidity) is collected multiple times per hour by IoT
    devices and smart meters at agriculture sensors layer to obtain fine-grained information
    about the plants status and improve nutrient solution efficiency. The detailed
    analysis of this IoT data may easily reveal farmers’ physical activities and the
    nutrient solution adopted. For example, in pH settings, if the pH rises excessively
    indicates that the farmer will increase the ammonium supply, and if the pH falls
    indicates that the farmer will reduce the ammonium supply. Using this information,
    an adversary can plan physical attacks (e.g., sending a drone) to disrupt pH settings.
    Obviously, this private information (i.e. pH settings) must be protected from
    unauthorized access. B. Attacks Against Authentication This category of attacks
    forges identities to impersonate as authorized nodes (i.e., IoT device, fog node,
    or cloud node) in order to gain access to the green IoT-based agriculture. For
    example, an adversary may lunch the following identity-based attacks for forge
    identities, namely, replay attack, masquerade attack, spoofing attack, and impersonation
    attack. A replay attack takes place in the form of man-in-the-middle attack (MITM).
    Its objectives in the green IoT-based agriculture are to intercepting data packets
    between IoT devices or an IoT device with an access point at agriculture sensors
    layer and then relaying them to their destinations without modification. The authentication
    protocols for securing IoT networks use three techniques against replay attacks,
    namely, pairing-based cryptography, hash functions, and timestamp in the encrypted
    data, as discussed in [19]. A masquerade attack aims to masquerade as a legitimate
    node to log into the server at agriculture sensors layer (i.e., log into the access
    point) or fog computing layer (i.e., log into the fog node). The authentication
    protocols for securing IoT networks use three techniques against masquerade attacks,
    namely, 1) behavioral features-based biometric (e.g., keystroke, signature, gait,
    or voice), 2) human physiological-based biometric (e.g., fingerprint palm, electrocardiogram,
    eyes, or face), 3) hashing functions, 4) Elliptic curve cryptosystem, and 5) pairing-based
    cryptography [63]. C. Attacks Against Confidentiality This category of attacks
    attempts to adversarially eavesdrop the network traffic between IoT devices or
    an IoT device with an access point at agriculture sensors layer so as to mislead
    the green IoT-based agriculture to compromise the confidentiality and make wrong
    decisions/actions. For example, an adversary may lunch the following Eavesdropping-based
    attacks to compromise the confidentiality, including, tracing attack, brute force
    attack, and known-key attack. A tracing attack aims to collect enough privacy
    information from IoT devices at agriculture sensors layer to link data with a
    particular real identity. To resist this attack, security solutions based on random
    numbers in commitments and proofs ought to be developed [64]. A brute force attack
    aims to produce a list of all possible passwords that can be used by IoT devices
    at agriculture sensors layer, then to exhaust them one by one until the correct
    password can be identified [65]. A known-key attack aims to generate new session
    keys based on compromising past session keys. To resist this attack, security
    solutions that integrate random nonce in session key ought to be developed. D.
    Attacks Against Availability This category takes the form of Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks. Its goals are to make the services in green IoT-based agriculture
    (e.g., authentication for IoT devices) are unavailable either by (1) flooding
    servers with a huge amount of data to make it busy and unable to provide a service
    to IoT devices; (2) updating with false data injection attacks; or (3) attack
    on accurate localization for UAV with a malicious 5G station. E. Attacks Against
    Integrity This category of attacks implies an unauthorized party to accessing
    and modifying private information (e.g. pH settings). Under this category, we
    can find the following attacks: forgery attack, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack,
    biometric template attack, and trojan horse attack. To resist this attack, the
    data aggregation schemes based on homomorphic encryption and hash functions ought
    to be developed. SECTION IV. Security and Privacy Solutions Table 3 summarizes
    research for security and privacy solutions for IoT applications and how they
    will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. TABLE 3 Summary of Security and
    Privacy Solutions for IoT Applications and How They Will be Adapted for Green
    IoT-Based Agriculture A. Privacy-Preserving Solutions 1) Privacy-Preserving Data
    Aggregation During running the aggregation at the network edge in green IoT-based
    agriculture, the fog devices cannot see each green product data. The privacy-preserving
    data aggregation solution is very important to protect each green IoT device’s
    data. To resist against inject false data, Lu et al. [70] proposed a lightweight
    privacy-preserving data aggregation solution, named LDPA, for IoT applications,
    which can be applied in green IoT-based agriculture. The LDPA combines three cryptographic
    techniques, namely, the homomorphic Paillier encryption Chinese Remainder Theorem,
    and one-way hash chain. The Chinese remainder theorem is used by the control center
    for computing the mean and variance after collecting, aggregating, and forwarding
    IoT devices’ data from the network edge to the control center. The homomorphic
    Paillier encryption is used for encryption the report of each sensing data from
    each IoT device. The one-way hash chain technique is used for achieving lightweight
    authentication among IoT devices. Therefore, the LDPA solution can resist against
    the false data injection since the one-way hash chain technique as well as the
    time slot are adapted in authentication phase between the fog device and IoT device.
    In addition, the LDPA solution can achieve differential privacy since some noises
    are added in the aggregated data. Guan et al. [75] introduced an anonymous and
    privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol, named APPA, for IoT application.
    The system model considers Fog-enhanced IoT, which contains three layers, namely,
    the lower layer (smart devices), middle layer (Fog nodes), and Upper layer (Cloud
    Computing). To archives anonymity and unforgeability, the APPA protocol uses two
    cryptographic techniques, namely, signature-of-knowledge and paillier cryptosystem.
    The APPA protocol can resist eavesdropping attack and false data injection attack,
    but the availability is not considered. 2) Location Privacy Location-based services
    (LBS) in green IoT-based agriculture will have a very important area for research
    with the rapid development of smart agriculture. Therefore, an adversary can track
    IoT devices in smart agriculture, which may cause problems of loss of privacy.
    Sun et al. [69] proposed a location privacy algorithm for IoT application, which
    can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. To protect location privacy, the
    study uses a dummy location privacy algorithm, which consists of finding an optimal
    set of dummy locations using a greedy approach. The proposed algorithm can resist
    two attacks categories, namely, inference attacks and colluding attacks, but the
    data integrity and authentication are not considered. 3) Content-Oriented Protection
    The content-oriented protection solution is very important against the violation
    of a farmer’s privacy when different IoT data are collected and combined from
    agriculture sensors layer. Gai et al. [72] proposed a dynamic privacy protection
    model, named DPP, for ensuring mobile device user privacy in IoT application.
    The idea of DPP model is based on the classification of the privacy protection
    levels. Specifically, the DPP model uses three main phases, including, (1) security
    classifications for the definition of the privacy weight; (2) content-oriented
    data pairs identification of content-oriented data pairs based on the security
    classifications; and (3) the input data table. The evaluation performance in term
    of plan generation and timing constraints show that the DPP’s average time consumption
    is 1.2% shorter than other related works. 4) Anonymity One of the important security
    properties in green IoT-based agriculture is strong anonymity, which means that
    except for the fog nodes, the agriculture IoT data identity cannot be revealed.
    The CPAL solution proposed by Lai et al. [66] archives user anonymity in IoT application
    using the hybrid linear combination encryption. The CPAL solution defined the
    privacy-preservation with three levels, including, authorized anonymous user linking,
    anonymity, and authentication. Therefore, the CPAL solution can be adapted for
    green IoT-based agriculture by applying the hybrid linear combination encryption
    between the IoT devices communications at agriculture sensors layer. In addition,
    the CPAL solution is robust against impersonation attack and DoS attack. 5) Privacy-Preserving
    Trust Evaluation Privacy-preserving trust evaluation is an important role to ensures
    trust relationships among green IoT-based agriculture entities. Yan et al. [68]
    proposed two schemes of privacy-preserving trust evaluation that can be adapted
    for green IoT-based agriculture. These two schemes use additive homomorphic encryption
    for providing trust evaluation. The first scheme considers that authorized proxy
    is a fully trusted and collusion does not exist between evaluation party and authorized
    proxy. The second scheme considers that authorized proxy is not fully trusted
    and evaluation party and authorized proxy don’t collude. In both schemes, there
    is a trust evaluation phase, which after receiving the encrypted evidence, a node
    decrypts data and then evaluates the trust of the result using a trust evaluation
    algorithm. 6) Personalized Privacy Personalized privacy consists of providing
    trapdoor indistinguishability and index indistinguishability. The work by Li et
    al. [78] proposed a searchable encryption scheme for personalized privacy in IoT
    application, which can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. The proposed
    scheme considers an IoT network model that includes three entities, i.e., the
    data owner, cloud server, and data user. The cloud server is used to stores and
    retrieves the encrypted file features, which it received the encrypted file features
    from the data owner. Based on the specific keyword, the data user queries the
    encrypted file features. The proposed scheme is proven using two challenge-response
    games that it satisfies trapdoor indistinguishability and index indistinguishability
    under chosen keyword-file feature level pair attack. Therefore, the proposed scheme
    can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture by adapting a searchable encryption
    scheme using the following five functions: 1) Setup for performing the security
    parameters; 2) KeyGen for generating the private and public keys; 3) Store for
    creating the index table and user authorization; 4) Trapdoor for creating the
    trapdoor query; and 5) Search. The Setup and Store functions are run by the fog
    node. The KeyGen function is run by the fog node and the IoT device. The Trapdoor
    function is run by the IoT device. The Search function is performed interactively
    between the IoT device and the cloud server. B. Data Integrity Solutions To protect
    data integrity and authentication for IoT applications, Song et al. [2] proposed
    a privacy-preserving protocol that uses message authentication codes (MAC). The
    MAC solution is added to the original IoT data, which the sender can verify that
    the IoT data has not tampered during communication. This solution can be applied
    in green IoT-based agriculture (i.e., between a group of IoT devices and fog device)
    in order to protect the integrity of the green IoT device’s data. Wang et al.
    [71] proposed a lightweight label-based access control scheme, named LACS, for
    IoT-based 5G network, which can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. The
    LACS scheme uses two parts, including, the prover (caching fog node) and the verifier
    (caching server). The user authentication is achieved using verifying data integrity.
    The label-based authentication is used against two attacks, namely, disturbing
    attack and ignoring attack. The performance evaluation shows that the MD5 is more
    efficient than the SHA-1 in the IoT environment that uses LACS scheme. The work
    by Li et al. [80] can provide content integrity verification for named data networking,
    which can be adapted for communication among agriculture IoT nodes in green IoT-based
    agriculture. Specifically, the authors proposed a lightweight integrity verification
    architecture, named LIVE, for ensuring secure content access. The LIVE architecture
    uses the following three security levels: (1) Non-Cacheable; (2) 1-Cacheable;
    (3) All-Cacheable. To produce tokens for signature generation, the LIVE architecture
    uses a hash tree based signature algorithm (Merkle Hash Tree algorithm). C. Authentication
    Solutions 1) RFID Authentication Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology
    used for capturing and automatically identifying information in electronic tags.
    With the adaptation of RFID technology into green IoT-based agriculture, the crops
    will better be controlled and herd better monitored. Therefore, an unauthorized
    party can manage the RFID-tag, which the smart agriculture system will be compromised.
    Gope et al. [73] proposed an anonymous lightweight RFID authentication solution
    for IoT application. Specifically, the network model considered by the study is
    based on four entities, including, two servers (i.e., an authenticated cloud and
    a backend database), a reader, and an RFID-tag. Based on unlinkable pseudo-identity,
    emergency key, and hash function, the proposed solution can resist against the
    following five attacks: replay attack, forgery attack, cloning attack, DoS attack,
    and location tracking attack. In addition, this solution can achieve five security
    properties, namely, mutual authentication, tag anonymity, availability, and scalability,
    but false data injection attack, as well as DDoS attack, are not considered. 2)
    Delegated Authentication Since agriculture IoT data can be transported via untrusted
    public devices, the security solutions need to provide the delegated authentication.
    The work by Zhang et al. [77] proposed a semi-outsourcing privacy-preserving scheme,
    named SOPP, for the IoT data collection. The SOPP scheme considers three components,
    including, data center, public (untrusted) clouds, and IoT devices. To decreases
    the throughput and achieves a longer battery duration, the SOPP scheme applied
    elliptic curve cryptography as a one-way (non-interactive) authentication between
    untrusted public clouds and IoT devices. To block invalid access, the authentication
    is delegated to public clouds. The data center uses data decryption to provides
    data integrity. D. Access Control Solutions To supporting privacy-preserving in
    green IoT-based agriculture, an efficient access control scheme can be adapted.
    The work by Fan et al. [76] designed an access control protocol for fog-enabled
    IoT. The study considered cloud-fog computing that contains five entities, including,
    a cloud service provider, a group of fog nodes, a group of data owners, a certificate
    authority, and a group of IoT devices. For providing revocation and data confidentiality
    with verifiability, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption is adapted when
    an IoT device with an identifier submits a data access request. The the blockchain
    technology [39] can be used for providing an access control in green IoT-based
    agriculture. Ouaddah et al. [81] proposed an access control framework, named FairAccess,
    for IoT application. The FairAccess framework uses the blockchain technology to
    get, grant, delegate, and revoke access. Zhang et al. [74] consider an IoT system
    with a large number of storage devices, servers, user devices, IoT gateways. Specifically,
    the study proposed an access control framework based on the Ethereum smart contract
    platform. This platform contains five main elements, including, smart contract,
    account/address, blockchain, transaction and message, and mining. To manage the
    policies and implement access control, the proposed framework provides functions
    or application binary interfaces (e.g., add new access control policy, updates
    the policy, returns the access result and penalty…etc.). The evaluation performance
    on two Raspberry Pi 3 Model B shows that the proposed framework may not be able
    to reflect the overhead in real-world IoT system. E. Data Confidentiality Solutions
    Data security in green IoT-based agriculture also includes confidentiality, which
    can be achieved by cipher-text based access control technique. Yao et al. [67]
    proposed a lightweight attribute-based encryption scheme for IoT application,
    which can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. To provide data confidentiality
    with integrity, the proposed scheme uses an elliptic curve integrated encryption
    scheme (ECDH). Specifically, the ECDH scheme is used for generating a sharing
    secret from two groups, including, the MAC key and encryption key. The performance
    evaluation in term of overhead (the total size of the private key, public key,
    and cipher-text) shows that the proposed scheme is much shorter than other related
    cryptographic methods that use decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent. In
    addition, the proposed scheme is robust against chosen plaintext and attribute-set
    attack. SECTION V. Privacy-Preserving Over Blockchain The blockchain technology
    can be effectively applied in almost all domains of IoT, including, green IoT-based
    agriculture [39], [82]–[85]. The application of blockchain technology for IoT
    is applied to provide privacy-preserving. To be specific, the blockchain is used
    for encrypted data sharing. Therefore, the blockchain can be used in green IoT-based
    agriculture as a distributed digital ledger containing all messages. This distributed
    ledger is replicated and stored in different IoT nodes at agriculture sensors
    layer, as presented in Fig. 6. Table 4 summarizes research for privacy-oriented
    blockchain-based solutions for IoT applications and how they will be adapted for
    green IoT-based agriculture. According to the characteristic of each privacy-oriented
    blockchain-based solution, we classify the blockchain-based solutions for green
    IoT-based agriculture into six categories, including, 1) Blockchain-based machine
    learning solution; 2) Blockchain-based distributed key management solution; 3)
    Blockchain-based access control solution; 4) Blockchain-based reputation and trust
    solution; 5) Blockchain-based authentication and identification solution, and
    6) Blockchain-based secure SDN solution, as presented in Fig. 5. TABLE 4 Summary
    of Privacy-Oriented Blockchain-Based Solutions for IoT Applications and How They
    Will be Adapted for Green IoT-Based Agriculture A. Blockchain-Based Solutions
    1) Blockchain-Based PKI Solution Jiang et al. [79] proposed a thin-client Authentication
    scheme, named PTAS, for IoT application. The PTAS scheme is applied in blockchain-based
    public key infrastructure (PKI). The PKI infrastructure is used to secure communication
    between IoT devices, which a certificate authority distribute certificates (a
    public key (PK) and identity (ID)) to IoT devices. To solve the problem of the
    single point of failure, the PTAS scheme is adapted in blockchain-based PKI. Specifically,
    the PTAS scheme uses the method of private information retrieval, which the identity
    of the user can be hidden in k indistinguishable identities. In addition, the
    PTAS scheme is robust against three attacks, namely, Sybil attack, eclipse attack,
    and 51% attack. 2) Blockchain-Based Machine Learning Solution The work by Shen
    et al. [91] proposed a privacy-preserving scheme, named secureSVM, for IoT application.
    The secureSVM scheme considers the data privacy of training support vector machine
    classifier (SVM) using blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. To protect the privacy
    of IoT data, the secureSVM scheme employs a public-key cryptosystem, Paillier,
    which is an additive homomorphic cryptosystem. The secureSVM scheme is robust
    against two threat models, including, known ciphertext model and known background
    model. The secureSVM scheme can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. The
    blockchain-based IoT platform can be installed at the agriculture sensors layer
    and IoT data analysts at fog computing layer. The adaptation is summarized by
    the following steps: Step 1: Agriculture sensor nodes use sensing and transmitting
    valuable data through wireless; Step 2: Each access point collect data from the
    agriculture sensor nodes; Step 3: Each access point encrypts data using partially
    homomorphic encryption; Step 4: Each access point records the encrypted data on
    the blockchain; Step 5: Each access point uses the built-in consensus mechanism
    for validating the data; Step 6: Fog nodes communicate with an access point to
    obtain parameters of the training SVM classifier. 3) Blockchain-Based Distributed
    Key Management Solution The blockchain is used in key management architecture
    for eliminating the drawback of introducing a third party. Ma et al. [92] introduced
    a blockchain-based distributed key management architecture, named BDKMA, for IoT
    application. To achieve hierarchical access control, the BDKMA architecture uses
    security access managers for operating the blockchain. Specifically, the BDKMA
    architecture is based on the idea of authorization assignment mode and group access
    pattern. The BDKMA architecture can be applied to the network model composed of
    a device layer, a fog layer, and a cloud layer. The adaptation of BDKMA architecture
    in green IoT-based agriculture is summarized by the following steps: Step 1: Each
    agriculture sensor nodes selects its private key and generates the public key,
    encryption key, and secret access key; Step 2: Each agriculture sensor nodes packages
    encrypted secret access key and then signs and broadcasts the transaction to access
    point; Step 3: Each access point at agriculture sensors layer collects the transactions
    of the agriculture sensor nodes; Step 4: Each access point uses the built-in consensus
    mechanism for validating the data; Step 5: An agriculture sensor node obtain access
    permission from access point using an access query transaction; Step 6: An agriculture
    sensor node periodically update the access keys and sends a key update transaction
    to the access point; 4) Blockchain-Based Access Control Solution To provide scalable
    access management in IoT application, Novo [87] proposed a distributed access
    control architecture using blockchain technology. The access control policies
    are enforced by the blockchain platform. The adaptation of proposed architecture
    in green IoT-based agriculture can bring the following six advantages to access
    control: transparency, scalability, lightweight, concurrency, accessibility, and
    mobility. The adaptation of proposed architecture is summarized in the following
    steps: Step 1: Fog node deploys the smart contract into the blockchain network
    at fog computing layer; Step 2: To be registered as a manager, each access point
    at agriculture sensors layer request the address of the smart contract; Step 3:
    To transfer the management control of an agriculture sensor device, an access
    point at agriculture sensors layer requests the agriculture sensor device’s address
    and the blockchain address of the smart contract; Step 4: An access point at agriculture
    sensors layer enforces the policy creating a transaction towards the smart contract;
    Step 5: An access point at agriculture sensors layer adds an existing policy.
    Ding et al. [94] proposed a attribute-based access control scheme for IoT application,
    which can be adapted for greenhouse. According to the identity or ability of each
    IoT devices, attribute authorities describe a set of attributes to each IoT devices.
    The blockchain is used to record the distribution of these attributes. The adaptation
    of this attribute-based access control scheme for blockchain-based greenhouse
    is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: Greenhouse miner generates a pair
    of public and secret key for each IoT devices; Step 2: Greenhouse miner sends
    both keys in a secure channel based on identity-based cryptography; Step 3: Each
    IoT devices uses an address along with its ID and then generate a corresponding
    address based on the hash algorithm; Step 4: IoT device inside greenhouse generates
    new block and broadcasts to the other consortium nodes using the practical Byzantine
    fault tolerance; Step 5: When IoT device wants to send to another device, they
    use identity-based authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Dorri et al.
    [34] introduced a smart home tier based on the blockchain technology, which can
    be adapted for greenhouse. The network model of the blockchain-based greenhouse
    is composed of the following components: transactions, local blockchain, greenhouse
    miner, and local storage. The adaptation of blockchain-based greenhouse is summarized
    in the following steps: Step 1: Greenhouse miner generates a key with an IoT device;
    Step 2: Greenhouse miner shares the key and stores it in the genesis transaction;
    Step 3: Greenhouse miner defines the policy header and adds it to the first block;
    Step 4: Each IoT device inside greenhouse communicate with another internal device
    using the permission from the miner; Step 5: Each IoT device inside greenhouse
    can store data on the cloud storage using the permission from the miner; Step
    6: When IoT device wants to send to another external device, a Virtual Private
    Network (VPN) connection is used to routes the packets to the shared miner. 5)
    Blockchain-Based Reputation and Trust Solution Dedeoglu et al. [93] proposed a
    reputation and trust mechanism for blockchain-based IoT applications, which can
    be adapted for greenhouse. The proposed model verifying transactions based on
    three key layers, namely the application layer, the blockchain layer, and the
    data layer. The adaptation of blockchain-based greenhouse for trust architecture
    is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: IoT device inside greenhouse generates
    blocks in periodic intervals. The generation is based on the public key and the
    signature of the data source; Step 2: IoT device sends the blocks to greenhouse
    miner at agriculture sensors layer; Step 3: Greenhouse miner validates the blocks
    based on the number of validator node and the reputation of the block generating
    node. To realize reliable storage and sharing of IoT information in green IoT-based
    agriculture, the work by Si et al. [95] is a security mechanism that can be adapted
    for smart agriculture. The proposed mechanism is based on blockchain technology,
    which is applied in three layers, including, the application layer, the transport
    layer, and the sensing layer. The application layer is mainly used by the cloud
    service. The data blockchain part is installed in the fog computing layer. In
    addition, the proposed mechanism uses a double-chain model with tamper-proof of
    data in the data blockchain. Zhou et al. [88] proposed a threshold secure multi-party
    computing protocol, TSMPC, for blockchain-based threshold IoT system. The TSMPC
    protocol extends Shamir’s (t, n)-secret sharing (SSS) [97]. Specifically, the
    TSMPC protocol is applied between a leader and n server, which can be adapted
    for green IoT-based agriculture. The network model is composed of n servers, the
    leader’s device, and a leader. The performance evaluation on the Ethereum blockchain
    shows that a block can record transactions of at most 62,360 bytes. Therefore,
    the adaptation of a threshold secure multi-party computing protocol for green
    IoT-based agriculture is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: A fog computing
    node generates an initialize transaction with a verification key and sends it
    to the blockchain network; Step 2: IoT sensor node at agriculture sensors layer
    verify the transaction’s verification key; Step 3: An access point at agriculture
    sensors layer verifies core shares, which can obtain a reward from the fog computing
    node. 6) Blockchain-Based Authentication and Identification Solution To ensure
    authentication and robust identification of IoT devices in IoT application, Hammi
    et al. [89] proposed an original decentralized system, called bubbles of trust
    , which can be applied for green IoT-based agriculture. Based on the blockchain
    technology, the bubbles of trust system create secure virtual zones (bubbles),
    which can protect the availability and data integrity. The bubbles of trust system
    is resistant against four attacks, namely, Sybil attack, spoofing attack, DoS/DDoS
    attack, and replay attack. Therefore, the adaptation of bubbles of trust system
    for green IoT-based agriculture consists of creating secure virtual zones inside
    the agriculture sensors layer, where devices can communicate securely. Specifically,
    each device at agriculture sensors layer must communicate only with devices of
    its zone. The communications between devices are considered as transactions and
    must be validated by this blockchain network. 7) Blockchain-Based Secure SDN Solution
    To facilitate software and hardware updates for green IoT-based agriculture, software-defined
    networking (SDN) is used, which allows easy control and management in a central
    location. To detect any false injection data, a blockchain-based secure SDN architecture
    is adapted. Derhab et al. [96] proposed two security components, namely, 1) Blockchain-based
    integrity checking system (BICS) 2) Intrusion detection system (IDS). These two
    systems are combined for SDN-architecture, which can be adapted for green IoT-based
    agriculture. The adaptation is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: Integrate
    the SDN controller into the cloud computing layer; Step 2: Integrate a Virtual
    Switch (vSwitch) into the fog computing layer Step 3: Integrate an IDS system
    into the access point at agriculture sensors layer. To detect cyber attacks, the
    IDS system combines two machine learning classifiers, namely, K-Nearest Neighbors
    and random subspace learning; Step 4: The SDN controller creates blocks and shares
    it via the blockchain; Step 5: The Firewall check the rules from vSwitch and blockchain.
    To provides scalability within the current IoT application, the SDN and blockchains
    technology are combined by the work Sharma et al. [86]. Specifically, the work
    proposed a secure SDN architecture, named DistBlockNet, which is based on the
    blockchain technology. The DistBlockNet architecture interconnects a distributed
    blockchain network with the controllers. Each local network includes Shelter modules,
    OrchApp, and Controller. To maintains the updated flow rules table information,
    the distributed blockchain network uses the request/response and controller/verification
    nodes. The performance evaluation shows that DistBlockNet architecture is robust
    against DDoS/DoS attacks and cache poising/ARP spoofing. The adaptation of DistBlockNet
    architecture in green IoT-based agriculture is summarized by the following steps:
    Step 1: Integrate Shelter and OrchApp modules into the cloud computing layer;
    Step 2: Integrate the distributed blockchain network into the fog computing layer;
    Step 3: Interconnect the distributed blockchain network with the controllers at
    fog computing layer; Step 4: IoT sensor node at agriculture sensors layer sends
    data to the controllers. B. Consensus Algorithms for Blockchain-Based Solutions
    A consensus algorithm can be defined as the mechanism by which a Blockchain network
    achieves consensus. The public blockchains (i.e., decentralized) are built as
    distributed systems and, since they do not depend on a central authority, the
    distributed nodes must agree on the validity of transactions using a consensus
    algorithm. Table 5 summarizes consensus algorithms for Blockchain-based solutions
    and how they will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. TABLE 5 Summary
    of Consensus Algorithms for Blockchain-Based Solutions and How They Will be Adapted
    for Green IoT-Based Agriculture 1) Proof-of-Work (PoW) The PoW is a consensus
    algorithm introduced by Bitcoin and widely used by other cryptocurrencies. This
    consensus is called “Mining”, which the nodes in the IoT network are called “Miners”
    [98]. Specifically, the PoW algorithm is presented as a response to a mathematical
    problem, which requires considerable work, but is usually easily checked once
    the answer is obtained. A miner node continuously tests a variety of unique values
    (known as nonce) until an appropriate value is produced [123]. The minor node
    that solves the puzzle extracts the succeeding block, then adds it to the blockchain
    network and confirms the transactions, and receives the compensation for the block.
    The PoW can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture,
    which each access point at agriculture sensors layer is selected as miners in
    order to calculate the hash values for validating blocks. This adaptation ensures
    that access points are encouraged to maintain the blockchain network, as they
    are compensated for their efforts. The disadvantage of the PoW algorithm for green
    IoT-based agriculture is that computational resources require a lot of energy
    to validate the blocks. 2) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) The PoS is a distributed consensus
    algorithm (used by Peercoin [99] and Nxt [100]) that requires the user to prove
    that they have a specific quantity of currency to validate any additional blocks
    in the blockchain network and to be awarded the reward. Compared to the PoW algorithm,
    the PoS is not computationally costly for validators, but it is vulnerable to
    nothing-at-stake problem. The PoS can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution
    for green IoT-based agriculture, which all IoT nodes in agriculture sensors layer
    are selected as the validators. 3) Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) The DPoS is
    a consensus algorithm (used by BitShares [101] and Steemit [102]) that restricts
    the number of nodes in a blockchain network to a small number of entities chosen
    by token owners. These delegates are responsible for the following three paid
    tasks: 1) implementing changes to the blockchain network, 2) recording transactions,
    and 3) ensuring the integrity of the registry. The DPoS algorithm can be adapted
    by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each access
    point at agriculture sensors layer is selected as a delegate. This adaptation
    ensures that access points provide an efficient, fast, decentralized consensus
    algorithm. 4) Delayed Proof-of-Work (DPoW) The DPoW is a consensus algorithm designed
    by the Komodo project [103], which is a modified version of the Proof of Work
    consensus algorithm. The DPoW algorithm is based on the idea of notary nodes,
    which are used to record data to the blockchain network (e.g., Bitcoin). The DPoW
    can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture,
    which all fog nodes in fog computing layer are selected as notary nodes and all
    IoT nodes in agriculture sensors layer are selected as as normal nodes. This adaptation
    ensures that it is impossible to reorganize notarized blocks, which makes blockchains
    more secure and resistant to attacks 51%. 5) Proof-of-Activity (PoAC) The PoAC
    algorithm (used by Decred [109]) is an extension of the Bitcoin protocol, which
    is based on combining Proof of Work component with a Proof of Stake type of system.
    The PoAC can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture
    as follows [124]. 1) Each fog node (miner) at fog computing layer uses his hashing
    power to generate an empty block header. 2) The fog node broadcasts her block
    header to IoT devices at agriculture sensors layer. 3) All IoT devices at agriculture
    sensors layer derive N pseudorandom stakeholders using the hash of the block header.
    4) Every stakeholder at agriculture sensors layer checks whether the empty block
    header that the fog node broadcasted is valid. 6) Proof-of-Authority (PoA) The
    PoA is a reputation-based consensus algorithm (used by POA.Network [106] and VeChain
    [107]) for private blockchain networks. The PoA consensus algorithm is based on
    the value of identity, which means that the validators use their own reputation
    to validate the blocks. The PoA can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution
    for green IoT-based agriculture, which all fog nodes in fog computing layer are
    selected as validators. This adaptation ensures a limited number of block validators,
    which provides a highly scalable system. 7) Proof-of-Importance (PoI) The PoI
    is a consensus algorithm proposed by NEM [113]. The PoI can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each IoT devices at agriculture
    sensors layer are assigned an importance score. The IoT devices with high scores
    of importance have a higher chance of harvesting a block. The transaction graph
    topology can be used as an input into the importance of an IoT device. 8) Proof-of-Weight
    (PoWE) The PoWe is proposed by Gilad et al. [110], which is based on the Algorand
    consensus model. The Algorand uses a Byzantine agreement protocol to reach consensus
    on the blockchain network. The users are selected randomly using verifiable random
    functions. Algorand users use a protocol to communicate, which assigns a weight
    to each user according to the tokens they hold. The users’ weights are used to
    chooses committee members randomly among all users. The PoWe can be adapted by
    a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which an Algorand
    protocol assigns a weight to each farmer according to the tokens they hold. This
    adaptation ensures resistance to Sybil attacks and achieves scalability but reducing
    the incentive since it’s very difficult to be rewarded. 9) Proof-of-Burn (PoB)
    The PoB algorithm (used by Slimcoin [111]) is similar to a proof of work algorithm
    but with reduced energy consumption rates. The PoB network block validation process
    does not require the use of powerful computing resources and does not depend on
    powerful extraction equipment. Instead, Coins are deliberately burned and this
    is a way to “invest” resources in the blockchain, so that candidate miners are
    not required to invest physical resources. By burning Coins, users are able to
    demonstrate their engagement with the network, which can obtain the right to mine
    and validate transactions [125]. The PoB can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each fog node at fog computing
    layer sends coins to a burn address. 10) Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) The PoC is very
    similar to the PoW algorithm, which the storage is used instead of computation.
    The PoC (used by Burstcoin [104]) allows the mining nodes to use the free space
    on their hard disk. The PoC can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for
    green IoT-based agriculture, where each fog nodes at fog computing layer are selected
    as miners since they have high storage compared to nodes at agriculture sensors
    layer. To validating the blocs and winning the mining reward, the fog nodes involve
    a two-step process, including, plotting and mining. 11) Proof of Elapsed Time
    (POET) The POET is a consensus algorithm frequently applied on the permissioned
    blockchain networks to decide on mining authorizations. The POET is based on the
    idea of “Elapsed Time”, where each node involved in the system is expected to
    wait for a randomly selected period of time, and the first node to complete the
    designated waiting time wins the new block. The POET can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each IoT device at agriculture
    sensors layer generates a random wait time and sleeps for a fixed period of time.
    For more details about the PoET algorithm, we refer the reader to the Hyperledger
    Sawtooth project [112]. 12) Proof-of-Reputation (PoR) The PoR algorithm (used
    by GoChain [115]) is similar to PoA algorithm, which it is based on the reputations
    of the IoT nodes. An IoT node in the green IoT-based agriculture must have a reputation
    important enough to be voted as an authoritative node. Once an authoritative node
    is voted, he can sign and validate blocks in the blockchain network. 13) Practical
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) The PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
    algorithm is the first to be able to tolerate “Byzantine” faults, which is proposed
    by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov in 1999 [126]. This algorithm provides reliability
    and robustness properties in a synchronous environment and requires N=3f+1 replicas
    to tolerate simultaneous Byzantine faults. The PBFT algorithm can be effectively
    applied in almost all domains of IoT, including, Internet of Energy [118], Internet
    of Drones [120], Internet of Vehicles [127],…etc. Therefore, the PBFT algorithm
    can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture,
    as presented in Fig. 6. Specifically, when a farmer buyer node wants to buy a
    product from agri-products sellers, they send its request to the fog node. This
    fog node creates a PRE-PREPARE message to propose to the other replicas the scheduling
    of the bloc. The correct replicas respond to the PRE-PREPARE with a PREPARE message,
    which is sent to all replicas (i.e., neighbor nodes). Once the neighbor nodes
    have received 2f PREPARE and the associated PRE-PREPARE, then they agree on the
    order of the farmer buyer node’s request. At the end, the neighbor nodes send
    a VALIDATION message to all replicas. Once a replica has received 2f+1 VALIDATION,
    then it executes the request and responds to both farmer buyer node and agri-products
    seller. If the client does not receive a response after a specified time period,
    he forwards the request to all replicas. When a replica receives a request, it
    starts view-change. Note that there are more variations of PBFT algorithm such
    as Aardvark [128], Zyzzyva [129], HQ [130], Q/U [131], and Abstract [132]. 14)
    Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) The dBFT algorithm is a consensus method
    (used by Neo [116]) where all users elect nodes, called bookkeepers, who are responsible
    for adding new blocks to the blockchain. This elected node group can be updated
    regularly. The vote is weighted by the amount of cryptocurrency owned. Each bookkeeper
    is randomly selected to propose a block. This node is called a speaker. The bookkeepers
    become speakers in turn by random drawing. The speaker checks the signatures and
    the validity of transactions and then collects them in a block. The speaker proposes
    his block to all the other bookkeepers. Afterward, the bookkeepers verify the
    block and then each one vote in favor or against the block. The consensus is reached
    when at least 66% of bookkeepers vote in favor of the block and it is then added
    to the blockchain. The dBFT algorithm can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture
    by applying a voting system in agriculture sensors layer to choose delegates and
    speaker among IoT devices. 15) Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) The SCP protocol
    (used by Stellar Consensus [114]) is based on federated Byzantine agreement (FBA).
    The nodes exchange a series of votes to confirm and accept a value. For this purpose,
    the SCP protocol determines a minimum quorum. The “quorum” is a set of nodes that
    are sufficient to reach an agreement. Each node chooses one or more quorum slices
    and includes in each slice the nodes in which it has confidence. Each quorum slice
    will then produce interactions with each other. To reach an agreement, the SCP
    protocol uses the idea of quorum intersection. A federated Byzantine agreement
    system enjoys quorum intersection if any two of its quorums share a node. The
    SCP protocol can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture by applying a voting
    system in agriculture sensors layer to choose quorum and quorum slice among IoT
    devices and then use quorum intersection to guarantee agreement. 16) Other Consensus
    Algorithms There are other consensus algorithms that can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture. We cite the following nine consensus
    algorithms: Byteball consensus [133], Mokka consensus [134], SPECTRE consensus
    [135], Block-Lattice consensus [136], Hashgraph consensus [137], Tangle consensus
    [138], Directed Acyclic Graphs (used by Iota [139]), Proof of Believability (used
    by IOST [140]), and RAFT consensus [141]. SECTION VI. Challenges To complete our
    overview, we outline research challenges that could improve the security and privacy
    solutions for IoT-based agriculture, summarized in the following recommendations:
    A. Machine Learning Techniques for Intrusion Detection Systems Intrusion detection
    systems (IDSs) are implemented along with other security systems such as authentication
    and access control techniques using encryption mechanisms to protect systems against
    cyber attacks. Using data mining and machine learning techniques (e.g., Deep learning,
    Random forests, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes,…etc), IDSs can differentiate
    between normal and malicious actions. The implementation of IDSs for IoT-based
    agriculture as a software application will able to identify security incidents.
    Therefore, the question we ask here is: how to choose the right machine learning
    technique among different types (i.e., reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning,
    or supervised learning)? We believe that a comparative study of machine learning
    techniques for cyber security intrusion detection is needed for IoT-based agriculture.
    B. Dataset for Intrusion Detection in IoT-Based Agriculture Scenarios The datasets
    for cyber security are so important in intrusion detection, which are used for
    testing the performance of IDSs. Actually, most and recent IDSs are tested with
    KDD 1999 [142], NSL-KDD [143], CICIDS2017 [144], Bot-IoT [145], and CSE-CIC-IDS2018
    [146]. These datasets are not simulated for IoT-based agriculture scenarios. A
    possible research direction in this topic could be related to developing a new
    dataset to build a network intrusion detector under IoT-based agriculture environment.
    C. Scalability Analysis of Blockchain-Based Solutions To solve security and privacy
    problems (e.g., access control, reputation, trust,…etc), we have seen that a blockchain-based
    solution brings advantages for IoT application. The application of a blockchain-based
    solution for IoT-based agriculture requires a study on the characteristics of
    the implementation. Therefore, there are many characteristics should be taken
    under consideration when a blockchain-based solution is proposed for IoT-based
    agriculture, such as scalability issues when the number of participating nodes
    at agriculture sensors layer is increased. Thus, one of the challenges that should
    receive more attention in the future is to provide a scalability analysis of blockchain-based
    solutions for IoT-based agriculture. D. How to Pick the Best Consensus Algorithm
    The performance of a blockchain-based solution for IoT-based agriculture is related
    to the effectiveness of the consensus algorithm. Therefore, since IoT devices
    at agriculture sensors layer are not always able to satisfy the high computational
    and energy requirements when addressing the validation of blocks and the storage
    of blockchain, consensus-efficient issues arise as follows: If the PoW algorithm
    is used, how to integrate a miner in each greenhouse for processing incoming and
    outgoing transactions? If the stellar consensus algorithm is used, how to design
    a voting system in agriculture sensors layer to choose quorum and quorum slice
    among IoT devices and then use quorum intersection to guarantee agreement? If
    the dBFT algorithm is used, how to design a voting system in agriculture sensors
    layer to choose bookkeepers and speaker among IoT devices? E. Design of Practical
    and Compatible Cryptographic Protocols In some cases of green IoT-based agriculture,
    it is not necessary to use blockchain to solve security and privacy problems (e.g.,
    identity anonymity), which there are many other better solutions such as practical
    and compatible cryptographic solution. Therefore, a new cryptographic solution
    is proposed recently by Yang et al. [147] for the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast,
    which they use the format-preserving encryption (FPE) and lightweight broadcast
    authentication protocol (TESLA) to achieve the identity anonymity. However, resource
    and power-constrained IoT devices at agriculture sensors layer are not always
    capable of meeting the substantial computational and power consumption in the
    processing of new cryptographic solution. Therefore, the design of practical and
    compatible cryptographic protocols is one of the significant research challenges
    in green IoT-based agriculture. F. Resiliency Against Specific Attacks in the
    Context of Low-Resource IoT Devices The threat models discussed in the environment
    of IoT-based agriculture and the key security problem is different in distinct
    smart agriculture applications. Sometimes, the specific problem does not exist
    in an IoT application, and it is meaningless to take combined attacks into consideration.
    The methods to solve attacks can be integrated together to solve problems in an
    application. To propose a scheme against a kind of attack in a smart agriculture
    application, the attack should be specific and defined at the beginning. The most
    important question that may arise is how to develop a new security strategy that
    can resist combined attacks while considering the practicability of deploying
    the solution, particularly in the context of low-resource IoT devices at agriculture
    sensors layer. G. Counter Measures Against 5G Network Slicing Threats 5G networks
    will be facilitators of IoT based agriculture applications, especially in the
    sensors layer (See Figure 1). 5G adopt network slicing as a means of partitioning
    the physical and network resources to optimally group the different traffic, isolate
    from other tenants and configure the network resources. The logical partitioning
    of network slicing divides and separates a single common physical network into
    various virtual, complete E2E networks and offers complete isolation for these
    virtual networks from each other in terms of access, transport, device and core
    network. The main advantage of Network Slicing is that now MNOs can configure
    and apply tailor-made customization of their network resources to accommodate
    different users and different traffic classes, and hence differentiated services.
    Security of Network Slicing plays a significant role for the control and the coordination
    among different slices and for function of the related mechanisms that are responsible
    for the inter-network slices communication and the coordination between user and
    control plane. A security leakage that is related to the inter-slice communication
    functionality can lead to disruption of the inter-slice communication. Moreover,
    authentication for the identification of the privileged users in order to prevent
    impersonation attacks against slices seems to be critical for the proper control
    of the network resources. Furthermore, the provision of differentiated services
    is also related to the provision of different security level of services among
    the slices. However, this must not affect the security level of another slice.
    In addition, DoS attacks focus on the possible exhaustion of network resources
    to lead in unavailability of network provisioned services [148]. These attacks
    must be dealt with a multi layered security framework that includes traditional
    methods, e.g. IDS and field specific solutions, e.g. slice isolation. H. Deploying
    IoT in Agriculture As we mentioned in Section II, IoT in agriculture can be envisioned
    in different layers and from different perspectives. In this subsection, we try
    to summarize and emphasize the different conditions that exist in an agricultural
    environment that make the deployment of IoT challenging. When talking about the
    WSNs, the specific characteristics of the environment, in which the nodes will
    be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles in farmlands
    whose positions may change over time, cause considerable interference in the communication
    between nodes. These moving obstacles affect the connection quality of links,
    changing the channel conditions over time, affecting the deployment, packet routing
    algorithms, failure diagnosis methods, and other aspects of WSNs. Environmental
    factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, high solar radiation along with
    changing shading by plant leaves, as well as noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, further increase Spatio-temporal climatic variation, greatly
    affecting the communication among nodes that are deployed in such harsh environment.
    This changing environment imposes requirements and calls for novel duty-cycle
    control, sampling and scheduling, data reconstructions, as well as data storage
    and query, intelligent control, and other solutions [38], [149]. Although in theory
    or in simulated environments all these challenges have been already studied and
    analyzed when it comes to the actual deployment of IoT in the agricultural sector
    this task is very demanding and challenging. The modules that are used in order
    to sense and report any situation need to be accurate enough, properly shielded
    against environmental factors which can either lead to false reporting or destruction
    of the sensors permanently [150]. In addition, the replacement of power source
    to distributed sensor nodes that are spread in wide areas can be a very difficult
    task, if not impossible and must be taken into consideration during the design
    of such systems. In terms of communication among nodes, since many different technologies
    can be combined, from GSM to WPAN and P2P, interoperability is the main challenge
    when designing or deploying such systems, especially in agriculture where high
    temperature and high humidity affect it in a negative way. Also when different
    communication methods are used in the same area (e.g. Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi)
    interference is a parameter that needs to be also considered [151]. Since the
    sensors devices are deployed in an open field, which cannot be monitored by people
    all the time, the system can easily be attacked physically. In addition, sensors
    devices are not densely deployed in agricultural applications and they are more
    complex in terms of hardware components. Finally the area where sensor devices
    are located is not monitored so well compared to the one deployed inside a city
    and it is easy to add malicious nodes (e.g., Malicious 4G stations) that can overhear
    the information that is exchanged or perform several attacks like DDoS or MITM.
    SECTION VII. Conclusion In this paper, we surveyed the state-of-the-art of existing
    security and privacy solutions for green IoT-based agriculture. We provided an
    overview of a four-tier green IoT-based agriculture architecture. Through extensive
    research and analysis that was conducted, we were able to classify the threat
    models against green IoT-based agriculture into five categories, including, attacks
    against privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity
    properties. In addition, we analyzed the privacy-oriented blockchain-based solutions
    as well as consensus algorithms for green IoT-based agriculture. There still exist
    several challenging research areas, such as machine learning techniques, datasets
    for intrusion detection, scalability analysis of blockchain-based solutions, how
    to pick the best consensus algorithm, and the design of practical and compatible
    cryptographic protocols, which should be further investigated in the near future.

    deep combination of both modern information technology and traditional agriculture,
    the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture, has come.
    Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation.
    However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development of
    agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three typical
    development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility agriculture,
    and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications
    are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications,
    6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control, privacy-preserving,
    blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management,
    physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems) are summarized and
    discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed
    and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information
    technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment
    as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments based
    on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate that
    agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more technologies
    (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management
    system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber
    security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future research
    directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica

    that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted the vision of
    the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to Multimedia Internet of Things (M-IoT).
    IoT devices are constrained in terms of energy, computing, size, and storage memory.
    Delay-sensitive and bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications over constrained
    IoT networks require revision of IoT architecture for M-IoT. This paper provides
    a comprehensive survey of M-IoT with an emphasis on architecture, protocols, and
    applications. This article starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT.
    Then, we discuss the issues considering the characteristics of multimedia and
    provide a summary of related M-IoT architectures. Various multimedia applications
    supported by IoT are surveyed, and numerous use cases related to road traffic
    management, security, industry, and health are illustrated to show how different
    M-IoT applications are revolutionizing human life. We explore the importance of
    Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) for multimedia transmission
    over IoT. Moreover, we explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing
    and present the relationship between the M-IoT and emerging technologies including
    event processing, feature extraction, cloud computing, Fog/Edge computing and
    Software-Defined-Networks (SDNs). We also present the need for better routing

    I. Introduction The amalgamation of the physical and digital world over the traditional
    Internet paved the way for the future Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is envisaged
    as the network model to fill the gap between the cyber and physical world [1].
    The core concept of the IoT is to connect the pervasive objects around us, such
    as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, mobile devices, sensors and actuators
    to the Internet through a wired or wireless network. Hence, it enables the objects
    to interact with each other and their neighbors to enhance the efficiency of the
    system [1]. Several researchers have defined IoT in various contexts [2]: “The
    integration of tiny devices known as Smart Objects (SO), usually battery operated
    equipped with a Microcontroller (MCU) and transceivers into the global Internet.
    The services offered by these smart objects are known as Smart Services (SS) [3]–[6].
    IoT has created new opportunities for machines to communicate with each other
    and extend the offered applications. Currently, 23 billion devices are connected
    to the Internet [7], and these numbers will stretch to 30 billion by 2020 [8].
    Conventionally, IoT was assimilated relatively in data sensing devices, particularly
    in the Machine to Machine (M2M) environment [9]. Vigorous growth in the connected
    devices to the Internet during the last decade and abrupt demand for multimedia
    traffic has given rise to the emergence of the Multimedia Internet of Things (M-IoT).
    The equilibrium between QoS data and best-effort data is now in transit towards
    an increase in multimedia QoS data. Currently, IoT is an assortment, comprising
    of M2M, Human-to-Machine (H2M), Human-to-Human (H2H), and Machine in/or Humans
    (MiH) communications (MiH devices may include human embedded chips, medical monitoring
    probes, and Global Positioning System (GPS)) [10]. M-IoT smart objects are usually
    resource-constrained, in terms of energy, memory storage, and processing power.
    To make the devices smaller, cost-effective and energy-efficient, sensors are
    usually designed to be battery operated or solar powered with only a few kilobytes
    of memory, and limited processing power in megahertz. Multimedia QoS data shows
    antagonistic behavior as compared to emblematic IoT scalar data. M-IoT devices
    require higher bandwidth, bulky memory resources, and higher computational power
    to analyze and process the procured multimedia data. Table 1 shows the difference
    between scalar and multimedia IoT data. The traditional multimedia application
    involves the data transmission of point-to-point, point to multipoint, or multipoint
    to multipoint. On the contrary, M-IoT applications require immense data transmission
    during multipoint-to-point communication (e.g., the surveillance system of the
    entire smart city) or multipoint-to-multipoint. Dynamic network, heterogeneous
    data, higher throughput, QoS, and delay sensitivity over such resource-constrained
    M-IoT smart objects escalates the challenges for M-IoT. TABLE 1 Comparison of
    Scalar and Multimedia IoT Data Multimedia data i.e., audio, image, and video is
    set of unstructured features. Transmission of such bulky and unstructured data
    over bandwidth and computationally scarce network requires efficient and intelligent
    network topology. The addition of multimedia data acquisition and communication
    requires revision and amplification of the traditional IoT system, which we refer
    to as M-IoT. The revision of IoT for multimedia communication requires efficient
    feature extraction, event processing, encoding/decoding, energy-aware computation,
    lightweight and priority-based routing, QoS and QoE maintaining performance metrics,
    effective channel access, and fair-MAC protocols. Real-world multimedia applications
    include an example of rescue vehicles based emergency response systems, traffic
    monitoring, GPS based path tracking, agricultural monitoring, crime inspection,
    smart cities, smart homes, smart museum, surveillance systems, security system
    for authentication and authorization, multimedia-based e-health, patient monitoring
    in smart hospitals, and industrial monitoring systems. Fig. 1 conceptualize the
    multimedia communication in IoT in every domain-specific applications. FIGURE
    1. The overall vision of integrating multimedia applications of every domain in
    IoT, developing a smart city and transforming human lives, i.e., multimedia in
    agriculture, smart health, security, industrial process, road management systems,
    and real-time applications. Show All This article presents a comprehensive state
    of the art survey on M-IoT. There are several published research papers that cover
    different aspects of IoT. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first
    that covers the studies specifically targeting multimedia communication in IoT
    in the context of the above-mentioned requirements. A. Contributions of This Survey
    Article In summary, this work aims to make the following contributions: To provide
    a detailed survey of various M-IoT network architectures. To survey the various
    M-IoT applications i.e., traffic monitoring, habitat monitoring, surveillance
    for public safety, industrial monitoring, and health monitoring. To discuss the
    design for M-IoT communication by summarizing performance metrics for M-IoT architectures.
    To survey the M-IoT computing paradigm comprising multimedia data compression,
    event processing, fog/edge computing, cloud computing, and Software-Defined Networks
    (SDNs) for data computing. To discuss various routing protocols in the context
    of multimedia data delivery in M-IoT. To provide a survey on different physical
    MAC (PHY-MAC) protocols for M-IoT. To provide open issues, challenges, and future
    research directions involving M-IoT. B. Comparison of Related Survey Articles
    Alvi et al. in [4] delineate the concept of M-IoT. The article is classified into
    two categories: M-IoT vision and, M-IoT applications and use cases. In the first
    category, authors have presented the vision of M-IoT and proposed four-layer multi-agent-based
    M-IoT architecture. Requirements and open issues in each layer are also discussed
    in this section. Moreover, IoT has been analyzed in-depth in the context of multimedia
    data. The authors have also discussed several video encoding and compressing techniques.
    The second section outlines the various multimedia applications and uses cases
    concerning M-IoT. However, this article does not cover a detailed survey on M-IoT
    specifically. An in-depth discussion on various enabling technologies, i.e., MAC
    protocols and network layer protocols, is missing. Discussion on future machine-type-communication
    and integration with 5th generation (5G) cellular communication is not found.
    Furthermore, various QoS and QoE depending factors and Information-Centric Network
    (ICN) approach regarding M-IoT are not discussed. Multimedia computation technologies
    are not found in this article. The discussion on M-IoT in the context of architecture,
    enabling technologies, MAC and routing protocols is not found in the recent survey
    articles on IoT [2], [11], [12]. The existing survey on energy-efficient M-IoT
    is presented in [13]. This study explains the working of each layer of the traditional
    IoT architecture; however, the intrinsic nature of multimedia data is not considered
    in any aspect. Different routing protocols are discussed in [14]–[18]. A detailed
    survey on multimedia routing in wireless sensor networks is presented in [17],
    [19]. However, these articles present a brief overview of multimedia routing and
    the comparison of various routing standards. It merely discusses the issues and
    challenges of current multimedia data requirements. Current M-IoT takes not only
    QoS but QoE into consideration that is dependent not only on network parameters
    but user’s hardware capabilities itself. MAC protocols and efficient resource
    allocation standards are presented in [20]–[23]. BlueVoice has been evaluated
    for multimedia services in real-time IoT devices in [24]. QoS is analysed in [25]–[29],
    while QoE is studied in [30]–[35]. The concept of Quality of Information (QoI)
    and ICN using a distributed algorithm for multimedia data collection is proposed
    in [36]. Kaaradi et al. [30] have presented the concept of Quality of Things (QoT)
    for M-IoT. However, it lacks QoS objectives. The rest of this article discusses
    the introduction of the virtual layer for virtual object representation and cross-layer
    communication. Cross-layer design related to M-IoT is presented in [33], [37],
    [38]. Thiyagarajan et al. [39] have proposed a secure video transmission energy-aware
    encryption scheme for M-IoT. Using Dictionary Learning (DL) and Approximate Message
    Passing (AMP). A compressed sensing technique is proposed for M-IoT in [40]. Various
    video encoding schemes and multimedia sensing are outlined in [41], [42]. Performance
    comparison of Advance Video Codings (AVC) H.265 and H.264 is presented in [43].
    A detailed survey on multimedia big data computation is presented in [44]. Salman
    et al. in [45] present a survey on IoT from the perspective of Fog and SDN technologies.
    Articles [46]–[48], present review on multimedia in road traffic management and
    biometric security. However, all these studies do not include a survey on multimedia
    communication in any form. Existing challenges, issues, and proposed work from
    the perspective of M-IoT are not presented in any of the articles. Comparison:
    From the word comprehensive, this article provides an in-depth overview of M-IoT.
    This article specifies the limitations of IoT architecture and user requirements
    of multimedia data in order to revise IoT architecture. This enables us to cover
    a review of various IoT architectures supporting wireless multimedia communication.
    Computation is the key feature required for M-IoT. Limitations of cloud computing
    in exhausting the bandwidth and energy-constrained networks are identified. Advantages
    of Fog/Edge computation to assist cloud computing are presented. SDNs are moving
    the IoT architecture towards network virtualization. SDNs in the perspective of
    M-IoT is detailed in this article. This article also discusses the use of Machine
    Learning (ML) as an important aspect for feature extraction from multimedia data
    which extracts meaningful information from unstructured multimedia data. In addition,
    this paper presents various event processing mechanisms to reduce network overhead
    and latency. QoS and QoE metrics are well defined and evaluated in this article
    by comparing it with existing work. Routing and PHY-MAC protocols are well surveyed
    in the literature. However, contemporary literature lacks the consideration of
    multimedia data nature and requirements. This article presents a comprehensive
    overview of multimedia applications and uses cases. This article only includes
    research work that specifically considers multimedia (audio, video, image, visual)
    data in IoT. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first to present
    a comprehensive survey on M-IoT. A comparison of this article in the context of
    M-IoT with other survey articles is presented in Table 2. TABLE 2 The Comparison
    of Comprehensive Survey on M-IoT C. Article Structure The remainder of the paper
    is organized as follows: Section II presents an overview of IoT architecture and
    a comparison of different architectures of multimedia communication in IoT. Diverse
    applications of M-IoT are discussed in Section III. Section IV summarizes the
    performance metrics, design requirements and existing work to maintain quality
    in M-IoT. Section V presents the M-IoT computing paradigm, including multimedia
    coding, event processing, cloud, Fog/Edge computing, and computing using SDNs.
    Section VI covers various routing protocols for M-IoT, while PHY-MAC protocols
    are discussed in Section VII. Section VIII discovers the open issues, challenges,
    and future research directions for multimedia communication in IoT. Finally, section
    IX concludes the article. Table 3 accords the list of acronyms used throughout
    this article. Fig. 2 shows the classification of this article. TABLE 3 The List
    of Acronyms and Corresponding Definitions FIGURE 2. Taxonomy of this article.
    Show All SECTION II. IoT and Multimedia IoT Architecture A. IOT Architecture “Anything,
    anytime, anywhere, any media” has become the axiom for IoT communication. Kevin
    Ashton first coined the term IoT in 1999 [49]. The concept of the M2M has gained
    momentum after the development of the first RFID. RFID uses an electromagnetic
    field that automatically detects and wirelessly tracks the object. RFID is a vital
    component of the IoT since it links millions and billions of physical objects
    with the cyber world [50]. Currently RFID is used in various IoT applications
    such as supply chain management, gestural detection [51], E-health [52], mobile-based
    payments [53], and intelligent restaurants [54]. Diverse IoT applications and
    devices from various manufacturers create heterogeneity in the network, which
    increases the challenges to achieve a unified and interoperable standard. Thus
    to speak and understand various languages, numerous architectures are proposed.
    However, no one has converged to a standardized architecture. Cloud computing
    layer-based architecture is proposed in [12]. The motivation and requirement of
    middleware based IoT architecture are presented in [55]. The integrated architecture
    of short-range micro IoT (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 standards) and macro
    Sub-GHz technologies is proposed in [56]. Hu et al. [57] proposed the concept
    of the Software-Defined Device (SDD) layer-based IoT architecture. Security and
    cognitive layer-based IoT architecture for enhancing efficiency, scalability,
    security, and privacy is presented in [58]. The article [59] proposes an energy-efficient
    IoT architecture based on cloud computing, sensor sleep intervals, and QoI. Fig.
    3 shows the IoT architectures proposed in the literature. FIGURE 3. (a) Basic
    three elements of IoT: power-constrained hardware sensors or devices to sense
    and acquire the data, a middleware to process, analyze, and transmit the desired
    data, and application which visualizes the processed data and results. The existing
    proposed IoT architectures. (b) Middle-ware based [55], (c) Software-defined-device
    based [57], (d) Cloud-based [12], (e) Traditional three-layer IoT architecture
    [60]. Show All The traditional IoT comprises three fundamental elements: mostly
    power-constrained hardware devices to sense and acquire the data, a middleware
    to process, analyze, and transmit the desired data, and application which visualizes
    the processed data and results. These three fundamental elements are depicted
    in Fig. 3(a), and it forms the basis of IoT architecture: 1) things layer, 2)
    network layer, and 3) application layer [60]. 1) Things Layer It is the bottom
    layer in IoT architecture, also known as the perception layer, device layer, or
    sensor layer [61]. This layer is composed of a sensing hardware, scalar or multimedia
    sensors, and actuators, depending upon the services required by the application.
    Sensing devices have uplink data transmission mode while actuators have downlink
    data functionality. Access devices have the competency to operate in both uplink
    and downlink data transmission mode [57]. The main objective of this layer is
    to interconnect things in the IoT network. These devices sense, acquire and pre-process
    data from the physical world either locally or send the data to the centralized
    servers through gateways using Local Area Network or Wireless Personal Area Network
    (LAN/WPAN) via short-range low power enabling technologies like Zigbee, Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), Ethernet, IEEE 802.15.4, etc. 2) Network Layer It is the middle
    layer in IoT architecture, also known as the transmission layer [62]. Virtually
    it is divided into two sub-layers: the access network and the core network. The
    main functionality of the network layer is to process the received data from the
    things layer. Therefore, it determines the energy-efficient optimum route to transmit
    the data to the IoT servers, devices and applications via the Internet using one
    of the communication networks such as WiFi, Ethernet, 3G, Long-Term Evolution
    (LTE), 5G or satellite network [63]. The access network layer is responsible for
    interconnecting various devices and applications through interfaces or gateways
    among Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet) using various communication protocols. The
    core network is responsible for determining the optimum route. Currently, the
    network layer should also support both Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and
    IPv6 networks considering the requirements of cross-domain interoperability in
    heterogeneous IoT networks. Furthermore, to optimize the IoT uplink transmission,
    devices (e.g., smartphones and vehicles) are also exploited as sink nodes for
    an end to end communication, such as Device-to-Device (D2D) communication [64].
    Various data link layer and network layer protocols are presented in section VI
    and section VII. 3) Application Layer It is the top layer in IoT architecture,
    also known as the business layer [11]. Based on the functionality of the layer,
    it is virtually subdivided into two layers, i.e., service sublayer and application
    sublayer [65]. The service sublayer provides information management, data mining,
    data analytics, and decision-making services. The application sub-layer needs
    to provide the required services to end-user or machines. The application layer
    primarily analyzes the required services of IoT application and transforms the
    physical world data into the expressions of cyber world demands. Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) is proposed by IEEE 802.15.4 standard [66] to improve data packets
    delivery and to reduce overheads. The messaging layer and request/response layer
    are two defined layers in CoAP. Other proposed IoT application layer protocols
    are Data Distribution Service (DDS), Advanced Message Queue Protocol (AMQP), and
    Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [11]. B. M-IoT Architectures
    The characteristics of IoT make it possible to support multimedia applications.
    However, it poses enormous challenges as multimedia applications are bandwidth-hungry
    and delay-sensitive. Radio and computational resources are preciously scarce for
    IoT devices. The rapid surge of multimedia data in IoT leads to vast amorphous
    data. Researchers have proposed different M-IoT architectures to efficiently analyze,
    process, and utilize the resources with more reliability. Novel M-IoT architectures
    are presented in this section. Fig. 4 and Table 4 summarizes existing M-IoT architectures.
    TABLE 4 M-IoT Proposed Architectures FIGURE 4. The existing proposed M-IoT network
    architectures: multi-agent-based M-IoT architecture [4], agent-based M-IoT architecture
    [67], AI-based SDNs for multimedia traffic management architecture [68], Fog-Cloud
    hybrid M-IoT architecture [69], and Big data layered M-IoT architecture [70].
    Show All 1) Multi-Agent Based M-IoT Architecture Based on the bulky and unstructured
    nature of the multimedia content, researchers in [4] propose a multi-agent cloud
    computing-based architecture for multimedia communication in IoT. The authors
    have outlined multiple open issues in M-IoT over different communication layers.
    The presented architecture is separated into four main parts; Multimedia sensing,
    reporting and addressability, multimedia aware cloud, and multi-agent systems.
    Multimedia sensing is responsible for pre-transmission processing, which includes
    transformation, quantization, estimation, and compression techniques to reduce
    the bandwidth requirements. In addition, authors have suggested equipping the
    network with energy harvesting capabilities to balance the tradeoff between feasible
    compressions and the energy-constrained M-IoT devices. The report and addressability
    comprise the abilities of the link-layer enabling technologies, i.e., IPv6 over
    Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) based IPv6 Routing Protocol
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), green communication, transport, and application
    layer. The multimedia-aware cloud performs four main jobs that are: Multimedia-aware
    middleware is responsible for understanding various requirements/services of the
    end-users and adapts itself to aggregate, process, learn, filter, and deliver
    the services. The device should be uniquely identified to globally access and
    control remote multimedia devices based on several techniques, i.e., Internet
    Protocol (IP), Domain Name System (DNS), Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and
    Object Name Sevices (ONS). Naming the multimedia content to manage huge multimedia
    data using Digital objects Identifiers (DOI), Digital Item Identification (DII),
    or Digital Item Declaration (DID). Data storage and processing are responsible
    for offering massive storage with the scalability, accessibility, and security.
    Along with stored multimedia, data should be categorized and indexed according
    to the end-users requirement. Multimedia content access requires security and
    privacy policies. Content-Delivery-Network (CDN) is proposed to process multimedia
    content in a distributed manner to overcome resource constraints. The multi-agent
    cloud performs data mining and data analysis, service composition, and content
    sharing. Authors have defined agents as autonomous software working independently
    to achieve objectives subject to design constraints. Kaeri et al. [67] further
    enhance the multi-agent M-IoT architecture to make it more practical by proposing
    and implementing the five-layer architecture. The proposed architecture includes
    a novel concept of modules based channel that comprises multimedia device communication,
    M-IoT services, resources, and a resource connector layer. Service execution agents
    and applications layer holds the upper position in the proposed architecture.
    Various multimedia devices and communication stack form the things layer. Multimedia
    data stream to or from the devices forms M-IoT service of the resource layer.
    Cloud resource is a special type that performs asynchronous communication. Edge
    nodes operate on synchronous communication for real-time processing. Resource
    connector exchanges messages to or from M-IoT service and resource layer with
    service execution agents layer which serves modules according to application requirement.
    It also provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for applications. The
    authors have conducted experiments by implementing their proposed architecture
    in the remote collaboration support system for video conferencing [67]. 2) AI-Based
    Software-Defined M-IoT Architecture The robust increase in multimedia traffic
    necessitates an efficient network traffic management system. Rego et al. [68]
    propose an intelligent network management system for the IoT video surveillance
    system based on SDN and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The AI module is integrated
    into SDN to guarantee the QoS and QoE based on delay, loss rate, and jitter. The
    authors define two main functionalities for the AI module, i.e., data classification
    and resource estimation. The SDN controller governs SDN. After the SDN controller
    receives the data from IoT Network Heads (NHs), the SDN controller sends a request
    to the AI module to classify the data. Multimedia data is classified as critical
    traffic. The article also highlights the preprocessing standards to prioritizes
    the data set by classifying it as critical and label it in increasing order with
    1 being non-critical traffic and 5 being very critical traffic. Various Machine
    Learning (ML) approaches are compared to train AI traffic classification module
    to achieve the best performance that is a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural
    Network (NN), and statistic method (Kernel). Bayes statistic model is used for
    network resource estimation based on traffic priority, route traffic, bandwidth
    variation, buffer management, nodes sleeping duration in the network, and activate
    backup nodes. Open Flow architecture is used to communicate between the SDN controller
    and NHs. The authors also propose a customized message protocol for communication
    between the SDN controller and the AI module, and NH and IoT nodes. Experiments
    are conducted using emulator Mininet, and several results are presented. Results
    depict 77% accuracy of the AI module. 3) Fog-Cloud Hybrid M-IoT Architecture Rahman
    et al. [69] propose a context-aware fog-cloud hybrid based framework that integrates
    spatio-temporal multimedia data from IoT mobile and stationary nodes for the massive
    ad-hoc crowd. In the article, a three-tier architecture: mobile client tier, fog
    node tier, and remote cloud tier, is presented. The authors aim to optimize energy
    resource utilization and reduce end-to-end delay for the massive crowd in the
    smart city. The mobile client tier includes service consumers. Fog nodes tier
    comprises smartphones and other IoT fog nodes distributed in the city to assist
    in real-time processing of spatio-temporal collective or individual queries. Cloud
    tier is formed of IP based massive big data architecture to analytical compute,
    store, and process offline queries. BLE, WiFi Direct, 5G, or D2D spectrum can
    be used for communication within the fog tier. Cloud comprises of four different
    platforms that are the crowdsensing service, social network service, mobile or
    stationary IoT service, and crowdsourcing service. Smartphone acting as a context
    manager and fog node, provides storage, computation, and communication-based on
    an individual’s historical context. Thus, it decreases a large amount of payload
    to the backend cloud. The eventual storage and complex analytical computation
    can be pushed to the cloud. User context requirements are defined according to
    their subscribed IoT services. Moreover, semantics is added to the system using
    the 3A model which assimilates the data from Body Sensor Network (BSN), crowdsourcing,
    social networks and IoT devices to a unified, generic context by the smartphone’s
    context manager to deduce elevated semantics overlay. A query can be responded
    by one or all four platforms. To find a dust-free path, dust sensors deployed
    in the city can provide real-time data, crowdsourcing delivers the query response,
    human or mobile IoT sensors provides the dust level. The response to the query
    can be made available on social network services. Crowdsensing provides congestion
    and weather-related statistics. The article presents a practical implementation
    of the proposed framework and development of smartphone application considering
    Hajj pilgrims as a massive ad-hoc crowd. 4) Big Data Layered M-IoT Architecture
    Authors in [70] proposed a novel concept of six-layered M-IoT architecture based
    on big data aggregation, computation, and extraction of multimedia content. Instead
    of word media authors have considered modal, which refers to the way the data
    is interpreted to convey meaning. Moreover, they have listed three main problems
    associated with multimodal big data computation that is to compute the huge amount
    of data, to detect and extract meaningful information and the current limitation
    of big data processing platforms for multimedia. The six layers proposed in M-IoT
    architecture are: Identification: Devices are first identified based on their
    object ID that is Electronic Product Codes (EPC) and Ubiquitous Codes (uCodes).
    Objects are further discriminately identified based on IPv4 or IPv6. An efficient
    identification technique based on the 6LoWPAN compression mechanism over IPv6
    is presented in [71]. Physical Object: This layer represents the data aggregated
    from scalar or multimedia objects based on their modality and passes on the data
    to the central unit for further processing. Communication: It has the same functionality
    of link, network, and transport layer as in traditional IoT architecture. Middleware:
    It is defined to provide software level support for functional services that is
    resource discovery, data management, and non-functional services, which include
    reliability, scalability, and security. Multimodal computation: It is responsible
    for providing hardware components for computation and Real-Time Operating Systems
    (RTOS). Authors have proposed a sub-layer for big data analytics, which includes
    a centralized data unit, multimodal data aggregation unit, multimodal divide and
    conquers computation unit, and fusion and decision-making unit. These units are
    specifically designed to aggregate, analyze, process, and extract the desired
    features from the big multimodal data. Application layer: It provides the required
    services through a set of standardizing protocols. Moreover, the article presents
    a unique and efficient technique that is Divide and Conquers Principal Component
    Analysis (DC-PCA) to reduce the dimensions, subdivides the data, process the subdivided
    data in parallel fashion, and fuse the final parallel processed data to extract
    the features. Thus making the required decision for services and applications.
    The practical implementation of the proposed DC-PCA for face recognition application
    using Yale and ORL databases is presented. The authors efficiently presented the
    functionality of each layer. 5) Security Based Architecture Zhou and Chao [72]
    devised Mediaware Traffic Security Architecture (MTSA) for M-IoT based on four
    main components. These components are key management which comprises service control,
    user control, flow control scalable, and nonscalable schemes [73]. Batch rekeying
    accommodates multiple multimedia applications based on periodic batch keying,
    periodic batch leave keying, and periodic batch join rekeying [74]. Authentication
    is achieved by group authentication, source authentication, and individual sender
    authentication employing access control list, ability certificates, and mutual
    authentication methods [75]. Watermarking is used to identify the origin of multimedia
    content, trace illegal distribution, and block unauthorized access by embedding
    a unique watermark into multimedia content [76]. The proposed framework exploits
    visual secrecy measures to provide generic multimedia security solutions that
    degrade comparatively to the number of shares in possession of an attacker. MTSA
    inherits content-awareness characteristics from media-aware based middleware security
    architecture for multimedia services [75]. C. Summary and Insights This section
    defines IoT and elaborates each layer of traditional IoT architecture. It also
    covers various architectures and the design requirements for M-IoT. Multimedia
    communication in IoT needs flexible and interoperable architecture to support
    HetNET and different multimedia applications with various application requirements.
    Multiagent, fog-cloud hybrid, big data, and multimedia traffic security architectures
    have been investigated in detail. However, quality-aware architectures and M-IoT
    computation are presented in the latter section of the article. The existing work
    on M-IoT are mostly focussed on application-dependent requirements, and it does
    not take into the consideration of standardizing M-IoT architecture. Standardized
    M-IoT architecture is in need to support multimedia content in various IoT applications.
    The use of multi-agent base ML algorithms can effectively improve the learning
    and understanding of an individual’s multimedia demands in M-IoT architecture.
    This section is summarized in Table 4. SECTION III. Applications of M-IoT Multimedia
    objects equipped with Internet connectivity and interaction with other objects
    without human intervention leads toward the vast opportunities for the betterment
    of humankind in daily life. Since multimedia data is rich in information. Features
    like face recognition, motion detection, license plate identification, driver
    drowsiness indication, patient state, crowd detection, path hole, and obstacle
    detection, retina scanning for authorization and crime detection can be extracted
    employing various data aggregation, analytics and extraction tools. A heterogeneous
    network of multimedia objects, ubiquitous data transmission, and cloud-based multimedia
    content analytics paved the path for smart cities. In this section, we have classified
    numerous M-IoT applications based on different roles in the smart city. Table
    5 classifies and summarizes the applications of M-IoT. TABLE 5 Applications of
    Wireless Multimedia Communication in IoT A. Road Management System 1) Traffic
    Monitoring Efficient traffic monitoring and control is one of the major issues
    in the smart city. To handle this problem, there are different solutions based
    on infra-red detectors, magnetic loops, and microwave radars. These conventional
    techniques incur huge installation, maintenance costs, and lack of accuracy. The
    researcher put forward M-IoT based techniques to effectively detect and identify
    the volume of traffic and predict the reason for a traffic jam. Fig. 5 conceptualize
    the M-IoT to enhance the road management system. Authors in [77] presented computer
    vision-based ontology-driven context-aware M-IoT architecture to estimate the
    traffic by tracking the number of vehicles present on the road in real-time from
    CCTV camera video and segregate moving vehicles from stationary vehicles. Based
    on the density of stationary traffic that occupies the road is compared to a threshold
    value. Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) has been adopted, which utilizes
    time-varying Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) for comparison and predicts the cause
    of traffic congestion. Automatic alerts can be triggered by road traffic authorities
    to avoid a traffic jam. Raspberry Pi and Pi camera-based IoT architecture are
    presented in [46] for traffic surveillance and road accidents. The authors used
    a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with canny edge detection on VIRAT and MIT traffic
    data set to evaluate their proposal. The article also presents several surveyed
    efficient methods, i.e., hidden Markov and neural network, Lucas-Kanade, and K-means
    clustering techniques for accurate accident detection and vehicle tracking. FIGURE
    5. The use case of M-IoT for road management systems that includes accident detection
    and prevention system ([46], [82]), traffic estimation and congestion prevention
    systems [77], lane and path hole detection ([81], [83]), trespassing detection
    [91], automatic emergency detection and alerts generation systems [86], and traffic
    signal monitoring system ([78], [90]). Show All George et al. [78] proposed an
    Adaptive Nero Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and image processing based technique
    using M-IoT for the better traffic light management and monitoring system. Camera
    images are obtained and analyzed on a ThinkSpeak based cloud server. Based on
    the analysis, control actions are given to traffic lights. Machine vision blob
    analysis technique is used to detect and locate the vehicle. Due to poor illumination
    conditions during night, the Otsu image processing technique is used. Low Power
    Wide Area Network (LoPWAN) and Long Range (LoRa) receiver and transmitters are
    adapted to propose IoT smart traffic monitoring and control architecture in [79].
    A comparative survey on the M-IoT based traffic management system is presented
    in [80]. 2) Path Detection, Lane Detection, and Accident Reporting Autonomous
    or Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) are the key element in the development of a
    smart city. Lane detection is considered a vital feature to avoid a collision
    in UGVs. Image-Based obstacle detection and path planning are discussed in [81],
    which includes the conversion of video into fixed-rate image frames. Frames are
    then analyzed using image processing techniques, i.e., edge extraction and thresholding.
    A cloud-based M-IoT system is proposed for accident prevention in [82]. HoneyBee
    Optimization (HBO) based IoT road monitoring system is proposed in [83] to detect
    humps and pothole to prevent accidents. A driving algorithm for path planning
    is proposed for autonomous vehicles exploiting potential field methods and lane
    detection in [84]. Data is acquired using CCD cameras, differential GPS, 2-dimensional
    laser scanner, and digital compass. The analysis is performed using the proposed
    algorithm for lane detection. CDN and MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
    (DASH) are used for a real-time vehicle monitoring system in [85]. Ni et al. [86]
    present a novel lifesaving concept for the individuals left behind in the vehicle.
    The article incorporates life recognition, environmental monitoring, and alarming
    subsystem. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in M-IoT based on Direct Short-Range
    Communication (DSRC) for Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is proposed in [87].
    Several benefits of using the multimedia Internet of Vehicle Things (IoVT) for
    a traffic management system are identified in [88]. Android-based IoT vehicle
    monitoring system accessing various vehicle parameters and driver behavior analysis
    using a Controller Area Network (CAN) is presented in [89]. 3) Traffic Lights
    Management An efficient, cost-effective traffic and street light control mechanism
    based on M-IoT is outlined in [90] for smart cities. The solar panel-based streetlights
    with Direct Current (DC) power supply as a backup along with Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) is used to control the intensity of the light when no vehicle is present
    in the street. Traffic bollards are used to avoid an accident during red and yellow
    lights. Cameras are deployed for the surveillance systems. Latif et al. [91] proposed
    the smart city model having intelligent traffic monitoring and guidance system.
    The proposed model incorporates multimedia data for authentication, verification,
    registration, authorization, shortest path identification, to high light the congested
    areas. Public places like schools, colleges, hospitals, hotels, petrol pumps,
    and banks are considered as objects and are identified by specific IDs. Cameras
    are used to monitor the flow of traffic. The shortest path is determined based
    on time or distance. Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL)
    is opted-in this article for modeling purposes. 4) Authentication and Crime Detection
    IP Multimedia System (IMS) based M2M metropolitan platform for traffic management
    to restrict vehicles entering the prohibited area is detailed in [92]. Authors
    in [93], proposed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based autonomous Taxi model for
    a smart city. Authors in [94] presented a novel concept of M-IoT based crime detection
    in a smart city by analyzing human emotions and CCTV videos. After detection and
    identification of crime, it is stored in the database and visualized using a Geographic
    Information System (GIS). As the smart city is the set of heterogeneous devices
    and networks, various network architecture supporting heterogeneity, e.g., Information-Driven
    Architecture (IDRA), participatory sensing in building the smart city is high
    lightened in [95]. Automatic toll tax payments are one of the essential features
    in a smart city. Beforehand payments based on source and destination location,
    and authentication based on license plate reading as JavaScript Object Notation
    (JSON) data are described in [96]. A detailed survey on M-IoT based road traffic
    surveillance and accident detection is presented in [46]. B. Habitat Monitoring
    1) Security and Surveillance The revolutionary IoT, transforming millions of lives
    by providing ease in almost every aspect of daily routine, could turn into the
    worst enemy. For example, hackers can hack to intercept every document you print
    and redirect it to an isolated site. They could have control of your smart TV
    to bug your home. The smart metering system could be hacked to control the appliances
    of the ventilation system of your home. A traffic light management system could
    be controlled to achieve specific tasks. Variation in the pacemaker of your heart
    could be made to kill. The autonomous vehicles could be hacked to control the
    braking system for your car. These issues lead to serious threats. Traditional
    use of passwords was the authentication system until now. However, the researcher
    has proposed various IoT security and surveillance system based on multimedia
    data, i.e., retina scanning, biometric scanning, voice recognition, and video
    surveillance systems to minimize security loopholes. Enthusiastic researchers
    have further extended the usage of M-IoT to gain maximum advantage in various
    fields. The following are M-IoT authentications, surveillance, and monitoring
    application. Fig. 6 shows the M-IoT application of security and surveillance for
    habitat monitoring. FIGURE 6. The use case of M-IoT applications for security
    and surveillance in a smart city. Existing work in security using multimedia data
    mostly includes fingerprint biometrics ([97]–[99]), voice bio-metrics ([101],
    [102]), retina and iris scanning ([103], [107]), and face recognition [105]. Multimedia
    data in IoT is widely used in surveillance systems ([108]–[124]). Show All a:
    Bio-Metric Authentication Al-alem et al. [97] presented the sketch map leading
    towards the Internet of Biometric Things (IoBT) using various multimedia devices.
    Authors have outlined various steps for efficient biometric identification, i.e.,
    image acquisition, segmentation, pre-processing, and feature extraction. Moreover,
    the article presents insights about different fingerprint acquisition devices,
    i.e., optical sensors, capacitive sensors, thermal, artificial fingerprints generation,
    ultrasonic, and digital cameras. Several fingerprint databases are also plotted.
    The smart objects in Industrial-IoT (IIoT) share information on open channels
    over the Internet that makes confidential industrial plants vulnerable to an eavesdropper.
    Das et al. [98] presented the cloud-based Biometric-Privacy Preserving User Authentication
    (BP2UA) technique. The security analysis of the proposed model is conducted using
    the Oracle-based Real-or-Random (RoR) model. Telecare Medical Information System
    (TMIS) has been introduced for critical patients to communicate with doctors.
    An un-registered adversary, i.e., attackers can find the loop opportunity to mislead
    the patient to achieve specific goals. An efficient, secure smart card based on
    biometric and password double authentication procedures for remote authorization
    is proposed in [99]. H. Hamidi, in [100] presented a secure biometrics-based technique
    for Health IoT (H-IoT). b: Voice Bio-Metrics With the growing deployment of smart
    homes and smart banking applications, i.e., voice to control everything, and authentication
    by voice recognition, provide attackers with an easy loophole which is one of
    the vital security challenges ahead. Voice biometrics are proposed by several
    researchers stretching up to the verification level of the security system. Voiceprint
    verification system based on DL exploiting SVM-Neural Network (SVM-NN) and Mel-Frequency
    Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and feature extraction technique to increase the
    security for M-IoT systems is proposed in [101]. In this work, the LibriSpeech
    dataset is utilized for training. Meng et al. [102] present a novel system based
    on a voice liveness detection system that utilizes wireless signals from IoT devices
    and received vocal samples for verification of Voice Control User Interfaces (VUI)
    decreasing spoofing attacks. The authors named their technique as WiVo. The feasibility
    and effectiveness of the proposed system are evaluated on the Samsung SmartThings
    testbed. The article also listed several attacks on VUI. A comprehensive survey
    on biometric-based IoT security issues, challenges, and techniques are presented
    in [47], [48]. c: Retina Authentication The researcher further enhances the security
    level of IoT using multimedia communication by proposing various techniques to
    implement retina scanning and iris recognition. Pjatkin et al. [103] proposed
    a probabilistic iris recognition approach using the UPOL database to overcome
    the PCA technique. HSI and Y C b C r color spaces are used to generate the Probability
    Density Function (PDF). The KLD tool is used to extract colored eye iris information.
    Ocular Recognition (OR) for a secure IoT application has been proposed in the
    literature. Different OR techniques have been investigated in [104]. An algorithm
    based on the fusion of iris and retinal scanning is proposed for user authentication
    in Apple and Andriod devices. Retina based face recognition authentication system
    is presented in [105]. In this article, retina modeling is improved by accurate
    truncation adaption, illumination classification, and lighting estimation. Yale
    B database is utilized to validate their model. Ocular maladies damage the vascular
    patterns and create abnormalities in the retina, which hinders the accurate recognition
    for authentication. Researchers in [106], proposed an efficient vascular recognition
    technique to overcome the effects caused by lesions and to extract region-based
    features from retina images. Gabor Wavelet is utilized for noise reduction and
    pre-processing, followed by segmentation. Blood vessel validation is performed
    to eliminate false detection by a 5-D feature extraction algorithm and classification
    based on SVM. The database is formed by 5-D extracted features. Finally, authentication
    is performed with the created database. Zhang et al. [107] proposed an improved
    Iris localization authentication method. The authors modeled the system by first
    evaluating the quality of the image taken according to the image intensity, clarity,
    and integrity. The clarity of the image is evaluated by using a block-variance
    method, and integrity is defined on the location of the pupil, i.e., the pupil
    must be in the center. The algorithm works by estimating the range of center,
    radius of the pupil, and pupil region extraction, thus reducing the delay in iris
    recognition. d: Surveillance for Public Safety With the increasing deployment
    of IoT in our daily life and decline in the implementation costs, video surveillance
    systems became a key requirement for the smart city to ensure public safety for
    crime detection, home security system, industrial surveillance, and other localization-related
    features. The immobility of the PC based surveillance system encourages the researcher
    to propose IoT based security systems. Multimedia communication over IoT enables
    us to achieve this objective. Basri et al. in [108] proposed IoT residential surveillance
    system. The proposed scheme is an Android-based application and hardware which
    includes Raspberry Pi, Pi camera, PIR sensor, and ultrasonic sensors to alert
    the owner of a house with an intruder. PIR sensor detects the suspicious movement
    within the specified range, and the image taken by Pi camera is stored in the
    memory card. An email or alert message is sent to the owner by Raspberry Pi. To
    detect emergency and generate alerts for the older person at home, an Android
    application is designed and implemented based on the Real-Time Stream Protocol
    (RTSP) and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [109]. The video is captured, processed,
    and encoded using H.264 at the server end. Client-end includes smartphones, tablets,
    or PC, can access live streaming using RTSP and video is decoded using FFMPEG.
    Security is further enhanced for the elderly by face detection feature using OpenCV
    library for intrusion detection, and critical screenshots are saved for emergency
    alerts. A natural language processing interface combined with ontologies and image
    analysis based video surveillance approach is proposed in [110] for content-based
    retrieval of visual data. The proposal aims to achieve passenger safety in the
    public transport system. Four ontologies are utilized, i.e., DAML time, properties,
    object, and event. PCA and SVM are used for face detection and gender classification.
    Sphinx is used for audio mapping with semantics formed by ontology vocabularies.
    Infants baby monitoring system for the detection of sudden infant death syndrome
    (SIDS) is presented in [111]. A video camera exploiting the Eulerian motion magnification
    technique developed by MIT to monitor and detect infant chest motion during breathing
    is proposed. When an emergency is identified, an alert message is sent to a parent’s
    smartphone via Twilio, which is a cloud-based communication platform [111]. Video
    summarization to reduce the search time from big multimedia data generated by
    the surveillance system and content image-based retrieval techniques for smart
    surveillance is detailed in [112]. Aggregated Channel Feature (ACF) extraction
    and bounding box approach for moving objects are used, and the cost is determined
    if any critical situation is observed. Image with a high-cost box is summarized
    and utilized for video retrieval on search, which reduces the time, memory, and
    computation requirements of the system. Lin et al. [113] proposed a multi-view
    video summarization method to address the high bandwidth transmission requirement
    for the Internet of Video Things (IoVT). The proposed scheme is based on the K-Nearest
    Neighbour (KNN) model. The performance evaluation is measured by making a comparison
    with the GMM based summarization model based on precision metrics, i.e., removal
    of redundant data, and the security of critical information. An online multi-view
    summarization algorithm and RPi based distributed video summarization sensor node
    is developed in [114] and [115]. Al-Saleh et al. [116] presented a secure framework
    for Mobile Video Surveillance Systems (MVSS) by considering a key management system
    to secure channels between all the entities, i.e., camera, Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC), MEC to MEC, and MEC to cloud. An optimized spectrum utilization scheme
    for video streaming in environment monitoring by automatic Transport Block Size
    (TBS) index selection using narrow-band Beyond 4G (B4G) is proposed in [117].
    Video-based Indoor Positioning System (VIPS) estimating the precise face detection
    of each individual with centimeter grade accuracy is presented in [118]. The prototype
    comprises two units, i.e., an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) and Mobile Handled
    Unit (MHU). IPS is responsible for capturing the frame of individuals approaching
    an area, the face is detected for all individuals and mapped to the area location,
    after which the positioning information is broadcasted to MHU which compares the
    individual information in its database with the received information. Cen et al.
    [119] proposed an efficient video compression and encoding/decoding technique
    for wireless multiview video streaming applications in IoT to enhance the energy
    efficiency of the system. The researcher in [120] presents the concept of distributed
    edge computing to minimize the video processing load at the cloud for real-time
    wireless multiview surveillance systems. Authors name this approach as Vigil,
    a camera with Edge Computing Node (ECN), which priorities the video frames from
    multi-camera deployed in the same region for multiview and intelligently schedule
    them for efficient resource utilization. It also provides a user input interface
    for a specific query. Slicing and parallel processing approaches to efficiently
    handle the bulky nature of IoVT are proposed in [121]. sTune architecture is followed
    in this approach, in which a metadata manager manages several cloud storage endpoints.
    The processing unit is composed of a master node and several slave nodes. The
    master node is capable of retrieving data from sTune and assigns the slave nodes
    to process the sliced video data in parallel. After processing master nodes stores
    the processed data back to the cloud. CPU and memory usage are considered as performance
    metrics to evaluate the performance. A multimedia application requesting the same
    content from M-IoT is delivered separately over the core network that increases
    the overhead. To cope with this issue, Silva and Neto [122] propose SCORPIO, an
    SDN control plane to provide multimedia multipart transport services to duplicate
    the multimedia packets at the edge of the network and map them with the applications
    of common interest in the data plane path. The performance metrics to evaluate
    the proposed methodology are throughput, jitter, and packet dropping ratio. Quality
    of Computing (QoC) is introduced in [123] to determine the occupancy of the network.
    The article presents an SDN based network selection approach to maintain QoC in
    HetNet. The proposed approach selects between the licensed band (LTE) or unlicensed
    (WiFi) for real-time services. The data aggregated at the sensor is transmitted
    to the edge processor over upstream links, i.e., LTE and WiFi. The Edge processor
    evaluates the received packets according to the data path and computational goals,
    and feedback is sent on a reverse path. Kougianos et al. [124] proposed a novel
    concept of using quadrotors for IoT real-time automatic tracking applications.
    C. Multimedia IoT in Industrial Applications 1) Smart Industry IIoT is the main
    component of the smart industry, enhancing product manufacturing, and optimizing
    the industrial process. Multimedia characteristics further enhance the outcome
    of the industrial process, as shown in Fig. 7a. The steel industry is known as
    the backbone of any nation. The steel industry modernizes civilization by playing
    a lead role in technology development. Steel manufacturing is performed at high
    temperature. Therefore track identification is challenging under such circumstances.
    Automatic depth-based vision feature extraction and track identification in steel
    billet to maintain the quality of steel products in a smart industry by M-IoT
    is proposed in [125]. Online images are taken once steel billets are manufactured.
    Features are extracted using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and stored in a database
    with identification codes. The framework for 3D surface inspection of steel billets
    is presented in [126]. 3D scanning is performed using a camera by continuously
    capturing multiple images, and green-line lasers are utilized to extract the depth
    information of steel billets to inspect the object from various angles in the
    smart industry. FIGURE 7. The use case of M-IoT in industrial and agricultural
    applications. (a) Multimedia data flow in industrial IoT for inspection of steel
    manufacturing ([125], [126]), combustion quality maitenance [128], and industrial
    meter reading [129]. (b) Agricultural application of M-IoT for crop monitoring
    for production control ([134]–[139]). Show All Condition Monitoring (CM) system
    based on M-IoT is defined in [127]. It detects defective machines to prevent production
    outage and reduce the operational cost in the oil-gas petroleum industry. Thermal
    and gas turbine power plants are the biggest assets of the nation. Flame color
    video recording and images are analyzed to optimize air to fuel ratio that ensures
    combustion quality. Sujatha et al. [128] proposed Fishers Linear Discriminant
    (FLD) analysis technique for dimension reduction and classification. An Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) based on Back-Propagation Algorithm (BPA) and Ant Colony
    Optimization (ACO) for feature extraction from flame images and videos are utilized
    to maintain the combustion quality. An automatic industrial meter reading device
    based on online Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is designed in [129]. After
    extracting readings of various industrial meters from images, the device logged
    the readings to the cloud. At the cloud, data is processed and made centrally
    available to authorized users on PC, smartphones, and laptops. The proposed smart
    device improves time utilization by reducing human intervention. Solar-powered
    grid estimation employing sky camera based on Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor
    Networks (EHWSN) is presented in [130]. Authors in this article maximize the transmission
    quality of sky camera images and minimize the energy consumption of multimedia
    data transmission by determining the best forward relay path. 2) Smart Museum
    Preservation of culture is essential for our future generation to establish and
    strengthen their identity. The Museum industry plays a critical role in preserving
    cultural heritage and displaying knowledge about it. It is the primary source
    of promoting tourism and improves economics statistics. Smart Museum is the need
    for a smart environment to inspire tourists from all over the world. A smart device
    is proposed in [131] to gather localization information of the visitor using BLE.
    It automatically provides the information related to art in front of it using
    image processing and stores it to the cloud to be accessible on smart devices.
    Foreground detection and background subtraction are utilized in the proposed work
    for extraction and image processing. To manage the huge historical data and enhance
    the guiding system for tourist in a smart Museum, M-IoT beacon devices based on
    Raspberry Pi for content delivery operating on BLE is proposed in [132]. The researcher
    further takes M-IoT benefits by implementing computer vision-based image recognition
    transport robots for an automated warehouse in [133]. Neural network-based image
    classification is performed using the Orange Pi hardware platform. CvCanny library
    is utilized in this work for object edge detection to track the path inside the
    warehouse facility. 3) Smart Agriculture Agriculture is another important industrial
    sector. Researchers are trying to revolutionize the agriculture sector to increase
    its productivity by incorporating M-IoT (See Fig. 7b). Nisha and Megala [134]
    present automatic irrigation and an infected area monitoring system using a wireless
    camera in the crop field to aid farmers. Zigbee transceiver is deployed to incorporate
    low power Zigbee over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol for communication and managing sensors
    data. K-means clustering machine algorithm is used for the detection of disease,
    color determination, and pest detection. Agricultural production framework to
    monitor and predicts the future harvest of crops to maintain balance in supply
    and demand is proposed in [135]. The software-based visual general user interface
    is implemented, and live streaming of the field crop is obtained by deploying
    a wireless camera. Dynamic data analysis for crop growth management system using
    IoT is proposed in [136]. The dynamic system equips the farmer with the historically
    analyzed data on a smartphone while moving in the field by communicating with
    the nearest deployed sensor node. An efficient low power MAC-based WSN working
    in a dynamic duty cycle scheme is presented in work to resolve the congestion
    condition. The system is evaluated in the context of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end
    delay, and duty cycles. Authors in [137] present a detailed study of various IoT
    agricultural crop monitoring systems. Android-based food recognition application
    to automatically recommend a cooking recipe is presented in [138]. The proposed
    work employs Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) with the Hessian detector to extract
    144 64-dimension features, Bag-of-Features (BoF) for feature representation technique
    and SVM as a classifier. The proposed scheme gives 84% of the recognition rate.
    Witjaksono et al. in [139] exploits IoT based application for images recognition
    to determine the freshness of the food. The application also discriminates halal
    meat from non-halal meat for Muslims. D. Health Monitoring Multimedia data provides
    the medium to communicate, monitor, and cooperate with various aspects of daily
    life at numerous levels of granularity across various applications, which in terms
    of health is known as personal health media. Incorporating personal health media
    in one device to measure everything using IoT is the features of the future health
    system, as shown in Fig. 8. For this purpose, highly elaborative personal health
    data features are required. Boll et al. [140] presented a logical device layer-based
    architecture for mapping multimedia signals from various devices to the smallest
    elaborative unit named as primary health feature. Mapping is also performed to
    fuse multiple features and deploy advanced analytics to gain minor health details.
    FIGURE 8. The use case of M-IoT for Health. The existing work of M-IoT for smart
    health includes remotely personal health monitoring ([140]–[142]), robotic ambulance
    [144], X-ray for robotic surgery ([145], [146]), biomedical training for surgeons
    [147] and ocular diseases detection using smartphones [148], [149]. All these
    applications could be integrated using cloud service to be available for online
    and offline access. Show All Zafra et al. [141] addressed the issue of coexistence
    wearable devices for e-health with traditional three-layered IoT architecture
    and proposed a pervasive layered architecture to integrate M2M communication between
    e-health wearable and IoT devices. Shah et al. [142] highlight the challenges
    in analyzing big data generated from remote health monitoring and decision making
    by comparison with the patient’s history. The authors also provided details of
    various QoS driven Cloud of Things (CoT) based data processing for remote health
    applications. Rehman et al. [143] proposed 5G small cell network deployment in
    an ambulance for efficient uplink medical video streaming to enhance the medical
    QoS (m-QoS). Ultrasound video is considered as uplink traffic. Medical QoS performance
    is analyzed on the basis of throughput, delay, and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR). Results
    depict that implementing small cell networks augments the performance of the system.
    However, improvements are still required for deploying remote medical health systems
    as packets drop in critical medical condition is not tolerable. Sudden cardiac
    arrest is a heart condition in which heart stops due to lack of oxygen leading
    to death if immediate Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is not given. AED
    is a small device for untrained or minimal trained personnel to use it until the
    first aid arrives. Samani and Zhu [144] designed an intelligent robotic ambulance
    named AmbuBot to provide AED to save a life. AmbuBot is equipped with a GSM module
    for remote connectivity and high-resolution cameras for Lane Keeping System (LKS)
    to track lanes and prevent accidents. The system can be further extended for multiple
    conditions, body sensors, and multiple robots for collaborative work. Robot-Assisted
    Fracture Surgery (RAFS) is revolutionizing the medical health care by reducing
    infection risk during surgery and perfectly manipulate each bone fragment into
    the perfect position. The coordination system is in need between the detected
    bone track and an external robotic tool to exact position the broken bone. Automatic
    tool detection for surgery assistance based on computer vision X-ray images is
    proposed in [145]. Block detection, geometric model matching, and principal component
    analysis are utilized to achieve a 91% success rate. The robotic arm can extend
    the perfection provided by 3D positioning. Smartphone controlled Raspberry Pi
    based robotic arm is designed to assist the doctor in surgery [146]. The platform
    offers built-in compatibility of WiFi, camera and other sensors. Surgical skills
    and effectiveness directly affect the patient’s health. To minimize the harm to
    the patient, surgeons should be highly trained with subjective skills. To overcome
    this problem, research scientists, along with the medical Doctors in [147] have
    designed a biomedical IoT data extraction technique to train surgeons and provide
    real-time feedback on their skills efficiently. The proposed biomedical trainer
    architecture comprises virtual images, medical images, patients data, and journal
    data. The performance of the surgeon is evaluated by capturing the surgeon’s technique,
    visualizing the data, and comparison with the benchmark. Multimedia data features
    in IoT further benefits the field of medical health by retinal cataract detection
    technique for remote area patients. To achieve this, authors in [148] proposed
    a design to implement a microscopic lens over a low-cost smartphone camera and
    real-time detection by FeedForward Neural Network (FFNN) trained the algorithm.
    Yin et al. [149] enhance the system to detect multiple ocular diseases. The proposed
    automatic architecture includes retinal images of data acquisition using a fundus
    camera. Cloud platform stores patient history, process, analyze and extract features
    of stored images. The reports are generated after analysis, and corresponding
    ophthalmologists are referred. The proposed methodology aims to reduce the workload
    on medical specialists and save time. E. Summary and Insights This section covers
    the wireless multimedia delay-sensitive applications supported by IoT. Feature
    extraction from audio, video, and images are studied in detail for different applications
    in security surveillance, traffic, health, and industry monitoring. Various proposed
    methods for biometric authentication to enhance security systems are highlighted.
    Multimedia data in optimizing the performance of the industrial process is also
    detailed in this section. The existing M-IoT applications are more focused on
    feature extraction, mapping, and analysis of multimedia data. However, mobility
    has not been considered in the M-IoT network for the successful transmission of
    the delay-sensitive real-time application. Table 5 classifies the existing work
    on M-IoT applications and summarizes this section. SECTION IV. Performance Metrics
    for M-IoT As compared to traditional IoT, multimedia services are gaining admiration
    in IoT. Multimedia services are delay-sensitive and require efficient network
    models to maintain quality. The bulky nature of multimedia data increases the
    challenges to satisfy the network end-user. User-centric and network-centric metrics
    can assess quality. QoS can be determined by network-centric metrics, while user-centric
    metrics estimate QoE. QoE symbolizes the user perspective of QoS, i.e., measurement
    of the overall performance of service or network to evaluate delay-sensitive traffic.
    QoE is further influenced by two factors, i.e., objective and subjective factors.
    The subjective QoE is measured from experience evaluated by humans, which is problematic
    to measure. The objective QoE data includes network-related manageable and quantifiable
    parameters. Multimedia content over IoT can be evaluated through subjective QoE
    metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Degradation Means Opinion Score (DMOS),
    and user satisfaction [150]. MOS is quantified by rating a user’s experience in
    the range from 1 to 5, where 5 represents the best experience and 1 as bad. Each
    MOS rating corresponds to a solo M-IoT service/session/application required by
    one or set of users and delivered by only one multimedia application. In DMOS,
    users are asked to quantify the degradation of the services as 1 being very annoying
    to 5 as degradation is inaudible. User engagement or satisfaction method can be
    adopted only when the user interacts with the application, i.e., video playtime,
    or several likes, and views. In the case of M2M communication, where the recipient
    of the application is a machine, the performance is evaluated by QoS. QoE and
    QoS perspective related to M-IoT architectures and optimization metrics are studied
    and detailed. Fig. 9 shows classification of QoS and QoE metrics to evaluate network
    and application quality. The elucidation of each study concerning QoE and QoS
    has been presented in the following subsections (See Table 6). TABLE 6 Performance
    Metrics for M-IoT Frameworks FIGURE 9. The classification of performance metrics
    for M-IoT network. The existing work on quality can be studied based on the objective-based
    QoS metrics or subjective-based QoE metrics. Show All A. Quality of Experience
    (QoE) Aware Architectures According to Qualinet White Paper [151], QoE is defined
    as “QoE is the degree of delight or annoyance of the user of an application or
    service. It results from the fulfillment of his or her expectations concerning
    the utility and enjoyment of the application or service in the light of the user’s
    personality and current state.” International telecommunication union (ITU) defines
    QoE in ITU-T Rec. P.10 [152] as follows: “The overall acceptability of an application
    or service, as perceived subjectively by the end-user.” Subjective and objective
    QoE data of the M-IoT network is mostly acquired and evaluated separately. The
    fusion of the subjective QoE data, i.e., user’s experience rating with the objective
    QoE data, i.e., bandwidth allocation, route selection, etc., is important to optimize
    the system. Huang et al. in [31] proposed a novel NN based self-learning self-updating
    framework to fuse QoE subjective and objective metrics named as QoEDF. MOS is
    adopted in this framework to quantify user experiences per service. Various factors
    affecting QoE has been presented in the article. Bandwidth allocation, jitter,
    and best route selection are considered as objective metrics. Two-layered NN based
    framework is presented to map the subjective MOS value with objective metrics.
    The optimization problem is formulated to optimize QoE by first selecting the
    best route and then assigning the required bandwidth for the selected route. Floris
    and Atzori in [153] and [154] proposed virtual layered based QoE-aware architecture.
    The term Quality of Data (QoD) is introduced to evaluate the quality or precision
    of acquired data by M-IoT devices, and QoS parameters are considered as influencing
    factors for QoD. QoE-aware framework for smart surveillance and vehicle monitoring
    system has been presented. The authors adopted MOS for numerically measuring QoE.
    Karaadi et al. [155] defined the term QoE and QoS in the rapport of M2H, H2H,
    H2H, and M2M. In the case of humans as the recipient of the multimedia services,
    the performance of the service is evaluated as QoE, otherwise, when a receiver
    is a machine, then the concept of QoT is utilized. QoT is defined as the acceptable
    quality to satisfy or complete a service session successfully. The bandwidth utilization
    is optimized by considering the minimum bandwidth at an acceptable level to meet
    the minimum requirement of an application. Results depict that the requirement
    for QoE is greater than QoT. The system can be further enhanced by utilizing ML
    approach to allocate minimum bandwidth as required to maintain QoT. Ikeda et al.
    [35] proposed M-IoT framework to evaluate QoE based on physical metrics and metaphysical
    metrics. The metaphysical metric is proposed to understand the user’s quality
    and service requirement, which varies with applications and model them with available
    physical metrics to achieve desired QoE. However, this work lacks subjective experiments
    and qualitative modeling. SDN and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) based
    QoE optimization for adaptive video streaming applications is proposed in [156].
    Video streaming comprises four main tasks, i.e., caching, encoding, forwarding,
    and playing back. Node selection for best-path selection is defined as the objective
    function subject to the constrained node in terms of resources. The proposed model
    is evaluated on Mininet a network emulator and OpenDaylight as an SDN controller.
    Performance evaluation of the model is studied based on end-to-end delay, packet
    loss, and user’s QoE. He and Wang [157] studied the effect of interference between
    Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) UE’s on QoE at the consumer end. Authors
    utilize the user satisfaction method, i.e., several clicks or playtime to quantify
    QoE and formulated Cournot competition Oligopoly game problem to optimize power
    allocation among NOMA UE’s to upload the acquired real-time video surveillance
    data to the BS with minimum interference and maintain QoE. Statistical learning,
    prediction, and automatic network resource management mechanism to optimize multimedia
    QoE has been presented in [158]. By statistical monitoring, the QoE is predicted,
    computed and managed by evaluating objective network metrics, i.e., jitter, packet
    loss rate, frame rate, frame resolution, data rate, codec, and data volume. MOS
    has been utilized for QoE. The mobile node frequently switching network has been
    tested for the proposed model. Ahmad et al. [159] presented a multi-dimensional
    passive QoE monitoring approach at the user terminal based on quality degradation,
    where the probes at UE becomes online when quality is degraded below a specific
    threshold. The analyzed data at UE will be sent to the service provider to take
    critical actions to overcome the degradation. The proposed system could be improved
    by the implementation of cloud-based QoE analysis and monitoring. Wang W. and
    Wang Q. in [32] introduce a novel concept of Smart Media Pricing (SMP) by implementing
    Price as a Resource (PaaR) instead of smart data pricing. The authors have proposed
    to price the end-user according to its required QoE as the criticality of a self-driving
    car is higher to ensure the QoE due to high data rate requirement for precision
    than the telepresence of a user in which bandwidth requirements are low. Premium
    quality content should be priced higher than an economy class user. B. Quality
    of Service (QoS) Aware Architecture The quality of telecommunication services
    is defined by ITU in recommendation ITU-T E.800 [160] as: “Totality of characteristics
    of a telecommunications service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and
    implied needs of the user of the service.” Microsoft defines network QoS in [161]
    technical white paper as: “Network QoS refers to the ability of the network to
    handle this traffic such that it meets the service needs of certain applications.”
    A framework to assess the quality of stereoscopic images for 3D product modeling
    in M-IoT has been presented in [162]. The authors proposed a blind image Deep
    Belief Network (DBN) based on natural science feature extraction and Support Vector
    Regression (SVR) for training. More effective machine and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms
    could be adopted to reduce the image distortions. Bellavista et al. in [163] proposed
    an SDN controller based Fibre optics-Wireless (FiWi) and edge M-IoT hybrid network
    architecture to optimize QoS in HetNet. Resource allocation, i.e., bandwidth,
    is considered as QoS optimization metrics. FiWi and Edge M-IoT hybrid network
    enhance the performance by communicating via the SDN controller. Reserved and
    excess bandwidth are offered by FiWi network to edge network in case of spontaneous
    network addition at consumer end via SDN heads. SDN based HetNets integration
    offers better network management. Statistical QoS metrics analysis of HetNets
    gateway is studied in [164] for betterment in M-IoT network designing. PLR, throughput,
    and delay are considered as QoS data. Results show that delay is the same for
    all types of devices. However, PLR and throughput affect more on low data rate
    gateways as compared to high data rate gateways. Aazam et al. [34] proposed a
    fog resource estimation and utilization to improve QoS based on service Relinquish
    Rate (RR) and previous Net Promoter Score (NPS). Resources are managed according
    to past Service Level Agreement (SLA) or disagreements. Fog computation enhances
    the performance of the system model by equipping the devices to estimate and utilize
    resources more efficiently. Quality-aware Universal Communication Framework (UCF)
    to handle mobile connectivity and reduce signaling overheads repeatedly between
    end devices for M2M communication has been presented in [165]. Network QoS parameters
    have been analyzed in [166] to evaluate to satisfy QoE for IoVT at various network
    conditions. QoS-aware framework for the Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT)
    network by utilizing a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to optimize
    energy consumption is outlined in [167]. To conserve energy, Poison distribution
    in POMDP is used to estimate traffic arrival rates and adopt dynamic network configuration
    changes according to future traffic prediction. The proposed model conserves power
    for BS and UE. Implementation of various optimization problems and ML algorithms
    to predict traffic arrival can further improve the system. Web Real-Time Communication
    (WebRTC) for video conferencing in connection with cloud computation has been
    studied in [168]. The proposed model analyzes QoS parameters in comparison with
    WebRTC in connection with local networks. Traffic load and the computational delay
    has been considered as QoS metrics for analysis. Elhammouti et al. [169] form
    a game theory problem named satisfaction equilibrium with an objective function
    to optimize energy instead of maximizing QoS. The authors have highlighted key
    motivation for optimizing energy subject to achieve satisfactory QoS constraint.
    Several applications related to multimedia have specific data rate requirements,
    therefore maximizing the QoS above that level will waste the energy. The energy
    management can be further enhanced by allocating power based on the intrinsic
    requirement of the application. C. Summary and Insight In this section, work related
    to the quality of the M-IoT network in terms of network performance has been discussed
    in detail. Quality of network is further evaluated in terms of a subjective measure
    of user experience, which is QoE and performance of network parameters, i.e.,
    QoS. Various QoE-aware and QoS-aware frameworks have been discussed. Issues and
    further enhancements in these works are highlighted. The Key Performance Indicators
    (KPIs) of communication are network metrics. Due to the scarcity of the network’s
    bandwidth, bandwidth utilization is one of the major KPI. As multimedia data consume
    a huge amount of bandwidth therefore researchers are considering exploiting un-utilized
    wideband available in Terahertz (THz) band i.e., 30–300 GHz that can loosen the
    strict limitations on bandwidth utilization. However, several issues related to
    human exposure index due to high penetration power, antenna designing, resource
    allocation, physical and MAC designing are open for research. Studies related
    to QoS and QoE are highlighted in Table 6. SECTION V. M-IoT Computing Paradigm
    A significant increase in multimedia big data generated from IoT devices, this
    volume increases with diminishing size and mobile nature of IoT devices. The amount
    of data generated is expected to be 600 Zettabytes (ZB) annually by 2020 [170].
    One of the particular multimedia IoT data generated online is audio, video, images,
    and graphics [171]. The characteristics of multimedia data are specified as huge
    volume, structured and unstructured data, velocity, unpredictability (frequently
    changing), and accuracy [172]. The current IoT frameworks to analyze and process
    scalar data are unsuitable for multimedia data in IoT. Multimedia data in IoT
    poses challenges including storage and sharing, real-time computation, processing
    and provision, energy optimization, resource allocation, feature extraction from
    unstructured multimedia data, addressing and routing, QoS and QoE preservation,
    delay sensitivity, data reduction, compression and encryption, security and privacy
    [171]. Previously we have discussed M-IoT architectures, use cases, QoS, and QoE
    optimization techniques. In this section, various computation, processing, compression
    techniques have been discussed. Fig. 10 shows the classification of multimedia
    computing in IoT. Routing and resource allocation MAC approaches are present in
    the later sections. Four main phases of multimedia data computation are shown
    in Fig. 11. A detailed survey on multimedia big data computing in IoT is presented
    by Kumari et al. [44]. The authors have discussed in detail the difference between
    big data and big multimedia data. This section has been specifically subdivided
    into multimedia data compression and event processing, fog/edge frameworks for
    M-IoT computation, cloud computation for M-IoT and SDNs for M-IoT computing. Table
    7 classifies and summarizes the existing work related to multimedia data computing
    in IoT. TABLE 7 Multimedia Computing Paradigm in M-IoT FIGURE 10. Classification
    of M-IoT computing. The existing work on multimedia computing can be studied based
    on compression and encoding, event detection and processing, cloud computing,
    fog/edge computing, and SDNs for computing. Show All FIGURE 11. Multimedia data
    computing phases. Data is first efficiently acquired, compressed, and transmitted
    to computing unit for feature classification and extraction, and then the decision
    is made on classified data. Show All A. Multimedia Coding and Compression In conventional
    multimedia data encoding techniques, data is compressed once and decoded whenever
    played. M-IoT devices are more concerned with uploading the data in uplink transmission,
    which poses challenges on computationally powered constrained M-IoT devices. Traditionally
    video encoding/compression is achieved by utilizing spatial and temporal redundancies.
    The techniques for multimedia encoding are known as High-Efficiency Video Coding
    (HEVC) jointly developed by ITU-T and International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO). The current standard jointly designed in 2013 is H.265, which shows efficient
    performance as compared to H.264 developed in 2003 [173]. The major features of
    H.265 include maximum block size of 64×64 , adaptive block sub splitting and prediction,
    and up to thirty-five intra-frame prediction directions. Google developed VP9
    and DAALA is designed by Mozilla Corporation, both compete with H.264 [174]. Comparative
    analysis of H.264, H.265, VP9, and DAALA has been presented in [43]. Results depict
    that H.265 outperforms other encoding techniques. Liu et al. [175] devised a computation
    complexity reduction transcoder solution for real-time video communication. After
    mapping the relationship among H.264/AAVC decoding information, the Coding Unit
    (CU), and the Prediction Unit (PU) decision process, the proposed model exploits
    SVM to classify either to select PU decision mode or CU depth decision process.
    The objective of the algorithm is to optimize the interframe prediction process
    of the HEVC re-encoder. Energy consumption can be significantly minimized by applying
    compression techniques to avoid energy transmission costs. Santos et al. [176]
    proposed a truncation based compression technique named ScaleRelativeMax based
    on Energy Packing Efficiency (EPC) for sensitive biomedical applications. For
    a biomedical application, the reconstruction of the signal without losses is of
    great importance. The impact of different truncation strategies on the Compression
    Ratio (CR) has been discussed in detail and compared with the proposed strategy.
    Results illustrate that the proposed technique offers linear reconstruction growth
    with comparable CR to other techniques. Compressed Sensing (CS) uses sparse signal
    structures to diminish the size of the transmitted or stored data. Multimedia
    data is sparse in structure. CS is used for multimedia data acquisition and reconstruction.
    Li et al. [40] exploit DL and AMP for improving IoT multimedia data reconstruction
    quality and minimize bandwidth utilization. Performance comparison of the DL-AMP
    technique with EM-GM-GAMP, Gauss-AMP, fast-BM3D-AMP, and other proposed CS techniques
    in the literature validates the proposed framework is suitable for multimedia.
    A Joint full reference Quality Assessment Metric (JQAM) based on the Human Visual
    System (HVS) by considering binocular perception and image properties is projected
    in [177]. The proposed technique efficiently measures the image pixel, contrast,
    and structural distortion by considering the luminance masking of the image to
    access the quality of the image. Hu et al. in [178] proposed a joint compression
    and transmission technique to optimize energy usage based on the canonical Lyapunov
    optimization scheme for power-constrained multisensor wearable devices. M-IoT
    devices are energy and resource-constrained. M-IoT devices are required to be
    computationally efficient as most of the devices are battery operated. An efficient
    task allocation strategy to maintain the QoS is required to assign the task to
    process in parallel dynamically. Wei et al. [179] proposed a real-time approximate
    task computation allocation strategy for MultiProcessor System on Chips (MPSoC)
    to increase the number of executions in a hybrid energy environment. In a hybrid
    renewable energy system, the power supply is unpredictable. Authors designed a
    dynamic task scheduler to adapt real-time varying conditions in fluctuating energy
    availability. Khernane et al. [180] discussed the tradeoff between video data
    coding and quality at the user end while optimizing the energy for the maximum
    life expectancy of the network. An entirely distributed algorithm is presented
    to balance the power utilized to encode the video and video encoding rate. The
    authors considered the dynamic nature of link capacity. The transmission errors
    are minimized by incorporating retransmissions based on the two-state Markov chain.
    However, in this work, spectrum efficiency is not taken into account, which is
    the key requirement for multimedia data transmission. A detailed survey on M2M
    communication is highlighting the issue and challenges in distributed video cameras
    in [181]. Various video coding techniques, power consumption analysis, and energy
    harvesting approaches is detailed in this article. Aljawarneh et al. [182] devised
    a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) encryption system based on Feistel Encryption
    Scheme (FES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to secure medical multimedia
    data. The multimedia data is divided into equal-sized blocks, which are subdivided
    into plain text and keys. Each key and plain text is then encrypted separately
    using FES and AES, respectively. The genetic algorithm integrates separately encrypted
    keys and plain text to secure the data from vulnerability. The system utilizes
    the GPU to process graphics efficiently and provides parallel processing to execute
    maximum tasks to increase system throughput. B. Event Processing The M-IoT encompasses
    myriad applications in every field which varies in data capacities, features,
    nature of outputs, and encoding formats. An increasing number of devices and applications
    transits the nature of multimedia traffic more towards unstructured events. Generic
    event detection and query processing framework is in need to process structured
    and unstructured multimedia events. Aslam and Curry [183] proposed a Multimedia
    Stream Processing Engine (MSPE) as a middleware with an operator to analysis unstructured
    events in multimedia data and DNN processor to extract and match the features.
    Publish/subscribe mechanism is adapted in which multimedia devices send captured
    events to the middleware and subscribers can access the desired events by relevant
    classifiers from middleware by DNN based matchers. Optimization models are adapted
    to analyze and process a user’s query to achieve optimized throughput and accuracy
    to serve the query. The integration of diverse image analysis techniques could
    enhance the genericity of the framework. Angsuchotmetee et al. in [184] offered
    Multimedia Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (MSSN-Onto) to detect various events
    in a HetNet to provide syntactic and semantic interoperability. A multimedia application
    that involves more than one user requires syntactic and semantic interoperability
    to understand different data encoding techniques and content-aware modeling. The
    proposed framework constitutes MSSN indexer, application manager, and event processing
    engine to process and index the data stream concerning their feature levels, and
    serving the queries of the users from the stored, indexed data. Xu et al. proposed
    an attention-in-attention (AIA) network in [185] for multievent recognition and
    representing the salient features of visual modality and semantic modality exploiting
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for visual features extraction. AIA comprises
    Encoder Attention Modules (EAM) and Fusion Attention Module (FAM) for desired
    features matching and fuses multi-dimensional features into a single-dimensional
    feature. The authors employed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) unit on decoding fused data into multi-events labels. Multiple AIA
    modules can enhance event recognition and representations of multimedia video
    streaming. Saha et al. [186] presented a context-aware Block-based Motion Estimation
    (BME) approach to enhance multimedia compression. The author uses the pixel distortion
    ratio to characterize the motion into a Large Diamond Search Pattern (LDSP) or
    Small Diamond Search Pattern (SDSP). The proposed scheme intends to reduce the
    computation time significantly. Parallel processing incorporating GPU and directional
    motion estimation can further augment the performance. Thiyagarajan et al. [39]
    devised energy-aware selective encryption for the high motion video frame. The
    detection of high motion is performed by the texture energy level of the frame
    which is classified by the DC coefficient in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and
    the motion vector which expresses descriptive information of video magnitude and
    phase angle. The high value of the motion vector indicates high motion activity
    and vice versa. For securing multimedia data and conserving energy in M-IoT, all
    syntax elements of high motion frames are encrypted. However, in low energy frames,
    alternate syntax elements are encrypted. C. Cloud Computing for M-IoT The miniature
    IoT devices and bulky nature of multimedia data necessitate excessively large
    and time-sensitive computation resources. Cloud computing offers computing resources
    in a centralized manner instead of localized computing to augment energy conservation,
    QoS and improves the life expectancy of the M-IoT network. Computing pioneer ‘John
    McCarthy’ speculated cloud computing in 1961 as ‘ computation may someday be organized
    as a public utility’ [187], which raises the question, what exactly cloud computing
    refers to. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defined cloud
    computing in [188] as: “Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand
    network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks,
    servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned
    and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”
    Cloud computing encompasses five essential elements [189]: 1) On-demand self-service:
    user with urgent requirement of CPU, storage, and software can avail the resources
    without human intervention. 2) Broad network access: the user required computation
    resources are available over the Internet for heterogeneous platforms. 3) Resource
    pooling: similar resources are organized in pools exploiting virtualization to
    serve multiple users. 4) Rapid elasticity: the consumer resource requirements
    vary according to the network condition and application regardless of having any
    knowledge about cloud computation capacity. Therefore cloud servers are flexible
    to address every user. 5) Measured services: The cloud server monitors the resource
    usage of each user through metering capabilities. In addition to these elements,
    the cloud services are categories as; Software as a Service (SaaS): accessing
    application from cloud, Platform as a Service (PaaS): providing application development
    platform as a service, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): providing hardware
    infrastructure i.e., storage, processing servers and network as a service [187]
    as depicted in Fig. 12. The cloud services are deployed in four models; private
    cloud, community cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud [189]. In this section
    varied proposed cloud computing schemes for M-IoT have been enlisted. A comprehensive
    study on the integration of cloud computing and IoT has been presented in [190].
    FIGURE 12. Cloud computing services for M-IoT. Cloud services are categorized
    as the platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and software
    as a service (SaaS). Cloud services can be studied for M2M and M2H communication.
    Cloud services require a secure and safe connection between device and cloud.
    Show All 1) Multimedia Cloud Computing in IoT The ubiquity of audio processing
    and cameras even in low-end devices increases the audio and visual recognition
    applications. However, due to small size IoT devices, multimedia data processing
    requires additional computational services that are readily available. To cope
    with this issue, the researcher has put forward several remote cloud computing
    scheme for multimedia processing. Renna et al. in [191] presented a framework
    to provide the optimal balance between energy consumption to process the query
    and the cost incurred for cloud computing by incorporating resource consumption
    according to the volume of query which either lies in the idle state or active
    state. Ubiquitous and heterogeneous data generated from the surveillance system
    is transmitted to a centralized processing unit over limited bandwidth incur high
    latency. Ali et al. [192], [193] proposed a cloudlet based, lightweight distributed
    computing framework for IoT video surveillance systems to minimize network latency.
    The cloudlet system brings cloud computation resources closer to the IoT network
    to compute critical and sensitive data in real-time. In this article, face recognition
    is considered as a use case to validate the framework. Cloudlet exists between
    surveillance cameras and the public cloud. Image/video captured by the camera
    is sent to the cloudlet for face recognition and feature extraction, which is
    transmitted to the public cloud for matching and identification purposes. Cloudlet
    is a device with significant storage, CPU, and GPU. Preprocessing the captured
    data before transmitting to the public cloud significantly reduces the network
    latency. DNN based face detection ‘OpenFace’ in real-time video stream and face
    denaturing named ‘RTFace’ technique for privacy and safety has been presented
    in [194]. The proposed algorithm is implemented on cloudlets for speedy and efficient
    face detection and denaturing. Crowdsensing is an important aspect of smart cities
    which provides ease in multimedia data aggregation by exploiting multimedia sensor
    of public mobile phone, wearable devices, and tablets. The acquired data is wirelessly
    transmitted to the cloud in real-time due to the limited storage capacity of the
    devices. Hong et al. [195] addressed three problems in cloud-based video crowdsensing:
    1) optimal transcoding, 2) the optimal data transfer protocol and meta-data selection
    to upload a video over WiFi, 3) camera parameters which require complete video
    lookup. The authors presented three algorithms: Adaptive Transcoding Algorithm
    (ATA) based heuristic algorithm for video representation without quality compromise.
    Protocol Selection Algorithm (PSA) to dynamically select transmission protocol
    by comparing average throughput normalized value achieved from FDT and UDT. Cloud
    Database Algorithm (CDA) based on Field-of-View (FoV) approach to manage videos
    in the cloud database. Authors in [196] devised an analytical framework to serve
    the cloud access request from the access network, core, or edge network by maintaining
    an optimal number of replicas to improve resource utilization. Cloud computing
    for event detection in a video stream and probabilistic future event prediction
    is detailed in [197]. Authors proposed a dynamic programming based framework to
    efficiently allocate bandwidth resources from limited uplink bandwidth based on
    future event predictions to transmit only meaningful information. The results
    show 80% event detection with 97% QoS satisfaction, utilizing 10% of essential
    bandwidth. Wang et al. [198] devised multimedia sensing as a service (MSaaS),
    an energy-efficient framework work to upload multimedia data by prioritizing it
    first and then optimally allocate network resources. The authors exploit the quad-tree
    decomposition algorithm to segregate regular and premium blocks. In this article,
    the truncation based resource allocation optimization problem is formulated. A
    unified resource allocation metric is considered based on Automatic Repeat Request
    (ARQ), channel coding for Forwarding Error Correction (FEC), data rate, transmission
    power and packet length subject to energy-constrained quality optimization. D.
    Fog/Edge Computing For decades cloud computing served as pay-as-you-go, managing
    and providing alternative solutions for data centers and enterprises by providing
    remote storage units, processing units, networks, servers and applications to
    serve multiple customers [199]. Cloud computing flows a centralized processing
    infrastructure which is usually located far from users or IoT proximity. However,
    cloud computing upsurges network overheads by transmitting the aggregated data
    from sensors to the centralized processing cloud and then acquiring back the analyzed
    data over bandwidth, latency, and energy-constrained network. M-IoT network requires
    a model that can handle high velocity, volume, and variety of data with minimum
    latency, conserve bandwidth, reliability, globally secure and chooses the best
    processing unit in the least possible time. In 2012, Cisco introduced and defined
    fog computing as [200]: “The fog extends the cloud closer to the things that produce
    and act on IoT data.” Fog computing is the virtualized platform that offers computation,
    storage units and routing devices between User Equipment (UE) and traditional
    cloud, located at the edge of the network, reducing the response time of the system
    [201]. The fog-cloud hybrid computing architecture process the data in the following
    pattern. Critical time-sensitive and real-time data are processed on the fog node,
    while less critical data that can tolerate minute delay is processed and stored
    on fog gateway node for a few hours. The regular periodic data that is not delay-sensitive
    is sent to the cloud to be processed and stored for offline access [200]. Stojmenovic
    et al. [202] outlined a detailed overview of fog computation applications and
    challenges. The term edge computing also refers to the notion of providing computation
    at the edge of the network. The edge computing is defined as network processing
    and resources progressing between data origin and cloud unit [203]. Detailed edge
    computing architecture and issues are presented in [203]. The smartphone act as
    an edge between the user and the cloud. The processing unit is placed within the
    proximity of data producers to increase energy efficiency, response time, and
    bandwidth allocation optimization. Fog computing is referred to as edge computing.
    However, the difference lies in the location of the computing unit is placed.
    Fog computing is employed at the Local Area Network (LAN) or the gateways of the
    network, whereas edge computing is embedded within the end or edge device, as
    shown in Fig. 13. Linthicum et al. describe edge computing as the concept, while
    fog computing as a protocol to implement edge computing [204]. The authors also
    highlighted the limitations of both the architectures in data computing. Various
    fog and edge computing frameworks, vision, and challenges in the M-IoT network
    are studied and presented in the subsection. FIGURE 13. Fog/Edge computing in
    M-IoT. Fog/Edge devices reduce network overhead and latency by preprocessing the
    acquired multimedia data at Fog/Edge nodes. Fog/Edge devices can be a smartphone,
    network hubs, gateways, routers, and servers. Show All 1) Fog Computing in M-IoT
    Extending the computing closer to the edge or access network raises several issues
    and challenges. Determining and classifying critical multimedia data is necessary
    for load balancing on fog node and the cloud for optimal efficiency. Excessive
    workload on fog node increases the power consumption, causing efficiency degradation.
    Deng et al. [205] formulated a primal problem for maximizing power conservation
    in fog-cloud hybrid systems. Four layered fog-cloud frameworks have been proposed.
    Moreover, the authors decompose the problem into three subproblems by specifying
    the tradeoff between latency and power consumption. The problem is subject to
    various constraints: 1) delay at fog node, 2) Wide Area Network (WAN) communication
    system between fog and cloud server, 3) bandwidth and network overheads at the
    cloud server. Simulation results show that the proposed framework improves latency
    and power consumption for delay-sensitive traffic. Chen et al. [206] devised a
    fog-based video surveillance system to monitor a speedy road traffic system in
    urban areas using a drone camera. The authors proposed a tracking algorithm that
    extracts and transmits image frames of interest to fog node to meet minimum computation
    and delay requirements. The tracking algorithm utilizes Bayes estimation and probabilistic
    Monte Carlo simulations. Yousefpour et al. in [207] presented a fog-cloud hybrid
    generic framework to minimize the service latency by sharing the load among fog
    nodes. The framework considers the queue length and the type of service requested,
    as the different application requires different service time. The Fog layer offers
    collaborative architecture to process a request exploiting the concept of load
    sharing by offloading the service request to neighbor fog nodes. Authors also
    put forward an approach to find the best fog node to process the request in minimum
    time by using a centralized fog node for maintaining a reachability table to offload
    the request to the node which offers minimum service delay. Minimum service delay
    and propagation delay are measured using a recursive analytical process. Simulation
    results depict the proposed model outperforms No Fog Processing (NFP). Ni et al.
    [208] put forward a fog computation resource allocation strategy based on Priced
    Timed Petri Nets (PTPNs) that considers price and time cost of task completion.
    The proposed scheme utilizes a dynamic recursive algorithm for fog resource allocation.
    The authors also presented a probabilistic model to predict the time cost of task
    completion. The framework provides a novel scheme for users to select the resource
    pool that fulfills their requirements. The innovation can still be improved by
    implementing the ML technique to train the system by mapping the nature of services
    with required fog resource and service time. Yang in [209] discussed fog architectures
    for data stream processing in four different applications: 1) IoT stream analytics,
    2) real-time crowdsourcing, 3) network control, 4) event processing. The author
    investigates various issues and challenges in applications focused on real-time
    monitoring and crowdsourcing. The main objective of this architecture is to incorporate
    fog computation in the M-IoT network that augments the network throughput, latency,
    fairness, stability, and reliability. 2) Edge Computing in M-IoT Communication
    between M-IoT devices, edge devices, and cloud incur additional delay if the tasks
    are not properly scheduled. Xu et al. [210] introduced the concept of optimizing
    in-memory processing to reduce the delay and latency of the network. Three-tier
    architecture is proposed to formulate closed-loop feedback scheduling and prioritization
    model to integrate memories of all the edge devices to balance workload allocation.
    Results depict improvement in latencies for M-IoT systems and rational workload
    allocation. Genetics a geo-distributed real-time stream processing for the dynamic
    edge-cloud network is proposed in [211] to achieve low latency by exploiting minimum
    bandwidth allocation and task sharing. A distributed Complex Event Processing
    engine (CEP) for a fully distributed edge IoT network is presented in [212]. CEP
    utilizes both events based and stream-based approaches. The authors proposed a
    heuristic assignment model for task distribution for a balanced workload between
    edge devices and cloud. Results show 6.6 times less data volume flow as compared
    to a centralized framework. Li et al. [213] proposed CNN based deep leaning optimization
    problem to maximize the number of tasks for edge devices subject to limited bandwidth
    and system capacity. The authors aim to reduce the network traffic and overheads
    from M-IoT devices to the cloud. The system is designed for online and offline
    video processing, as video processing is the integration of computer vision and
    image processing. Sharma and Wang [214] devised a collaborative edge-cloud framework.
    The framework utilizes the historic cloud computing data to aid edge computation
    to analyze live data for maintaining QoS. The authors also highlighted the issues,
    challenges, and limitations of both edge and cloud computing. Furthermore, the
    motivation for a collaborative edge-cloud framework is also outlined. Long et
    al. in [215] proposed an edge M-IoT framework to process video on edge devices
    to improve the accuracy of human detection in surveillance systems. The proposed
    framework utilizes D2D communication to transmit the divided and compressed video
    frames to nearby edge nodes that form cooperative groups to process the video
    frames transmitted to them in multicast or unicast fashion. The authors deduced
    that human detection accuracy is positively correlated with the video coding rate
    and formulates an optimization problem to maximize the average video coding rate
    subject to deadline and group formulation constraint. Group formulation problem
    is solved by considering it as Winner Determination Problem (WDP), which states
    that the video chunks are allocated to the group of edge nodes which maximizes
    the overall utility. Simulation results validate that the proposed work outperforms
    no cooperation and an arbitrary model. Elias et al. [216] devised Where’s The
    Bear (WTB), an image processing technique for edge computing based on NN to recognize
    animals in wildlife monitoring systems. The objectives of WTB are to conserve
    bandwidth and improve accuracy. WTB exploits Google TensorFlow for image recognition
    and classification, and OpenCV for analysis. Results show that implementing image
    recognition at the edge of the network where the images are acquired reduces latency
    and conserves bandwidth. E. Software-Defined Networks Several devices are responsible
    for handling network in IoT, such as, routers, switches, and embedded devices.
    These devices are equipped with integrated circuits, that are pre-programmed to
    execute predetermined tasks. Such devices are not reconfigurable with dynamic
    changes in the network to support real-time multitasking. The expected 50 billion
    connected devices could generate 600 ZB annually by 2020 [170]. Transmitting such
    a huge amount of data to the cloud for analysis and processing may lead to developing
    network congestion, which can cause latency and bandwidth issues affecting overall
    QoS and QoE. To cope with this problem, most of the technology giants like Cisco
    and IBM offered to process the data closer to the network’s edge to achieve high
    data rates and low latency. However, edge processing may incur high energy consumption.
    To deal with issues mentioned above a flexible, scalable, reprogrammable, and
    reconfigurable M-IoT architecture is in need to manage multimedia traffic flow
    and data computation to optimize energy consumption and performance. SDN is an
    emerging network technology that offers flexible, interoperable, reconfigurable,
    and reprogrammable network architecture to satisfy dynamic changes in the network.
    SDN compromises network management [217], network virtualization [218], network
    accessibility [219], resource utilization [220], energy management [221], security
    and privacy [222] by segregating network control from hardware devices [223].
    The main objective of the SDN is to decouple the control plane from the data plane
    to rationalize the network. This network device now acts as a Forwarding Device
    (FD), that forwards a sequence of packets from source to destination by regulatory
    policies [224]. The control plane in SDN is a centralized unit while the data
    plane works in a distributed manner. The Telecommunication Management Network
    (TMN) architecture comprises three planes: management, data, and control plane.
    Management plane forms the maintenance and operations unit of the network, i.e.,
    human operators and software that monitors the status, configure and update the
    network. The data plan performs data transmission by following the flow decisions
    of the controller in the control plane. This plane constitutes all the FDs such
    as routers, switches, firewalls, and embedded circuits. The control plane is a
    centralized controller to configure and reprogram the network, for instance, network
    path, routing protocols, network policies according to the application requirements
    [225]. The SDN comprises two Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), i.e.,
    northbound API that is responsible for providing communication between application
    plane and controller, whereas southbound API supports communication between the
    controller and network devices as shown in Fig. 14. This section presents studies
    and proposed schemes associated with multimedia data computation by employing
    SDN. FIGURE 14. The architecture of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) for multimedia
    computing. SDNs offers scalability, flexibility, reconfigurability, and re-programmability
    for efficient network management. SDNs separates data planes from the control
    plane and provide four APIs. Show All 1) Multimedia Computing in SDN SDNs are
    not specifically introduced for data computing. However, managing the network
    proficiently by SDNs could reduce the computing complexity to yield low latency
    and fewer overheads. Kaur et al. in [226] devised SDN as a middleware in edge-cloud
    hybrid architectures to improve the energy efficiency of the stream processing.
    The framework provides the classification of data flow into batch processing and
    stream processing. Batch processing is more focussed on network service bandwidth
    while stream processing comprehends real-time applications that are latency-sensitive.
    Upon the classification of workflow, network control logic are configured and
    implemented. The authors have formulated multi-objective optimization problems
    for each control logic, which exploits the Tchebycheff decomposition algorithm
    to solve the problems to minimize energy consumption by efficient routing path
    selection and scheduling. Results show that incorporating dynamic network changes
    according to the classified workflow enhances the energy efficiency meeting SLA.
    Salman et al. [227] proposed Software-Defined Mobile Edge Computing (SD-MEC) architecture
    to reduce latency and bandwidth by combining the features of both SDN and edge
    computing. The proposed framework offers scalability by managing the distributed
    edge network with SDN controllers to incorporate network changes and developing
    new services. Wang et al. [228] presented SDN-based-Publish/Subscribe (SDNPS)
    unified framework to serve multiple IoT applications. The presented framework
    aims to reduce the latency and throughput of the network with publishers that
    publish the generated data and offer services tagged with specific event topics
    to SDN. The subscribers that require specific event services receive their desired
    services from SDN based middleware without interaction with the publisher. SDNPS
    leads to a unified, interoperable framework. Baktir et al. [229] detailed the
    limitations and challenges of cloud-edge computing with increasing data traffic
    and proposed a vision of SDN based network management strategy to decrease the
    complexity of cloud-edge architectures. Authors have highlighted several use cases,
    including multimedia data computation in IoT for face detection and revealed the
    benefits of incorporating SDNs to add scalability and reliability in the network.
    A comprehensive survey and future research direction on SDN and fog computing
    is presented by Salman et al. [45]. F. Summary and Insights In this section, the
    limitations of underlying M-IoT architectures for multimedia communication has
    been discussed. Various multimedia encoding and compression techniques to reduce
    the complexity of multimedia data transmission in IoT has been detailed in [43],
    [173]–[182]. Detection, extraction, and event processing of meaningful information
    from multimedia data has been studied in [39], [183]–[186] for efficient network
    resource utilization. The vision of cloud computing and various studies to analysis
    and process multimedia data over the Internet through remote access is present
    in [187]–[198]. Increasing network overheads and the latency due to cloud computing
    has been discussed, the concept of fog\edge computing to minimize network latency
    for real-time applications is discussed in [205]–[216]. The notion of SDNs to
    enhance the scalability and interoperability to support heterogeneous M-IoT devices
    has been explained. Various studies related to SDN based fog\edge-cloud computing
    to reduce computing latency and overheads have been presented in [31], [32], [34],
    [35], [45], [46], [46]–[170]. SDNs, not only provides reconfigurability but also
    offers a more scalable and interoperable architecture. A tabular summarization
    of this section can be seen in Table 7. SECTION VI. Routing Protocols for Multimedia
    in IoT Multimedia data exhibits stringent requirements according to diverse characteristics
    in terms of volume, variety, velocity, and value, especially for efficient bandwidth
    utilization and reliability. The deviation from Moore’s law, multimedia devices
    are now becoming smaller in size, with a decrease in cost and memory to support
    mobility [3]. The current standards and protocols, as shown in Fig. 15, consume
    a significant amount of bandwidth and energy to ensure reliability. These communication
    protocols are not optimized for low power multimedia communication. The current
    standardization activities are not focussed on multimedia communication over IoT.
    ITU defines traffic routing of mobile services in ITU-T Recommendation E.170 [230]
    as: “establishing a successful connection between two exchanges or the selection
    of path between source and sink node in the network.” An intelligent routing protocol
    is in need to select an efficient route for multimedia content transmission over
    bandwidth and memory-constrained wireless IoT network. FIGURE 15. Standards and
    protocols of three layered IoT framework [2]. Show All The scarcity of IPv4 urges
    the recommendation of IPv6 for smart IoT objects. 6LoWPAN is an IP based technology
    for Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) to bridge the gap between low-power devices
    and the IP world [231]. 6LoWPAN compresses IPv6 headers and fragmentation of large
    packets to make IPv6 suitable for resource-constrained devices [232]. International
    Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed an IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL)
    [233], [234]. RPL is now widely adopted as a promising standard with increasing
    popularity because it offers flexibility and interoperability by adopting different
    network topologies. RPL exploits key network metrics such as throughput, node
    energy, latency, hop count, and link reliability. RPL supports Point-to-Point
    (P2P), Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) and MultiPoint-to-Point (MP2P) communication
    paradigm. Kim et al. [18] provided a detailed picture of the research that has
    investigated RPL. The authors presented the distribution of research carried out
    on RPL in the context of the geographical region, operating systems, hardware
    platforms, and network metrics. A plethora of work and survey studies of the IoT
    communication protocols mentioned in Fig. 16 are present in the literature [11],
    [3], [235], [236]. In this section, we have extensively studied routing of multimedia
    content, i.e., audio, image, and video in IoT to meet the stringent requirements
    of multimedia communication in IoT while maintaining QoS and QoE with efficient
    bandwidth and energy utilization. Fig. 16 shows the classification of the existing
    works on multimedia routing in IoT. Cross-layer communication protocol for multimedia
    data routing in IoT has been discussed. Routing protocols for multimedia data
    streaming in a multicast or unicast manner to provide the required QoS has been
    extensively studied. Table 8 tabulates the performance summary and comparison
    of studies on multimedia data routing in IoT. TABLE 8 The Existing Work on M-IoT
    in Context of Multimedia Data Routing FIGURE 16. Existing work on routing protocol
    for M-IoT is classified on their capability to transmit multimedia data in single-hop
    or multi-hop or multicast manner or on the basis of QoS requirements. Show All
    A. Multimedia Data Routing in M-IoT The recent studies on routing protocols for
    M-IoT discuss the transmission of data in varied perspectives, i.e., the transmission
    of audio, image, and video streaming in the context of energy, workload balance,
    fault tolerance and delay in time [17], [237]. 1) Energy-Aware Routing Xu et al.
    [36] proposed EQRoute, an energy-aware, and QoI-aware routing algorithm. The EQRoute
    is a distributed algorithm, designed for ubiquitous multimedia transmission based
    on the information value of data and capacity of the mobile user concerning it’s
    moving speed. In the proposed model, a mobile user constructs the data collection
    tree, based on its capacity and moving speed. The route is selected based on information
    gain, which is calculated in the context of communication cost and information
    value. The aim of the proposed work to maximize information gain and reduce energy
    consumption. Energy harvesting has shifted the design paradigm from energy-aware
    to Energy-Harvesting-Aware (EHA). Nguyen et al. [238] devised the EHA Routing
    Algorithm (EHARA) based on the energy-backoff process and energy prediction process
    that defines cost metrics to select the best route. A hybrid energy harvesting
    sources are considered in the proposed work, i.e., solar panels, moving vehicle-based,
    and RF-based. The energy prediction process utilizes a Kalman filter approach
    that considers previous time step and current statistics to determine an improved
    estimation of current energy arrivals from different sources. The energy backoff
    process is proposed to extend the network lifetime by putting the nodes with minimum
    energy to sleep that are unable to perform operations until the energy level is
    recovered. The node with the highest energy level and minimum cost link based
    on Dijkstra’s shortest path is selected to route the data. Carbon Dioxide (C O
    2 ) emission is one of the vital factors affecting the network or node lifetime
    in green communication. Alvi et al. [15] proposed green-RPL routing for M-IoT
    to route the multimedia data by selecting the parent node operating on green energy
    that consumes minimum energy and delays to the sink. The objective of the green-RPL
    is to minimize carbon footprint subject to path delay, path energy, residual energy,
    and idle time. Trinh et al. in [239] presented SPIDER, a sustainable policy-based
    intelligence-driven edge routing algorithm based on MEC to detect geographical
    obstacles using DL to aid the routing engine to efficiently offload the data and
    route the priority data in an emergency for energy conservation. The proposed
    work presents a facial recognition use case in a disaster scenario. 2) Load Balancing
    Packet loss due to heavy traffic and power depletion are two main reasons for
    network congestion. Taghizadeh et al. in [240] address these problems by proposing
    Context-aware and Load balancing RPL (CLPRL). The proposed work offers Context-Aware
    Objective Function (CAOF) and Context-Aware Routing metric (CARF) to improve RPL.
    CAOF ranks the nodes for the selection of a parent node based on the residual
    power level of the node and the Expected Transmission Count (ETX). After ranking,
    CARF takes the buffer queue utilization, node rank and network traffic dynamicity
    index that indicates the utilization of link in the past, to compute the route
    during heavy traffic conditions. The authors ensure the load balancing by considering
    the number of children node with a parent from the list of candidate parent nodes
    for parent selection. It helps in load balancing even if a node is eligible to
    be a parent node, but a large number of children node can create loops and network
    congestion. 3) Fault-Tolerant The miniature multimedia sensors are equipped with
    limited battery power. The exhaustion of the battery leads to network failure.
    Lin et al. [241] proposed a fault-tolerant routing for Cluster Head based (CH)
    HetNets. The proposed scheme addresses three problems that are the pre-verifying
    the fault-tolerant capability, distributing the load and optimizing the fault-tolerant
    cost. These problems are dealt with by the sink node with a virtual CH approach
    that estimates all the traffic in the network and verifies the sustainability
    of IoT application. Virtual CH combines all the energy resources of non-failure
    CHs, estimates the size of sensed data to be transmitted and verify the capability
    of tolerance offered by non-failure CHs in the network. After which an optimal
    fault-tolerant route is determined from the flow-bipartite graph that represents
    all the possible routes between faulty and non-faulty CHs. 4) Delay-Aware Multimedia
    data poses delay-sensitive characteristics. Dropping priority and meaningful multimedia
    data packets decrease the reliability of the application. Li et al. in [242] proposed
    mobile sensing vehicles for multimedia data collection to optimize delay and delivery
    ratio (DDSV). Mobile vehicles equipped with IoT devices are exploited to deliver
    data to and from multimedia IoT devices to data centers. The proposed work addresses
    three problems in the context of multimedia data packets that are data collection
    impartiality, delivery ratio, and delay. DDSV proposes priority assignment based-upon
    distance from the data center to overcome data collection impartiality. The vehicle
    with a high probability to pass through a data center is given high priority to
    deliver high priority data packets, which will augment delivery ratio and reduces
    delay in return. Performance is evaluated in the context of delivery ratio and
    average delay for data collection. 5) Mobility Mobility is one of the key requirements
    of rapidly evolving multimedia IoT applications. However, the majority of research
    has ignored mobility. Jeong et al. in [243] proposed MAPLE, a routing architecture
    based on mobility support Asymmetric Transmit Power (ATP) for LLNs. MAPLE utilizes
    a single high power periodic beacon in the downlink from the gateway to create
    a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) gradient field network. Any low power
    node can route the data for uplink transmission in a multi-hop manner using the
    RSSI gradient values of neighboring nodes. High RSSI value indicates high proximity
    to the gateway. Each high power beacon updates the RSSI gradient metric for uplink
    routing, which addresses the mobility problem, improves reliability and reduces
    the overheads in the network. MAPLE also reduces energy consumption because of
    single high power downlink transmission using ATP architecture. B. QoS Aware Routing
    QoS-aware frameworks to route wireless multimedia data in IoT network for bandwidth-hungry
    and delay-sensitive applications have been taken into consideration. The definition
    and requirements of the QoS-aware framework have been discussed in the earlier
    section. Below is the description of some of the QoS-aware routing protocols to
    support multimedia communication in IoT. 1) Cluster-Based QoS-Aware Routing Amjad
    et al. in [244] proposed centralized energy-efficient QoS-aware and Heterogeneously
    Clustered Routing (QHCR) for delay-sensitive real-time applications. The network
    area is divided into different energy levels, and Cost Values ( C v) that are
    determined based on distance from the Base Station (BS), initial energy levels,
    number of nodes, and weights. The cluster head is elected on it’s C v. The shortest
    path to the destination is selected based on path metric that is the combination
    of the initial energy of node, ETX, and inverse ETX, cost value of cluster head
    and minimum loss with QoS as a constraint. The proposed model offers intra-cluster
    multipath communication for the nodes that are at a significant distance from
    BS. Real-time multimedia and non-real-time data are transmitted over separate
    paths to reduce end-to-end delay and conserve energy. Filho and Amazonas [245]
    devised a QoS-aware routing protocol to eliminate the need for a routing table.
    The proposed scheme is based on a Trellis Coded Network (TCNet) utilizing a Mealy
    Machine (MM) or Finite State Machine (FSM). QoS is maintained using MultiProtocol
    Label Switching (MPLS). 2) SDN Based QoS-Aware Routing Bahnasse et al. in [246]
    devised QoS-aware SDN based smart and dynamic model to allocate bandwidth (Smart
    Alloc) for MPLS Traffic Engineering DiffServ Aware (DS-TE) network. The proposed
    architecture translates the QoS requirements of an application into commands that
    indicates bandwidth and priority requirements. The SLA of each application is
    detected in terms of delay, loss rate, jitter, HTTP load time, and TCP session
    delay, and threshold values are set. Smart-alloc adaptively allocates the bandwidth
    according to the status of SLA. Sway, an SDN based QoS-aware routing protocol
    for delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive application, is presented in [247]. Sway
    exploits Yen’s K-shortest path algorithm to compute traffic-aware (delay-sensitive
    or loss-sensitive) best routing path while considering QoS requirements for each
    packet. Multi-constrained QoS metrics are considered that are the delay, packet
    loss probability, and bandwidth. Integer linear programming is utilized to solve
    a multi-constrained QoS-aware route. 3) Distributed QoS-Aware Routing Shih et
    al. [248] devised a meta routing protocol for QoS-aware architectures to select
    the optimum path between gateways of HetNets. Gateways are registered in the network
    by broadcasting messages comprising the information of all the network interfaces.
    Nodes in each network update their table with the addresses of reachable network
    gateways and interfaces. The optimum path is selected by measuring QoS metrics
    of each gateway link that is timeliness and reliability. When the QoS requirement
    is not satisfied, the meta-router will transmit data on multiple paths to achieve
    maximum QoS. C. Cross-Layer Protocols for Multimedia Routing Rani et al. [37]
    proposed a cross-layer protocol to minimize energy consumption and response time.
    The authors formulated a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the
    end-to-end packet error rate, time, and energy. These parameters are interlinked
    and dependant on cross-layer parameters such as path loss, modulation scheme,
    BER, transmission power, ARQ, duty cycling, and network routing protocol. The
    optimization of these parameters requires cross-layer communication and coordination.
    Authors exploit the Minimum Energy consumption Chain-Based Cluster Coordination
    Algorithm (ME-CBCCP) presented in [249], which finds the shortest path not only
    at the local cluster level but also takes the intercluster path into consideration.
    Bennis et al. [33] devised Efficient Queuing Multimedia (EQM), a cross-layer communication
    protocol for transmitting multimedia data over wireless networks. A carrier sense
    aware disjoint multipath routing protocol is presented to transmit high priority
    independent video frames by reserving 2-hops neighbor nodes for video frames.
    The routing layer coordinates with the MAC layer to be aware of priority video
    data. An enqueuing and dequeuing approach is presented to process high priority
    multimedia data first and scalar data at the last of the queue. The proposed work
    aims to reduce waiting for the time and energy consumption of wireless networks.
    Rosario et al. [250] proposed LinGO, QoE aware link quality and geographical beaconless
    opportunistic routing protocol for video transmission in IoT. Forwarding node
    selection and routing path are determined according to cross-layer parameters
    that are: 1) link quality indicator classified by packet reception ratio, 2) progress
    which is the Euclidian distance between forwarding node to the destination, 3)
    energy of the forwarding node. The proposed model increases the reliability by
    adding redundancy packets for high priority video packets which improve QoE. Devi
    et al. [38] proposed an agent-based cross-layer protocol for optimal path selection
    and reducing end-to-end delay to transmit important multimedia data with minimum
    latency. The proposed model exploits the agents to transmit the data when the
    channel consumes more time than a threshold time. Hassan et al. [251] presented
    a cross-layer framework to ensure QoS satisfaction. A channel access mechanism
    based on queuing model M/M/1 is formulated for the duty cycle to handle the packets
    of real-time applications. The impact of multi-hop communication is analyzed using
    PHY-MAC parameters that are transmission power, hop distance, path loss, and packet
    error ratio (PER) for adaptive switching between end-to-end transmission or hop-by-hop
    transmission scheme. D. Multicast and Hop-Count Based Routing Routing protocols
    for multimedia bandwidth-hungry and real-time applications of M-IoT have been
    designed based on multicast and hop-count metric [252]. A detailed survey on multipath
    routing protocols of M-IoT to ensure QoS parameters has been presented in [19].
    Below-mentioned are few studies in the context of multicast and multi-hop routing
    protocols of M-IoT. 1) Multicast Routing Multimedia real-time critical applications
    require the network to guarantee multiple QoS metrics that are maximum throughput,
    minimum delay, and minimum PLR. Multimedia communication requires multicast routing
    with minimum end-to-end latency for delay-sensitive health applications. A Fast
    Multiconstrained Multicast Routing Algorithm (FAMOUS) is proposed in [14]. The
    proposed routing scheme is based on Shortest Path Algorithm (SPT) and Minimum
    Steiner Tree (MST) algorithm. Authors exploit entropy-based weight aggregation
    to reduce multicriteria decision problems into a single criterion problem. The
    objective of FAMOUS is to determine the shortest path and optimal multicast tree
    from source to destination for better accuracy and speed. Aswale and Ghorpade
    in [253] presented Energy and ETX Aware Multipath Geographic Routing (EEMGR) protocol.
    ETX is a link quality metric that estimates the number of transmissions required
    to deliver a packet from source to destination successfully. EEMGR exploits ETX,
    node remaining energy and distance between a node to sink to determine the optimal
    path for reliable and energy-efficient multimedia routing. Performance comparison
    is made with the Two-Phase Geographic Greedy Forwarding (TPGF) algorithm. 2) Multi-Hop
    Routing The real-time multimedia applications demand a probability of zero percent
    delay violation. A cooperative relaying model incorporating Cognitive M2M Network
    (CM2MN) is proposed in [254] for effective end-to-end QoS. Probabilistic forwarding
    protocol (PFP) based on a network-aware routing algorithm for multi-hop routing
    is presented. Cooperative Quality Controller (CQC) is formulated to guarantee
    QoS requirements. The opportunistic relay selection as a routing extension is
    based on the M/M/1 queueing model with First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) strategy.
    Chen et al. [255] presented Multipath Planning for the Single source (MPSS) and
    Multiple Sources (MPMS) for multimedia transmission in IoT. The proposed work
    is based on B-spline trajectories. MPSS comprises two units that are the calculation
    of the hop count module, which determines the number of hops required to satisfy
    QoS delay and energy-saving module that determines the minimum power required
    to deliver the data successfully. Utilizing spline trajectories, the source can
    determine the direction of next-hop by integrating parametric functions for geographical
    routing. The aim is to determine multiple paths that satisfy QoS with minimum
    energy consumption. The optimum path with the least energy consumption is selected.
    The performance of the system is evaluated based on end-to-end delay and energy
    consumption. Chen et al. in [256] devised a Trusted Connectivity Probability (TCP)
    based D2D relay selection model for routing data in a multi-hop manner. A ranking
    model is adapted to select the next-hop node with the highest rank. Rank is allotted
    based on Trust Probability (TP) that depends on the geographical distance between
    the current and next-hop nodes. An optimization problem is formed to select the
    optimal route with maximum TCP. The problem is solved with the help of the Dijkstra
    algorithm that determines the TCP value from a source node to all the nodes in
    the network. The model offers the D2D communication in both Channel State Information
    (CSI) aware and unknown condition to calculate the minimum power required to transmit
    between D2D device and BS. E. Summary and Insights In this section, routing protocols
    for M-IoT has been discussed. The existing research presents the routing protocols
    from the perspective of energy-awareness, load balancing, fault tolerance, mobility,
    delay awareness [257]. QoS–aware routing [258] for multimedia data is investigated
    and presented in [244]–[248]. Cross-layer protocols to improve routing strategies
    in terms of energy, delay, throughput, and reliability [259] have been presented
    in [37], [33], [249]–[251]. Challenges and issues in multicasting [260] and hop-count
    based routing schemes have been discussed in [252]–[256]. However, to support
    multimedia bandwidth-hungry and delay-sensitive applications, cross-layer and
    energy-aware protocols need to be explored in detail. The existing studies on
    multimedia routing protocols do not consider efficient bandwidth utilization and
    fault tolerance. Lightweight and energy efficient ML algorithms like reinforcement
    learning, Q-learning, Epsilon greedy are yet to be investigated for latency reduction
    and improve power conservation for multimedia routing in IoT. Table 8 presents
    a detailed overview of this section, classifying each study and highlighting it’s
    key features. SECTION VII. PHY-MAC Protocols for M-IoT The network protocol stack
    of the IoT architecture rests on the joint PHY-MAC layer as depicted in Fig. 16.
    The protocols under this layer, feature low power operations and guarantee a stringent
    QoS compliant performance. The discussion of the M-IoT applications in the preceding
    sections indicates a general guideline for the design of the PHY-MAC protocols.
    These guidelines include an ability to manage a dense, as well as a sparse network,
    with a small network overhead, over a wide range and with a low energy requirement
    [261]. The applicability of M-IoT in the wide range of applications like industrial
    monitoring, healthcare, security, and smart services in smart city applications
    implies that there are multiple QoS and QoE parameters for each application. Additionally,
    the heterogeneity of the devices in the network creates a set of challenges in
    terms of interoperability. That results in a need for application-oriented data
    transformations at the network gateway [262]. Therefore, the PHY-MAC layer for
    each application is designed to fulfill these QoS and QoE parameters. This section
    discusses the different MAC-PHY standards and protocols designed for specific
    applications. The major standard in use today is the IEEE 802.15.4 that covers
    the physical layer specifications for the global application. It forms the basis
    of the ZigBee standard that is usually used in the smart living IoT scenarios.
    Additionally, the IEEE 802.15.6 standard is defined for the healthcare scenarios.
    The other standards used for specific application cases are BLE, Long Range Wide
    Area Network (LoRaWAN), NB-IoT, and Near Field Communication (NFC). These provide
    the physical layer as well as MAC specifications for the M-IoT networks. The IEEE
    802.15.4 family of Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs) was first
    approved in 2003 [263]. Since then, several amendments have been made to the standard.
    There have been numerous region-specific amendments as well as application-specific
    amendments in the 2003 approved standard. The features of the PHY-MAC standards,
    along with the amendments, are tabulated in Table 9. This standard supports both,
    a star topology as well as a peer-to-peer topology. The MAC layer resides above
    the PHY layer in the OSI model and provides an interface between the PHY and the
    higher layers [263], [264]. The MAC specifications for the IEEE 802.15.4 (2003
    release) envisages the use of a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collison Avoidance
    (CSMA/CA) mechanism for Channel Access. The CSMA/CA supports the beaconed mode
    as well as the non-beaconed mode [265], [266]. The CSMA/CA mechanism for this
    standard and the IEEE 802.11 differs due to the absence of a request to send/clear
    to send (RTS/CTS) frame exchange in the IEEE 802.15.4 family. TABLE 9 Description
    of PHY-MAC Standards and Amendments Additionally, in the IEEE 802.15.4a-2007 amendment,
    the ALOHA is used for the channel access for the Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) [267].
    The 802.15.4 standard serves as the PHY-MAC standard for a large range of applications
    which requires a unique approach to each problem such as in industrial systems.
    Additional applications include multimedia surveillance, traffic management, advanced
    healthcare, and environmental monitoring [268]. Therefore, the focus of this section
    remains the IEEE 802.15.4 standard as most of the M-IoT scenarios are operated
    by this standard. The application-oriented PHY-MAC approaches are discussed under
    the following sub-headings. A. Existing Work on M-IoT Applications in the Context
    of PHY-MAC Protocols 1) Industrial Applications The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has
    been identified as a suitable technology for industrial applications owing to
    the features it offers in this domain such as support for a peer-to-peer topology
    and beaconing in the MAC protocol. The different beacon intervals for the IEEE
    802.15.4 superframes leads to a scheduling problem in the network. Toscano and
    Bello [269] present a solution for the scheduling problems in the multichannel
    networks. The key concept underlying the Multichannel Superframe Scheduling (MSS)
    algorithm is utilizing the maximum superframe duration to determine the length
    of the timeslice and to schedule all the superframes within the same timeslice
    on different channels [269]. The experimental results reveal the beacons are perfectly
    aligned, and through the tracking of the parents, the synchronization is maintained.
    This is not feasible in the time-division approach. Chen et al. [270] present
    a case for the use of IEEE 802.15.4 in the industrial scenario. The experimental
    evaluation of the standard is carried out in the OMNET++/INET framework that tests
    the large scale deployment of the nodes in an industrial setup. The node energy
    efficiency and the goodput support the argument for industrial applications. The
    Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) approach is used with the Guaranteed Time
    Slot (GTS) that enhances reliability. The authors in [271] also propose a GTS
    based real-time messaging service in the industrial environment. Kim et al. in
    [272] allow a periodic synchronization of the node network clocks using Enhanced
    Beacons (EBs). The synchronization allows efficient scheduling in the proposed
    Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TISH) mode. The overall result is the reduction
    in energy consumption and traffic collisions compliant with industrial standards.
    2) Healthcare Applications Healthcare is one of the most important applications
    of M-IoT. The PHY-MAC layer for the healthcare applications is designed taking
    under consideration, the QoS parameters like low latency and high data integrity
    [273]. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has been successfully used for healthcare applications.
    However, a new standard from IEEE 802.15.6 was approved in 2012 for wireless body
    area networks (WBANs). The IEEE 802.15.4 supports a large range for monitoring
    the complete health status of the user. One of the primary concerns with regards
    to the healthcare applications in the M-IoT scenario is prolonging the lifetime
    of the nodes. The nodes may be surgically implanted. Thus, it becomes imperative
    that the nodes have a large battery lifetime to prolong its use without causing
    inconvenience to the user. Fahmi et al. [274] provide a fuzzy logic-based sleep
    scheduling algorithm. This algorithm aims at optimizing the sleep schedule of
    the nodes and introducing an adaptive sleeping mechanism. The fuzzy logic uses
    an inference table that has a set of 81 rules to govern the sleeping times. The
    energy savings are significant, which are reflected in the experimental results.
    An intrinsic challenge faced by wireless networks is that of coexistence with
    multiple wireless networks. The WBAN based M-IoT networks also face a similar
    challenge, particularly in the IEEE 802.15.4 network. Deylami and Deylami [275]
    have presented an evaluation of the coexisting IEEE 802.15.4 based networks for
    health monitoring applications. The coexistence of multiple networks results in
    loss of data that may be critical, especially in the time divided slot approach
    and GTS based mechanisms. Therefore, a dynamic mechanism for resynchronizing the
    network clock according to the network coordinator is required. To evaluate the
    security of the network by analyzing the efficient usage of the bandwidth, authors
    in [276] foresee an exploitation attack on the contention period during the MAC
    layer operation. The mechanism to remedy the problem is required to enhance the
    reliability of the system, which is the paramount QoS parameter. This includes
    an intelligent backoff mechanism that offers a fair chance during the Contention
    Access Period (CAP). 3) Multimedia Content Streaming Including Surveillance The
    development of the advanced and cost-efficient Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor
    (CMOS) sensors has led to the widespread growth of visual and audio content across
    many platforms. Its impact is profound in the IoT domain as well and has led to
    the development of the Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) [277]. These
    WMSNs have found their application in surveillance and telemedicine. The constraints
    these networks face are in terms of computing power, energy supply, and memory.
    Additionally, they struggle with limited channel bandwidth and variable capacity.
    Lin et al. [278] propose a system to mitigate the challenges of the limited network
    capabilities in the multimedia framework. This involves a dynamic scheme to adjust
    the beaconing interval and the superframe duration. This dynamic approach helps
    in the network synchronization and efficient scheduling, thus, resulting in enhanced
    transmission efficiency. The proposed method is effective for a dynamic data load,
    as well. Pham et al. [279] have presented an evaluation of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    for the image transmission applications real deployment scenarios. The evaluation
    is a representative of the Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)
    and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) based boards for surveillance. The authors
    present a compression scheme for Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format
    image data as well as a block interleaving scheme that enhances the reconstructive
    accuracy after encoding the images. The authors identify the possible bottlenecks
    that induce higher latency. 4) Military Applications Mendes et al. [280] propose
    a cross-layer and cross standard methodology for an improved surveillance system
    in a military application. The proposed method involves support for the multimedia
    sensors as well as auxiliary sensors for improved enemy movement detection. The
    proposed method involves the superframe synchronization for improved transmission
    reliability by allowing cross-standard compatibility between the IEEE 802.15.4
    and IEEE 802.15.3 standard. The reliability is the key performance indicator for
    the applications. 5) Precision Agriculture The implications of M-IoT in the agricultural
    field are immense. The data rates for the various metrics that are sensed vary
    greatly amongst each other. Additionally, the priority of each data is different,
    so the channel access mechanism has to adapt accordingly. Kone et al. [281] propose
    a fine-tuned MAC layer for precision agricultural applications in the IEEE 802.15.4
    standard. Precision agriculture is closely monitored and controlled agricultural
    practice. The proposed method involves the selection of optimal values for the
    sampling frequency based on the recorded parameter. Additionally, the MAC parameters
    like the minimum value of the backoff exponent as well as the maximum number of
    backoffs. The proposed method demonstrates the increased sampling frequency for
    applications that require higher resolution, thus, improving the granularity.
    B. ZigBee Standard ZigBee is another standard that is used in the M-IoT scenario.
    It is particularly utilized in the consumer electronics sphere for home automation.
    However, the ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 can be used interoperably. Some applications
    with higher security requirements utilize ZigBee while coexisting with the IEEE
    802.15.4 standard. Han and Lim [282] explore such a scenario. The authors present
    a planned overview of automated systems for efficiently deploying smart living
    systems. C. IEEE 802.11 Standard Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
    created the first standard for Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). The standards
    in the IEEE 802.11 family are also known as Wi-Fi. These standards provide PHY
    and MAC protocols for M-IoT devices. The key characteristics of this standard
    can be seen in Table 9. From the day first, WLANs have been facing the challenge
    of efficient MAC layer resource allocation while accessing the channel [283].
    CSMA/CA is one of the popular collision avoidance mechanisms used by the MAC layer.
    In CSMA/CA, a randomized backoff mechanism is performed by the devices before
    accessing the channel resources. However, a blind exponential increase and reset
    of contention values in this backoff mechanism induce performance degradation.
    Ali et al. proposed solutions in [284]–[286] to tackle the blindness of currently
    implemented CSMA/CA. Their proposed channel observation-based mechanisms adaptively
    increase and decrease the contention parameters. Besides, ML-based techniques
    have been playing a vital role in the performance optimization of MAC layer resource
    allocation mechanisms [287]. Such ML-enabled techniques are also utilized for
    other low-power energy-constrained networks of IoT applications, such as smart
    healthcare systems [288]. In the context of M-IoT, an ML-enabled distributed channel
    access (MEDCA) mechanism is proposed in [289]. The proposed MEDCA mechanism utilizes
    Q learning algorithm to optimize the performance of channel access in multimedia-based
    WLANS (that is IEEE 802.11e). D. Narrow-Band IoT NB-IoT is one of the Low Power
    Wide Area (LPWA) technologies released by the 3rd Generation Partnership (3GPP).
    It is designed for heterogeneous IoT devices to achieve improved spectrum efficiency,
    extended, and in-depth coverage. The key feature of NB-IoT is that it can be directly
    deployed in the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) or LTE spectrum [290].
    However, the NB-IoT device has to continuously monitor the data transmission channel
    for service announcements and updates that waste energy resources. Tsoukaneri
    et al. [291] present an NB-IoT communication approach that dynamically creates
    a group of devices that are subscribed to receive multimedia services in a multicast
    transmission. To enhance the coverage area, the repetition of control and data
    transmission signals has been considered. The Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM)
    scheme and repetition numbers are in need of link adaption for NB-IoT systems.
    However, traditional link adaption techniques without repetition numbers are not
    applicable to NB-IoT systems. Yu et al. [292] proposed an inner loop and outer
    loop link adaption that copes with block error ratio and coordination between
    ACM and repetition numbers. The direct communication link between user and BS
    usually does not satisfy QoS for transmitting vital data. Li et al. [64] exploit
    D2D communication as an opportunistic communication with improved link quality
    to upload critical data to BS. The proposed optimization aims to improve end-to-end
    delay and packet delivery ratio. NB-IoT is an emerging technology that yet needs
    to be explored in-depth for deployment. E. Bluetooth Low Energy BLE is also known
    as Bluetooth Smart was introduced in Bluetooth 4.0. BLE is a short-range PHY-MAC
    communication protocol for low power battery operated devices [293]. BLE is mostly
    used for scalar parametric monitoring applications. Multimedia communication using
    BLE has not been yet investigated in-depth in IoT, as BLE is only suitable for
    a small chunk of data. Gentili et al. [24] proposed BlueVoice, an application
    for voice communication over BLE. However, results in the proposed study have
    not been compared with other PHY-MAC protocols. F. Long Range Wide Area Network
    LoRaWAN developed by LoRa Alliance is another LPWA communication standard that
    provides PHY-MAC protocol for IoT applications. LoRaWAN utilizes LoRa modulation
    based on Chrip Spread Spectrum (CSS) and ALOHA medium access mechanism. To the
    best of our knowledge, no substantial work has been done in M-IoT exploiting LoRaWAN.
    G. Summary and Insights The PHY-MAC layer is responsible for the resource allocation
    and management of hardware and networking resources. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    is the most widely utilized standard for the M-IoT deployment. The various authors
    present solutions for improving reliability and reducing the delay by synchronizing
    the network clocks periodically. The MAC protocols are modified according to the
    application QoS. Various proposed work on PHY-MAC protocols mentioned in Table
    9 has been presented in this section. ML and DL based resource allocation and
    management techniques are yet to be explored for M-IoT applications. Security
    is another critical challenge in the wireless medium. Efficient authentication,
    authorization, and validation technique are required for critical M-IoT. Table
    10 classifies and summarizes this section. TABLE 10 Existing Work on PHY-MAC Protocols
    for M-IoT Applications SECTION VIII. Future Research Directions In spite of the
    plethora of research activities and incredible progress in recent years, M-IoT
    still possesses many open issues that are still waiting to be resolved. The main
    goal of M-IoT includes carrying out multimedia communication with maximum QoE
    in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, and extending network lifetime
    while minimizing energy expenditure and preventing connectivity degradation. These
    goals can be achieved by employing efficient data aggregation, interoperable and
    scalable architecture, efficient feature extraction, intelligent routing, and
    adaptive MAC protocols, and managing energy while maximizing computing. Additionally,
    there are restrictions on IoT devices to be miniscule with the capability of mobility
    and multiple communication interfaces. Therefore, there are extensive research
    issues that should further be explored in the field of M-IoT. Fig. 17 depicts
    the major areas that demand novel contributions and innovations. In this section,
    a wide range of research issues are delineated for future exploration. FIGURE
    17. Overview of the open issues, challenges, and future research directions for
    M-IoT systems. Show All A. Interoperable and Scalable Architecture M-IoT requires
    redefined efficient network architecture to offer scalability and interoperability
    for multiple multimedia heterogeneous devices while considering the spectrum scarcity
    and limited power resources. SDN based middleware is extensively studied with
    regard to software-defined IoT architectures [294], [295]. SDNs addresses the
    hardware and reconfigurability limitations of IoT devices [296]. Publish/subscribe
    is a communication mechanism for distributed IoT systems [297], [298]. In the
    publish/subscribe model, the user does not have to be in direct contact with the
    service provider. Software-defined publish/subscribe based agents for M-IoT architecture
    offers new opportunities to add scalability and interoperability in the network
    [299]. However, no dedicated work has been done to devise SDN based publish/subscribe
    M-IoT architecture. There is a need to explore SDNs in the context of standardizing
    M-IoT architecture. B. Feature Extraction Multimedia devices generate a huge amount
    of data that comprise structured and unstructured data. The processing of such
    amount of unstructured data over an energy-constrained network requires the transmission
    of only meaningful information. An Intelligent feature extraction mechanism is
    required to identify and classify multimedia data with minimum energy consumption
    [300], [301]. DL addresses the limitations of ML to process a huge amount of data
    [302]. DL offers proficient multimedia feature extraction models [303], [304].
    Extracting semantic from multimedia data could transform unstructured data into
    structured, indexed data for efficient processing [305]. Implementing DL over
    SDNs and adding semantics to multimedia data are yet to be explored for intelligent
    multimedia feature extractions. C. Data Prioritization Prioritizing multimedia
    data addresses a lot of issues related to energy [306], scheduling [307], video
    streaming [308], memory [309], improving PLR, enhancing QoS [310], security [311],
    and reduce network latency [312]. A large number of M-IoT applications mentioned
    in the previous sections are real-time delay-sensitive that require multimedia
    data prioritization. Multimedia applications require ubiquitous transmission for
    which AI-based data classification and priority optimization in M-IoT should be
    extensively studied concerning the requirements of the application. D. Event Processing
    Events are defined as real-world occurrences that reveal over space and time.
    A huge volume of event content is being captured in multimedia, of which YouTube
    videos, TV shows, and animations cover 60% of the Internet traffic [313]. The
    tremendous increase in real-life events captured in multimedia requires event
    analysis to associate metadata with events for efficient query processing. Event
    detection [314], feature representation [315], and adding semantics [316], is
    known as event mining [317]. An intelligent event mining in audio, videos, and
    images are required in M-IoT for efficient resource utilization to process the
    required service with minimum delay. E. Compression and Encoding/Decoding Techniques
    for M-IoT M-IoT necessitates compression techniques to become more vigorous with
    low complexity and to produce low bandwidth output while adhering to limited network
    and spectrum resources. Compression techniques are extensively studied in the
    context of multimedia transmission over wireless networks in [318], [319]. However,
    no enthusiastic work has been done on compression or encoding techniques for the
    transmission of multimedia data over the M-IoT network. There is a need to explore
    the coding methodologies related to multimedia services in M-IoT while considering
    the power and interface constraints. F. Computation Related Issues The difference
    between multimedia data and scalar data has been shown in Table 1. Processing
    and analysis of such high power consumption, and processing data requires efficient
    computing models for minimizing the network overheads and energy consumptions
    [320]. Multimedia processing is dependant on multiple factors, i.e., feature extraction,
    prioritization, network coding, compression, efficient routing, and MAC protocols.
    The limitation of cloud computing and compensation offered by Fog/Edge computing
    is detailed in the previous sections [321]. However, minimal work has been performed
    in SDNs as multimedia computing in IoT. Due to the diverse nature of multimedia
    applications, applications dependent software-defined computing architectures
    are required to offer interoperability in HetNets. To increase network throughput
    with minimum energy utilization, the intelligent transmission of only meaningful
    information to cloud and fog/edge is required for processing. G. QoE Related Research
    Direction User satisfaction of multimedia content in M-IoT is measured by exploiting
    QoE subjective metrics. Recent studies of QoE evaluation for M-IoT applications
    are conducted with primary QoE metrics that are packet loss, MOS, DMOS, and user
    satisfaction. Other QoE metrics such as buffering time, data rate, interruption
    time, and failure rate should also be used for evaluation of M-IoT (as discussed
    in [322]). Most of the work on M-IoT considers network performance metrics (QoS
    metrics) that are jitter, end-to-end delay, bit error rate, and frame loss. Both
    QoS and QoE metrics should be jointly evaluated to achieve better multimedia quality
    and network services [323]. H. Security and Privacy The transmission of bandwidth-hungry
    and delay-sensitive multimedia applications over the scares spectrum requires
    protection from eavesdroppers and threats. Confidential industrial and health
    multimedia data needs P2P, MP2P, and P2MP encryption. Very partial research has
    been conducted on securing multimedia transmission over the IoT network [324],
    [325]. There are several threats that compromise the user’s data and privacy [58].
    New approaches should be adopted to secure the network from any attack. Multimedia
    is content-based data [75]. However, content-aware secure transmission of multimedia
    data over M-IoT has not been studied. The authentic distribution of multimedia
    content is also required to verify legal copyrights. The miniature M-IoT devices
    are computational and energy-constrained. Thus, lightweight data cryptography
    is required for secure communication. AI offers to secure multimedia data at the
    cost of high power consumption due to complex algorithms, that are not feasible
    to implement on IoT devices [326], [327]. Fog/Edge enables IoT devices to perform
    computationally better and faster. Fog/Edge offers to implement blockchain-based
    secure and transparent systems [328], [329]. However, security issues related
    to multimedia data has not been explored in detail. I. Energy-Aware and Green
    Communication Energy is a scarce resource. Bandwidth and power-hungry multimedia
    applications require vast energy resources for their transmission. Thus, to transmit
    multimedia data over IoT, energy-aware and energy harvesting methods need to be
    explored. There are many energy harvesting solutions for harvesting energy from
    the environment. These solutions can assist in prolonging network life and promoting
    green communication [330]. SDNs provide a better softwarization and virtualization
    approach to manage hybrid energy resources in future communication networks [331].
    To the best of our knowledge, SDNs are not studied for energy harvesting approaches
    to transmit multimedia content over the IoT network. J. Routing and MAC Related
    Issues The routing and MAC layer protocols for M-IoT exploit QoS metrics to make
    their routing or medium access decisions. Cross-layer protocols provide multi-layer
    metrics for better decisions to select route and access medium for multimedia
    data in a wireless network [332], [333]. Cross-layer metrics evaluation for user
    satisfaction of multimedia data (QoE) has not been thoroughly explored [334].
    Selecting route and medium by evaluating cross-layer and mapping them with the
    user’s QoE will enhance the performance and lifetime of the M-IoT network. D2D
    communication provides an efficient routing and medium access extension for the
    delivery of multimedia content in a smart city [335]–[337]. Due to bandwidth scarcity
    and delay the urgency of multimedia data, D2D supports a proficient mechanism
    to reduce PLR, latency, and power consumption [338]. D2D communication as a routing
    and medium extension can be investigated for M-IoT. Lightweight ML algorithms
    like reinforcement learning do not consume a significant amount of energy. IoT
    devices equipped with these ML approaches for efficient route and medium selection.
    DL learning algorithms could be implemented on edge devices to extract multimedia
    features and map them with routing and MAC metrics to achieve better user’s QoE
    of multimedia content in IoT. To the best of our knowledge, no substantial amount
    of work has been proposed in this domain. K. Multimedia Applications and Smart
    City M-IoT applications support a wide variety of applications, assisting in building
    a smart city by providing varied networks and architectures [339], [340]. These
    applications contribute a major portion in the industry, agriculture, road management
    systems, and security (as discussed comprehensively in section III). However,
    work to secure and authenticate voice assistant systems has not been studied.
    The collaboration of these applications in the smart city requires integration
    in 5G. The integration of M-IoT has not been studied significantly. L. 5G and
    Beyond 5G The future 5G of wireless cellular communication is expected to lay
    the basis of an intelligent network for multimedia communication in smart cities.
    Massive Mulitple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems for spectral efficiency
    [341], Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) for multimedia broadcast services
    [157], [342], micro and femtocells to increase cellular capacity, Ultra-Reliable
    Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) to achieve low latency for multimedia applications
    [343], [344], and NB-IoT for machine type communication are few solutions to achieve
    objectives of 5G [345]. However, a fully intelligent on-demand self-reconfigurable
    network to enhance many folds in the services and performance will be released
    in Beyond 5G (B5G). ML, DL, Quantum Computing (QC), and Quantum ML (QML) are considered
    as a core enabler of Sixth Generation (6G) or B5G [346]. Gigahertz (GHz) and Terahertz
    (THz) frequencies provide solutions to bandwidth scarcity and high date rates
    to deliver multimedia content [347]. All these areas are yet to investigate and
    explored for integrating M-IoT with 5G and 6G. M. Augmented and Virtual Reality
    in M-IoT Multimedia Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in IoT will
    reveal many hidden and open the close doors for humanity [348]. 5G and B5G will
    enable user-friendly wireless AR and VR interfaces. AR and VR in M-IoT will revolutionize
    the health, industrial, and education sector [349]. It could be helpful for several
    patients suffering from immutable diseases, education and training, guidance and
    assistance, construction and architecture, and games. In brief, it could expedite
    the development of the smart city [350]. To achieve the development of a smart
    city, the requirements of end-user should be known, preferred, and satisfied by
    the interaction of end-user, telecommunication industry, content developers, and
    research scientists. N. Tactile Internet Certain real-time application areas of
    M-IoT such as robotic surgery, remote physical interaction, teleoperation, automation
    industry, and AR/VR require even minor tactile sensing information that occurs
    due to the interaction between the application and the environment [344]. IEEE
    recently launched activities to standardize tactile Internet (IEEE P1918.1) [351].
    The requirements of tactile information are ultra-low latency in milliseconds.
    URLLC seems to satisfy these requirements. There are a lot of research areas from
    the perspective of the tactile Internet that is yet to be studied in detail. Compression
    of tactile information, intelligent and scalable network traffic engineering for
    audio and video, and edge caching and computing for AR/VR has received very little
    attention [352]–[354]. Efficient routing and MAC protocols for tactile information
    are in need. O. Molecular Communication The ability to integrate all the five
    sensory features of humans that are olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile
    (touch), ocular (sight), and hearing (audio) in information and transmit is known
    as Human Bond Communication (HBC) [355]. In humans, the exchange of information
    is based on the synthesis, transformation, emission, propagation, and reception
    of molecules through biochemical and physical processes. In telecommunication
    engineering, this information exchange is classified as molecular communication
    [356]. With the emergence of NanoThings, molecular communication is the key research
    areas to revolutionize M-IoT [357]. SECTION IX. Conclusion The evolving Multimedia
    Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) has promoted several innovative applications, aiming
    to improve the quality of life by connecting numerous smart devices through emerging
    enabling technologies. Multimedia communication in IoT can support countless applications.
    The objective of this survey is to highlight the overview of M-IoT and the importance
    of M-IoT applications. The main issues while designing M-IoT architectures, protocols,
    and computing approaches are explored to provide stable IoT architecture to support
    maximum QoE. However, it is challenging to achieve because of constraints imposed
    by multimedia content, which distinguish it from traditional IoT. Various application-use
    cases were presented to illustrate how M-IoT can revolutionize the world. Various
    requirements and proposed solutions on Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for M-IoT on
    their subjective and objective-based metrics have been presented. Moreover, the
    relation between multimedia content, cloud computing, big data analytics, event
    processing, fog/edge computing, multimedia data coding, feature extraction, and
    SDNs have been discussed. Also, this article provides a comprehensive survey of
    various routing and Medium Access Control protocols (MAC) used for M-IoT. Finally,
    this article points out the open and potential research areas that need to be
    solved in future M-IoT systems. This article should deliver a sound basis for
    researchers to understand issues and challenges in M-IoT. Authors Figures References

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\

    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    Camera\n3.2. Vegetation Indices\nUsing multi-spectral images from the remote sensors\
    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n19 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\nFigure 6. (A) Correlation b/wair temperature\
    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    \a\nAbstract: The growing need for food worldwide requires the development of\
    \ a high-performance,\nhigh-productivity, and sustainable agriculture, which implies\
    \ the introduction of new technologies\ninto monitoring activities related to\
    \ control and decision-making. In this regard, this paper presents\na hierarchical\
    \ structure based on the collaboration between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\n\
    and federated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for crop monitoring in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nThe integration of UAVs with intelligent, ground WSNs, and IoT\
    \ proved to be a robust and\neﬃcient solution for data collection, control, analysis,\
    \ and decisions in such specialized applications.\nKey advantages lay in online\
    \ data collection and relaying to a central monitoring point, while\neﬀectively\
    \ managing network load and latency through optimized UAV trajectories and in\
    \ situ\ndata processing. Two important aspects of the collaboration were considered:\
    \ designing the UAV\ntrajectories for eﬃcient data collection and implementing\
    \ eﬀective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate approximation)\
    \ at the network level for the transmission of the\nrelevant data. The experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where diﬀerent\ncrops and\
    \ methods are developed. The results demonstrate that the collaborative UAV–WSN–IoT\n\
    approach increases the performances in both precision agriculture and ecological\
    \ agriculture.\nKeywords: unmanned aerial vehicles; wireless sensor networks;\
    \ intelligent data processing; trajectory\nplanning; relevant data extraction;\
    \ data consensus; Internet of Things; precision agriculture\n1. Introduction\n\
    The need for high-performance, high-productivity, and sustainable agriculture\
    \ results from the\nrapid growth of the human population. This requires permanent\
    \ monitoring and intelligent processing\nof the measured data collected from the\
    \ ﬁeld, correlated with the weather forecasts, to produce\nagronomic recommendations.\
    \ In the last few years, new technologies in agriculture, and especially in\n\
    precision agriculture (PA), have been leveraged for increased productivity and\
    \ eﬃcient input dosage [1].\nMost importantly, in PA, farmers need to know exact\
    \ and timely details about crop status. These details\nabout certain parameters,\
    \ obtained by measurements both from the ground and in the air, constitute\ninput\
    \ data to specialized systems of process management in the PA. Some relevant examples\
    \ might\ninclude for example, irrigation control, pesticide dosage, pest control,\
    \ etc. For acquisition and complex\nprocessing of the collected data, integration\
    \ of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) under\
    \ novel frameworks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), has been shown to\n\
    contribute to increases in agricultural yields [2]. Such advanced systems are\
    \ modeled as well-speciﬁed\nSensors 2020, 20, 817; doi:10.3390/s20030817\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 817\n2 of 25\nagent-based solutions with sensors and UAVs. Although\
    \ the contributions of UAVs and WSNs, taken\nseparately, are well documented and\
    \ important in the sustainable growth of agricultural production,\nthe integration\
    \ of these components together within an IoT framework is expected to signiﬁcantly\n\
    improve the solutions for monitoring, production modeling, prediction, and decision-making.\n\
    Relevant applications of UAV–WSN systems are presented in Reference [3–6]. In\
    \ viticulture,\nas a special type of PA, the soil and air parameters modify grape\
    \ yield and quality. For this purpose,\na solution based on the collaborative\
    \ system mini UAV (quadrotor type)–WSNs to monitor parameters,\nlike temperature\
    \ and humidity, to prevent the frost in fragmented vineyards is proposed in Reference\
    \ [3].\nThe UAV is considered as communication relay between sensors and a base\
    \ station. A real application\nfor monitoring sensitive parameters in vineyards\
    \ with both agro-meteorological stations and UAV\nplatforms is presented in Reference\
    \ [4]. In order to obtain a precise monitoring of the speciﬁc indicators,\nthe\
    \ data from the ground are correlated with the data collected by a UAV platform\
    \ with 8 rotors\nprovided with a professional thermal camera. The study was conducted\
    \ over a period of two years.\nFor data acquisition on large areas, a ﬁxed wing\
    \ type UAV, used as data mule from the ground WSN,\nis proposed in Reference [5].\
    \ In addition, the UAV has attached an high deﬁnition (HD) camera for the\ndetection\
    \ of certain plant diseases. Experimentally, a small tank has been added to spray\
    \ diﬀerent\ninsecticides, fertilizers, herbicides, etc. Both UAV and WSN are low\
    \ cost and not robust for only\ndemonstration purposes. In addition, in Reference\
    \ [6], a low cost agro-meteorological monitoring\nsystem in a vineyard was designed\
    \ and developed. The optimal positioning of the sensors was made\nwith the help\
    \ of the multispectral image analysis, acquired by UAV.\nGiven recent evolutions\
    \ in UAV technologies, cost reduction, and new regulations of aviation\nauthorities\
    \ regarding the usage and deployment of such systems (e.g., European Aviation\
    \ Safety\nAgency (EASA) [7] and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [8]), such\
    \ aerial robotic platforms\nare increasingly used in agriculture for diﬀerent\
    \ tasks, the most important being crop monitoring [9].\nAccording to EASA, the\
    \ UAVs should be safely integrated into the existing aviation context in a\nproportionate\
    \ way [7]. For large scale applications, in which UAVs are ﬂying beyond line-of-sight,\n\
    compliance with strict regulatory frameworks is essential.\nAdoption of a UAV-based\
    \ solution for image acquisition in agriculture applications is more\ncost eﬀective\
    \ and ﬂexible in comparison with satellite or manned aircraft alternatives [10].\
    \ Both\nﬁxed- wing [11,12] and rotary-wing type [3,13] UAVs are frequently used\
    \ in various applications in\nagriculture, while accounting for the risk of crashes\
    \ [9] and potential damages. Equipped with speciﬁc\nsensors in modular payloads\
    \ [14], such as high resolution RGB [15], infrared, multispectral [16,17],\nthermal\
    \ cameras [18,19], and also LIDAR [10], UAVs are able to create precise maps of\
    \ crop state or\nevolution [17], health plant assessment [20], diseases [21],\
    \ soil characteristics, evaluate losses caused\nby ﬂoods [11], etc. In the crop\
    \ monitoring, the following characteristics are analyzed from UAV\nimages [9]:\
    \ the crop water stress, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the canopy and the air\
    \ temperature,\nthe photochemical reﬂectance index, and the vegetation indices.\n\
    Although UAVs with diﬀerent propulsion systems are now available, most applications\
    \ in PA\nuse UAVs driven by electric motors due to their compact size, reduced\
    \ maintenance and operational\ncosts and, not the least, their alignment with\
    \ the current regulatory context and tendencies towards the\nreduction of global\
    \ carbon emissions [22].\nThe small-scale data acquisition by the WSN helps farmers\
    \ to take actions like crop irrigation,\nfertilizer usages, deciding on the optimum\
    \ stages of sowing, and harvesting [23]. Moreover, WSNs\nemployed in PA lead to\
    \ large amounts of data. Thus, data collection by WSNs is an important\ncontribution\
    \ to the development of farm management information systems (FMIS) [24,25].\n\
    The WSN has multiple functions at the ﬁeld level: data acquisition of various\
    \ parameters\n(e.g., temperature in soil and air, humidity in soil and air, solar\
    \ radiance, soil nutrients, the presence of\npests and weeds, chlorophyll content\
    \ in plants, etc.), distributed processing of data by establishing\nconsensus—if\
    \ it is the case, establishing the relevant data and its storage, low level data\
    \ fusion, and\ndata transmission. New sensor node designs oﬀer reduced costs [26];\
    \ see, for example, the detailed list\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n3 of 25\nof sensors\
    \ used in PA given in Reference [10]. As in many other large-area monitoring applications,\n\
    for communication or local processing reasons, the sensors are grouped into sensor\
    \ networks, the\ncommunication being made by radio. A WSN network will include\
    \ measurement nodes (sensory\nnodes) and data collection, processing, and transmission\
    \ nodes (sink or cluster head).\nRegarding PA, there is no rigorous theory of\
    \ sensor placement because it depends on the\nparticularities of the soil and\
    \ the weather. Sensor groups need to comply broadly with the need for\nsensory\
    \ and communication coverage. In Reference [27], two examples of sensor location\
    \ topologies\nare given: grid and random. From the point of view of communication\
    \ with the sink node, the most\nused are the star and mesh topologies. The wireless\
    \ communication protocols used in WSN for PA are\nthe following [10]: 6LoWPAN,\
    \ ZigBee (both being the most suitable for the mesh topology), LoRaWAN,\nGSM,\
    \ BLE, and Wi-Fi.\nIn PA, WSNs are used, most often, for parameter monitoring,\
    \ but they can also be integrated into\ncontrol systems as sensors. Direct speciﬁc\
    \ applications of WSN in control systems for PA are the energy\neﬃcient automated\
    \ control of irrigation [28] and smart automated fertilization [29].\nThe performance\
    \ of the crop monitoring can be improved by UAV–WSN collaboration [30].\nThe collaborative\
    \ aspects in an integrated UAV (aerial agents)–WSN (ground agents) architecture\
    \ for\ndiﬀerent applications was recently presented in a review paper [22], where\
    \ the diﬀerent functional\ncomponents of the system and how they collaborate with\
    \ each other was highlighted. In Reference [31],\nthe authors presented an integrated\
    \ UAV–WSN–IoT system, named FarmBeats, which is an end-to-end\nplatform for data\
    \ collection from various sensors, cameras, and drones in agricultural applications.\n\
    An unlicensed TV White Spaces is used to setup a high bandwidth link from the\
    \ farmer’s home to an\nIoT ground station at a distance for collecting data from\
    \ UAVs and WSNs.\nIn order to interconnect the UAVs and terrestrial WSNs into\
    \ hybrid networks and, at the same\ntime, to ensure a safe airspace sharing with\
    \ aircrafts, multiple organizations are contributing [22]:\nInternational Civil\
    \ Aviation Organization, EASA, Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned\n\
    Systems, International Telecommunications Union, etc. Satellite connection is\
    \ required for two reasons.\nOne-way communication, such as obtaining the GPS\
    \ location of the UAVs or the sensory nodes (if any)\nis one reason. The second\
    \ reason is a possible data transmission or remote control (via two-way\nsatellite-intermediated\
    \ internet).\nIn Reference [32], the authors discuss the information system design\
    \ supporting agriculture\ndata management. Enabling advanced data processing in\
    \ the form of sensor fusion and clustering\nmechanisms for improved network topologies\
    \ in generic applications has been discussed [30]. Eﬀective\ndata gathering mechanisms\
    \ [33] and higher level IoT architectures [34] are key and current topics\nof\
    \ interest.\nWe believe that the challenges of UAV–WSN–IoT integrated systems\
    \ can come from several\ndirections: (a) precise localization of the ground sensors\
    \ with the aid of a preliminary ﬂight; (b) sensor\nstates periodically inspected\
    \ by UAV; (c) establishing of the WSNs as sensor clusters able to cover, both\n\
    from the sensorial and from the communication point of view the monitored area;\
    \ (d) establishing\nthe cluster heads (CH), named base stations, of the WSNs able\
    \ to communicate data to UAVs;\n(e) transmitting commands to change the strategy\
    \ and parameters of the sensor networks, (f) data\nacquisition from WSNs through\
    \ UAVs, (g) special trajectory planning and tracking, (h) the aggregation\nof\
    \ information collected by the UAV with the information collected by WSN for the\
    \ purpose of\nmeasuring and interpreting the parameters with increased accuracy,\
    \ (i) remote control via Internet,\nand (j) edge and cloud computing.\nIn a hierarchical\
    \ structure, the data processing architecture of the integrated system is based\
    \ on\nthree levels: consensus, edge computing [35], and cloud computing.\nFor\
    \ the main activity, the data collection from CH, UAV must have a predeﬁned trajectory,\
    \ properly\ndesigned, and accounting for the following limitations:\n•\nWaypoint\
    \ passing: a UAV has to pass above the CH to extract the relevant data from that\
    \ area\n(covered by the corresponding WSN sub-network);\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n\
    4 of 25\n•\nObstacle avoidance: UAVs avoid obstructions or prohibited areas along\

    \ systems for PA in IoT is a mandatory step to create an\nadvanced FMIS [25].\n\
    Due to the integration, the system can become “smart” by using elements of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence\nlike self-adaptation and decision, optimal trajectory, data transmission\
    \ of relevant parameter values,\nenergy eﬃciency, and neural networks for data\
    \ and image processing. Not in the least, the sensors must\nbe placed optimally,\
    \ considering the terrain characteristics. Battery life is an important design\
    \ point\nof the ground sensor algorithms by reducing to a minimum the number of\
    \ wireless communications\nneeded to transfer the information. The radio interface\
    \ is the critical factor in increasing battery life.\nBased on the frequency of\
    \ the data collection and radio transmissions the nodes can have a battery\nlifetime\
    \ ranging from several months up to one year. Therefore, the intelligent collaboration\
    \ between\nUAV and WSN can lead to optimization of parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption, sensing coverage,\nrisk, data acquisition, and processing time\
    \ [36]. To this end, bio-inspired optimization heuristics and\ngenetic algorithms\
    \ were applied to the aforementioned agents.\nThe optimal WSN coverage by the\
    \ aid of UAV platforms is implemented in Reference [37] as an\noptimization problem,\
    \ formulated by means of the travelling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the\n\
    best path of the UAV for data collection with minimum energy consumption.\nUsing\
    \ UAV as data mule for multi WSNs is an energy-eﬃcient method to increase the\
    \ networks’\nlife. To this end, the authors in Reference [38] apply the successive\
    \ convex optimization technique.\nThe proposed system presents the following integration\
    \ aspects:\n-\nGroup the sensors in clusters and determine the cluster heads,\
    \ the methodology proposed by the\nauthors in Reference [30];\n-\nPath planning\
    \ based on speciﬁc conditions for eﬃcient data collection; and\n-\nIntelligent\

    \ for agriculture applications, (ii) a speciﬁc path planning for ﬁxed\nwing–type\
    \ UAV with the purpose of robust and eﬃcient data collection, (iii) obtaining\
    \ relevant data\nfrom sensors for the purpose of saving energy, and (iv) edge–fog–cloud\
    \ computing algorithms for\nsubsequent data processing. Thus, the main challenge\
    \ is related to improving data extraction and\ncommunication in large scale heterogeneous\
    \ monitoring system. The key problem is focused on\nimproving the performance\
    \ of such systems through better algorithms and synchronization among the\ntwo\
    \ subsystems: the ground sensor network and the robotic aerial platforms, implemented\
    \ as UAVs,\nfor data collection and relaying.\nThe rest of the paper is structured\

    \ UAV-WSN-IoT Systems\nFor the design of reliable and robust large-scale monitoring\
    \ system the requirements have to\nﬁrst be validated. The main challenges for\
    \ such collaborative systems were considered to be: sensing\ncoverage in accordance\
    \ to mission objectives, communication coverage by the hybrid UAV–WSN\nsystem\
    \ using various types of radio links, from low-power, low-data rate to high throughput\
    \ long\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n5 of 25\ndistance for streaming, energy eﬃciency,\
    \ and, not in the least, computing eﬃciency. The decentralized\narchitecture for\
    \ crop ﬁeld monitoring described in this paper is designed to overcome the challenges\n\
    mentioned above and to account for the data generation patterns at the ﬁeld level.\
    \ While the proposed\ndata fusion mechanisms and processing of centralized in-ﬁeld\
    \ data at CH level manage to reduce data\nvolume and ensure the ﬂow of information\
    \ up to the level of events, an additional intermediate level is\nappended to\
    \ the data stream, in order to reach the server. To this end, we consider both\
    \ mobile agents\n(UAV) and multiple ﬁxed agents (ground sensors (SNs)). The system\
    \ diagram is presented in Figure 1.\nThe mobile agent can perform the following\
    \ functions: data mulling, image acquisition, relay, and\nstate inspection of\
    \ WSNs. The ﬁxed agents acquire data from the ﬁeld (agricultural ﬁeld—soil and\
    \ air),\nprocess data locally (relevant data extraction, data consensus), and\
    \ ﬁnally transmit data to the UAV by\nmeans of CHs. The system is composed of\
    \ four main processing levels (Table 1): Sensor level, Fog\nComputing level, Internet/Cloud\
    \ Computing level, and Data Management and Interpretation level.\nThis is a multi-WSN–UAV\
    \ structure with higher level integration in internet-based systems for decision\n\
    support. The data from WSNs are collected by a UAV, transmitted at a ground control\
    \ station (GCS),\nand, from here via the internet, to the Data Interpretation\
    \ module. Analytics functionality ranges from\nbasic statistical indicators to\
    \ trend and event detectors and up to basic statistical learning models that\n\
    have the ability to anticipate evolutions in the monitored ground phenomena.\n\
    Another important requirement of the integrated system is the correlated or complementary\n\
    interpretation of the data from the sensory agents, either mobile or ﬁxed. For\
    \ example, when the soil\nmoisture is too high, the soil sensors show the maximum\
    \ value and cannot discern whether a ﬂood has\noccurred. This can be accurately\
    \ determined from aerial images taken by the UAV. In addition, the\ndegree of\
    \ humidity in plants and the degree of foliage development can be observed either\
    \ from the\nground or from the air (images), and a more precise determination\
    \ results from the fusion of the two\ndata sets.\nOther types of similar systems\

    \ must be considered. The ﬁrst is the trajectory planning\nfor collecting data\
    \ from sensors (CHs), and it must take into account certain requirements, such\
    \ as\nthe complete and safe acquisition of data, on one hand, and minimize energy\
    \ and time consumption,\non the other hand [39].\nUnder certain reasonable assumptions\
    \ (known environment, known limitations), the UAV tasks\nreduce to computing a\
    \ trajectory which respects constraints and minimizes a cost (length, total energy\n\
    consumption, etc.), while simultaneously respecting various constraints (internal\
    \ dynamics, stall\nvelocity constraints or exogenous ones, those imposed by the\
    \ environment, such as obstacle avoidance\nand waypoint passing through).\nThe\
    \ particularity lies in the fact that many of the UAV-speciﬁc constraints are\
    \ non-convex [40],\ne.g., the variable of interest z (depending of time t) has\
    \ to stay outside some bound (e.g., outside of\nan interdicted region and/or maintain\
    \ a minimal velocity). If z(t) is the UAV position, the velocity\nrestrictions\
    \ are usually written as follows:\nv ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\n.z(t)\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\
    \ ≤ v.\n(1)\nBoth bounds (lower—v and upper—v) may depend on a variety of factors.\
    \ Hard constraints are\nimposed by the UAV physics: upper bound given by the engine\
    \ characteristics and lower bound by\nthe requirement to avoid stall. Note that\
    \ this work neglects the inﬂuence of wind: velocity is usually\nmeasured against\
    \ the ground (e.g., through a GPS), but, in fact, the UAV “feels” the addition\
    \ of its own\nand of the wind velocities. This may lead to an unexpected stall\
    \ or, at least, improper behavior. Usual\ntechniques are to provide more conservative\
    \ bounds in Equation (1) and to restrict the ﬂight to normal\nweather conditions.\n\
    Waypoints are introduced, in a practical mission, because data has to be gathered\
    \ from a cluster\nnode. Thus, the question of minimum communication time arises\
    \ [41]: It is necessary to remain in a\nspeciﬁc neighborhood for a deﬁned time\
    \ interval ∆ti. To correctly describe such a constraint, we require\na tuple (ωi,\
    \ ∆ti, ri , Ri), where ωi is the corresponding cluster node position (the center\
    \ of the circle in\nFigure 2), and ri and Ri are, respectively, the minimum and\
    \ the maximum radius of the permitted\ncommunication area. Because there are perturbations\
    \ due to trajectory control errors or other causes,\nthe real trajectory is included\
    \ in a ﬂight lane (Figure 2a). The ﬂight lane was experimentally established\n\
    at 30 m, under reasonable assumptions about wind speed. The trajectory z(t) has\
    \ to stay near the\nwaypoint for a least amount of time ∆ti determined by the\
    \ quantity of data which has to be transferred:\nri ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\fωi − z(t)\n\
    \f\f\f\n\f\f\f ≤ Ri, t ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti].\n(2)\ncondition (2) is often impractical\
    \ to check due to the continuous nature of z(t) and because of the\nvarying time\
    \ interval [ti, ti + ∆ti]. The usual approach is to sample the constraint and\
    \ to estimate the\npath length by assuming the bounds (1) on the velocity. To\
    \ this end, we consider:\n\f\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\fz\n\x10\nti\n\x11\n− ωi\n\f\f\f\f\n\
    \f\f\f\f = ri,\n(3)\nwith ti given such that ti ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti]) holds; it is\
    \ important that a waypoint is reached, not when.\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n7 of\
    \ 25\nNote that the shortest distance for a trajectory checking (4) is the straight\
    \ line shown in Figure 2a,\nwhose length is 2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni . In other words,\
    \ a suﬃcient condition for guaranteeing that the minimal\ntime ∆ti has passed\
    \ is to ensure that\n∆ti ≥\n2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni\nv\n.\n(4)\nCondition (4) provides\
    \ a lower bound for the time the UAV stays between the inner and outer\ncircles\
    \ (i.e., how much time it spends inside waypoint’s ωi communication range). Then,\
    \ inserting (3) in\na trajectory design procedure implicitly guarantees enough\
    \ communication time. This approach may\nbe insuﬃcient for a couple of reasons.\
    \ First, the desired communication time may not be known at the\ntrajectory generation\
    \ time and thus could not be compared with ∆ti. Second, the communication time\n\
    is known to be larger than ∆ti and a “tangential” pass (like the one enforced\
    \ by (3)) does not suﬃce.\nThe method (detailed below) is to enter a loitering\
    \ mode to increase arbitrarily the data-gathering\ntime [42]. Making the reasonable\
    \ assumption that the loitering rl\ni radius respects the condition\nri < rl\n\
    i < Ri, means that the UAV can orbit the waypoint ωi for an indeﬁnite period of\
    \ time [43]. From\nthe viewpoint of trajectory generation, the only relevant question\
    \ remains the places at which the\nUAV inserts/dislodges onto/from the loitering\
    \ circle. Both of these points are decided by the relative\nposition of the current\
    \ waypoint with respect to the previous and next waypoints in the sequence\n(such\
    \ as to reduce unnecessary inﬂexions in the trajectory). The switch between normal\
    \ and loitering\nmodes will be done at pre-determined points: the trajectory enters\
    \ loitering mode at a point ω−\ni and\ndislodges from it at a point ω+\ni (which\
    \ lie on the loitering circle and are from/towards the direction\nof the previous/next\
    \ waypoint). Thus, when the UAV decides to ﬁnish the communication, it will\n\
    continue to orbit the loitering circle until it reaches the dislodging point ω+\n\
    i . Here, it will switch back\nto the normal trajectory mode.\nThe inner (dotted\

    \ line)\nare illustrated in Figure 2b. We show a trajectory inserting to the loitering\
    \ circle, tracking an arc of\nit, and, lastly, dislodging from the circle to re-enter\
    \ its normal mode (line tracking). The UAV could\nhave orbited the loitering circle\
    \ repeatedly and dislodged from it at ω+\ni when desired. As is mentioned\nabove,\

    \ the\ncurrent segment.\n#\nLoitering circle: whenever the UAV is required to\
    \ spend a signiﬁcant time in communication\nwith the current cluster head, the\
    \ decision to start loitering is taken. The loitering radius is\nrestricted to\
    \ be less than the communication radius and larger than the physical limitations\n\
    imposed by the roll angle bounds (a tighter circle means a larger roll angle).\n\
    #\nProximity circle: the procedure employed in the algorithm takes (whenever there\
    \ is\nintersection between the circle and the current segment) the heading angle\
    \ in the direction\nof the intersection point (the one closest to the end-point\
    \ of the segment).\n▶\nWhen the last waypoint is covered, the UAV returns to base\
    \ (by default, we consider this to be\nthe initial point on the trajectory).\n\
    Without being exhaustive, some of the most relevant updates in the algorithm are:\n\
    In segment tracking mode:\n1.\nAt the current time, we consider the UAV position\
    \ (x,y), the segment determined by the current\n(CP) and next waypoint (CP + 1):\n\
    \x10\nwi\nx, wi\ny\n\x11\n,\n\x10\nwi+1\nx\n, wi+1\ny\n\x11\n.\n2.\nWe compute\
    \ the projection of the current point onto the current segment (PP). We identify\
    \ three\npossible cases by checking the relative position of the projection wrt\
    \ the segment’s end points\n(described by W): inside the segment (0 ≤ W ≤ 1)),\
    \ outside and located before the initial segment\nend (W < 0); outside and located\
    \ after the initial segment end (W > 1);\n3.\nWe compute the distance (D) from\
    \ the current point to the segment and the circle of radius L\n(proportional with\
    \ the UAV velocity) and further used to compute the heading vector.\n4.\nWe consider\
    \ the following cases:\ni.\nThe UAV is too far away, and the projection point\
    \ lies before the segment start point. Then,\nthe heading angle points towards\
    \ the projection point.\nii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and the projection\
    \ point lies before the segment start point.\nThen, the heading angle points towards\
    \ the start point.\niii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close to the segment end point,\
    \ or its projection onto the segment\nlies after the end point. Then, the current\
    \ segment is updated, and the procedure jumps to\nstep 4i.\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    \ interior of the segment. Then,\nthe heading vector points towards the projection.\n\
    v.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and its projection lies onto the interior of\
    \ the segment.\nThe heading angle is taken as the vector of length L in which\
    \ the tip lies on the segment\n(there are two possible tips; the one closer to\
    \ the segment end point is considered).\n5.\nGo to step 1.\nIn the loitering mode:\n\
    1.\nSelect the loitering center as the current waypoint.\n2.\nConstruct the circle\
    \ of radius L and centered in the current position of the UAV.\n3.\nIf the circle\
    \ does not intersect the loitering circle, move towards the projection point situated\
    \ on\nthe loitering circle.\n4.\nIf the proximity circle intersects the loitering\
    \ circle, take the heading vector along the tangent at\nthe intersection point\
    \ between loitering circle and proximity circle (there are two solutions, we\n\
    selected depending on the desired loitering rotation—clockwise or counterclockwise).\n\
    Note that all steps where a decision regarding the trajectory update is taken\
    \ consist in fact in a\ndecision about the UAV’s heading. Thus, for trajectory\
    \ tracking, only the heading angle is used as\ncontrol input. This suﬃces for\
    \ relatively simple trajectories and is robust against wind disturbances\n(as\
    \ later shown in the simulations).\n2.3. Relevant Data Extraction\nThe collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level, cluster head level,\
    \ UAV level\nup to the cloud. Alongside these steps, information is gradually\
    \ extracted through various methods\nthat enable local decisions based on the\
    \ conﬁguration of the system (thresholding, consensus, symbolic\naggregate approximation,\
    \ etc.).\nIn-ﬁeld data processing is ensured both at local level (independent\
    \ data ﬁltering) and decentralized\nat network level (through data exchange between\
    \ neighbor sensory nodes). The proposed data\nprocessing mechanisms, tailored\
    \ for in-ﬁeld level, are designed in order to ensure a substantial\nweighted average.\
    \ This step is found as ‘Enable consensus dialog’. Once the convergence is reached,\n\
    each node performs a routine for results analysis basically seeking to discover\
    \ and mark nodes with\ndivergent values. This information remains available alongside\
    \ the consensus value so that it can be\ninterrogated by the higher level of data\
    \ processing if needed. This is found in Figure 4 as ‘Analyze\nresults step’.\n\
    Aggregated data sets are achieved through diﬀerent methods. All seek for relevant\
    \ data points,\naiming to a reduced size set and providing at the same time a\
    \ satisfying reconstruction of the initial\ndata. The proposed method for data\
    \ aggregation is based on the minimum and maximum values\nextraction, computed\
    \ as global extremes for a predeﬁned period of time (e.g., a day). It is obvious\
    \ that\nthis method is suitable only for measurements that have a periodic behavior,\
    \ with smooth variations\nduring the day. A measurement for which this method\
    \ is suitable is the soil temperature. Conversely,\nchange detection is commonly\
    \ used for irregularly-shaped data sets. This method follows extraction of\nlocal\
    \ extreme points where trend changes occur.\nGiven a set of data points (xi, yi),\
    \ i = 1, . . . , n, trend ti is computed for each sequence\nmeasurements such\
    \ that for a measure m, (5),(6),(7) has to be true. If ti , ti+1, then it means\
    \ that a trend\nchange has occurred, and the data point (xi, yi) is added to the\
    \ relevant data set.\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni > δm ⇒ tm\ni = 1,\n(5)\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni\

    \ volume of data and the data relevance. For a set of measurements, \nfor air\
    \ temperature monitoring, acquired for 10 days, 502 data points were validated\
    \ and stored, \ntotaling 2.008 kBytes. This raw data set was used for three relevant\
    \ data extraction methods; the \nresults are presented below.  \nFigure 19 illustrates\
    \ a total of 98 relevant points extracted through the Fog computing algorithm\
    \ \nbased on change detection approach. Considering the common size of 4 bytes\
    \ for floating point \nvalues, a total of approximately 400 bytes needs to be\
    \ uploaded (excluding the proposed protocol \nframe).  \nFor the symbolic aggregation\
    \ method, two tests were performed, for two parameterizations of \nthe SAX algorithm\
    \ at opposite poles. First, Figure 19 illustrates the results for SAX algorithm\
    \ adjusted \nfor a rough representation of the time series; thus, a number of\
    \ 10 characters is extracted. Considering \nthe common size of one byte for ASCII\
    \ character representation, a total of 40 bytes needs to be \nuploaded. Secondly,\
    \ for granular SAX, Figure 19 illustrates a total of 48 points, thus totaling\
    \ of 48 \nbytes. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure 19. Cont.\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n\

    \ [47] with further details regarding the \nUAV trajectory tracking and implementation\
    \ of the support path planning software interfaces and \nillustrative path planning\
    \ examples. On the data processing and deployment of the ground sensor \nnetwork,\
    \ the results are further elaborated upon with coverage maps, improved consensus,\
    \ and \nrelevant data extraction results. The two-stage data processing methodology\
    \ presented in this paper \nincludes a consensus algorithm for distributed agreement\
    \ for sensor node patches deployed in the \nfield alongside a relevant data extraction\
    \ step based on the consensus results. The first stage is \nintended to ensure\
    \ agreement of all the data collection entities upon the measured parameters,\
    \ as \nwell as to increase data quality by limiting the effect of sending upstream\
    \ erroneous sensor readings. \nThe second stage aims to optimize the data collection\
    \ time at the interface between the cluster head \nand the UAV acting as a data\
    \ mule. Based on the compressed representation of SAX segments, the \nresults\
    \ can be expanded and further processed at the decision level, in the cloud. At\
    \ the higher \nabstract layer in the cloud, the results presented in Table 2 can\
    \ be interpreted using state-of-the-art \ntext analytics tools. This is useful\
    \ for quantitative assessment of univariate sequences, as well as \ncorrelations\
    \ between multivariate string series. The character frequencies and recurring\
    \ \nsubsequences for certain parameters might be indicators for evolving phenomena\
    \ at the ground level. \nPotential drawbacks of the integrated system are related\
    \ to the increased complexity for multi-\nlevel data processing, communication,\
    \ and interoperability constraints between the aerial platform \nand the ground\
    \ sensors. Increased administrative requirements have to be complied with, e.g.,\
    \ \napproving flight plans for each UAV mission, along with maintenance requirements\
    \ that can stem \nfrom outdoor deployment of the nodes. We consider, however,\
    \ that the benefits outweigh the \ndiscussed drawbacks of such a system. \n5.\

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ of protected agriculture and the experience of other scholars, we \nproposed\
    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\
    \ layer through the \nnetwork layer for further processing and analysis. \n(2).\
    \ Network layer: The network layer is the infrastructure of IoT, which includes\
    \ a converged \nnetwork formed by various communication networks and the internet.\
    \ The transmission \nmedium can be wired technology such as CAN bus and RS485\
    \ bus or wireless technology like \nZigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa and NB-IoT. The network\
    \ layer not only transmits various kinds of \nagricultural related information\
    \ collected by the perception layer to the higher layer, but also \nsends the\
    \ control commands of the application layer to the perception layer, so that the\
    \ related \ndevices of the sensing layer take corresponding actions.  \n(3). Middleware\
    \ layer: IoT can provide different types of services for different devices. The\
    \ technical \nspecifications (processor, power supply, communication module) and\
    \ system of each device \nare different and different devices cannot be connected\
    \ and communicated with each other, \nwhich leads to heterogeneity problems. The\
    \ middleware layer aggregates, filters and processes \nreceived data from IoT\
    \ devices, which greatly reduces the processing time and cost of the \nabove issues\
    \ and provides developers with a more versatile tool to build their applications.\

    \ which \nFigure 4. IoT-A IoT framework [21].\n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected\

    \ layer is responsible for the storage, \ndecision-making, summary and statistics\
    \ of agricultural information and the establishment of \nvarious algorithms and\
    \ models for agricultural production process such as intelligent control, \nintelligent\
    \ decision making, diagnostic reasoning, early warning and prediction. This layer\
    \ is \ncomposed of cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing, Big Data, machine\
    \ learning \nalgorithm, other common core processing technologies as well as its\
    \ establishment model. \n(5). Application layer: The application layer is the\
    \ highest level of the architecture and the place \nwhere IoT's value and utility\
    \ are most apparent. There are lots of intelligent platforms or \nsystems in this\
    \ layer for the environmental monitoring and control of plants and animals, the\
    \ \nearly warning and management of diseases and insect pests, and agricultural\
    \ product safety \ntraceability, which can improve production efficiency as well\
    \ as save time and cost. \n \nFigure 5. Structure of IoT in protected agriculture\

    \ Technology \nSensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant\
    \ and animal information \nand it is also one of the technical bottlenecks in\
    \ the development of IoT. In recent years, sensor \ntechnology has rapidly developed\
    \ with the emergence of new materials and methods [23]. The \nFigure 5. Structure\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture [22].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n7 of 24\n3. The\
    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\

    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\

    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\

    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\

    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies have revolutionized
    every sphere of 21 st century humans. IoT technologies and the data driven services
    they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and
    influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc.
    In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this
    technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people
    from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways,
    from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying
    drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use
    of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity
    threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks
    have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent
    on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy
    in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi layered architecture
    relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses the security and privacy
    issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical environment. Further more,
    the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios and highlights open research
    challenges and future directions. A Roadmap of Cybersecurity Research and Challenges

    and Motivation According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected
    to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population
    [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent
    in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety
    of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water
    and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the
    dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary
    agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production
    is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2
    and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential
    to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart
    farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture
    applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous
    smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this
    new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors
    placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the
    volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been
    used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with
    the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped
    fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however,
    goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply
    chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire
    farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and
    revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional
    farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors
    and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences,
    as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of
    the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed
    potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks
    introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous
    vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can
    create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that
    have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the
    farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption
    as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner,
    also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting
    the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the
    U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat
    scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    content Abstract Internet-of-Things (IoT) refers to the massive network interconnection
    of objects often equipped with ubiquitous intelligence employed to provide smart
    services to end users. However, one of the substantial issues of IoT is the limited
    energy of IoT devices that are expected to run consistently for a long period
    of time without battery replacement. Moreover, in the wake of pervasive IoT, the
    number of IoT devices has exploded and lead to a tremendous rise in IoT networks
    carbon footprint. In this regard, Green-IoT and energy management of IoT emerged
    as challenging and attractive research topics for both academia and industry.
    In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and an up-to-date survey on recent energy
    management techniques in IoT networks. We start by presenting the challenges of
    energy consumption in IoT networks. Then, we will present novel and well-known
    energy management approaches for IoT but focus on the most recent solutions proposed
    in each approach. Next, we will provide a comprehensive survey of the most recent
    energy management solutions for IoT ecosystem. We will also present recent trends
    and new research perspectives that can be exploited for energy conservation in
    IoT networks. Finally, we will give recommendations on how to exploit the techniques
    presented in our survey to achieve the IoT applications QoS requirements. Previous

    managementEnergy harvestingEnergy saving 1. Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is a paradigm that envisions to connect everyday objects and integrate them
    to the internet using microcontrollers, transceivers, and protocol stacks. This
    paradigm attracts the attention of both academia and industries and aims at the
    digitization of a plethora of applications with high societal relevance. The IoT
    applications in our daily life activities are manifold, from smart transportation
    that offers ground breaking progress in the transportation and logistic industry
    to smart home that facilitates its in-habitants activities. IoT covers several
    fields such as smart traffic, healthcare, agriculture, industry 4.0 and can even
    be found in our everyday objects such as pens, clothes, etc. As a result, the
    world has known an explosive growth in the number of these devices. According
    to IHS Markit, 125 billions of IoT devices are expected to be connected with each
    other by 2030 (Howell, 2017). This number is highly influenced by the emergence
    of 5G networks and the exploitation of new spectrum frequencies (Li et al., 2018).
    Moreover, IoT devices are usually small and battery limited and the exchange of
    massive information between these devices gives rise to enormous energy requirements.
    These requirements are often not supported by IoT devices and can quickly lead
    to battery depletion and the network’s death. So, how can we develop energy-efficient
    solutions that will not only reduce the energy consumption in IoT networks and
    their carbon footprints but also increase the networks lifetime? Accordingly,
    we witness the emergence of the Green Internet of Things which focuses on saving
    and managing energy in IoT networks in order to optimize and reduce the energy
    consumption and prolong the IoT networks lifetime. In the next few years, Green
    IoT will make significant changes in our daily life and will help realize the
    vision of “green ambient intelligence” (Al-Turjman et al., 2019). In this survey,
    we are going to present a wide range of energy harvesting and energy saving techniques
    and set out the recent research trends for Green IoT such as green 5G IoT, green
    social IoT, green networks softwarization, backscatter communications, etc. This
    paper is organized as follows : In Section 2, we present the background information
    on the energy management works presented in the literature. In Section 3, we describe
    the problem and challenges of energy consumption in IoT networks. In Section 4,
    we discuss and select some of the energy harvesting and energy saving techniques
    presented in the literature focusing on the most recent researches. In Section
    5, we present the energy management technologies for IoT ecosystem. In Section
    6, we discuss the recent trends and research perspectives that can be exploited
    in energy management for IoT. Finally, we shall conclude the paper by providing
    an insight into open research problems and the future of Green IoT. Table 1. The

    of energy management for IoT networks has been widely studied and various reviews
    and surveys were presented throughout the years. Researchers are interested in
    energy efficient WSNs since they are widely deployed and omnipresent in IoT. In
    Khan et al. (2015), the authors presented battery-driven energy conservation and
    energy harvesting schemes used to design algorithms in Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs). The authors focused on reviewing the protocols used for the energy management
    of wireless sensor networks. Compared to this survey, our survey does not only
    focus on sensors but the different devices IoT networks can include. In Singh
    et al. (2020), the authors surveyed energy saving and energy management schemes
    and energy efficient protocols for WSNs focusing on transmission power management
    and miscellaneous techniques. Compared to our survey, this survey does not include
    the energy harvesting and wireless charging solutions of IoT networks. In Shaikh
    and Zeadally (2016), the authors surveyed the energy harvesting approaches used
    in WSNs which help to improve WSN lifetime. Compared to our survey, this survey
    focus only on energy harvesting of wireless sensor networks and not the different
    types of devices we can have in IoT networks. In our work, we present solutions
    not only energy saving and harvesting solutions for sensors but also rich resources
    devices. In the recent years, more and more authors started to use the Green IoT
    appellation. Green IoT refers to the energy efficient hardware or software procedures
    used to reduce the greenhouse effect of existing IoT applications and services
    as well as the impact of greenhouse effect of IoT itself (Shaikh et al., 2015).
    It represents all the enabling technologies for Green IoT such as Green RFIDs
    (radio frequency identification), Green Datacenters, Green Sensor Networks, Green
    Cloud Computing, Green Edge Computing and Green Communications. In Albreem et
    al. (2017), a Green IoT life cycle is presented which includes: green design,
    green production, green utilization, green recycling in addition to green IoT
    technologies such as green tags, green sensing networks and green Internet technologies.
    In Arshad et al. (2017), the authors discussed IoT techniques to achieve Green
    IoT and proposed a taxonomy of energy efficient based on the technologies used
    in IoT while in Tahiliani and Dizalwar (2018), the authors discussed energy efficiency
    techniques of different components and layers of IoT networks. Compared to our
    survey, the previous works do not include the energy harvesting techniques for
    IoT networks. In Table 1, we present a comparison between our survey and the other
    energy management and Green IoT surveys. It is clear through Table 1 that, in
    our survey, we chose to present novel schemes that were not discussed in the surveys
    presented previously. The main purpose of our paper is to provide an up-to-date
    state-of-art about energy management and Green IoT. Our comprehensive survey discusses
    the different and most recent techniques used in order to reduce energy consumption
    and increase the networks lifetime in IoT networks. Therefore, this article aims
    to serve as a guideline for researchers interested in the trends of energy management
    IoT networks. Download : Download high-res image (409KB) Download : Download full-size

    Since IoT applications and services are reaching almost every corner our life,
    the carbon footprint of these applications is increasing proportionately with
    the number of IoT devices. IoT networks are composed of devices that can be rich
    or limited in energy resources. The aim of Green IoT is to reduce the energy consumption
    of both types of devices while still being able to effectively perform their tasks
    and services. Key and widespread IoT technologies such as wireless sensor networks
    are composed of small and battery limited sensor devices that gather information
    and build efficient and reliable information and communication systems. However,
    these devices are typically used to perform monitoring and control tasks in IoT
    applications over long periods of time and without interruption. Sensors can also
    be placed in areas which are difficult to access (e.g. under water systems, military
    systems, unsafe environments, etc.) and can quickly run out of energy. Consequently,
    replacing their batteries frequently becomes an arduous and costly task. Energy
    storage and power management should also ensure the constant availability and
    operability of IoT devices given that, neither cable-power nor battery replacement
    are feasible options in harsh conditions. Many energy saving software and hardware
    solutions, which we will present in our survey, have been developed in order to
    reduce IoT networks energy consumption and maintenance cost. Currently, the world
    experiences a scarcity in energy sources in addition to the important emission
    of CO2 resulting of human activity. Greening information and communication technologies
    becomes an imperious need considering the damages caused on our environment. Consequently,
    energy harvesting solutions has been studied in order to power IoT devices with
    green and renewable energies such as solar energy, wind energy, mechanical energy,
    etc. Since Green IoT is a newly studied research field, one essential domain that
    is not widely discussed is energy measurement. In fact, with the battery limited
    nature of IoT devices and their high number and energy consumption, measuring
    and analyzing the energy consumption of IoT devices is key to achieve applications’
    QoS requirements. Due to the high cost and large size of the existing commercial
    energy measurement solutions, researchers proposed various alternatives. However,
    these alternatives are often limited with their complexity, measurement range
    and accuracy (Dezfouli et al., 2018). IoT energy measurement tools should also
    be standardized to be able to support all types of devices with their different
    complexities at a low cost. As we can see, although the revolution of IoT changing
    our lives has started, many challenges still need to be overcome in terms of energy
    consumption and environmental issues. Accordingly, numerous potential solutions
    in different disciplines are being explored to achieve this goal that requires
    a lot of efforts. Download : Download high-res image (348KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Backscatter communication paradigms. 4. Energy management
    techniques In order to tackle the energy issues in IoT networks, two approaches
    are usually employed: energy harvesting and energy saving. Energy harvesting can
    be described as the mechanisms employed to produce energy from a network ambient
    environment to provide an uninterrupted power supply for the network devices.
    On the other hand, energy saving schemes focus on developing algorithms, protocols
    and even hardware solutions to minimize the network energy consumption and maximize
    its lifetime. Based on these two categories, we propose a technique-based taxonomy
    (Fig. 1) which represents the recent energy management solutions studied in the
    literature in order to extend IoT networks lifetime and reduce the carbon footprint
    of those networks. Our taxonomy includes recent energy management techniques that
    can be found in the literature and not discussed in previous surveys. As shown
    in Fig. 1, we divide the energy harvesting category in the taxonomy depending
    on the energy sources into four sections: RF energy harvesting in which we include
    Backscatter Communications (BCC) (Hoang et al., 2020), a novel energy harvesting
    technology that have not been mentioned in previous energy management and Green
    IoT surveys, Mobile Energy Transfer (MET) and Simultaneous Wireless Information
    and Power Transfer (SWIPT) technology. We also discuss the most recent researches
    in energy harvesting techniques with green sources such as : solar, thermal and
    mechanical energy. We will present these techniques more deeply later in this
    section. The second category of energy management solutions we represent in the
    taxonomy includes energy saving solutions. As shown in Fig. 1, we classified energy
    saving solutions depending on the technology they employ. Unlike existing energy
    management surveys, in our survey, we introduce recent intelligent energy saving
    techniques that use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to reduce the
    energy consumption in IoT networks. We present energy efficient data collection
    techniques used in IoT networks as well as, sleep/wake-up schemes such as Duty
    Cycling and the recent low power Wake-Up Radio technology which have not been
    presented in the existing energy management and Green IoT surveys. In what follows,
    we will discuss the energy management techniques for IoT networks. First, we start
    by presenting the energy harvesting techniques followed by the energy saving techniques
    discussed in the literature. It is worth mentioning that we will present and focus
    more deeply on the emerging energy management techniques which have not been discussed
    in previous surveys. Table 3. The table shows the energy harvesting techniques
    and their challenges. Energy harvesting techniques Concept Challenges Backscatter

    it to the receiver -Short range -Efficient information coding -Security -High

    Energy harvesting techniques We will discuss the energy harvesting techniques
    existing in the literature. We focus our review on the recent solutions proposed
    for each one of these techniques. In Table 3, we present the concept and challenges
    of the energy harvesting techniques presented in our survey and Table 2 summarizes
    the energy harvesting works organized by the nature of the harvested energy: RF,
    solar, thermal and mechanical energy. 4.1.1. RF energy harvesting (wireless power
    transfer techniques) In what follows, we will present RF energy harvesting techniques
    focusing deeply on backscatter technology since it is an emerging technique in
    energy harvesting that has not been presented in previous surveys. 1. Backscatter
    Communications One of the major issues that IoT networks face is the limited network
    lifetime due to the battery dependency of IoT devices. Having these devices completing
    task over a long period of time could easily lead to battery depletion and induce
    a replacement cost. In some cases, sensors do not need to be kept active consistently
    and will wear out their batteries unnecessarily. Backscatter communications allows
    battery-less devices to transform wireless signals and use them as a source of
    power and a communication medium. Having battery-less devices is a major advantage
    of backscatter communications as it helps reducing energy consumption, removes
    the constraint of frequent battery replacement and averts from undesired performances
    due to energy shortage. According to Hoang et al. (2020), there are three different
    paradigms of Backscatter Communications (Fig. 2):Monostatic Backscatter Communication
    (MBC), Bistatic Backscatter Communication (BBC) and Ambient Backscatter Communication
    (ABC). • Monostatic Backscatter Communication: as shown in Fig. 2(a) MBC system
    is composed of two components: a reader and a backscatter transmitter (e.g. a
    RFID tag). The specificity of MBC is that the receiver and the RF source are located
    in the reader. The RF source sends a signal that activates the tag which modulates
    the signal and reflects it back to the backscatter receiver. Since the RF source
    and the receiver are located in the same device, the modulated signals may suffer
    from a round trip path loss which makes it more suited for short-range RFID application.
    • Bistatic Backscatter Communication: the main difference between BBC and MBC
    systems lies in the separation of the RF source (renamed the carrier emitter in
    BBC) and the backscatter receiver in different components which significantly
    reduce the round-trip path-loss problem (as represented in Fig. 2(b)). Moreover,
    by optimally placing carrier emitters, the overall communication range can be
    extended and the system performance is greatly improved. Although the deployment
    and maintenance of the carrier emitters in BBCs are costly, their design remains
    simple which makes their manufacturing cost lower than MBCs. • Ambient Backscatter
    Communication: in Ambient backscatter communication systems (Fig. 2(c)) and similarly
    to BBC systems, ABC systems carrier emitter is separated from the backscatter
    receiver. However, the carrier emitter, in this case, can be an already available
    ambient RF source in the environment such as a Wi-Fi access point or a cellular
    base station. In Zhang et al. (2019a), an ABS system is presented as a batteryless
    device (tag or sensor) which can harvest wireless energy from a RF source and
    then transmit “0” or “1” bit to a sink node through reflecting or non-reflecting
    states. In addition to having virtually no cost of deployment, the manufacturing
    costs and power consumption of ABCs can be reduced by the use of low-cost and
    low-power components. Various works studied the backscatter communications and
    its impact on the energy consumption of IoT networks and proposed solutions to
    further improve the energy efficiency of these systems. In Yang et al. (2018),
    the authors proposed a cooperative ambient backscatter communication system which
    allows a device to recover information from both the ambient backscatter devices
    and the RF source. The proposed solution enhances the maximum-likelihood detection
    performance if the backscatter device symbol period is longer than the RF source
    symbol period. This solution can be upgraded to be exploited in smart home and
    wearable applications. In order to further enhance the energy efficiency of backscatter
    communications, various works studied the optimization of the communication parameters.
    The authors in Ji et al. (2020) proposed a joint optimization based on the source
    antenna number and power splitting factor under the condition that the minimum
    energy required by the destination node is met while in Timoudas et al. (2020),
    the authors proposed a solution to optimize the needed power to transmit for a
    base station and the radio of backscattered signal of the IoT devices in the context
    of massive IoT. For complex IoT systems, other parameters (such as the number
    of base stations, the number of backscatter devices and their positions) need
    to be optimized in order to be energy efficient and to adapt to the IoT application
    needs. The authors in Feng et al. (2018), focused on the link layer of backscatter
    communication systems using centralized MAC protocols, while other solutions used
    distributed MAC protocol (Ma et al., 2018, Cao et al., 2019). Distributed MAC
    protocols are more suitable than the centralized protocols for large-scale IoT
    networks with unstable network topologies and high topology maintenance cost.
    Although backscatter communications seem ideal to achieve green IoT, it still
    has to overcome some challenges such as the risk of interference when there is
    a high number of nodes as well as, the bit rate limitations as it is not simple
    to implement very complex modulations on a backscatter tag due to its limited
    capability in manipulating the RF signal and performing baseband processing. In
    addition to that, backscatter communications networks need to overcome the short
    range limitation and the high deployment cost they may generate. 2. Simultaneous
    Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) SWIPT is one of the most attractive
    and challenging technologies in energy management. It is a technique that enables
    the simultaneous transfer of information and power wirelessly (Perera et al.,
    2017b). Theoretically, SWIPT allows an IoT device to harvest energy and receive
    RF information from the same RF signal that carries both energy and information.
    Therefore, an IoT device can be self-powered by receiving data. However, in most
    of the cases, it is not possible to perform energy harvesting and information
    decoding simultaneously from the same signal. The information could be altered
    or lost by the energy harvesting operation. Thus, different receiver architectures
    were designed to achieve SWIPT: Separate Receiver, Time Switching (TS), Power
    Splitting(PS) and Antenna Switching (Perera et al., 2017b). In SWIPT, the power
    and information needed for an IoT node are sent at the same time which keeps the
    node alive and extend the lifetime of IoT networks. Various solutions have been
    proposed to adapt and achieve SWIPT. For example, in Perera et al. (2017a), the
    authors provide a comprehensive study related to SWIPT in different types of wireless
    communication setups. In Liu and Ansari (2019), the authors proposed a dual-battery
    green energy harvesting architecture that achieves SWIPT. It consists in using
    one battery to power the device while the other one is harvesting energy in order
    to reduce energy shortage probability. However, this solution is limited to small
    IoT networks with devices that can support a dual battery. The proposed solution
    also adds complexity to sensor devices and is expensive for massive IoT networks
    with a high number of devices. In Lu et al. (2017), the authors proposed a collaborative
    energy and information transfer protocol for WSN that does not require the power
    and information splitter component which is convenient for IoT networks and reduces
    the sensors complexity and cost. In Huang et al. (2018), the authors studied the
    optimization of the energy efficiency in a SWIPT-based distributed antenna system
    by coordinating the energy harvesting and information decoding for IoT devices.
    The proposed solutions take into consideration the number of IoT devices in the
    network. SWIPT was also associated with deep learning to further enhance the energy
    saving potential of this technology. In Luo et al. (2019), the authors proposed
    a solution based on deep learning to minimize the total transmit power of a multi-carrier
    NOMA SWIPT system while satisfying the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of
    each user. Deep learning was also used with SWIPT in Park et al. (2020b). The
    authors proposed a dual mode SWIPT system that uses an adaptive mode switching
    based on deep learning to exploit both single tone and multi-tone SWIPT. Although
    deep learning proves to be efficient for SWIPT-based system, it also requires
    an important amount of resources that should be considered to build green and
    sustainable IoT networks. In Lee and Lee (2018), the authors proposed a hybrid
    resource and task algorithm in a SWIPT system that enables the devices to do their
    requirement tasks in a distributed manner. However, this solution should be improved
    to take into consideration delay-sensitive tasks for it to satisfy the real-time
    requirement of IoT applications. Finally in Liu et al. (2017), the authors proposed
    a cooperative SWIPT scheme that consists of a conflict-free schedule initialization
    algorithm, a cooperative resource allocation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm
    to obtain a maximum energy efficiency in the transmission schedule with the appropriate
    resource allocation policy. SWIPT is theoretically a very efficient energy harvesting
    technique. However, this technique offers several challenges. In SWIPT, the information
    and energy are sent through the same signal. This signal needs to be efficiently
    decoded in order to recover the correct information. The signal can also be altered
    by the energy harvesting mechanisms or by interference. SWIPT is limited in range
    since the signals can weaken when crossing long distances. Finally, signals that
    are sent to the devices can be hijacked by hackers. Therefore, a level of security
    should be added in order to protect potential private and personal data. 3. Mobile
    Energy Transfer Mobile energy transfer is an ambitious energy efficient technique
    for IoT networks. It extends wireless power transfer technologies since the use
    of classical wireless power transfer technologies is not suitable if the node
    is isolated, placed in areas which are difficult to access and does not support
    free charging. Mobile energy transfer consists in giving to a mobile node (such
    as a car, a bus, etc.), the ability to transfer energy to the devices within its
    transmission range. Various works have studied the use of mobile energy transfer
    technology for IoT networks energy management. The energy consumption of the mobile
    node is a key challenge of mobile energy transfer enabled IoT networks. In Almasoud
    and Kamal (2017), the authors proposed a solution to minimize the total energy
    consumption of a mobile base station while supporting the data and energy demands
    of IoT devices to guarantee the QoS. This study shows that various parameters
    can impact the energy consumption of MET based IoT networks such as the mobile
    base station locations and its movement speed, the number of devices and their
    tolerable time for delivering data and energy as well as the transmission powers
    (the power needed for energy and data transmission). In Madhja et al. (2016),
    the authors proposed a hierarchical and wireless energy transfer using mobile
    chargers in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks while in Zhang et al. (2019b),
    the authors presented one of the mobile energy transfer technologies called Adaptive
    Resonant Beam Charging (ARBC). As shown in Fig. 3, it consists of two specially
    separated components: a transmitter and a receiver (car, TV, etc.) and in some
    cases, a relay (UAV in Fig. 3) which is used to relay the energy between the transmitter
    and the receiver. In Liu et al. (2018), the authors proposed a mobile power network
    based on long range and short range wireless power transfer technologies and discussed
    the challenges of MET such as interference, efficiency, range and topology. Download

    Mobile energy transfer RBC scenario. 4.1.2. Solar energy harvesting Given its
    abundance in the environment, solar energy is considered as an affordable and
    clean energy source that could eliminate the energy shortage problem in IoT networks.
    This technique directly converts sunlight into usable electricity which is convenient
    for location with high light availability. However, the solar energy harvesting
    technique flaws arise in locations where light availability cannot always be guaranteed.
    Additionally, transporting solar energy from a location to another when needed
    may cause considerable energy waste which shows that there is still room for research
    and improvement in this area. In the literature, various authors studied solar
    energy harvesting for IoT networks. In Luo et al. (2018), the authors presented
    a review on solar energy harvesting for IoT applications and discussed the use
    of artificial intelligence and more specifically artificial neural networks to
    enhance and rapidly design energy harvesting systems for IoT applications. Numerous
    authors proposed solutions on solar energy harvesting for WSNs in Li and Shi,
    2015, Shin and Joe, 2016, Nguyen et al., 2017. In Li and Shi (2015), the authors
    proposed an intelligent solar energy harvesting system based on maximum power
    point tracking for wireless sensor nodes used in IoT, which prefers to use the
    solar power and takes the lithium battery as a supplementary under the condition
    of inadequate illumination. This solution offers IoT systems more reliability
    in case of scarcity in solar energy in the area. In Shin and Joe (2016), the authors
    proposed an energy prediction algorithm that uses the light intensity of fluorescent
    lamps in an indoor environment for wireless sensor nodes for IoT. This solution
    can be particularly helpful to achieve green and sustainable smart home since
    lamps can be used to power the sensors used in the smart home. In Nguyen et al.
    (2017), the authors proposed a new routing algorithm that aims to improve the
    lifetime of sensor nodes as well as the QoS under variable traffic load and solar
    and RF energy availability. The proposed algorithm significantly improves the
    energy efficiency of the IoT network even if the number of nodes increases drastically
    which constitutes a suitable solution for massive, complex and scalable IoT networks.
    In Wu et al., 2016, Wu et al., 2018b, the authors proposed a solution to improve
    solar energy harvesting in wearable IoT applications. In Wu et al. (2016), the
    authors proposed an MPPT algorithm based on the output current to extract the
    maximum power from a flexible solar panel to power wearable pulse sensors. Finally,
    in Wu et al. (2018b), the authors presented a self-powered wearable IoT sensor
    network that uses solar energy and is designed for safety environmental monitoring.

    Thermal energy is the energy that comes from heat and variation in temperature.
    The human body and the environment can be a source of thermal energy. For example,
    a difference in temperature can be created by the human body and the environment
    depending on the health condition, the location of a person, or body motion. There
    are two techniques that are used in thermal energy harvesting: thermometric, a
    technique that directly converts temperature difference into usable energy and
    pyroelectric, a technique that generates electrical energy when there is a change
    in temperature. It is important to efficiently generate electric energy from thermal
    generator in order to extract maximum electric energy to power devices and exploit
    the maximum potential of this approach. In the literature, various authors tackled
    the subject of thermal energy harvesting for IoT. In Abdal-Kadhim and Leong (2018),
    the authors discussed the use of thermal energy harvesting approach to power up
    a wireless sensor node for IoT applications. This study shows the efficiency of
    using thermal energy to power IoT nodes and the importance of using thermal energy
    harvesting in long-term IoT applications. Thermal energy harvesting proves to
    be efficient for various IoT applications. For example, in Yun et al. (2016),
    the authors studied the use of energy thermal harvesting for self-powered smart
    home sensors. For healthcare, in Priya et al. (2018), the authors studied a human
    body heat-based solution for wearable biomedical IoT nodes. Finally, in Teplỳ
    et al. (2019), the authors proposed a solution to optimize the energy consumption
    of thermal energy in IoT nodes by proposing an intelligent control of the individual
    parts of an IoT node. Unlike in Abdal-Kadhim and Leong (2018), This solution uses
    a battery to store the harvested energy and then uses the nodes’ battery to power
    the application. 4.1.4. Mechanical energy harvesting Mechanical energy harvesting
    consists in harvesting the energy that results from movement, pressure, human
    activity or any type of motion from an object. It is considered as a very efficient
    energy harvesting solution since the more and faster the object moves the more
    energy is produced to do more tasks. Mechanical energy comes from various sources
    such as wind and water flow or human motion and can be converted into electrical
    energy and exploited to supply IoT devices. For example, it can be interesting
    to use the energy produced from human motion to power a human temperature monitoring
    device that the user wears or powering neighboring houses using energy produced
    by wind and water flow. Mechanical energy harvesting offers a wide range of possibilities
    which makes it an ideal solution for creating green and sustainable applications.
    In the literature, mechanical energy harvesting have been thoroughly discussed.
    Several authors focused on wind flow and hydro in Jushi et al., 2016, Kamenar
    et al., 2016 respectively. In Jushi et al. (2016), the authors discussed the use
    of wind energy in autonomous WSNs and weather forecast to improve the prediction
    of wind condition in the near future. In this solution, the authors used a one
    and two hours weather forecast window in case of zero wind energy which shows
    that the unpredictable nature of wind energy makes it unsuitable for IoT applications
    that require constant availability and real-time performances. In Magno et al.
    (2016), the authors studied kinetic energy harvesting for wearables resulting
    from human motion. This study shows that human motion can produce an impressive
    amount of energy per day however, since the energy produced can vary from one
    person to another it can be difficult to develop a solution that is destined to
    a large population. In Kamenar et al. (2016), the authors described the conception,
    modeling, calculation, design, manufacturing and validation of the performances
    of energy harvesting devices deployed in river streams to be employed as a power
    source for pollution monitoring wireless sensor clusters. Table 5. The table shows

    The energy harvesting techniques presented in the previous sections are employed
    to produce energy from their surrounding environment and to power IoT networks.
    In Table 4, we summarize the energy harvesting techniques presented previously
    and the ability to use them in, what we consider, the major IoT applications (smart
    home, healthcare, agriculture and industrial IoT). For RF source harvested energy,
    SWIPT and MET can be applied to the use cases listed previously. In case of backscatter
    communications, the technology is suitable for smart homes, agriculture applications
    and indoor medical applications. Backscatter communications is still at a development
    stage, therefore, it faces limited-range, security and interference problems which
    makes it not suitable for applications that handle critical data and require a
    high level of reliability such as industrial and outdoor medical applications.
    Solar energy harvesting is largely used in smart homes and buildings, healthcare
    and agriculture. However, while solar energy can be used in industrial IoT, the
    network designers should take into consideration the uncontrollable nature of
    solar energy and how it can affect the performance of the high reliability requirements
    of industrial IoT applications. As shown in Table 4, thermal energy can be employed
    in different IoT applications as it can be frequently produced and stored to supply
    IoT devices. In case of mechanic energy harvesting, human motion is considered
    suitable for healthcare application. However, it does not produce enough energy
    to be helpful in the other applications. Wind and water flow can produce enough
    energy for various application, however, the uncontrollable nature of those energies
    is unsuitable for industrial IoT applications which require high availability
    and no energy shortage. 4.2. Energy saving techniques In this section, we discuss
    the existing energy saving techniques in the literature by presenting and focusing
    on the most recent solutions proposed in each one of these techniques. In Table
    5, we summarize the energy saving works studied in our survey. 4.2.1. Sleep/wake-up
    techniques 1. Wake-Up Radios: Wake-Up Radio is a novel hardware solution that
    has been developed to reduce the energy consumption of devices and extend the
    network lifetime. It consists in having a low power radio attached to the device
    main radio in charge of waking it up when an incoming signal is sensed. In IoT
    systems, a Wake-up Radio enabled IoT device has been defined in Froytlog et al.
    (2019). It is a microcontroller unit associated with a main radio and a wake-up
    receiver. The microcontroller and the main radio are in deep sleep most of the
    time. As shown in Fig. 4, when the receiver receives a request by means of a wake-up
    signal transmitted by an external node, it generates an interrupt signal to wake
    up the microcontroller to perform certain tasks and transmit data back via its
    main radio. Based on power usage, three types of wake-up radios have been identified
    (Piyare et al., 2017): active, passive and semi-active wake-up radios. Active
    wake-up radios require continuous external power supply such as batteries. Passive
    wake-up radios do not need energy from power supplies. They harvest energy from
    the transmitted signal instead. In semi-active wake-up radios, some components
    of the receiver require continuous power from an external source while the RF
    front-end remains passive. Wake-up radios can be particularly useful in a smart
    home/office scenario, or in an industrial context like warehouses and can be enhanced
    further to be used in smart cities (Deng et al., 2019). However, due to the sleep
    and wake-up nature of wake-up radio, we can expect an increase in data reception
    latency. According to Piyare et al. (2017), designing wake-up radio in a larger
    environment requires considering different design aspects such as: • Power consumption:
    the node’s power consumption should not exceed the main radio’s sleep power to
    keep the balance between the energy saved and used by the device. • Time to wake-up:
    the time needed to wake-up the device radio should be minimum in order to reduce
    the latency and thus enlarge the spectrum of applications Wake-up Radios can be
    used for. • False wake-ups and interference: due to interference and wrongly receiving
    signals intended to other devices, a node or several nodes could be unnecessarily
    activated causing huge energy waste. Thus, designers should find the right compromise
    and find solutions to those challenges without increasing the energy consumption.
    • Sensitivity: in Wake-up Radio environment, the sensitivity of the receiving
    node has a considerable impact on the power demand as having high sensitivity
    requires high power demand at the receiving side and having low sensitivity means
    needing high radiated power at the transmitter side. • Communication range: the
    range of a Wake-up Radio has an impact on the type of application it is used in,
    as well as on the system’s power consumption. For example, having short range
    communication would require a multi-hop communication which will increase the
    nodes density and the power consumption. • Data rate: having a higher data rate
    in a Wake-up Radio context is a way to improve energy efficiency and wake-up latency.
    Similarly, having a longer bit duration also increases the communication range
    and the reliability of the wake-up signal. • Cost and size: the Wake-up Radio
    should be cost effective in order to be integrated into the IoT context and existing
    sensor nodes. The cost should not exceed 5–10 per cent of the complete sensor
    node cost. • Frequency regulation: the design of Wake-up Radios should adhere
    to frequency regulations in industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands. It
    should also be adapted to communication standards such as the maximum allowed
    effective radiated power (ERP) used to transmit the Wake-up signal (WuS). In the
    literature, various studies proved the efficiency of low power wake-up radios
    energy saving. In Bello et al. (2019), the authors studied the design (from physical
    to media access control) and utilization of passive wake-up radios in IoT applications.
    This review also discusses the limitation of wake-up radios such as the short
    communication range, the high latency, lack of standardization, mobility as well
    as contention and channel access. In Basagni et al. (2017), the authors proposed
    GREENROUTES, an energy-aware cross-layer routing protocol for wake-up radio-based
    green networks. This protocol selects the relay nodes based on their distance
    in hops from the sink ans uses semantic addressing to enhance capabilities. Since
    wake-up radios are sensible to the distance between nodes, it would be interesting
    to see if this protocol is efficient in case the nodes are distantly distributed.
    The authors in Giovanelli et al. (2017) analyzed Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons
    scenarios in IoT applications and discussed the benefits of integrating wake-up
    radios in the BLE protocol stack which can help both reduce the time to contact
    all the beacons and also reduce the current consumption. Low power wake-up radios
    networks still suffer from the limited range of their components. This is why,
    in Frøytlog et al. (2019), the authors tackled the wake-up radios limited range
    issue and proposed a design and implementation of long range low-power wake-up
    radio for IoT devices that increases the lifetime of the devices and reduces the
    power consumption and overall cost in a large scale deployment. Another approach
    was proposed in Rakovic et al. (2020) to improve the energy efficiency and communication
    range of wake-up radios in IoT systems. The proposed approach consists in applying
    error correction codes on wake-up signals. Since wake-up radio suffer from short
    range capability and low signal sensibility, wake-up radio commonly misinterpret
    the wake-up signal which leads to performance degradation of the system. Code
    correction on wake-up signals constitutes an efficient solution to improve the
    robustness and sensitivity of wake-up devices. 2. Duty-cycling: Duty-cycling,
    also known as ’sleep schedule’, is considered one of the most effective ways of
    saving energy and extending networks lifetime. Duty-cycling algorithms are used
    to reduce the node’s battery consumption by alternating between sleep and wake-up
    modes. The node is usually set in a low power mode and only wakes up when needed
    (e.g. data reception, radio transmission). Those algorithms usually fall under
    3 categories: topology control protocols, sleep/wake-up protocols and MAC protocols
    with low duty-cycles. Duty-cycling have been studied broadly and due to its constant
    relevance, several recent works on duty cycling and its impact on the energy consumption
    of IoT networks have been proposed. In Passos et al. (2019), the authors provided
    a qualitative and quantitative comparison between the families of asynchronous
    duty-cycling methods, their characteristics and the most suited Green IoT applications
    for each of them. Asynchronous duty-cycling methods undergo an excessive transmission
    energy consumption while waiting for the receiver wakes up in addition to the
    multiple unicast transmissions that not only consume energy but can also lead
    to a network congestion. In Munir et al. (2018), the authors proposed an algorithm
    to optimize the duty-cycle duration of low-power IoT devices equipped with energy
    harvesting circuits in Wi-Fi based IoT networks. This solution use an optimal
    weighting moving-average filter to predict the harvested energy and find the optimal
    weighting factor to estimate the duration of the off period for IoT devices. The
    devices will exploit the off periods to harvest enough energy for the data acquisition.
    Finally, in Dhall and Agrawal (2018), the authors proposed a modified duty cycling
    efficient path planning algorithm for an IoT-based precision agriculture system.
    The proposed duty-cycling algorithm is performed on the data transmission phase
    and the path planning algorithm studies all the path and chose the short path.
    This solution proves to be effective even with a high number of devices. However,
    since the solution’s performance depends on the clusters, it would be interesting
    to optimize the cluster organization in order to reduce the overall energy consumption.

    Fig. 4. Concept of wake-up radio. 4.2.2. Energy efficient data collection Millions
    of IoT devices are deployed in intelligent applications like smart homes, smart
    transportation, and so forth. These devices generate huge amounts of data. In
    order to communicate its data to the base station or to his neighbors, an IoT
    device will consume large amounts of energy. Moreover, IoT networks are usually
    constituted of a large number of devices that have limited batteries. Once emptied
    or depleted, those batteries are often difficult to replace especially if the
    devices are placed in an isolated or a difficult to access position. One promising
    solution is to collect the generated data and communicate it in an efficient way
    to reduce the transmission energy cost. Several data collection approaches have
    emerged in order to reduce the energy consumption, delay and maximize the network
    lifetime (Chandnani and Khairnar, 2020). 1. Data Aggregation approach: This approach
    consists in reducing the number of transmission in a network and remove redundant
    and duplicated transmission of data. Data aggregation is the procedure of one
    or a number of nodes that gather data from other nodes for a period of time, aggregate
    them and transmit the aggregated result. In Chandnani and Khairnar (2020), the
    authors divided the data aggregation techniques into three classes : tree based,
    cluster based and centralized based. In Pourghebleh and Navimipour (2017), the
    authors presented a systematic review on the data aggregation mechanisms for IoT
    and presented a detailed comparison of the techniques used in each class. The
    authors found out that tree-based techniques offer low energy consumption, high
    network lifetime and great scalability compared to the other techniques while
    cluster-based techniques offer low traffic and high fault tolerance. On the other
    hand, centralized techniques focus mainly on security aspects. The latency, network
    lifetime as well as device heterogeneity should also be considered in data aggregation
    techniques. In John and Jyotsna (2018), the authors did a review on tree-based
    data aggregation techniques. The tree architecture is composed of nodes structured
    in the form of a tree. A tree contains leaf nodes and forwarding nodes. The authors
    found out that tree-based aggregation consumes less energy than clustering and
    grid-based aggregation. However, in a tree-based approach, the failure of a intermediate
    node affects the whole topology and disturbs the network activity. In Song et
    al. (2017), the authors proposed a cluster-based data collection technique that
    uses a sensor based cluster formation algorithm to elect the controllers and handle
    the different types of sensors. This algorithm is used alongside a multi-tier
    aggregation function. This solution allows us to extend the network lifetime,
    maximize the coverage and eliminate redundant data at the controller. However,
    using these structures can have major drawbacks. For example, tree and cluster
    structures increase the vulnerability of the network and make it less secure.
    They also do not take into consideration sleep and transmission latency. In Ko
    et al. (2019), the authors proposed a centralized-based data aggregation for IoT
    which gathers data and sends it to a centralized IoT gateway. This method also
    proposes an efficient sleep scheduling method along with data aggregation in order
    to ensure data consistency in the network. Compared to the tree and cluster structures,
    the centralized structure is more secure. However, it has low fault tolerance.
    2. Probability based approach: The probability based approach allows us to save
    energy by using approximation models to find correlation between data. The goal
    of probability based solutions is to predict the value of the sensed data. In
    Razafimandimby et al. (2018), the authors proposed a Bayesian inference approach
    that allows us to avoid the transmission of highly correlated sensor data and
    reduce IoT networks energy consumption. This approach was applied to a hierarchical
    architecture with smart devices and data centers and proved to reduce the number
    of transmitted data with good information accuracy in three different scenarios.
    In general, it is difficult to implement since the devices that help achieve the
    probability based approach can be increasingly complex and the models are not
    optimal considering the high correlation between the devices data. 3. Compressive
    sensing based approach: Compressive sensing consists in compressing the collected
    data and reduce the quantity of data sent throughout the network. Compressive
    sensing help reduce the size of the sensory information matrix as possible to
    reduce information and communication redundancy. According to Chandnani and Khairnar
    (2020), compressive sensing approaches can be divided into three categories :
    Conventional compression, Distributed source coding and Distributed compressive
    sensing. In Uthayakumar et al. (2018), the authors presented a review on data
    compression techniques from different perspectives such as data quality, coding
    schemes, data type and applications. Data compressing techniques are described
    by their compatibility, representation efficiency, computational complexity and
    memory management. Data compressing solutions should optimize these characteristics
    in order to enhance the efficiency of IoT networks and reduce the devices complexity.
    In Wang et al. (2019a), the authors proposed a clustering routing protocol based
    on energy efficient compressive sensing that finds the optimal size of a cluster,
    the optimal distribution of cluster heads and also alleviate the ”hot spot problem”.
    This solution reduces efficiently the overall energy consumption of the network
    and extend its lifetime. In this case, there is a temporal correlation between
    data which means it would be interesting to use a predictive approach in order
    to reduce the energy consumption resulting from the spatial–temporal correlation.
    In Hsieh et al. (2020), the authors employed distributed source coding between
    two node in a NOMA pair to optimize the performance and minimize the energy consumption
    in resource-constrained cellular IoT networks. This solution focuses only on mobile
    broadband applications, where transmissions typically occur in the downlink with
    full-buffered traffic. 4. Mobility based Data Collection: Recently, mobile data
    collection approaches have been widely used as a mean to develop energy efficient
    IoT networks and extend their lifetime. Mobile data collection allows battery-limited
    devices to save their transmission energy and thus extend their lifetime. Mobile
    data collection can be achieved by three methods. The first method consists in
    using static sensor nodes and a mobile sink that will collect data from these
    nodes when they are sufficiently close to it. The second method consists in having
    a static sink and mobile nodes. Since the nodes can move, they improve the network
    coverage and decrease the number of nodes needed (e.g. we can have less sensors
    in the network since one sensor can move and cover other areas of the network).
    This strategy has been studied widely in the recent years the number of mobile
    is increasing. The third method consists in having mobile sensor nodes and a mobile
    sink. There have been various studies that focused on energy efficient mobility-based
    data collection in the literature. In Wang et al., 2019b, Zhan et al., 2017, Chen
    et al., 2019, the authors studied the use a mobile sink (UAV) with fixed nodes
    and proposed a solution that optimizes the UAV trajectory in order to ensure an
    energy efficient data collection. In Chang et al. (2019), the authors proposed
    an algorithm for a distributed bus-based data collection to maximize the lifetime
    and throughput of WSNs. On the other hand. Researchers also studied the use of
    a mobile nodes with a static sink. In Wang et al. (2018), the authors proposed
    a solution based on the Internet of Vehicles that allows traffic data gathering
    architecture with an efficient sink node selection. This solution shows only certain
    vehicles and paths should be selected to reduce the network energy consumption.
    As shown in the latter works, mobility-based data collection is a very promising
    energy saving technology if the mobile sink has a low carbon footprint and is
    provided with an optimized trajectory which constitutes a challenging research
    area. Table 6. The table shows the pros and cons of the energy saving techniques
    discussed in the survey. Energy saving technologies Empty Cell Pros Cons Sleep/Wake-up

    the mobile node is difficult to find 4.2.3. Discussion The energy saving techniques
    presented in the previous section are used to reduce the energy consumption of
    IoT devices as much as possible. In Table 6, we summarize the energy saving techniques
    presented previously and highlight the pros and cons of using these techniques
    in IoT networks. In case of sleep/wake-up schemes, both duty-cycling and wake-up
    radios considerably reduce the nodes energy consumption. While wake-up radios
    is an on-demand sleep and wake-up scheme, duty cycling schemes can be divided
    into three categories: on demand, asynchronous and schedule rendez-vous. Accordingly,
    wake-up radio schemes are able to reduce the idle listening and overhearing that
    duty-cycling may suffer from. However, it has a limited communication range, a
    high deployment cost and can suffer from high interference. Duty-cycling, on the
    other hand, in addition to idle listening, overhearing and over-emitting can also
    struggle with high sleep latency (e.g. sending data to a node who is not ready
    to receive data) and data transmission latency (e.g. waiting for the next wake-up
    phase to send data). Choosing either wake-up radios or duty-cycling depends essentially
    on the network needs and requirements. Energy efficient data collection approaches
    are efficient schemes to reduce the energy consumption of IoT. However, they still
    have challenges and issues to overcome such as security and latency issues for
    cluster-based and tree-based data aggregation or the hardly achievable sensory
    data sparsity in data compression. Mobility based approaches can also be subject
    to data loss and energy starvation if the system policy used is not well defined.
    5. Recent advances in IoT ecosystem energy management In order to achieve Green-IoT,
    several new approaches for energy management have been explored by the researchers
    to reduce the energy consumption of the different components of the IoT infrastructures
    from data centers to the IoT nodes. These developments emerged with the exploitation
    of new communication paradigms like 5G and the rapid growth of technologies such
    as artificial intelligence, cloud, etc. In this section, we will present the recent
    advances in energy management for IoT networks ecosystem. In Table 7, we summarize
    the energy management solutions studied for cloud, fog and edge enabled IoT networks.
    5.1. Energy management in IoT-cloud computing With the start of the IoT revolution,
    the number of IoT devices has exploded and with it, the amount of data collected
    by those devices. However, since IoT devices do not possess the computational
    power to process all of the collected data, cloud computing is considered as a
    very promising paradigm that provides high-performance computing capability and
    high-capacity storage to support the ubiquitous need for data collection and processing
    in IoT networks. Cloud computing allows the battery-dependent IoT devices to offload
    various tasks to the cloud (e.g. data cleaning) and conserve their energy. Although
    it can be convenient to use this technology, it is well-known that the cloud servers
    that host cloud applications are highly energy consuming. Therefore, it is also
    necessary to reduce the cloud energy consumption by using its resources efficiently.
    Reducing energy consumption in Cloud computing can also be achieved by the use
    of low-power devices and the virtualization of services. In the literature, a
    large scope of energy saving solutions in cloud computing enabled IoT networks
    have been studied. In Kaur and Sood (2015), the authors proposed an energy-efficient
    architecture for IoT that allows the system to predict the sleep interval of sensors-based
    IoT networks upon their remaining battery level and reduce the energy consumption
    of sensor nodes and cloud resources. However, this solution is not recommended
    for application with strict real-time requirements since it is specific to systems
    with a sleep/wake-up strategy. Various solutions proposed energy saving in cloud
    computing by using service composition optimization. In Baker et al. (2017), the
    authors proposed a multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm (E2C2). The composition
    of services is energy-aware and integrates the minimum number of IoT services
    to meet a user’s requirements. This solution outperforms similar algorithms have
    been previously proposed: All Cloud, Base Cloud, Smart Cloud (Zou et al., 2010)
    and COM2 (Kurdi et al., 2015). To further improve service composition solutions,
    we should take into account not only the cloud providers aggregate energy, but
    also the energy needed for the service execution. In Kumari and Kaushal (2017),
    the authors presented a partitioning method of an application into offloadable
    and non-offloadable components to reduce the energy consumption and the execution
    time. This solution offloads components to the cloud however, it requires high
    network reliability in order to ensure the application well functioning and availability.
    Other solutions focused on energy saving using power-aware virtual machine placement
    in cloud providers. In Gharehpasha et al. (2020), the authors also proposed a
    virtual machine placement algorithm in order to reduce the number of active physical
    machines and reduce their energy consumption while also load balancing between
    the active physical machines. However, in this solution a static virtual machine
    placement is done which means once a virtual machine is placement it cannot be
    migrated to another physical machine. In Alharbi et al. (2019), the authors proposed
    an ant system for dynamic virtual machine placement that reduces the number of
    active physical machines and reduces the overall energy consumption of the data
    center. In dynamic virtual machine placement, virtual machines can be migrated
    from one physical machine to another. Therefore, security strategies should be
    applied during migration in order to protect private data from hackers’ attacks.

    in fog computing Cloud computing offers a platform and frees businesses and end
    users from the burden of many specification details. However, it does not constitute
    an effective solution for latency sensitive applications and often fails to meet
    their delay requirements. Consequently, Fog computing emerged as a new paradigm
    that constitutes an extension of cloud computing at the edge of the network rather
    than a replacement to it. Fog Computing is a highly virtualized platform that
    provides computing, storage, and networking services between end devices and traditional
    Cloud Computing Data Centers (Bonomi et al., 2012). Fog Computing platforms are
    designed to support the mobility, geo-distribution in addition to low latency
    required in various IoT application (e.g. industrial-IoT). These characteristics
    make the Fog platforms suitable to support the energy constraints of Green-IoT
    applications. Various Fog computing solutions have been proposed in the literature
    to reduce the energy consumption in IoT systems. In Sarkar et al. (2015), the
    authors studied the sustainability of Fog Computing and its performances compared
    to traditional Cloud in terms of power consumption, emissions and cost in IoT
    networks. Fog computing enhances the performance of latency sensitive applications
    in terms of QoS and eco-friendliness. In Perera et al. (2017c), the authors identified
    major features (such as dynamic discovery, configuration, management of devices,
    multi-protocol support at different layers of the network architecture, mobility
    etc.) that fog computing platforms need to support toward building sustainable
    sensing infrastructure for smart city. Fog computing platforms should built in
    a manner that different applications can use. Such platforms should also offer
    build-in support for different types of communication and data analytics frameworks
    in order to implement the different features of fog-IoT platforms. In Mebrek et
    al. (2017), the authors proposed a solution that allows a number of IoT devices
    to select a fog instance that will receive their data considering the energy consumption
    (e.g energy consumed by the transport network, energy to process and store the
    data, energy to forward the data to the cloud if needed) and the latency (transmission
    latency, processing latency, forwarding to cloud latency). In Nayeri et al. (2021),
    the authors reviewed the AI based application placement solutions that address
    latency, resource utilization and energy consumption issues in fog enabled IoT
    networks. Fog application placement solution focus mostly on achieving efficient
    load balancing methods. Machine learning and more specifically, reinforcement
    learning algorithms, are widely used and combined with evolutionary algorithms
    in order to solve the fog application placement problem. Algorithms can be combined
    to cover each others’ weaknesses and achieve challenges such as security, privacy,
    availability, etc. In Peralta et al. (2017), the authors proposed an energy efficient
    fog-based IoT scheme that reduces end-devices energy consumption for industrial
    IoT by reducing their transmission. This scheme uses an MQ Telemetry Transport
    broker to predict future data measurements through prediction techniques, operate
    as gateway and offload expensive data processing from the Cloud to the Fog. In
    order to reduce the energy consumption in fog-based IoT networks, various fog
    computing models were proposed. In Oma et al. (2018a), the authors proposed a
    linear fog computing model to reduce the total energy consumption. Although linear
    models are simple and useful they are only suitable for IoT networks with few
    number of sensor nodes. Consequently, in Oma et al. (2018b), the authors proposed
    a tree-based fog computing model that supports a large number of IoT devices and
    reduces the total electric consumption compared to the Cloud Computing model.
    Finally in Lavassani et al. (2018), the authors proposed a distributed (online)
    learning model on the sensor device. The model is created by mining the collected
    data that approximate the data stream behavior and then transmitting only the
    updated model parameters to a fog computing system. This solution saves energy
    in IoT devices by preventing unnecessary uplink transmission. 5.3. Energy management
    in edge computing With the increasing number of IoT devices, the data produced
    by those devices is also escalating explosively. Processing efficiently those
    data then becomes a necessity in Green-IoT. Therefore, edge computing technologies
    emerge as a very attractive solution for energy management in IoT as they bridge
    the gap between the limited capability of low-powered devices and their computational
    demands. Edge computing allows the workload to be offloaded from the cloud to
    a location closer to the source of data that need to be processed. It offers the
    possibility to downstream data on behalf of cloud services and upstream data on
    behalf of IoT services. It consequently has the potential to extend the lifetime
    of battery constrained IoT devices, reduce the network traffic, increase the bandwidth,
    improve the privacy and achieve a considerable energy and communication delay
    saving. Different approaches have been proposed to achieve energy saving in Edge
    computing based IoT networks. Energy efficiency using edge computing can be achieved
    through different schemes : from offloading strategies to data reduction schemes
    as well as the efficient management of IoT devices and applications. In Sun and
    Ansari (2016), the authors tackled the scalability and energy consumption challenges
    that IoT faces by proposing a novel architecture including the cloud, mobile edge
    computing and IoT. It includes a framework which develops a selective offloading
    scheme to reduce the energy consumption of IoT devices and the overhead of edge
    devices. However, this architecture needs to overcome many challenges related
    to nodes identification by the virtual machines (especially if they change location)
    as well as the nodes and virtual machines migration. In fact, if a mobile node
    changes its location, the system should find an efficient strategy that can either
    migrates the virtual machine or not based on the QoS requirements of the application.
    In Min et al. (2019), the authors proposes a reinforcement learning based offloading
    scheme for IoT devices with energy harvesting. IoT devices select an edge device
    and their offloading rate according to their current battery level, the previous
    radio transmission rate to each edge device, and the predicted amount of harvested
    energy. This solution also includes a deep reinforcement-based offloading scheme
    to further accelerate the learning speed. In Liu et al. (2019), the authors also
    combined Edge Computing with deep reinforcement learning in an IoT-based energy
    management system to reduce the energy consumption in a smart home context. The
    proposed solution consists in an offline and an online phase. During the offline
    phase, a deep neural network is trained and a deep reinforcement learning model
    based on Q-learning is built and exploited during the online phase. The proposed
    solution proves to reduce the energy cost. Such solutions can be proposed to reduce
    the energy consumption of smart homes in a smart city context. In Azar et al.
    (2019), the authors focused on compressing the data collected by the edge device
    before their transmission. The proposed solution is based on an error-bounded
    lossy compressor designed for high performance applications with high data production.
    The proposed compression algorithm proved that the extracted data produced similar
    classification accuracy as the compressed data. 6. Research perspectives in IoT
    energy management In this section, we will discuss the use of approaches (see
    Fig. 5) like social IoT 5G-IoT and network softwarization as well as artificial
    intelligence and Cognitive Radio IoT in order to reduce the global energy consumption
    of IoT networks. We will also present the most recent solutions proposed for this
    purpose. In Table 8, we summarize the papers studied for each approach. Table

    for IoT. 6.1. Energy management techniques in 5G IoT With the emergence of 5G
    IoT, up to 120 billion devices will be connected all over the world. In order
    to meet the intense user demands, the devices will not be limited to smart phones
    but also home appliances, cars and other devices and will contribute to build
    a smart society. 5G IoT also claims a data rate increase up to 10 Gb/s and uses
    multiple technologies (e.g. massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO), small cells,
    beam forming, etc.) in order to support the tremendous number of users. Consequently,
    5G IoT suffers not only from spectrum efficiency but also energy efficiency problems
    that are causing negative effects on the environment and human health. This exponential
    growth has raised the energy consumption and carbon footprint of those networks
    to alarming rates which led both the industry and academia to turn towards green
    5G communications. In the literature, various studies discussed the importance
    of energy efficiency in 5G networks. In Buzzi et al. (2016), the authors presented
    an overview of energy-efficient techniques for 5G networks covering resource allocation,
    network planning, network deployment, hardware solutions, etc. In Gandotra et
    al. (2017), the authors presented a detailed survey on energy efficient cellular
    networks and proposed a spectrum sharing solution for prolonged battery life in
    IoT networks. In Costanzo and Masotti (2017), the authors provided an overview
    of several recent solutions for the wireless powering of devices exploiting either
    near-field or far-field techniques. These techniques are expected to have a leading
    role in the realization of 5G-IoT networks. In Dao et al. (2020), the authors
    proposed a probabilistic decay feature-based solution which focused on the energy
    consumption of spectrum sensing for IoT devices in 5G networks. In Zhang et al.
    (2016), the authors proposed an integrating and energy efficient system model
    for 5G-IoT that uses a massive MIMO array to replace the single remote antenna
    and cellular partition zooming (CPZ) mechanism as a select-and-sleep mechanism,
    shortening consequently the distance between the components and reducing the number
    of routers. 6.2. Energy efficient cognitive radio iot With the high number of
    IoT devices connected to the internet, the frequency spectrum used by those devices
    to communicate are getting crowded. Cognitive radio is an approach that aims to
    improve the usage efficiency of the radio electromagnetic spectrum by using all
    available frequencies. The cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless communication
    system that can be programmed and configured dynamically. It is built on a software-defined
    radio which is aware of its environment and uses the understanding-by-building
    methodology to learn from the environment (Haykin, 2005). It automatically detects
    the available channels in the wireless spectrum and accordingly adapts its transmission
    and reception parameters in order to ensure communication reliability and efficient
    utilization of the radio spectrum. Recently, the integration of cognitive radio
    and IoT have been widely studied as a potential solution for the bandwidth scarcity
    and devices high demand of uninterrupted connectivity. Compared to traditional
    IoT, spectrum sensing may consume much energy and reduce the transmission power
    of the network. Thus, reducing energy consumption in cognitive radio networks
    remains one of the most important challenges in IoT networks energy management.
    In Qureshi et al. (2017), the authors proposed an energy efficient protocol for
    cognitive radio IoT that reduces the number of handshakes, avoid re-transmission
    for reliable data communication and thus reduces communication time and enables
    energy transmission with high throughput. The reduction in communication time
    reduces considerably the energy consumption of the network. Other solutions focus
    on reducing the energy consumption using optimization algorithms. In Xu et al.
    (2017), the authors proposed an algorithm for joint time and power allocation
    optimization in green cognitive radio networks while in Liu et al. (2020), the
    authors focused on optimizing resources and sensing time in green cognitive IoT.
    The solution consists in having two groups of IoT nodes alternate between spectrum
    sensing and energy harvesting in order to compensate sensing energy consumption.
    The authors in Hao et al. (2016), proposed an algorithm to optimize the power
    allocation and sensing time during imperfect sensing in cooperative cognitive
    radio networks. Cognitive radios resolve the problem of high spectrum requirements,
    reduce waiting time and thus allow devices to consume less energy. On the other
    hand, cognitive radios may face interference issues between secondary and primary
    users and may also struggle to compromise between a good QoS and energy efficiency.
    6.3. Energy efficient network softwarization for iot IoT connects billions of
    devices to provide a variety of services (smart homes, smart agriculture, industry
    4.0, etc.). In order to achieve these services, IoT devices employ various protocols,
    communication ways, and format of data. The diversity and heterogeneity of IoT
    data and devices compared to traditional networks in addition to the need of security,
    privacy, storage and processing means that IoT networks require dynamic solutions
    for management, configuration, and flow scheduling solutions. Network softwarization
    in the form of Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV) have emerged in order to overcome the previously discussed challenges. Networks
    softwarization consists in transforming telecommunication processing to a software-based
    environment. It is based on SDN which separates the control plane of the network
    and the data plane and thus separates the control from the forwarding in the network.
    The IoT network devices are employed for forwarding the data while the network
    controllers define the forwarding policies for the devices. These controllers
    can be organized in a centralized manner or in a hierarchical manner in order
    to prevent the controller from becoming a single point of failure and enhance
    the system’s fault tolerance (Eghbali and Lighvan, 2021). SDN integrated IoT can
    offer smart routing and load balancing as well as intelligent network traffic
    management and analysis. SDN can also provide a global view of IoT networks and
    improve the scalability and security of the networks. Network softwarization is
    also based on NFV which decouples the functions of network from the network hardware
    and runs it as virtual machines on containers. Network softwarization schemes
    such as NFV aim to replace energy consuming network hardware and improve the performances
    and capabilities of IoT systems. However, it is important to mention that these
    network functions are often run on servers which are the predominant energy consumers.
    Then, how does network softwarization impact the overall energy consumption of
    IoT networks and how can we reduce and optimize its energy consumption? To this
    end, various works studied the energy consumption in the network softwarization
    field. In Zemrane et al. (2018), the authors surveyed SDN-based solutions to improve
    IoT networks and describes SDN as a solution to IoT challenges focusing on energy
    saving, network management and mobility. In Naeem et al. (2020), the authors proposed
    an SDN-enabled routing protocol that not only efficiently utilizes the limited
    bandwidth cost to reduce the energy consumption but also achieves the QoS requirements
    for an industrial IoT network while in Yazdinejad et al. (2020), the authors proposed
    a cluster architecture using blockchain-based SDN controllers with distributed
    network management for IoT devices that provide a secure and energy-efficient
    mechanism for IoT devices in an SDN domain using a routing protocol. Numerous
    authors focused on reducing the energy consumption of SDN and NFV enabled data
    centers and thus, reducing the energy consumption of the whole IoT system. In
    Krishnan et al. (2015), the authors proposed an open stack based solution to enable
    policies that enforces constraints in the system with periodic event monitoring
    and dynamic resource management to minimize energy consumption in NFV data centers.
    In Liao and Wang (2018), the authors proposed an energy consumption control solution
    in SDN-based cloud data centers using the integration of virtual machine migration
    based on mixed single-parent genetic algorithm. Various SDN solutions achieved
    energy efficiency through energy efficient routing protocols. 6.4. Social IoT
    for energy management Social IoT is a paradigm that resulted from the integration
    of social networking concepts into the Internet. Social networks are able to connect
    a large number of individuals and this characteristic has previously inspired
    researchers in internet-related works (Atzori et al., 2012). Similarly to social
    networks, IoT networks use a variety of technologies to connect a large number
    of things which made the idea of combining these two concepts not only possible
    but also advisable. The concept of Social IoT was motivated by popular social
    networks over the Internet such as Facebook and Twitter. Therefore, it has attracted
    scientists and researchers in E-business, E-learning, sociology, psychology and
    networking. It has also caught the eyes of researchers in energy management as
    they consider it a promising solution in green networking. Since Device-to-Device
    communication and social network are two essential components in IoT, various
    authors studied energy management using Social IoT and proposed solutions to enhance
    the energy and spectrum efficiency in this context. For example, in Yang et al.
    (2020), the authors proposed a social interaction assisted resource sharing scheme
    for Device-to-Device communication, to improve the utilization of spectrum resources
    and thus, reduce the energy consumption in Green-IoT networks. The interconnection
    of IoT devices can also be used to efficiently harvest energy. For example, in
    Jiang et al. (2016), the authors proposed a social-aware energy harvesting Device-to-Device
    communications architecture that integrates energy harvesting technologies and
    social networking characteristics into Device-to-Device communication to improve
    the spectrum and energy efficiency for local data dissemination in 5G cellular
    networks. In Meng et al. (2017), the authors also worked on using social interaction
    in Device-to-Device communication but in this case to improve the efficiency of
    data exchange, sharing and delivery reducing thus, the energy consumption in the
    network. In Zhou et al. (2018), the authors proposed an energy efficient Cyber–Physical–Social
    system powered by IoT, where wireless network virtualization over SDN was adopted
    to enhance the service operation and the system management. In Lee et al. (2016),
    the authors propose an efficient pervasive interconnection technique to process
    and share information in IoT environment based on the human’s social network and
    the device’s sociality. In Al-Turjman (2019), the authors studied the use of smartphone
    sensors to contribute to smart social spaces as well as the energy consumption
    of femtocell, a potential communication technology for the realization in 5G-IoT.
    6.5. Intelligent energy management techniques for iot IoT networks are composed
    of physical devices such as vehicles, houses and any other item enhanced with
    sensors and software that enable data collection, distribution and analysis. However,
    due to the high number of IoT devices and their small sizes, they do not possess
    the computational power to process all the data collected hence, machine learning
    and big data technologies are efficient approaches to develop intelligent solutions
    to the collected data management. Big data technologies allow the collection and
    analysis of large amounts of data while machine learning studies algorithms and
    statistical models based on patterns and inferences that systems use to meet their
    goals (Machorro-Cano et al., 2020). Likewise, machine learning is a very reliable
    and robust approach, therefore, it is largely used in real-time applications.
    It is considered ideal for learning-based problems and is capable of identifying
    the background and characteristics of such problems to learn from them and execute
    actions based on the knowledge acquired thus increase system performances. Due
    to the high number of IoT devices, the energy consumed by IoT devices is huge.
    In addition, the world we live in faces a huge environmental crisis with climate
    change and high rates of air pollution, water pollution, etc. Reducing energy
    consumption in IoT networks is, then, one of the greatest challenges we might
    face. Researchers can exploit machine learning and intelligent solutions in order
    to predict energy consumption in IoT networks and applications. Table 9. The table
    shows the pros and cons of intelligent energy saving techniques. Intelligent energy
    saving techniques Pros Cons Machine learning -Help identify trends and patterns
    -Performances improve over time -Consumes energy while running the algorithms
    -Algorithms become obsolete when the data grows -Irrelevant and invaluable data
    can cause bad results Deep learning -Ideal for complex tasks -Supports large amounts
    of data -Bad quality data leads to bad results -Opacity of neural networks -More
    data security Various solutions have been proposed in order to reduce the energy
    consumption of IoT devices. However, those solutions are usually static, limited
    to a certain context and do not include taking smart and intelligent decisions.
    For example: in case of energy management of home appliances consumption, various
    optimizations solutions have been proposed. However, those solutions are depending
    on a certain context and do not consider a change of habit for the in-habitant.
    This is why, machine learning has emerged as promising approach to develop intelligent
    solutions for energy efficiency in smart homes as they are able, using smart meters
    data, to not only reduce the energy consumption but also adapt the decision making
    depending on the in-habitants’ habits. In fact, it would be interesting to exploit
    machine learning in order to adjust transport scheduling depending on air pollution
    or action depollution mechanisms if sensors detect a high pollution rate in water,
    etc. Hence, many researchers turned towards achieving Green-IoT at different network
    layers using intelligent solutions like machine learning and deep learning that
    proved their efficiency in other fields. Machine learning and deep learning, two
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches, are often confused as deep learning is
    considered a part of machine learning but, we believe is important to differentiate
    them as they are two concepts used in different contexts and application fields.
    Machine learning can be defined as algorithms that provide a system the ability
    to automatically learn and improve its performances. Machine learning algorithms
    learn from data or experiences and apply what they have learned to make informed
    decisions. They usually involve human intervention to give feedback to the algorithm.
    Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised
    learning. Supervised learning uses the experiences learned from past data and
    apply it to new data using labeled examples to predict the future actions or events,
    while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled and unclassified data and helps the
    system find all kinds of unknown patterns in data. Another category of machine
    leaning is semi-supervised machine learning which uses both supervised and unsupervised
    learning. Typically, those algorithms use a small amount of labeled data and the
    rest is usually unlabeled data. Semi-supervised algorithms decrease the labeling
    effort and increase the learning accuracy of the system. Finally, reinforcement
    learning is an approach in which the learning methods consist in interacting with
    the environment by taking actions and receiving rewards or errors. Within a specific
    context, this method maximizes the system’s performances and automatically determines
    its ideal behavior. Deep learning algorithms are an evolution of machine learning
    algorithms as they use a programmable layered structure of algorithms called an
    artificial neural network. These artificial neural networks enable systems to
    make accurate decisions without human intervention. Deep learning differs from
    the other machine learning algorithms as it is able to accomplish complex tasks
    using unstructured data, process a large amount of data and learn efficiently
    without human intervention. In what follows, we will present machine learning
    and deep learning based solutions employed to reduce the energy consumption of
    IoT networks. 6.5.1. Machine learning-based energy saving techniques With the
    emergence of IoT and the exploding number of IoT devices, the volume of the data
    generated by IoT systems also increases considerably. Consequently, machine learning
    techniques have emerged to use the data generated by IoT devices and make IoT
    application more intelligent. However, due to the high number of IoT devices,
    the energy consumed by those devices has also increased considerably, thus, energy
    saving has become a priority for IoT systems designers and end-users. This motivated
    researchers to study the use of machine learning in order to create green smart
    and sustainable IoT-network applications. The amount of works concerning the use
    of machine learning to achieve energy saving is large. To help reduce the energy
    consumption, machine learning can be used in energy saving IoT applications such
    as Smart Buildings (Zhao et al., 2018, Thomas and Cook, 2016), Smart Energy (O’Dwyer
    et al., 2019, Sheikhi et al., 2015), Smart Water (Mounce et al., 2015). Other
    works focus on saving energy by efficiently transmitting data and reducing the
    number of transmitted packets (Lavassani et al., 2018). While in Paris and Anisi
    (2019), the authors focused on energy efficient mobility prediction using machine
    learning. This shows if the data features are known and with the available datasets,
    machine learning algorithms prove to be an interesting solution that can be used
    and adapted to different aspects of energy saving in IoT networks. 6.5.2. Deep
    learning-based energy saving techniques Deep Learning is a promising approach
    for energy management in IoT networks. As shown in Table 9, it differs from machine
    learning as it provides better performances with large scale data. Deep learning
    algorithms are self-directed on data-analysis and can automatically extract new
    features for problems in contrast to machine learning algorithms which depend
    on the extracted and already identified features. Deep learning has been used
    in several works related to energy saving. In Liu et al. (2019), a deep reinforcement
    learning-based energy scheduling was proposed to deal with uncertainty and intermittence
    of energy supplies. In Hu et al., 2018, Liessner et al., 2018 a deep reinforcement
    learning approach was proposed to obtain an energy management strategy for a hybrid
    electric vehicle. On the other hand, in Wu et al. (2018a), a deep Q-learning based
    energy management strategy for power split Hybrid Electric Buses is proposed.
    As shown in the works presented previously, deep learning can be used in numerous
    energy saving applications. However, it is more suitable for large scale applications
    that require constant learning and that needs to adapt to the state of its environment.
    6.6. Application-based energy management IoT has revolutionized the way we live.
    However, IoT technologies face several challenges such as the increase in energy
    consumption and carbon footprint of IoT nodes. Therefore, IoT applications must
    be smart, eco-friendly and sustainable and with the recent development of Green
    IoT, it has become a tool towards achieving green and sustainable societies. Various
    IoT solutions have been proposed where IoT is an enabler for greening several
    fields of our society such as waste management, retail and logistics, smart streets,
    etc. For smart waste management, the authors in Shyam et al. (2017) proposed a
    smart waste management system where the waste level in waste bins is communicated
    and an optimized and energy efficient route is proposed to the workers. In Kazmi
    et al. (2020), the authors proposed a smart street framework where streetlights
    are powered by solar panels and are efficiently monitored and maneuvered by IoT.
    The streetlights operate at different intensities depending on the traffic flow
    rate and the absence or presence of sunlight and vehicles. In the proposed solution,
    streetlights are also equipped with sensors to help monitor air quality. Throughout
    the years, it has also been proven that traditional infrastructures that help
    simplify human beings daily lives (e.g. public transportation systems, home appliances,
    cars, factories, etc.) waste a tremendous amount of energy. Therefore, in order
    to continue using these vehicles and infrastructures without draining our planet’s
    energy resources, greening using IoT becomes a top priority and constitutes a
    step towards achieving green and sustainable societies. Consequently, various
    solution have been proposed as alternatives to traditional and polluting applications.
    In Chen et al. (2016) the authors discussed the use of Intelligent Transportation
    Systems to achieve energy saving and what changes both consumers and decision-makers
    should take in order to reduce the energy consumption of public transport systems.
    In Franzitta et al. (2017), the authors studied the use of renewable energies
    to power public transport (buses) and reduce the energetic dependence on fossil
    fuels by replacing diesel vehicles with hydrogen-powered vehicles. Numerous works
    specialized in energy management for trains and railways station such as Şengör
    et al., 2017, Kampeerawat and Koseki, 2017. Personal vehicles are also concerned
    with energy management. In Giliberto et al. (2019), the authors proposed a solution
    based on fuzzy logic aimed at prolonging the battery life of electric bikes. The
    use of electric bikes (e-bikes) is particularly interesting in IoT networks as
    they can be used as mobile node for energy or data transmission. Reducing energy
    consumption in buildings also caught the eye of researchers (Esther and Kumar,
    2016). For example, in Rahim et al., 2018, Ożadowicz, 2017, the authors proposed
    solutions to minimize energy consumption of homes and building appliances while
    causing the minimum discomfort to the user. In Rahim et al. (2018), the authors
    proposed a hybrid solution based on three heuristic algorithms for home energy
    management in a smart building while in Ożadowicz (2017), the authors proposed
    an approach to both physical and logical organization of an active demand side
    management system for building-integrated prosumer microgrids based on IoT and
    standard building automation and control systems (BACS) Table 10. The table shows
    recommendations on how to use the energy management techniques presented in our
    survey to meet iot applications requirements. IoT application Requirements Techniques

    will present recommendations and indications to IoT system designers on which
    techniques presented in our survey can help achieve the requirements of an IoT
    application in an energy efficient way. The application fields of IoT in a single
    domain are diverse thus, the requirements can differ from one application to another
    in the same field. However, a number of these techniques can be used for different
    applications. For example, using battery-less devices with backscatter communications,
    simultaneously transmitting power and information with SWIPT, in addition to periodically
    alternating between sleep and wake-up states for IoT devices with duty-cycling
    and wake-up radios that can be combined with machine learning techniques to optimize
    the sleep and wake-up time. These techniques are very promising and are use in
    scenarios where the device do not need to be constantly active. 5G technology
    is integrated with IoT networks in order to boost the communication and response
    time as well as the capacity of IoT networks. Security is also crucial for IoT
    applications that use private and critical data such as smart homes, healthcare
    and industrial IoT. IoT system designers should consider security at different
    layers of the network with security protocols as well as network softwarization
    that not only allows to save energy by replacing physical security devices but
    also to have powerful security mechanisms. Green energy sources also need to be
    exploited for various applications in order to power the devices and ensure the
    availability of the devices and real-time data. In Table 10, we summerize our
    recommendations for each IoT application. 7.1. Smart home IoT is drastically transforming
    how households are managed. Devices and home appliances are equipped with communication
    interfaces and are remotely and automatically controlled in order to offer a comfortable
    experience for the in-habitants. In this regard, smart homes services need to
    be available at any time and with low latency. Therefore, processing data at edge,
    fog and cloud level allows to have a quick response (Mao et al., 2018). Task offloading
    at different levels of the platform also enhances the availability of the service
    and allows a quick recovery in case one of the components stops working (Chowdhury
    et al., 2020). If smart home sensor data are communicated to the edge, fog or
    cloud for processing and since communication costs more energy than local computation,
    energy efficient data communication schemes need to developed for smart home through
    lightweight protocols, data reduction, data aggregation schemes (Pattamaset and
    Choi, 2021) and social IoT (Kim and Lee, 2015) to exploit the interconnection
    between the devices to find energy efficient communication routes. Smart homes
    solutions should also be context-aware and flexible thus, these applications can
    use machine and deep learning techniques in order to adapt to the user’s needs
    and reduce the energy consumption (Jo and Yoon, 2018). 7.2. Agriculture IoT was
    introduced in agriculture to improve agricultural yield and quality for the increasing
    world population. IoT is used to collect real-time information about temperature,
    humidity and soil and transmit them to a platform where they will be used to monitor
    the production. IoT devices in smart agriculture applications need to be reliable
    through weather conditions and available for years without the need for battery
    replacement. In addition to green energy sources and intelligent sleep/wake-up
    techniques, energy efficiency in agriculture IoT devices can also be achieved
    through using mobile vehicles such as tractors as power relays and data sinks
    and ensure the availability of the application data. A combination of sleep/wake-up
    techniques and UAV-based mobile energy harvesting is proposed in Jawad et al.
    (2019) for a smart agriculture system. Agricultural application are in constant
    expansion. Therefore, sensor data management is a key challenge that need to be
    taken into consideration through different devices organization schemes as well
    as data reduction and flexible data collection strategies. 7.3. Healthcare IoT
    is progressively integrated in healthcare in order to improve the access and enhance
    the quality of care. IoT healthcare applications aim to achieve excellent healthcare
    services at affordable costs. IoT in healthcare can be used to monitor a patient
    behavior and extract information that will improve well-being, healthcare and
    patient support. Patients’ medical information are critical, this is why healthcare
    application should protect data with secure transmission protocols. Healthcare
    IoT application should also offer real-time information about the patient’s health
    condition with low response time which will be possible with the democratization
    of 5G networks. In order to ensure efficient patient support and services, IoT
    healthcare services should be available even if one of the components stops working
    and devices should be able to function through arduous condition for a long period
    of time (e.g. wearable heart rate monitor). One of the most suitable approaches
    presented in our survey to meet those requirements is social IoT. IoT devices
    in healthcare are often mobile, the connection and relationships between these
    devices can be exploited in order to ensure the availability of critical information
    and the system’s fault tolerance. In Al-Turjman (2019), the authors used 5G and
    exploited Social IoT to ensure service availability for smart devices. The social
    aspect of IoT devices can also be exploited for power transmission between devices
    (Pei et al., 2020). For healthcare IoT applications that use wearable devices,
    human motion and mechanical energy harvesting can constitute the perfect solution
    to further increase the devices’ and network’s lifetime (Wu et al., 2021). 7.4.
    Industrial IoT IoT has recently made its way to the industry. It refers to the
    interconnection of all the industrial assets and aims to collect the maximum data
    from these assets to achieve optimal industrial operations. Industrial applications
    that are safety-critical and used for control and decision making need to be available
    and reliable at any time. In order to achieve industrial IoT applications requirements
    of real-time performance, 5G communication technologies (Slalmi et al., 2021)
    that offer low latency can be combined with CR-IoT (Abbas et al., 2020) to satisfy
    end-to-end deadlines of the tasks and optimize the frequency spectrum utilization
    and thus, reduce the waiting time. Edge and Fog computing can be used to perform
    energy-hungry computation at the edge of the network (as in Hsu et al. (2019))
    with low latency instead of handling them on the cloud which induces a longer
    transmission time and a higher energy consumption. With the large amounts of data
    generated in industrial IoT applications, an compromise must be made between the
    high availability of industrial IoT and the high energy consumption of data transmission.
    Therefore, IoT devices data should be organized and reduced through data aggregation
    and reduction techniques presented in our survey to reduce the transmission data
    energy consumption and latency in industrial IoT applications. Similarly to smart
    homes, industrial IoT applications should use artificial intelligence in order
    to offer a flexible and context-aware experience and exploit mobile devices in
    order to power other devices through intelligent mobile energy transfer strategies
    (Park et al., 2020a). 8. Conclusion With the constant need of human being to have
    a safe, comfortable and stable environment, Green IoT emerged as a key and hot
    technology. It guarantees a decrease in the energy consumption of IoT. In the
    coming years, the number of IoT devices will be even higher as big companies (e.g.
    Google, Amazon, etc.) are investing in the sector. Thus, companies and organization
    should develop IoT solutions from an eco-friendly and energy efficient standpoint.
    Re-usability and recycling of IoT devices should also be a focal point of the
    research of Green IoT to avoid the energy resulting from the process of producing
    new smart devices. Therefore, in order to achieve Green and sustainable IoT, there
    is a crucial need for new IoT policies and standardization that include the principles
    of Green IoT. In our survey, we have focused on gathering a large range of energy
    management technologies that will help achieve Green IoT systems. We have also
    discussed recent trends and new perspectives in IoT networks energy management
    that were not discussed previously in the literature. It is important to mention
    that other factors like QoS and security can further increase the energy consumption
    of Green IoT networks. For the longest time, in order to offer the best experience
    to the user, energy consuming solutions that achieve a good QoS was often privileged
    to a green solution that could lack in an aspect of QoS. Security is also another
    energy consuming factor of Green IoT. With the high expansion of IoT networks
    and high IoT nodes connectivity, the cybersecurity risks increase accordingly.
    Personal and private data will also circulate through IoT networks. Therefore,
    it is important to address the cybersecurity issues. Declaration of Competing

    \ two billion in 2050, according to\nthe survey taken by the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization, while the arable area is likely to grow\nonly by 5%. Therefore,\
    \ smart and eﬃcient farming techniques are necessary to improve agriculture\n\
    productivity. Agriculture land suitability assessment is one of the essential\
    \ tools for agriculture\ndevelopment. Several new technologies and innovations\
    \ are being implemented in agriculture as\nan alternative to collect and process\
    \ farm information. The rapid development of wireless sensor\nnetworks has triggered\
    \ the design of low-cost and small sensor devices with the Internet of Things\n\
    (IoT) empowered as a feasible tool for automating and decision-making in the domain\
    \ of agriculture.\nThis research proposes an expert system by integrating sensor\
    \ networks with Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nsystems such as neural networks and Multi-Layer\
    \ Perceptron (MLP) for the assessment of agriculture\nland suitability. This proposed\
    \ system will help the farmers to assess the agriculture land for\ncultivation\
    \ in terms of four decision classes, namely more suitable, suitable, moderately\
    \ suitable,\nand unsuitable. This assessment is determined based on the input\
    \ collected from the various sensor\ndevices, which are used for training the\
    \ system. The results obtained using MLP with four hidden\nlayers is found to\
    \ be eﬀective for the multiclass classiﬁcation system when compared to the other\n\
    existing model. This trained model will be used for evaluating future assessments\
    \ and classifying the\nland after every cultivation.\nKeywords: smart agriculture;\

    \ is considered as the base for human living because it is the primary source\n\
    of food and income for most of the countries in the world. The economy of the\
    \ country depends\non agriculture production as it provides food, raw materials,\
    \ employment, etc., to the people living\nin that country [1]. It has been observed\
    \ in recent times that there is no signiﬁcant development in\ncrop production\
    \ in the agriculture sector. Also, there is a rapid increase in the price of food\
    \ because\nthe production of the crop is not meeting demand [2]. One of the causes\
    \ for the decrease in crop\nproduction is the farmers use of the traditional way\
    \ of cultivation, which leads to less crop yield.\nThe farmers new to the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld have insuﬃcient knowledge about the characteristics of soil\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 3667; doi:10.3390/s19173667\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 3667\n2 of 16\nfor crop cultivation [3]. They are not conscious of the fact\
    \ that agriculture land needs to be assessed\nbefore cultivation [4].\nLand suitability\
    \ analysis is a mandatory prerequisite for crop cultivation, which helps to obtain\n\
    maximum production. In order to acquire the properties of the soil, farmers depend\
    \ on soil testing\nlabs, which are not suﬃcient enough to help them, and sometimes\
    \ the data provided by the labs are\ninaccurate [5]. In order to get enough knowledge\
    \ about cultivation, data need to be collected manually,\nwhich is very diﬃcult\
    \ for farmers. The solution is the replacement of traditional methods of data\n\
    collection with Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors [6]. Sensors play a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in collecting\ninformation about various factors such as soil, water, climate,\
    \ etc., for agriculture development. With\nthe help of data gathered from diﬀerent\
    \ sensors, land suitability analysis could be done, which would\nhelp farmers\
    \ identify the current status of their agriculture land and improve their crop\
    \ production.\nSeveral decision models have been developed so far to assist the\
    \ farmers in taking a decision on crop\ncultivation to maximize their proﬁt [7].\n\
    Ever-changing real-world conditions like monsoons to temperate are the dominant\
    \ factors in\naﬀecting agriculture productivity. Soil parameters to weather prediction\
    \ are essential in knowing\nthe future yield [8]. The key factors that are inﬂuencing\
    \ the crop yield are climatic conditions, soil\nproductivity, and groundwater\
    \ characteristics, as well as its availability. An extensive study on\nphenotyping\
    \ is helping researchers to understand these factors [9]. One of the signiﬁcant\
    \ challenges\ninvolved in identifying the diﬀerent land conditions is based on\
    \ the inﬂuence of various soil parameters.\nOver the past few decades, soil testing\
    \ has been practised, which is widely accepted by agriculture\nexperts and farmers\
    \ to determine the properties of soil for agriculture production [10]. The Agriculture\n\
    Management Information System (AMIS) is mandatory to store the data acquired in\
    \ various formats\nand exchanges the data for digital agriculture technology [11].\
    \ Currently, AMIS has enhanced its\nfacilities by accumulating the latest technologies,\
    \ such as the Internet and the Internet of Things (IoT).\nIntroduction of the\
    \ usage of sensors actually reduces the cost and time involved in assessing the\n\
    land suitability in the traditional manner [12]. The uses of sensors are plenty,\
    \ and it is possible to use\nas many sensors in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Soil\
    \ sensors, water sensors, and biosensors are few that\nhave been shown to have\
    \ a signiﬁcant role in measuring nature. These sensors contribute to the smart\n\
    farming system, especially in the handling of appropriate irrigation systems to\
    \ help farmers. The Radio\nFrequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) technology is used for\
    \ the detection of animals entering into the\nfarmland. The Global Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) position-based seeding recommendation is emerging\nas another beneﬁt\
    \ in the ﬁeld of agriculture beneﬁting from the latest technological developments\
    \ [13].\nSome of the beneﬁts it has achieved in recent days are improved eﬃciency,\
    \ sustainable growth, as well\nas cost-eﬀectiveness. It is considered to be the\
    \ connection between the collection of physical devices\nthrough internet connection\
    \ such as WiFi, Data cards, etc.\nAs a revolutionary change, the sensor-driven\
    \ network has a considerable role in precision\nagriculture [14]. Timely forecast\
    \ based on soil parameters will ensure proper irrigation systems. IoT\nhas a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in handling the recorded data from sensors. General Purpose Input/Output\n\
    facilitates various sensor inputs and the corresponding outputs in Raspberry Pi.\
    \ Further, this could\nreally help in hosting diﬀerent sensors. Cloud computing\
    \ is helping the IoT sensor networks to record\nthe measured data through its\
    \ sensors. The wireless medium is transferring the data to the cloud,\nwhich is\
    \ used later for data analysis [15].\nData Analytics has brought impactful results\
    \ for future predictions in almost every single\napplication. Artiﬁcial intelligence-based\
    \ model building is a challenging task as the model should\nreplicate the observed\
    \ parameters in the dataset. Parametric estimations are helpful in solving the\n\
    problems in a futuristic way, and agriculture problems are among those [16]. Agriculture\
    \ data analysis\nis done with diﬀerent machine learning algorithms. Maximizing\
    \ the outcome is the agenda for any\nmachine learning model, and model assessment\
    \ metrics are helpful in analyzing the results obtained.\nAppropriate training\
    \ of the machine learning model will produce the results with utmost accuracy.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3667\n3 of 16\nNeural network-based models are used widely,\
    \ as they have the capability to improve the eﬃciency\nof the model over every\
    \ iteration [17]. Classiﬁcation problems are handled by various algorithms,\n\
    such as support vector machines, decision tree algorithms, etc. Multiclass classiﬁcations\
    \ are expertly\nhandled by neural network algorithms [18]. When the model is trained\
    \ with the appropriate number\nof inputs and outputs, it is expected to give better\
    \ results compared to other machine learning models.\nThe integration of IoT,\
    \ along with machine learning models, are providing the farmer recommendation\n\
    system with appropriate inputs [19].\nIn this work, an agriculture dataset has\
    \ been obtained through various IoT sensor devices such as\na pH sensor, soil\
    \ moisture sensor, salinity sensor, and electromagnetic sensor. A sensor is a\
    \ device\nwhich is used to detect and respond to some type of input obtained from\
    \ the physical environment [20].\nAs it requires less labor and consumes less\
    \ time, it is used in many real-time applications. As the\nInternet plays a mediatory\
    \ role in various kinds of communication and data exchange, it is advisable to\n\
    integrate the agriculture data with the cloud platform. The data acquired from\
    \ the various IoT devices\ncould be stored to the cloud platform [21].\nThe key\
    \ contribution of this work is as follows\n•\nThe selection of the relevant attributes\
    \ and the collection of data from the appropriate sources for\nbetter agriculture\
    \ land suitability classiﬁcation, and these data are heterogeneous in nature.\n\
    •\nIntegration of diﬀerent data collection and bringing it to a form suitable\
    \ for future predictions.\n•\nThe noble initiation towards helping the farmers\
    \ build a recommendation model, especially for\nthe low economic regions, in a\
    \ country like India.\n•\nGeneralization of the proposed model, which could be\
    \ used for any land, as the current test inputs\nare suﬃcient for the classiﬁcation\
    \ of the land suitability with this developed model.\n•\nThe multiclass classiﬁcation\
    \ is another crucial contribution as the majority of the past work is\nbased on\
    \ binary classiﬁcation, which includes two decision classes, namely suitable and\
    \ unsuitable.\nThese multiclass results are helpful for the farmers when compared\
    \ to the binary classiﬁcation, to\ntake suitable action based on the outcome of\
    \ the results.\nThis paper presents a model that will automate the process of\
    \ analyzing various deciding factors\nin the assessment of present and future\
    \ conditions for the better crop yield. The diﬀerent classiﬁcation\nwill help\
    \ decide well in advance how to proceed to start a new session. Besides, this\
    \ would ensure\nminimal loss to the farmers, and the diﬀerent sections presented\
    \ here elucidate the model further.\n2. Related Work\nThe integration of the Internet\
    \ of Things into the agricultural system has led to the Internet of\nAgriculture\
    \ of Things along with advanced computing techniques. The researchers apply this\
    \ to\nobtain maximum beneﬁt and to also improve the production of agriculture,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, and\nIoT [22]. The agriculture domain is experiencing\
    \ new evolution and revolution motivated by sensors,\nIoT, big data, and cloud\
    \ technology [23]. The IoT based on a smart agriculture system was developed\n\
    using deep reinforcement learning integrated with a cloud environment, in which\
    \ four layers were\nincluded, namely data collection, edge computing, data transmission,\
    \ and cloud computing [24]. IoT\nhas been integrated with agriculture systems\
    \ to yield maximum proﬁt, and the applications of IoT in\nagriculture have been\
    \ categorized into restricted environment planning, open farm planting, livestock\n\
    farm monitoring, and aquaculture development [25].\nA new proposal was presented\
    \ for agriculture applications by investigating various integrated\nplatforms,\
    \ which include cloud computing, IoT, and data mining techniques [26].\nA scalable\n\
    network-based architecture was proposed to monitor and regulate agriculture farms\
    \ in rural areas\nwith the help of IoT-based WiFi with long-distance network and\
    \ fog computing [27]. The development\nof IoT in agriculture data analytics has\
    \ transformed from a speciﬁc crop to any kind of crop. Also,\nthe system is able\
    \ to support a various number of applications from controlling and supervising\
    \ the\nagriculture crops to promoting the products in the market [28]. An irrigation\
    \ monitoring and control\nSensors 2019, 19, 3667\n4 of 16\nsystem was developed\
    \ using a fuzzy approach to generate a moisture content distribution map of soil\n\
    by applying an interpolation technique.\nThe IoT-based Wireless Sensor Network\
    \ (WSN) was used to generate a distribution map with the\nmeasurements of soil\
    \ moisture content taken at nine places of the selected farmland [29]. An IoT-based\n\
    system was developed to water agriculture crops using a wireless sensor network,\
    \ and a web application\nwas also designed to control the information about the\
    \ crop and ﬁeld [30]. Several machine learning\nalgorithms have been used so far\
    \ for prediction and forecasting. A new forecasting model was designed\nby combining\
    \ the gravitational search algorithm with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to forecast\
    \ the level\nof water in Winnipesaukee and Cypress Lakes in the USA [31]. A neural\
    \ network-based model was\nproposed using MLP to predict the bid price of the\

    \ by combining the ﬁreﬂy algorithm and MLP to predict the salinity value\nof soil\
    \ with the help of remote sensing data [33]. An algorithm was proposed for the\
    \ identiﬁcation of\nweed diseases using MLP and automatic relevance determination.\
    \ Three multi-criteria yield models\nwere proposed using neural networks with\
    \ MLP for the prediction of winter rapeseed [34].\nAn IoT-based hydroponic intelligent\
    \ system was developed using deep neural networks to control\nthe actions in the\
    \ hydroponic environment characterized by multiple parameters gathered using IoT\n\
    sensors [35]. An IoT-based smart decision model was developed to help the farmers\
    \ to get information\nsuch as fertilizer requirements, crop analysis, and market\
    \ requirements. IoT-based sensors were used to\nobtain the data related to farming,\
    \ and it is stored in a cloud framework where information is processed\nand sent\
    \ to farmers’ mobile devices by applying some data mining techniques [36]. An\
    \ Intelligent\nmodel was developed for the diagnosis of faults in the aquaculture\
    \ ponds located in remote places\nthrough IoT sensors. A fuzzy neural network\
    \ algorithm was applied for fault detection, and the model\ndetects many types\
    \ of faults in aquaculture ponds [37]. An IoT-based prototype was designed for\n\
    monitoring the water level in sources like borewells, water tanks, etc. This prototype\
    \ could be used to\navoid damage in pump motors when the water level goes beyond\
    \ the threshold level [38].\nA predictive platform for precision agriculture was\
    \ presented using IoT devices to improve\ncrop productivity at low-cost. Deep\
    \ learning algorithms were used to predict the diseases in plants\nwhich were\
    \ hidden in the images of the leaves, and they were classiﬁed with maximum accuracy\
    \ [39].\nAn intelligent system was developed to predict the fruit-melon image\
    \ of skin lesions and alert for new\nplanting environments using the convolutional\
    \ neural network and deep learning rule. The image is\nobtained by using an infrared\
    \ video sensor, and the system has obtained a satisfactory accuracy of\n97.5%.\
    \ A modern automatic agriculture monitoring system was developed using the ZigBee\
    \ Wireless\nSensor Network and deep learning algorithms. Wireless sensor networks\
    \ are also used to monitor the\ntemperature of soil and humidity. Also, the system\
    \ classiﬁes the moisture content in the soil.\nA decision tree-based model was\
    \ proposed for optimizing water and energy consumption [40].\nFurther, this was\
    \ accomplished with the assistance of the Internet-of-things. Moreover, to help\
    \ the\nfarmers in saving the precious water resource, which is declining day by\
    \ day, several soil parameters\nwere considered. Besides, for measuring the water\
    \ requirement, and factors such as soil moisture\ncontent and soil temperature\
    \ were utilized for making a suitable decisions concerning water release.\nThe\

    The various parameters used to ﬁnd agriculture land suitability analysis in this\

    \ used to get the salinity\nSensors 2019, 19, 3667\n6 of 16\nvalue. The porousness\
    \ value is obtained based on the measurement of the soil moisture sensor and\n\
    granularity of the soil is obtained using the measurement acquired from the moisture\
    \ content of the\nsoil. The values of the structure of the soil and the compact\
    \ and cementation are obtained from the\nagriculture experts.\nThe type of dataset\
    \ acquired from the sensors are numerical values. Based on the values obtained\n\
    from the sensor, suitability range values (obtained from experts) are assigned\
    \ to the parameters\nconsidered for the land suitability model. For example, the\
    \ pH value ranges from 7.2–6.7 for favorable\nland conditions, 6.6–5.5 for less\
    \ favorable land conditions, 5.4–4.5 for unfavorable land conditions,\nand less\
    \ than 4.5 for the very unfavorable land condition. The salinity value for the\
    \ favorable land\ncondition is <2, 2–6 for less favorable land conditions, 6–12\
    \ for unfavorable land conditions, and\ngreater than 12 for the very unfavorable\
    \ condition. The sampling period of data acquisition is one\nday. The average\
    \ of the one-day data obtained from various sensors is stored in the cloud network\
    \ as\npart of the preprocessing of the data. As the data may contain missing and\
    \ noisy values, the mean of\nthe data is considered. Since the data contain diﬀerent\
    \ units of measurement (categorical, numerical),\nnormalization is done before\
    \ applying the proposed model.\nFigure 1 states the architectural diagram of the\
    \ proposed model. The steps involved in this process\nare shown in this ﬁgure.\
    \ The data is collected from the farmland using sensors, and is then transferred\n\
    and stored with the help of the Raspberry Pi system in the cloud. The stored data\
    \ is used here to\nbuild the artiﬁcial intelligence recommendation model shown\
    \ in the ﬁgure. The constructed model is\nexpected to classify the results into\
    \ four diﬀerent categories. Amazon Web Service (AWS) is used here\nfor the storage\
    \ of the data.\nThe learning model construction is explained in the algorithm\
    \ part given below. The built model\nwill be assessed with inputs received after\
    \ every cultivation period, and accordingly, assessment results\nwill be provided.\
    \ Diﬀerent classes are considered here for land suitability assessment as most\
    \ suitable\n(class 1), suitable (class 2), moderately suitable (class 3), and\
    \ unsuitable (class 4).\nThe Algorithm 1 presented here explains the steps involved\
    \ in the processing the collected data\nfrom the diﬀerent sensors. Since the size\
    \ of the data is quite high in size, it is necessary to handle the\ndata with\
    \ the algorithm that is capable of handling the expected size of the data. That\
    \ is the reason\nwhy a neural network approach is considered here for processing\
    \ the data. The algorithm presented\nhere is further explained below.\nArtiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence Model building is given in the algorithm. Processing of the neural\
    \ networks\nrelies upon the network topology, adjustments of weights, and activation\
    \ functions. The network\ntopology deﬁnes the network arrangement together with\
    \ its connecting links and nodes. In neural\nnetworks, learning refers to the\
    \ process of modifying weights of neural connections among the neurons\nof the\
    \ speciﬁc network. Activation functions are additional eﬀorts applied over the\
    \ input to achieve\nthe exact output. In the proposed work, a supervised learning-based\
    \ neural network is adopted where\nthe learning process is dependent. The input\
    \ vector is oﬀered to the network model and obtains an\noutput vector, which is\
    \ then compared to the desired or target vector. An error signal is developed\n\
    in case of a variation existing between the actual and the desired output vector.\
    \ Depending on the\nerror signal the weights are adapted until the desired and\
    \ the actual output matches. Neural networks\ncan be precisely deﬁned as complex\
    \ adaptive architecture, which can transform its internal structure\ndepending\
    \ on the information passing through them. The following section explains the\

    \ of a Proposed Sensor Network-Based Model\n4.1. Description of the Dataset and\
    \ Study Area\nThe data used for this experimentation are collected from the diﬀerent\
    \ villages of the Vellore and\nTiruvannamalai district in the state of Tamil Nadu,\
    \ India. With expert opinions, we have shortlisted\nthe various parameters that\
    \ are really inﬂuence the crop yield. This collection of the dataset includes\n\
    a combination of distinctive climate, soil, and groundwater properties. Four decision\
    \ classes are\nconsidered here for land suitability assessment, namely most suitable\
    \ (class 1), suitable (class 2),\nmoderately suitable (class 3), and unsuitable\
    \ (class 4).\n4.2. Data Preparation\nIt is essential to prepare the information\
    \ astutely before training the neural networks (NN) and\nmultilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLP) models. The present real-world data obtained from sensors are distributed\n\
    non-uniformly, and henceforth, th data cannot be utilized legitimately amid training\
    \ and testing of the\nNN and MLP models. In this way, the input features are normalized,\
    \ and categorical variables are\nconverted to numeric data through the data label\
    \ encoder for eﬃcient processing. The standardized\ndataset is then sub-divided\
    \ into training and independent test sets in the ratio of 75:25. The results\n\
    obtained are observed in the perspective of multiclass classiﬁcation, as well\
    \ as for the individual class\nbasis. The process of training and testing is repeated\
    \ for a variable number of iterations starting from\n30, 50, and so on, till 100\
    \ until the convergence optimization is met, and also for a variable number of\n\
    neurons and hidden processing layers for each model.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3667\n\
    8 of 16\n4.3. Performance Measures\nThe performance parameters which are assessed\
    \ for multiclass classiﬁcation are characterized as\nfollows. For a class ‘C’,\
    \ the classiﬁer eﬃciency and performance could be assessed with true positive\n\
    (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) that can\
    \ be determined from the\ncounts of testing samples belonging to ‘C’ [42]. Various\
    \ performance metrics appropriate for assessing\nNN and MLP for multiclass classiﬁcation\
    \ problems are calculated [42]. Classiﬁcation accuracy scores\ncould be used to\
    \ determine the accuracy of the model by deﬁning the number of correct predictions\n\
    made from all the predictions. Also, this enables us to determine the per-class\
    \ eﬀectiveness of the\nmodel and is calculated as,\nAccuracy =\nTP + TN\nTP +\
    \ TN + FP + FN\n(1)\nThe performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score,\
    \ etc., used for binary classiﬁcation\nneeds to be generalized for the multiclass\
    \ classiﬁcation setting. To meet the appropriate needs, we\ncalculate the micro-average\
    \ and the macro average. In micro-averaging, the performance is evaluated,\ni.e.,\
    \ the precision, recall, and the F1 score are obtained from the individual TP,\
    \ TN, FP, and FN of\nthe n-class model [42]. In macro-averaging, the mean of the\
    \ performance of each individual class is\ndetermined, providing equal weight\
    \ to each of the classiﬁcation labels. Precision is the ratio of the\npredicted\
    \ positive events that are actually positive.\nPrecisionmicro =\nPn\ni=1 TPi\n\
    Pn\ni=1(FPi + TPi)\n(2)\nPrecision macro =\nPm\ni=1\nTPi\n(FPi+TPi)\nn\n(3)\n\

    (7)\nThe Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)-Area Under the Curve (AUC) curve\
    \ is the\nperformance measurement for classiﬁcation problems under various threshold\
    \ settings. ROC represents\nthe probability curve, and AUC is the degree or measure\
    \ of separability distinguishing the classes.\nThe AUC-ROC score is represented\
    \ in Table 2 under various iterations for the NN and MLP learning\nmodels. Figures\
    \ 2–4 represent the AUC-ROC curve for the multiclass classiﬁcation problem under\n\
    various iterations for the learning models. The AUC-ROC curve indicates how well\
    \ the probabilities of\nthe positive class are separated from the negative class.\n\

    \ which legitimately impacts the execution of MLP and NN during\nthe training\
    \ and preparation of the information for setting up a learning base. In any case,\
    \ determining\nthese parameters prior has been an unsolved problem in ML research.\
    \ In the proposed work for NN,\nthe experiments were performed with the number\
    \ of hidden neurons (Nh) to be set as 30, 50, and 80\nand the results were noted.\
    \ For MLP, the experiment is repeated for three and four numbers of hidden\nlayers\
    \ and the neurons in each layer were 30, 50, and 80. All the results have been\
    \ epitomized and\ndeﬁned in tables for varying the Nh values. Tables 1 and 2 deﬁnes\
    \ the results obtained for each class\nseparately using NN and MLP with Nh = 30.\
    \ Likewise, Tables 3 and 4 deﬁnes the results obtained\nfor Nh = 50 and Nh = 80.\
    \ On the other hand, Table 4 describes the results attained by the NN and\nMLP\
    \ based on multiclass classiﬁcation with Nh = 30. Likewise, Tables 5 and 6 illustrates\
    \ the multiclass\nclassiﬁcation results obtained for Nh = 50 and Nh = 80 accordingly.\
    \ It needs to be noticed that all the\nresults that appeared in these three tables\
    \ are averaged and equated over ten independent simulations\nfor each of the learning\
    \ models.\nTable 1. Performance of Neural Networks (NN) and MultiLayer Perceptron\

    \ are delineated in Tables 2–6, are basically dependent on\ndiﬀerent performance\
    \ parameters. The proposed work compiles various performance parameters for\n\
    the evaluation and assessment of NN and MLP for the multiclass classiﬁcation dataset.\
    \ The training\nperformance for the NN for the proposed dataset is found to be\
    \ varying for diﬀerent values of Nh such\nas Nh = 30, Nh = 50, and Nh = 80. The\
    \ performance measures of the NN model are found to improve as\nthe number of\
    \ neurons in the hidden layer Nh increases. With the increase in Nh, the NN is\
    \ capable\nof predicting the test data hypothesis with improved accuracy. Moreover,\
    \ the MSE and the RMSE\nare found to be very low and decrease accordingly in all\
    \ three cases. Further, this results in better\nconvergence of error, leading\
    \ to possibly proper learning of features. The performance parameters,\nlike the\
    \ accuracy, precision, and others mentioned, seems to follow a similar manner.\n\
    Hence, it could be presumed that predictive accuracy could be a good measure for\
    \ this dataset.\nThe performance results obtained using the MLP with three hidden\
    \ layers are found to be much better\nthan that of NN. Similar to the NN model,\
    \ this MLP model shows improved performance results\nwith the increasing number\
    \ of Nh. However, since the number of hidden layers has increased the\narchitectural\
    \ complexity, the convergence optimization is achieved with less number of iterations\
    \ when\ncompared to the NN.\nThe accuracy and other performance measures are found\
    \ to improve accordingly with an increase\nin the Nh. On observing the performance\
    \ measures of MLP with four hidden layers, the model\nindividually is found to\
    \ provide better results with improved performance with an increase in Nh.\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3667\n14 of 16\nHowever, when observed for the test case of Nh = 30,\
    \ MLP with three hidden layers is found to produce\nbetter results than the MLP\
    \ with four hidden layers. Further, this may be due to the increase in\narchitectural\
    \ complexity with an increased number of hidden layers. Also. if the Nh is set\
    \ to as high as\n100, there might be a high risk of over-ﬁtting the training data\
    \ which would lead to poor performance\nthan those obtained with Nh values of\
    \ 50 and 80. Besides, provided the current experimental setup,\none could likewise\
    \ accomplish slightly diﬀerent results due to the underlying fact that the biases\
    \ and\ninitial weights of the neural networks are determined randomly. If an appropriate\
    \ weight set is ﬁxed\ninitially, one could obtain superior results for similar\
    \ settings. This assertion could be endorsed by the\nfact that the gradient descent\
    \ may not generally ensure a near-ideal weight set towards the end of the\nneural\
    \ network training process.\nAccording to the results obtained inTable 6, the\
    \ performance of MLP with four hidden layers\nis high compared to the performance\
    \ of the Neural Network and the MLP with three hidden layer\napproaches used in\
    \ some of the existing literature. Therefore, the proposed model assesses the\
    \ given\nagriculture land and provides better results for sustainable agriculture\
    \ development compared to other\napproaches. This model provides a reliable decision\
    \ on the suitability level of the agriculture land in\nfour diﬀerent categories,\
    \ helping agriculturists to assess their land appropriately. Thus, this proposed\n\
    model could be used as a recommendation model for land suitability to improve\
    \ the crop production\nfor sustainable agriculture development.\n7. Conclusions\n\
    Since agriculture is the backbone of any country, it is necessary to ensure its\
    \ sustainable growth\nover the years. This work has presented a model that would\
    \ be as accurate as 99%, which would be the\nmost desirable. The data collected\
    \ through various sensors, handled here with MLP with four hidden\nlayers, has\
    \ ensured better eﬃciency. A proper advisory system with precise instructions\
    \ would always\ndeliver better results. Thus, the accuracy score to precision\
    \ score presented depicts the eﬃciency of this\nproposed approach, which will\
    \ ensure appropriate classiﬁcation. Multiclass classiﬁcation in agriculture\n\
    would further ﬁne-tune the recommendation system to guide farmers appropriately.\
    \ Rather than\nbinary classiﬁcation, this one would guide the farmers’ precisely.\
    \ Thus, this approach would provide\nreal-time data to ensure better crop yield\
    \ productivity.\nAuthor Contributions: This research speciﬁes below the individual\

    Abstract: The growth of the global population coupled with a decline in natural\
    \ resources, farmland,\nand the increase in unpredictable environmental conditions\
    \ leads to food security is becoming a major\nconcern for all nations worldwide.\
    \ These problems are motivators that are driving the agricultural\nindustry to\
    \ transition to smart agriculture with the application of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) and\nbig data solutions to improve operational efﬁciency and productivity.\
    \ The IoT integrates a series\nof existing state-of-the-art solutions and technologies,\
    \ such as wireless sensor networks, cognitive\nradio ad hoc networks, cloud computing,\
    \ big data, and end-user applications. This study presents\na survey of IoT solutions\
    \ and demonstrates how IoT can be integrated into the smart agriculture\nsector.\
    \ To achieve this objective, we discuss the vision of IoT-enabled smart agriculture\
    \ ecosystems\nby evaluating their architecture (IoT devices, communication technologies,\
    \ big data storage, and\nprocessing), their applications, and research timeline.\
    \ In addition, we discuss trends and opportunities\nof IoT applications for smart\
    \ agriculture and also indicate the open issues and challenges of IoT\napplication\
    \ in smart agriculture. We hope that the ﬁndings of this study will constitute\
    \ important\nguidelines in research and promotion of IoT solutions aiming to improve\
    \ the productivity and quality\nof the agriculture sector as well as facilitating\
    \ the transition towards a future sustainable environment\nwith an agroecological\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: sustainable agriculture; food security; green technologies;\

    1. Introduction\nIn order to meet the current global needs of humanity, new solutions\
    \ and technologies\nare constantly being proposed and implemented. This has led\
    \ to the advent of the Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) [1,2]. IoT is deﬁned as the\
    \ network of all objects that are embedded\nwithin devices, sensors, machines,\
    \ software and people through the Internet environment\nto communicate, exchange\
    \ information and interact in order to provide a comprehen-\nsive solution between\
    \ the real world and the virtual world [3]. In recent years, IoT has\nbeen applied\
    \ in a series of domains, such as smart homes [4,5], smart cities [6,7], smart\n\
    energy [8,9], autonomous vehicles [10,11], smart agriculture [12–15], campus manage-\n\
    ment [16,17], healthcare [18,19], and logistics [20,21]. Series of other IoT applications\
    \ have\nbeen described by Shaﬁque et al. [22]. An illustration of rich and diverse\
    \ IoT applications\nfor smart agriculture is provided in Figure 1.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12073396\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n2 of 19\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing\
    \ agricultural production, new solutions and \ntechnologies have been introduced\
    \ in the agriculture sector [24]. An emerging trend is the \napplication of the\
    \ IoT and big data. A significant number of studies have been focused on \nresearch,\
    \ experiments, and applications [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over\
    \ 500 \nbillion IoT devices will be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The\
    \ use of IoT and big \ndata will enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance\
    \ efficiency and productivity \n[28]. \n \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications\
    \ for smart agriculture. \nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have\
    \ been strongly applied in the \nagricultural sector, building the foundation\
    \ for developing smart agriculture [29]. The \nunique characteristics of WSN,\
    \ such as the ability to self-organize, self-configure, self-es-\ntablish, and\
    \ self-recover, make it suitable for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device\
    \ \nconsists of a radio frequency (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and\
    \ battery power \n[31]. The WSN focuses on applications such as environmental\
    \ monitoring, machine con-\ntrol automation, and traceability [32–35]. \nAlong\
    \ with the development of science and technology, the urgent requirement for \n\
    breakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at improving productivity and efficiency\
    \ \nin the agriculture sector has led to adoption of the IoT. The primary motivation\
    \ for their \napplications is the breakthrough progress of smart agriculture and\
    \ its inevitable role as \nthe future of smart and sustainable environment management.\
    \ IoT integrates a series of \nexisting solutions and technologies, such as WSN,\
    \ cognitive radio, ad hoc networks, cloud \ncomputing, and end-user applications\
    \ [36]. In the smart agricultural sector, automation \nsolutions and technologies,\
    \ mechanical machines, knowledge, decision-making tools, ser-\nvices, and software\
    \ are integrated seamlessly to help farmers improve productivity, prod-\nuct quality,\
    \ and profitability [37]. \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications for\
    \ smart agriculture.\nAccording to the United Nations’ (UN 2019) statistics, the\
    \ world population is esti-\nmated to grow to 10 billion by 2050 [23]. As a consequence,\
    \ the requirements of agricultural\nproducts are continually increasing. However,\
    \ farmlands are declining, natural resources\nare increasingly depleted, and the\
    \ rise of unpredictable nature challenges, such as global\nwarming, salinization,\
    \ and ﬂooding, make food security the most concerning problem for\nall nations\
    \ worldwide.\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing agricultural production,\
    \ new solutions and\ntechnologies have been introduced in the agriculture sector\
    \ [24]. An emerging trend is the\napplication of the IoT and big data. A signiﬁcant\
    \ number of studies have been focused on\nresearch, experiments, and applications\
    \ [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over 500\nbillion IoT devices will\
    \ be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The use of IoT and big data\nwill\
    \ enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance efﬁciency and productivity\
    \ [28].\nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been strongly applied\
    \ in the agri-\ncultural sector, building the foundation for developing smart\
    \ agriculture [29]. The unique\ncharacteristics of WSN, such as the ability to\

    \ for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device consists of a\nradio frequency\
    \ (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and battery power [31]. The WSN\n\
    focuses on applications such as environmental monitoring, machine control automation,\n\
    and traceability [32–35].\nAlong with the development of science and technology,\
    \ the urgent requirement for\nbreakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at\
    \ improving productivity and efﬁciency\nin the agriculture sector has led to adoption\

    \ of 135 relevant works published between 2017 and 2022 was con-\nducted. Firstly,\

    \ speed, wind\ndirection, and solar radiation, and barometric pressure [21,24,36].\n\
    2.2. Communication Technology\nThe survey of communication technologies for IoT\
    \ [43,44] indicated that to integrate\nIoT into the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ communication technologies must progressively\nimprove the evolution of IoT\
    \ devices. They play an important role in the development of\nIoT systems. The\
    \ existing communication solutions can be classiﬁed as: protocol, spectrum,\n\
    and topology.\nProtocols: many wireless communication protocols have been proposed\
    \ for the smart\nagriculture sector. Based on these protocols, devices in a smart\
    \ agricultural system can\ninteract, exchange information, and make decisions\
    \ to monitor and control farming condi-\ntions and improve yields and production\
    \ efﬁciency. The typical, low-power communication\nprotocol numbers commonly used\
    \ in smart agriculture can be divided into short-range and\nlong-range categories\
    \ based on the communication range.\n-\nShort-range: NFMI (near-ﬁeld magnetic\
    \ induction) [45], Bluetooth [46], ZigBee [47],\nterahertz (Z-Wave) [48,49], and\
    \ RFID [50].\n-\nLong-range: LoRa [51], Sigfox [52], and NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)\
    \ [53].\nTable 1 presents some typical communication technologies for the smart\
    \ agriculture\nsector. The values in Table 1 indicate that short-range communication\
    \ technologies have\na transmission distance of less than 20 (m), high energy\
    \ efﬁciency, and low data rate.\nThese protocols are often employed in sensor\
    \ networks, while long-range communication\ntechnologies have transmission distances\
    \ of up to several tens of kilometres, consume more\nenergy, and are installed\
    \ for backhaul device-to-device communications. A diverse survey\nof low-power\
    \ communication technologies for IoT that presents solutions, challenges, and\n\
    some open issues is described by Sundaram et al. [54].\nTable 1. Some typical\

    Spectrum: Each radio device uses certain frequency bands for communication. The\n\
    FCC (Federal Communications Commission) has deﬁned unlicensed spectrum bands for\n\
    unlicensed operations in scientiﬁc, industrial, and medical purposes [55]. These\
    \ spectrum\nbands are often applied for low-power levels and short-range applications.\
    \ Consequently, a\nseries of common technologies for the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ from wireless machine con-\ntrol and UAVs to communication technologies such\
    \ as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, use unlicensed\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n6 of 19\n\
    spectrum bands [56]. However, the use of unlicensed spectra faces several challenges,\
    \ such\nas the quality of service guarantee, the cost of setting up the initial\
    \ infrastructure, and the\ninterference generated by the huge number of IoT devices\
    \ [57,58].\nA licensed spectrum usually is allocated to mobile networks. It provides\
    \ more efﬁcient\nnetwork trafﬁc, more reliability, enhances the quality of service\
    \ (QoS), offers security,\nprovides extensive coverage, and involves lower initialization\
    \ infrastructure costs for users.\nHowever, the use of licensed spectrum bands\
    \ has faced some limitations, such as high data\ntransmission costs and the low\
    \ energy efﬁciency of IoT devices [59].\nSeveral recent studies have demonstrated\
    \ the efﬁciency of unlicensed spectrum bands\nin the mm wave range. It uses extremely\
    \ low power but provides large transmission\ndistances and high data rates [60,61].\
    \ One limitation of the mm wave spectrum is that the\ndata rate is strongly affected\
    \ by weather conditions, especially rain [62].\nTopology: The establishment of\
    \ the communication spectrum band and operation pro-\ntocol of IoT devices depends\
    \ on the structure that deploys IoT devices for smart agriculture\napplications.\
    \ Network structures for smart agriculture usually have two main types of\nnodes:\
    \ sensor and backhaul nodes [63]. The common characteristics of IoT sensor nodes\n\
    are short communication distance, low data rate, and high energy efﬁciency. In\
    \ contrast,\nIoT backhaul nodes often require large transmission distances, high\
    \ throughput, and data\nrates. Therefore, based on the role of each IoT network\
    \ node, the sensor node or backhaul\nnode selects and installs appropriate communication\
    \ technologies [64]. Figure 5 presents a\ntypical low-power network topology designed\
    \ for measuring and monitoring factors in a\nsmart farm. The system includes:\n\
    (1)\nIoT sensor nodes collect information from the farming environment, such as\
    \ soil\nmoisture, air humidity, temperature, nutrient ingredients of soil, pest\
    \ images, and\nwater quality, then transmit collected data to IoT backhaul devices.\
    \ Depending on\nthe operation purpose and installation location, IoT sensor nodes\
    \ can be installed as\nRFDs (reduced-function devices), which only communicate\
    \ with FFDs (full-function\ndevices). These nodes cannot communicate with the\
    \ other RFDs, aiming to save\nenergy and decrease investment costs.\n(2)\nIoT\
    \ backhaul nodes, besides having the role of an IoT sensor node, also play a role\
    \ as\nintermediate nodes to receive information from other IoT nodes and transmit\
    \ it to the\ncontrol centre. IoT backhaul nodes are often installed as an FFD\
    \ device, which can\nconnect to other FDD and RFD devices.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\

    \ besides the main problems of sensing, collecting\ndata, and controlling devices\
    \ to respond to the real farming environment, data storage and\nprocessing are\
    \ also important problems and face some challenges [26,28]. In reality, the\n\
    number of collected data is huge, and traditional data storage, organization,\
    \ and processing\nsolutions are not feasible. Therefore, big data processing solutions\
    \ need to be researched\nand applied for smart agriculture [65,66].\nThe complexity\
    \ of data storage and processing is due to the unique characteristics\nof the\
    \ smart agriculture ﬁeld, including unstructured data and various formats, such\n\
    as text, images, audio and video, economic ﬁgures, and market information. Recent\n\
    solutions and technologies have introduced the use of cloud platforms for storage\
    \ and\ndata analytics, which are collected from farms [36,67]. In addition, cloud-assisted\
    \ big data\nanalytic solutions, such as edge computing [68] or fog computing [69],\
    \ are also proposed to\nreduce latency and costs and support QoS.\nThe survey\
    \ results demonstrate that, in recent years, many management information\nsystems\
    \ for smart agriculture have been proposed [70–72]. Nowadays, possible solutions\n\
    have been developed and commercialized, providing solutions and services for farmers\n\
    to manage farms and ﬁelds, aiming to increase productivity, reduce human labour,\
    \ and\nenhance farming efﬁciency, as follows:\n-\nOnFarm [73]: It is part of the\

    \ IoT platform that aims to provide comprehensive, end-\nto-end solutions for\
    \ farmers, including: (1) connecting and managing IoT devices in\nfarms or ﬁelds;\
    \ and (2) monitoring and controlling behaviours of devices based on\ndata analysis\
    \ results.\n-\nFarmlogs [80]: It is a platform that provides tools and solutions\
    \ for: (1) automating\nthe production cost calculation process; (2) managing the\
    \ day-to-day activities of the\nfarm in real-time; and (3) supporting marketing\
    \ and increasing sales of products.\n3. Typical Applications of IoT in Smart Agriculture\n\
    In recent years, a series of IoT applications for agriculture have been introduced.\n\
    According to survey results, we divided these applications into categories based\
    \ on their\npurpose, including monitoring, tracking and traceability, and greenhouse\
    \ production. The\ndetailed results are presented in the following subsection.\n\
    3.1. Monitoring\nIn the agriculture sector, factors affecting the farming and\
    \ production process can be\nmonitored and collected, such as soil moisture, air\
    \ humidity, temperature, pH level, etc.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n8 of 19\n\
    These factors depend on the considered agricultural sector. Some smart agricultural\
    \ sectors\nare applying the following monitoring solutions:\nCrop Farming: In\
    \ this sector, some vital factors that affect the farming process and\nproduction\
    \ efﬁciency include air temperature, precipitation, air humidity, soil moisture,\n\
    salinity, solar radiation, pest status, soil nutrient ingredients, etc. In [81],\
    \ the authors\ndesigned an IoT device called FarmFox. This device allows real-time\
    \ collection and analysis\nof the composition of the farming soil and transmits\
    \ the information to farmers/owners\nvia the Internet. The results demonstrate\
    \ the health of the soil is monitored in real time to\nprovide timely recommendations\
    \ to farmers aiming to increase productivity and farming\nefﬁciency.\nFurthermore,\
    \ in [82], the authors proposed an IoT device to allow intelligent control\nof\
    \ temperature and humidity factors, called a weather radar. This device will automatically\n\
    turn on the warning mode using the light signal and send messages to the farmer\
    \ when the\ntemperature or humidity exceeds a pre-installed threshold. In [83],\
    \ the authors introduced\nan IoT system based on Web GIS to monitor pest status\
    \ and provide early warnings. In\naddition, this study also proposes a predictive\
    \ model based on monitoring the habitat of\npests and diseases. The efﬁciency\
    \ of the proposed system was indicated, based on the\npredicted ﬁgures of the\
    \ locust epidemic, to have a high accuracy rate (over 87%) in 2019\n(China).\n\
    Monitoring information, such as soil condition, moisture, and temperature, and\
    \ the\nprediction of natural factors, such as rainfall and weather, support the\
    \ control of growing\nconditions of crops, helping farmers plan and make irrigation\
    \ decisions to optimize pro-\nduction and reduce labour costs. In addition, the\
    \ collected data, combined with big data\nprocessing technology, can provide recommendations\
    \ for implementing preventive and\nremedial solutions against pests and diseases\
    \ in farming.\nAquaponics: It is an integration of aquaculture and hydroponics.\
    \ Aquaponics is a\nfarming technique where ﬁsh waste becomes a source of nutrients\
    \ needed by plants. One of\nthe most important issues in such farms is constantly\
    \ monitoring water quality, water level,\ntemperature, salinity, pH, sunlight,\
    \ etc. [84]. According to this research direction, in [85],\nthe authors designed\
    \ an IoT system to monitor the temperature and pH value of water for\naquaponics\
    \ farms. Moreover, this system is also equipped with a control system of water\n\
    metrics to keep the ﬁsh habitat stable and an automatic ﬁsh feeding function to\
    \ increase\nthe productivity of the ﬁsh. The results show that the IoT system\
    \ had stable operation and\nprovided real-time monitoring parameters. The authors\
    \ of [86] designed an aquaponics\nfarm for households/urban areas based on IoT.\
    \ This system recommends the proper ratio\nof ﬁsh and plants.\nConsequently, the\
    \ system decreases feed consumption as well as reduces carbon\nemissions into\
    \ the environment. The primary purpose of this proposal aims to balance the\n\
    self-sustaining ability of the aquaponics system. The experimental results demonstrate\
    \ the\nnumber of ﬁsh decreases from 30 to 15, and the number of plants increases\
    \ from 20 to 30,\nbut the crop production will increase by more than 50%. A detailed\
    \ and diverse survey of\nthe IoT systems and devices for control and monitoring\
    \ of aquaponics farms is introduced\nin [87]. Based on the obtained data, monitoring\
    \ can improve the production of ﬁsh and\nplants through the control, supplementation,\
    \ and regulation of nutritional ingredients in\nthe water. The collected data\
    \ were also used to automate the management of aquaponics\nfarms to reduce labour\
    \ costs.\nForestry: Humans depend on forests for survival. Moreover, forests play\
    \ a vital\nrole in the carbon cycle and provide a habitat for more than two-thirds\
    \ of animal species\nin the world. Forests also have the effect of protecting\
    \ watersheds, limiting ﬂoods, and\nmitigating climate change. The main factors\
    \ that need to be monitored in a forest include\nsoil ingredients, air temperature,\
    \ humidity, and concentration of several different gases,\nsuch as oxygen, methane,\
    \ ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide. A series of forest control\nsystems and solutions\
    \ are presented in [88,89] based on IoT and big data analytics.\nAppl. Sci. 2022,\
    \ 12, 3396\n9 of 19\nIn [90], the authors designed a peatland forest environmental\
    \ monitoring system.\nThis forest area plays a very vital role in the rainforest\
    \ ecosystem of Brunei. However,\nthe peatland forest type is very burnt. This\
    \ work designed an IoT system to monitor\nenvironmental conditions, such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, wind direction, barometric\npressure, and manage possible disasters.\
    \ For the purpose of enhancing feasibility, IoT\ndevices use the solar-powered\
    \ system and communicate with the monitoring centre based\non the LoRa network.\
    \ In [91], the authors proposed a solution to control forest changes\nand vitality\
    \ by using high-resolution RapidEye satellite imagery. This solution has been\n\
    deployed commercially in several states in Germany and has detected leaf diseases\
    \ in a\npine forest affected by pests. Survey results indicate that monitoring\
    \ in forestry focuses on\nproviding early warning systems against forest ﬁres,\
    \ pest control, or deforestation.\nLivestock Farming: It is deﬁned as the process\
    \ of raising domesticated animals, such as\ncows, pigs, sheep, and goats, chickens,\
    \ etc., in an agricultural environment to obtain traction,\nserve production,\
    \ and obtain products such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, etc. In this\narea,\
    \ the factors to be monitored depend on the type and number of farming animals\
    \ [92].\nIn [93], the authors designed a support system for the diagnosis, prevention,\
    \ and treatment\nof diseases for livestock called VetLink. This system can provide\
    \ recommendations for\nanimal health for farmers in rural areas where it is difﬁcult\
    \ to access veterinary doctors\nimmediately. In [94], the authors proposed a noncontact\
    \ temperature measurement system\nand monitoring of animals to ensure early detection\
    \ of diseases and animal health. This\nsystem can be used for remote monitoring\
    \ of animal health and timely anomaly detection.\nIn [95], the authors introduced\
    \ a monitoring system for large-scale pig farms based on IoT.\nThe speciﬁc solution\
    \ is to attach an IC tag on each pig to monitor the behaviour of each pig,\nsuch\
    \ as their period of feeding and resting and exercise. Data from sensors are collected\n\
    and combined with data analytics solutions that can make recommendations for pig\
    \ health.\nThe monitoring data of water, feed, and animal health for livestock\
    \ in the farming\nprocess helps farmers set up livestock plans, reduce labour\
    \ costs, and enhance production\nefﬁciency. While a series of solutions has been\
    \ provided for monitoring large-scale farms,\ntheir application in small and medium-sized\
    \ farms is very limited, especially in developing\ncountries. This can be attributed\
    \ to the high cost and the lack of knowledge needed to\nset up, manage, and operate\
    \ IoT systems. Therefore, effective and low-cost solutions for\nagricultural IoT\
    \ have much potential.\n3.2. Tracking and Tracing\nIn order to meet the needs\
    \ of consumers and increase proﬁt value, in the future, farms\nneed to demonstrate\
    \ that products offered to the market are clean products and can be\ntracked and\
    \ traced conveniently, thereby enhancing the trust of consumers in product\nsafety\
    \ and health-related issues. In order to solve this problem, a series of tracking-\
    \ and\ntracing-based problems for the smart agricultural sector has been proposed,\
    \ speciﬁcally as\nfollows:\nIn [96], the authors designed an information system\
    \ that allows tracking and tracing\nof agricultural products and foods such as\
    \ dairy and vegetables, called SISTABENE. This\nsystem helps suppliers track the\
    \ production process and errors arising in the supply chain,\nand helps end-users\
    \ trace the origin of food. In [97], the authors proposed a food supply\nchain\
    \ traceability system based on blockchain technology. It helps to track and trace\
    \ agri-\nfood supply chains’ production process and trace the origin of agricultural\
    \ products. This\nsolution has been employed at Shanwei Lvfengyuan Modern Agricultural\
    \ Development\nCo., Ltd. (Shanwei, China). Although there are still limitations,\
    \ the results demonstrate\nthat this solution has successfully supported the tracing\
    \ of food and agricultural prod-\nucts through QR codes, improving product quality\
    \ and ensuring the clear traceability of\nproducts. In [98,99], the authors proposed\
    \ smart agricultural solutions to tracking and\ntracing agricultural products,\
    \ thereby allowing consumers to know the product’s entire\nhistory. These solutions\
    \ enable tracking and tracing some of the data collected along the\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n10 of 19\nsupply chain, ensuring that consumers and other stakeholders\
    \ can identify products’ origin,\nlocation, and history.\n3.3. Smart Precision\
    \ Farming\nThe advent of the GPS (global positioning system) has created breakthrough\
    \ advances\nin many ﬁelds of science and technology. The GPS provides the most\
    \ important parameters\nfor locating a device, such as location and time. GPS\
    \ systems have been successfully\ndeployed in many ﬁelds, such as smartphones,\
    \ vehicles, and IoT ecosystems. However,\nGPS is only good support for outdoor\
    \ systems and the sky. Meanwhile, the demand\nfor the locating and navigating\
    \ systems in the home and on the streets of smart cities is\ngrowing rapidly.\
    \ Aiming to solve this problem, an advanced global navigation satellite\nsystem\
    \ (GNSS) is being deployed [100]. Based on GPS and GNSS systems, suitable farming\n\
    maps have been established for ﬁelds and farms. As a result, agricultural machinery\
    \ and\nequipment can be operated autonomously [101]. Figure 6 presents an illustration\
    \ of the\ntypical cloud-assisted, IoT-based precision agriculture platform.\n\

    \ machines to operate autonomously and remotely via the Internet \n[107]. \n \n\
    Figure 6. Cloud-assisted IoT-based precision agriculture platform. \n3.4. Greenhouse\
    \ Production \nA greenhouse consists of walls and a roof, which are usually made\
    \ from transparent \nmaterials, such as plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants\
    \ are grown in a controlled envi-\nronment, including controlling for moisture,\
    \ nutrient ingredients of the soil, light, tem-\nperature, etc. Consequently,\
    \ greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans to grow \nany plant, at any\
    \ time, by providing suitable environmental conditions [108]. Figure 7 \nillustrates\
    \ a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse farming factors \n\
    based on IoT ecosystems. \nIn [109], the authors introduced an IoT-based greenhouse\
    \ environmental monitoring \nsystem for multipoint monitoring in large greenhouses.\
    \ Instead of using multiple sensors \nat different locations, this solution involves\
    \ a drive system that allows the sensor system \ndiff\nl\ni\ni\nh\nh\nTh\ni\n\

    In smart precision farming, one of the most important applications is the use\
    \ of drones\nin monitoring and farming activities. Some common farming tasks using\
    \ UAVs include\nspraying pesticides, fertilizing, sowing seeds, evaluating and\
    \ mapping, and monitoring\ncrop growth. In [102], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ survey of drone applications for\nsmart agriculture, including applications,\
    \ control technology, and future trends of the UAV\napplication for smart agriculture.\
    \ In [103], the authors designed an automatic agricultural\nproduct classiﬁcation\
    \ system based on camera systems, image processing algorithms, and\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n11 of 19\nmechanical actuators. The experimental results for\
    \ agriculture products such as oranges\nand tomatoes present a classiﬁcation success\
    \ rate of over 95%, and the sorting time for each\nproduct is less than 1(s).\
    \ This solution can be adapted and applied to the classiﬁcation of\ndifferent\
    \ agricultural products. In [104], the authors proposed a solution to estimate\
    \ grape\nproduction. The proposed solution combines an RGB-D camera mounted on\
    \ a mobile robot\nplatform and size estimation algorithm for a bunch of grapes.\
    \ The experimental results\npresent an average error in the range of [2.8–3.5]\
    \ (cm). The results demonstrate this solution\nis a feasible method for evaluating\
    \ the productivity of large-scale grape farms.\nThe survey results show that smart\
    \ precision agricultural equipment, such as irriga-\ntion systems, unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAV), and smart agricultural equipment, etc.,\nare conﬁgurable in\
    \ an autonomous-control mode based on certain conditions or can be\ncontrolled\
    \ remotely by the farmer via the Internet [105,106]. Smart precision farming helps\n\
    to improve productivity and production efﬁciency and is suitable for large-scale\
    \ farms.\nNowadays, suppliers of precision agricultural equipment have IoT modules\
    \ built into their\nmachines, allowing machines to operate autonomously and remotely\
    \ via the Internet [107].\n3.4. Greenhouse Production\nA greenhouse consists of\
    \ walls and a roof, which are usually made from transparent\nmaterials, such as\
    \ plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants are grown in a controlled\nenvironment,\
    \ including controlling for moisture, nutrient ingredients of the soil, light,\n\
    temperature, etc. Consequently, greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans\
    \ to\ngrow any plant, at any time, by providing suitable environmental conditions\
    \ [108]. Figure 7\nillustrates a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse\

    \ Research Directions \nThe survey results indicate that IoT components for the\
    \ smart agriculture sector, in-\ncluding hardware and software, have been focused\
    \ on research and achieved many break-\nthrough results. Several IoT solutions\
    \ have been deployed on large-scale farms/fields. \nHowever, the widespread deployment\
    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some \nchallenges. We have\
    \ present two main problems: economic efficiency and technical prob-\nlems. We\
    \ consider these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration\
    \ of IoT \ntechnologies in agriculture. \nFigure 7. An illustration of IoT application\
    \ for monitoring farming conditions in a greenhouse.\nIn [109], the authors introduced\
    \ an IoT-based greenhouse environmental monitoring\nsystem for multipoint monitoring\
    \ in large greenhouses. Instead of using multiple sensors\nat different locations,\
    \ this solution involves a drive system that allows the sensor system\nto move\
    \ to different locations in the greenhouse. The experimental results show that\
    \ the\nproposed system can effectively monitor multiple points in large greenhouses.\
    \ In [110], the\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n12 of 19\nauthors introduced an energy-saving\
    \ temperature control technology for smart greenhouses.\nThis study proposed two\
    \ intelligent control methods: active disturbance rejection control\nand fuzzy\
    \ active disturbance rejection control. The experimental results demonstrate\n\
    that the proposed technology saves over 15% of the total energy consumption of\
    \ the\ngreenhouse. In [111], the authors designed an intelligent IoT system to\
    \ monitor and\ncontrol greenhouse temperature for energy efﬁciency and improve\
    \ crop productivity. The\nexperimental results for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\
    \ where daytime temperatures can be\nabove 50 ◦C, demonstrate the efﬁciency of\
    \ the proposed solution, including saving energy\nand predicting the rate of plant\
    \ growth.\nRecent studies indicated that solutions integrating IoT, big data processing,\
    \ and artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence could be applied in greenhouses to reduce labour\
    \ and energy efﬁciency.\nMoreover, it also provides direct connections between\
    \ the greenhouse farms and the cus-\ntomer [112–115].\n4. Challenges and Open\
    \ Research Directions\nThe survey results indicate that IoT components for the\
    \ smart agriculture sector,\nincluding hardware and software, have been focused\
    \ on research and achieved many\nbreakthrough results. Several IoT solutions have\
    \ been deployed on large-scale farms/ﬁelds.\nHowever, the widespread deployment\
    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some\nchallenges. We have present\
    \ two main problems: economic efﬁciency and technical prob-\nlems. We consider\
    \ these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration of IoT\n\
    technologies in agriculture.\n4.1. Economic Efﬁciency\nIn agricultural economics,\
    \ one of the most important characteristics is a low rate of\nproﬁt of an investment\
    \ project, which presents many risks from natural conditions. The\nbeneﬁt–cost\
    \ of a new technology seeking deployment in agriculture should be carefully\n\
    calculated to ensure a trade-off between the cost of technology implementation\
    \ and the\nproﬁt potential. Therefore, we discuss the economic aspects related\
    \ to IoT implementation\nin smart agriculture.\nThere are several types of costs\
    \ related to the implementation of IoT in agriculture.\nWe divided them into categories,\
    \ including (1) the system initialization cost and (2) the\nsystem operating cost.\
    \ The system initialization cost includes hardware purchases (IoT\ndevices, gateways,\
    \ base station infrastructure). The system operating cost includes service\nregistration\
    \ cost and the cost of labour to manage IoT devices. Furthermore, additional op-\n\
    erating costs include incurred costs from energy consumption, maintenance, data\
    \ exchange\namong IoT devices, gateways and cloud servers. According to the opinion\
    \ of Turgut and\nBoloni [116], the successful deployment of the IoT technologies\
    \ will only happen if the\ncustomer beneﬁts (customers need to know the beneﬁts\
    \ and potential) that IoT systems\nprovide exceed their physical value and privacy\
    \ costs. The businesses participating in the\nIoT domain will proﬁt and achieve\
    \ success. We can describe this process using these two\nconditions, as follows:\n\
    Success o f IoT Applications=\n\x1A Vservice > Cpri + Cuser\nh\n+ Cpay, Farmer\
    \ Bene f its\n(1)\nVin f o + Rpay > Cbusiness\nh\n, Businesses Bene f its\n(2)\n\
    where\nVservice is the expected value received by the IoT service users.\nCpri\
    \ is the cost of the loss of privacy.\nCuser\nh\nis the equipment and hardware\
    \ costs the user pays.\nCpay is the payment for the service fee.\nVin f o is the\
    \ received information value.\nRpay is the received direct payment.\nCbusiness\n\
    h\nis the share of the hardware and maintenance costs of the business.\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n13 of 19\nAccording to the opinion of the service user\
    \ (farmers or the owner of the farm),\nEquation (1) shows that the perceived value\
    \ of the service for the user (Vservice) must be\nhigher than the total of costs,\
    \ including: the cost of the loss of privacy (Cpri), the equipment\nand hardware\
    \ costs the user pays (Cuser\nh\n), and the payments for the service fee (Cpay),\
    \ while\nthe opinion of the service provider, as shown in Equation (2), shows\
    \ that the received\ninformation value (Vin f o) and the received direct payments\
    \ (Rpay) must be higher than the\nshare of the hardware and maintenance costs\
    \ of the business (Cbusiness\nh\n).\nThere is still a gap between service providers\
    \ and service users (farmers or the owner\nof the farm), leading to the slow deployment\
    \ of IoT applications in smart agriculture. In\nterms of the economic aspect,\
    \ the analyzed results show that the need for a support policy\nfrom regulatory\
    \ agencies and governments to allow service providers and service users\nto use\
    \ IoT-based smart agriculture applications in their infancy can be met. As discussed\n\
    in [117], to promote smart agriculture, the European Union has issued supportive\
    \ economic\npolicies, the so-called the European CAP (Common Agricultural Policy),\
    \ whose annual\nbudget amounts to approximately EUR 59 billion and is paid for\
    \ by the nations of the EU.\nIn our view, to be able to apply IoT in the ﬁeld\
    \ of smart agriculture, service costs\n(Cpay) and the operating and system initialization\
    \ cost of IoT (Cuser\nh\n) needs to constantly be\nimproved and optimized to reduce\
    \ the cost of the IoT services for farmers. In addition, IoT\nbusinesses (service\
    \ providers) also need to maximize the value of information obtained\n(Vin f o)\
    \ to improve the proﬁtability of the service providers.\nIn reality, service providers\
    \ may commercially exploit the information received (Vin f o)\nin the period of\
    \ providing services for farms, aiming to encourage the deployment of\nIoT applications\
    \ in smart agriculture. Nowadays, several IoT platform providers allow\nfree registration\
    \ and use of services with some limitation conditions regarding services’\nfunctionality\
    \ and ability processing; the number of connected IoT devices; and the number\n\
    of data stored while premium functions and services charge users a fee.\nIn addition,\
    \ one of the signiﬁcant factors slowing down IoT adoption in agriculture\nis farmers’\
    \ knowledge and ability to use IoT devices. In developed countries, this issue\n\
    can be easily solved due to the accessibility of new technologies of farmers.\
    \ Otherwise, in\ndeveloping countries, where the majority of farmers in rural\
    \ areas have very limited access\nto advanced technologies, this issue is a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge [118,119].\n4.2. Technical Problems\nInterference: Deploying a huge\
    \ number of IoT devices for smart agriculture can\ncause interference to different\
    \ network systems, especially some IoT networks using short\nspectrum bands such\
    \ as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, and LoRa (See Table 1). Interference can\ndegrade\
    \ system performance as well as reduce the reliability of IoT ecosystems. IoT\n\
    networks that use cognitive technology to reuse unlicensed spectra increase the\
    \ cost of the\ndevice. In our opinion, the advent of the 6G network [120] will\
    \ allow a huge number of\ndevices to connect to the Internet with an extremely\
    \ high access speed and extremely large\nbandwidth. The full interference problem\
    \ of IoT networks will be solved.\nSecurity and Privacy: One of the most important\
    \ problems of applying IoT in smart\nagriculture is the security problem, including\
    \ the protection of data and systems from\nattacks on the Internet. In regard\
    \ to system security, IoT devices’ limited capacity and\nability led to complex\
    \ encryption algorithms that are impossible to implement on IoT\ndevices. As a\
    \ result, IoT systems can be attacked using the Internet to gain system control\n\
    rights; IoT gateways are also attacked via denial of service [121–123]. In addition,\
    \ cloud\nservers can be attacked by data spooﬁng to perform unauthorized tasks\
    \ that affect the\nautonomous farming processes of farms. Cloud infrastructures\
    \ can also be controlled by\nattackers [124,125]. Several issues of detailed IoT\
    \ data privacy and security measures have\nbeen discussed in [126–128]. According\
    \ to Neshenko et al., the IoT data security issue is one\nof the biggest problems\
    \ slowing down IoT adoption in smart agriculture [129].\nRegarding data security,\
    \ the obtained information from IoT systems in farms is col-\nlected, processed,\
    \ and commercially exploited by service providers to varying degrees.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n14 of 19\nTherefore, one of the most important problems of policies\
    \ regards the validity and legal\nstatus of farm data [130]. In reality, these\
    \ data are of great value when aggregated and\nanalyzed for large-scale agricultural\
    \ activities. Consequently, without policies, the data\nprivacy and security of\
    \ farms can affect the competitive advantage of farmers/farm owners.\nIn our opinion,\
    \ using cryptography coupled with access keys is a possible solution to\nsolve\
    \ this problem. Keys could be made available based on a regional user group and\n\
    to those who contributed to the database. For further complex cases, secure multiparty\n\
    computation can be used, where the homomorphic encryption method [131,132], or\
    \ this\nmethod combined with the blockchain [133], can be applied for the purpose\
    \ of balancing\nprivacy and data utility.\nIn our opinion, the security problems\
    \ of IoT systems will be an exciting research topic\nand garner attention for\
    \ both academia and industry research. An in-depth survey of\nthreats and solutions\
    \ to improve robustness, trust, and privacy for future IoT systems is\npresented\
    \ in [134].\nReliability: Most IoT devices are expected to be deployed outdoors\
    \ (in ﬁelds and\nfarms). Harsh work environments lead to the rapid degradation\
    \ of IoT devices’ quality and\ncan lead to unexpected manufacturer failures. The\
    \ mechanical safety of IoT devices and\nsystems must be ensured so they can withstand\
    \ extremes of weather, such as temperature,\nhumidity, rainstorms, and ﬂoods [135].\
    \ In our opinion, new materials and technologies\nneed to continue to be studied\
    \ to improve the durability of devices.\nThe open problems and challenges discussed\
    \ in this section indicate that for IoT\nto be widely deployed in the smart agriculture\
    \ sector, there are still many issues to be\nsolved. Service providers need to\
    \ reduce the service costs, more effectively exploiting\nthe information collected\
    \ from the farm. On the other hand, farmers need to improve\ntheir skills to be\
    \ able to apply IoT solutions on their farm to enhance productivity and\nfarming\
    \ efﬁciency. Researchers need to continually study and propose optimal solutions\n\
    and technologies to ensure IoT systems’ privacy and security and improve the durability\
    \ of\nIoT devices. These are really major challenges and exciting research topics\
    \ in the future so\nIoT can be widely applied in the smart agriculture sector.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we presented an overview of IoT and big data for\
    \ the smart agriculture\nsector. Several issues related to promoting IoT deployment\
    \ in the agriculture sector have\nbeen discussed in detail. Survey results indicate\
    \ that many studies have been performed\nto apply IoT for smart agriculture, aiming\
    \ to enhance productivity, reduce human labour,\nand improve production efﬁciency.\
    \ The beneﬁts of applying IoT and big data in agriculture\nwere discussed. In\
    \ addition, we also pointed out the challenges we need to overcome\nto be able\
    \ to accelerate the deployment of IoT in smart agriculture. However, there are\n\
    still some challenges that need to be addressed for IoT solutions to be affordable\
    \ for the\nmajority of farmers, including small- and medium-scale farm owners.\
    \ In addition, security\ntechnologies need to be continuously improved, but in\
    \ our opinion, the application of\nIoT solutions for smart agriculture is inevitable\
    \ and will enhance productivity, provide\nclean and green foods, support food\
    \ traceability, reduce human labour, and improve\nproduction efﬁciency. On the\
    \ other hand, this survey also points out some interesting\nresearch directions\
    \ for security and communication technologies for IoT. We think that\nthese will\
    \ be very exciting research directions in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ (WSNs) and unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) with electric propulsion are emerging\
    \ as state-of-the-art solutions for large scale\nmonitoring. Main advances stemming\
    \ both from complex system architectures as well as powerful\nembedded computing\
    \ and communication platforms, advanced sensing and networking protocols\nhave\
    \ been leveraged to prove the viability of this concept. The design of suitable\
    \ algorithms for\ndata processing, communication and control across previously\
    \ disparate domains has thus currently\nbecome an intensive area of interdisciplinary\
    \ research. The paper was focused on the collaborative\naspects of UAV–WSN systems\
    \ and the reference papers were analyzed from this point of view, on\neach functional\
    \ module. The paper oﬀers a timely review of recent advances in this area of critical\n\
    interest with focus on a comparative perspective across multiple recent theoretical\
    \ and applied\ncontributions. A systematic approach is carried out in order to\
    \ structure a unitary from conceptual\ndesign towards key implementation aspects.\
    \ Focus areas are identiﬁed and discussed such as\ndistributed data processing\
    \ algorithms, hierarchical multi-protocol networking aspects and high level\n\
    WSN–constrained UAV-control. Application references are highlighted in various\
    \ domains such as\nenvironmental, agriculture, emergency situations and homeland\
    \ security. Finally, a research agenda\nis outlined to advance the ﬁeld towards\
    \ tangible economic and social impact.\nKeywords: unmanned aerial system; wireless\

    \ unmanned aerial vehicle-wireless sensor network (UAV–WSN)\nsystems for surveillance,\
    \ exploring and monitoring large regions of interest is increasingly strong today.\n\
    These systems are able to integrate information from ground (WSN), air (UAV),\
    \ space (satellite—GPS\nor equivalent) and internet. The advantage of these collaborative\
    \ systems has been emphasized for\nlarge-scale monitoring [1], increasing mobility,\
    \ accessibility and reaction time in case of emergency.\nThe main novelty included\
    \ a hybrid system architecture for data collection, which integrates an optimal\n\
    method for the UAV trajectory design in conjunction with cluster head selection\
    \ schemes at the ground\nsensor level. Practical development and implementation\
    \ allow validation of the proposed theoretical\napproach in scalable fashion with\
    \ tens to hundreds of ground nodes. Field level data is ﬁrst aggregated\nat the\
    \ node level before being relayed through the UAV systems to the central gateway.\
    \ Salient example\nof data aggregation methods is represented by consensus algorithms,\
    \ which allow for distributed\nagreement locally thereby reducing the burden on\
    \ the communication channels and reducing overall\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690; doi:10.3390/s19214690\n\

    \ WSN transmission schedules with UAV over ﬂight patterns is also highly relevant\n\
    for the collaborative aspects of such large-scale monitoring systems. Neither\
    \ of the subsystems is\neﬃcient in what regards data transmission, reliability\
    \ and duration of functioning by itself. Managing\ncommunication only through\
    \ ground sensors would quickly deplete their batteries and using only\nUAVs would\
    \ be wasteful from an energy point of view. Thus, a mix between these two types\
    \ of agents\n(ﬁxed and mobile) provides a solution, which is better than the sum\
    \ of their parts.\nAlongside this initial example there are many relevant and\
    \ recent contributions, mostly in the form\nof papers, research projects and commercial\
    \ products concerning either WSN or UAV implementations.\nNeither of these subsystems\
    \ is eﬃcient in what regards data transmission, reliability and duration of\n\
    functioning by itself. Managing communication only through ground sensors would\
    \ quickly deplete\ntheir batteries and using only UAVs would be wasteful from\
    \ an energy point of view. Thus, a mix\nbetween these two types of agents (ﬁxed\
    \ and mobile) provides a solution, which is better than the sum\nof their parts.\n\
    Several surveys are also available that synthesize the characteristics, application\
    \ areas and challenges\nin each of them, such as [2–6] for WSN and [7,8] for UAV.\
    \ Over time, sensor networks have been\nwidely used for data collection in both\
    \ outdoor and indoor settings and in various application domains.\nGradually,\
    \ given significant technological development, the sensor networks have been enhanced\
    \ with\ndata processing elements, towards on-board intelligence. WSN design considerations,\
    \ mainly relating\nto: production cost, accessibility, scalability and reliability,\
    \ networking protocols, physical constraints\nsuch as: energy consumption, communication\
    \ range and autonomy, data transmission and processing\ncapabilities have been\
    \ analyzed in many papers in the last years. The reference WSN architecture has\
    \ a\nhierarchical tree structure and includes several sensing nodes (SN) grouped\
    \ around a cluster head (CH).\nThe CH is responsible for collecting and aggregating\
    \ sensor data to make it available to the user [1].\nMore complex architectures\
    \ focus on optimizing packet transmission time and reliability and involve\nmulti-hop,\
    \ mesh routing and even adaptive and dynamic topologies, such as in cellular networks,\n\
    where challenge arise as nodes can join or leave the network at any time.\nOn\
    \ the other hand, unmanned aerial vehicles experienced a rapid development as\
    \ they enabled\nfast access to otherwise inaccessible areas, with initial focus\
    \ in military and disaster management ﬁelds.\nThey were referred in the literature\
    \ under various names such as: UAVs, drones, aerial platforms\nand aerial robots.\
    \ UAVs can be characterized according to diﬀerent categories: (a) according to\n\
    the type of communication: open, speciﬁc and certiﬁed—EASA (European Aviation\
    \ Safety Agency)\nclassiﬁcation [9]; (b) according to the type of motor: with\
    \ thermal or electric motors and (c) according\nto the type of wing: airplane\
    \ type (ﬁxed wing) or helicopter type (rotor or multi-copter). The EASA\nrules,\
    \ which are based on the evaluation of the risk of operation, establishes the\
    \ obligations of drone\nmanufacturers and operators in terms of safety, respect\
    \ for privacy, the environment, protection against\nnoise and security. Thus,\
    \ starting from June 2020 all drone operators shall register themselves and\n\
    receive an authorization before using a UAV. The registration number needs to\
    \ be displayed on the\nUAV. It must be speciﬁed if the UAV path is below 120 m\
    \ (visual line of sight—VLOS) or more (beyond\nvisual line of sight—BVLOS). Increased\
    \ pay-load capabilities have allowed equipping them with\ncameras to easily survey\
    \ a given area, with small tanks of chemical solutions for spraying pesticides\n\
    or ﬁre extinguishing and even with WSN nodes for faster deployment. While the\
    \ basic architecture\nconsiders a single UAV and one or more base stations for\
    \ transmitting trajectory parameters, more\nrecent advances analyze multi-copter\
    \ applications, with or without inter-UAV cooperation to overcome\nenergy and\
    \ distance limitations. Probably the most important issue is that these devices\
    \ raised safety\nconcerns regarding the allocation of airspace, which is currently\
    \ separated from that of commercial\nairplanes or helicopters. This problem is\
    \ under analysis at both research and institutional/regulatory\nlevels and it\
    \ is expected that by using speciﬁc intelligent technologies to reduce the risk\
    \ both in the air\nand on ground, a suitable and widely adopted solution will\
    \ be identiﬁed [9].\nWhile neither WSN nor UAV architectures lack individual applicability,\
    \ in the last years researchers\nshowed interest in integrating these technologies.\
    \ Motivated by the current evolving requirements for\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690\n\
    3 of 40\nmonitoring and data collection from extensive geographical spaces, collaborative,\
    \ hybrid (air-ground\nor mobile-ﬁxed) UAV–WSN systems have been developed [1,10].\
    \ The eﬃcient use in wide areas of\nthe UAV–WSN collaborative systems, however,\
    \ requires an artiﬁcial intelligence component for the\nacquisition, transmission\
    \ and processing of data as well as for the control of the mission. Although\n\
    commercially UAVs with diﬀerent propulsion systems are available, in this paper\
    \ we will only\nhave under consideration those with electric propulsion, which\
    \ are generally small, with reduced\nmaintenance and operational costs. This is\
    \ also aligned with the current regulatory context in Europe\nand beyond concerning\
    \ the reduction of carbon emissions, which is driving electriﬁcation in the\n\
    transport sector. Electric cars replacing gas-powered vehicles represent just\
    \ one salient example.\nFor most monitoring applications, the use of UAV with\
    \ electric propulsion is currently widespread.\nConsidering the reduced ﬂight\
    \ autonomy in comparison to thermal powered versions, one solution\nto extend\
    \ the useful coverage area is to deploy multi-UAV systems. On the other hand,\
    \ satellites\nare currently indispensable for most global navigation and other\
    \ applications, but they can also\nbe leveraged as complementary support infrastructure\
    \ for transmitting data or commands for the\nanalyzed UAV–WSN systems. Their impact\
    \ on the environment however should also be accounted for,\nespecially due to\
    \ the release of small particles by rockets at launched [11].\nThis paper aims\
    \ to review and highlight the collaborative aspect between the mentioned elements,\n\
    organized in an integrated UAV–WSN architecture, as well as the intelligent data\
    \ processing, computation,\ncommunication and control methods for carrying out\
    \ specific monitoring and evaluation tasks in certain\nfields such as: transport,\
    \ agriculture, disaster management, environmental assessment, etc.\nThe paper\
    \ topic is broad, including many keywords, but they must be viewed from the standpoint\n\
    of the collaborative, integrated UAV–WSN system, as they are a means of integration\
    \ and collaboration\nbetween ground agents (WSN) and air agents (UAV). On the\
    \ other hand, the ways in which the diﬀerent\nfunctional components of the system\
    \ collaborate with each other were highlighted. For example, the\nmotion planning\
    \ procedures are discussed from the viewpoint of their interaction with the rest\
    \ of the\nWSN: path with sensory data collection, image acquisition and processing,\
    \ eﬃcient communication\nwith data collection and processing, etc.\nRecently,\
    \ many studies have been carried out on the integration of UAV–WSN systems into\
    \ the\nInternet of things (IoT) paradigm for long-distance mission communication\
    \ and control or for cloud\nprocessing and storage. With the increasing number\
    \ of papers in IoT technologies and considering the\nIoT role as a data sensing\
    \ and/or actuating node, we believe it is of great interest including this topic\n\
    in our research. Not the least important, a special emphasis was placed on distributed\
    \ computing\nelements stemming from Fog and Edge Computing [12–14] domains with\
    \ direct relevance to the\neﬃcient design of collaborative UAV–WSN systems.\n\
    Many recent contributions, in the form of papers, research projects, and commercial\
    \ products\nconcern the implementation of WSN [2] and UAV [3] systems. The contribution\
    \ and timely aspect of\nour article stem from a focused overview and highlight\
    \ regarding the key collaborative aspects between\nthe mentioned elements as well\
    \ as the intelligent data processing, computation, communication and\ncontrol\
    \ methods. These lead to carrying out speciﬁc monitoring and evaluation tasks\
    \ in application\ndomains of critical interest such as: transport, agriculture,\
    \ natural disaster damage management,\nenvironmental assessment and others.\n\
    Over time, sensor networks have been widely used for data collection both outdoor\
    \ and indoor,\nin various ﬁelds of applications [3–5]. Gradually, due to the technological\
    \ development, the sensor\nnetworks were equipped with data processing elements,\
    \ thus becoming intelligent ones [6].\nIn our vision, the blueprint for such a\
    \ complex, collaborative, monitoring system is composed of\nfour main parts, as\
    \ illustrated by Figure 1: Ground WSNs, UAVs, Internet/global system for mobile\n\
    communications (GSM) networks and ground control stations (GCSs). From the communication\
    \ point\nof view, we identiﬁed ﬁve possible communication channels: WSN–WSN (between\
    \ SN—marked\nwith red and CH marked with blue), WSN–UAV (between CH and WSN),\
    \ UAV-GCS (between UAV\nand GDT, associated with GCS), GCS-internet-GCS, UAV–UAV\

    \ which is often impractical to\nsolve [26,27].\nNoteworthy, the schemes encountered\
    \ consider mostly a single UAV operation scenario. Those\nwhich have multiple\
    \ UAV usually partition the tasks a priori such that each of the UAVs functions\n\
    independently of the others [27,28].\nThe rest of the article has been structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 deﬁnes a speciﬁc context into\nwhich our contribution\
    \ can be framed. This is mostly related to a signiﬁcant increase in the interest\n\
    of the research community in studying and developing UAV, WSN and IOT systems.\
    \ Our primary\nanalysis is based around keyword searches in the reference SCOPUS\
    \ and Web of Science (WOS)\ndatabases and we detail the arguments for the articles\
    \ that we have surveyed for this review. Section 3\nis focused on the advantages\
    \ and speciﬁc design space of collaborative UAV–WSN operation. One of\nthe main\
    \ topics that is handled in this section relate to designing eﬃcient UAV paths\
    \ and tracking in\nmission scenarios that involve WSN data collection. We also\
    \ discuss the key challenges and current\napproaches for the data acquisition\
    \ and data processing, which can leverage the on-board computing\nresources of\
    \ the network nodes while reducing communication bottlenecks inside the collaborative\n\
    system. Due to the varied radio and networking protocols that are usually deployed,\
    \ we handle\ndata communication as a independent topic in Section 4. This details\
    \ the radio interfaces that are\nused at both the WSN and UAV levels as well as\
    \ the components, both logical and physical, that\nenable interoperability in\
    \ a hierarchical fashion, from low power/low data rate to high power/high\ndata\
    \ rate. Section 5 handles implementation aspects of integrated UAV–WSN systems\
    \ with a main\nemphasis on optimization algorithms and heuristics that allow improvements\
    \ in system performance\nfor data collection, relaying and extended autonomous\
    \ operation through energy eﬃciency. The core\napplications that we survey as\
    \ representative use cases for collaborative large-scale monitoring systems\n\
    are in agriculture, environmental monitoring and disaster management. These are\
    \ discussed in\nSection 6. The article concludes with discussion and conclusion\
    \ sections that observe the current trends\nand main areas for a research agenda\
    \ in this ﬁeld.\nFor readability, each topical section includes a synthesis table\
    \ with the main relevant articles that\nwere analyzed, highlighting the key objectives\
    \ and approaches to the reader. To save space and to\nbetter track the work content,\
    \ Appendix A gives a complete list of the acronyms and symbols used\nthroughout\
    \ this review article.\n2. Materials and Methods\nAlthough the works that presented\
    \ separately WSNs and UAVs are older and their respective\nresearch topics are\
    \ well-established in the literature [29], the study of collaborative integration\
    \ between\nUAV and WSN is relatively recent (mostly after 2004). One of the ﬁrst\
    \ reference papers addressing an\nintegrated WSN–UAV approach is [30], where an\
    \ UAV is used for WSN node deployment. In [31],\nconsidering the drop in the cost\
    \ of the drones, a multi-UAV system is proposed for collecting data from\nground\
    \ sensors. To this end, mobile software agents were used for intelligent communication,\
    \ data\ncollection and processing.\nIn order to better frame the opportunity for\
    \ the current work we have initially performed a\nkeyword search across the SCOPUS\
    \ and WOS databases in order to have a better picture on the main\ntopics of this\
    \ survey. We considered a period of 12 years between 2007 and 2018. The search\
    \ was\nsplit between individual keywords and combinations of keywords using “and”\
    \ and “or” connectors,\nwhile searching the title, abstract and keywords of the\
    \ respective original articles indexed in the\ndatabases and reporting the yearly\
    \ publication counts. For the individual keywords we searched for\nthe following\
    \ keywords: UAV, WSN and IoT. Figures 2 and 3 show the individual results for\
    \ Scopus\nand WOS databases respectively. While we observed a linear increase\
    \ in the interest from the scientiﬁc\ncommunity for the UAV topic, for WSN there\
    \ was an increase until around 2012 followed by a relative\nstagnation beyond\
    \ this point (or an even slight decrease in terms of WOS data). This was more\
    \ than\ncompensated by the exponential increase in the interest for IoT and can\
    \ be explained through the\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690\n6 of 40\nfact that many current\
    \ IoT systems rely on wireless sensor networks as key building blocks for their\n\
    implementation. Among the two studies databases the trends in publication counts\
    \ over the years\nwere similar, with Scopus providing an absolute larger number\
    \ of references when compared to WOS\nas well as timelier indexing of the respective\
    \ contributions.\nSensors 2019, 19, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n6 of 40 \n \nFigure 2.\

    \ and Intelligence in the UAV–WSN System\nOne of the ﬁrst collaborative UAV–WSN\
    \ applications was the location of sensors on the ground.\nThus, in [30] the AVATAR\

    WSN used radio signals at 915.5 MHz and achieved a maximum distance of 13 m.\n\
    More recently, UAV–WSN architectures have been using aerial vehicles as one of\
    \ three types\nof actors:\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690\n8 of 40\n-\nfor node deployment\
    \ [30] in applications with low on-site accessibility or dangerous for\nhuman\
    \ operation;\n-\nas actuators, as in [37] where drones are used for spraying pesticides;\n\

    \ node carrying sensing equipment or\nin [42] to overcome faults of the sensing\
    \ network;\n-\nas mobile sinks, this being the most widely used role integrated\
    \ with either small or large scale\nWSNs. In this case, two data acquisition modes\
    \ were identiﬁed:\n#\nclustered, when data is sent to a local CH;\n#\ndirect communication,\
    \ where the UAV collects data from each sensor node.\nIn [43] the authors provide\
    \ a model depending on weight, wing area, air density and energy\nrequired for\
    \ transmission for evaluating the energy consumption for a UAV. They compare the\
    \ clustered\nand direct communication approaches and show the energy consumption\
    \ is lower in the clustered\ndesign. UAV were used for the dynamic clustering\
    \ of ground sensor nodes and cluster head selection\nmechanism in a randomly deployment\
    \ of sensors [1].\nDue to the development of new technologies, the trade-oﬀ between\
    \ storing and transmitting WSN\nground level data is, currently, a challenge [44].\
    \ The UAV acts as a mobile CH for the network with\na novel scenario in which\
    \ it harbors an energy harvesting module and wireless recharging for the\nground\
    \ nodes. Energy harvesting is based on RF signal energy extraction where part\
    \ of the received\nsignal is used for this and part for standard data collection\
    \ while hovering over a sensor node island.\nBased on information collected from\
    \ the nodes, the UAV schedules appropriately the battery charging\nand data gathering.\
    \ Visiting the nodes is based on a variant of the travelling salesman problem\
    \ (TSP)\nwith time windows: shortest travelling time trajectory (STTT). The model\
    \ used for the battery level of\na WSN node is a birth–death process based on\
    \ the observed activity rates in terms of data sensing\nand transmissions.\n3.2.\
    \ Satellite Information\nSatellite connection oﬀers two major advantages: system\
    \ localization (both UAV and WSN) and\ndata communication support. For localization\
    \ the system elements (especially the UAVs) are equipped\nwith GPS. One of the\
    \ ﬁrst notable papers introducing the use of a UAV equipped with a GPS as a beacon\n\
    node was [45]. In this case no a priori knowledge on the WSN node location is\
    \ required. For WSN\nnode localization the GPS information is combined with the\
    \ RSSI signal strength of RF communication\nbetween the UAV and the node [1].\
    \ The position is represented as a probability distribution function.\nExperimental\
    \ results prove that by increasing the distance between node and WSN the standard\n\
    deviation of the RSSI signal decreases [45]. Therefore, the positions are less\
    \ sensitive to measurement\nuncertainties and the signal does not need to be ﬁltered.\n\
    3.3. UAV Path Generation and Tracking\nIn the context of WSNs, the main motivation\
    \ of having an UAV (or team of UAVs) as mobile sink(s)\nis to prolong the sensors’\
    \ lifetime (by canceling their need to communicate with a base station [20])\n\
    and to reduce operational costs (canceling the need of direct human supervision\
    \ [25]). In addition,\ncases where widely dispersed parcels must be traveled preclude\
    \ direct sensor communication and\nunavoidably require UAVs [22,23].\nThus, gathering\
    \ and exchanging information with the WSN implicitly translates into the design\n\
    and subsequent tracking of a path (or paths in the multi-UAV case [28]). This\
    \ is hence the main\njustiﬁcation for our interest in path planning and the ancillary\
    \ mechanisms: whereas the WSN–UAV\nsystem may have diﬀerent objectives and constraints,\
    \ ultimately these translate into limitations and\nrestrictions of the mobile\
    \ agent’s path.\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690\n9 of 40\nThere are several criteria that\
    \ characterize and inﬂuence the path planning procedures.\n(i) Oﬄine versus online\
    \ planning. Most works assume a known environment (known domain,\nareas of interest,\
    \ interdicted regions, etc.), which permits to solve the motion planning problem\
    \ oﬄine.\nA varying environment or changing mission parameters may lead to an\
    \ online computation of the\npath. This is generally avoided as it introduces\
    \ elements of risk, which are unacceptable in practical\napplications. Still,\
    \ path updates are sometimes employed, either due to alarms signaled by a collision\n\
    avoidance mechanism [46] or due to mission updates [24].\n(ii) Coverage versus\
    \ waypoint passing. Some works consider a discovery phase in which the\ndeployed\
    \ sensors’ position has to be estimated or the terrain has to be mapped through\
    \ a preliminary\npass. Such missions cover the entire area of interest [47] through\
    \ either random or deterministic\nscanning. The former may be considered, e.g.,\
    \ in military applications where random routes are\nselected to avoid prediction\
    \ of future actions. Realistic implementations combine both types of paths\neven\
    \ when the sensors are deployed deterministically (e.g., in a grid) [48]. Furthermore,\
    \ obstacles or\nother features of interest may not be stored in the static map\
    \ available at the mission’s start.\n(iii) Static versus dynamic path planning.\
    \ Whereas the path generation procedure is mostly static\n(decided at the ground\
    \ level prior to the ﬂight), novel information is sometimes used to update the\n\
    path. As noted in [19], predeﬁned routes are dangerous as any un-modeled disturbance\
    \ can greatly\nimpact the performance. Thus, more advanced schemes account for\
    \ obstacle and collision avoidance\n(i.e., sense and avoidance strategies [46,49])\
    \ and even for online path reconﬁguration [24]. E.g., the\nauthors adjust the\
    \ path by considering both static requirements (accounting for borders as it has\
    \ to\nstay in a safe lane) and dynamics requirements (counteracting wind gusts\
    \ and avoiding regions, which\nare already sprayed, based on information sent\
    \ by the ground sensors).\n3.3.1. Limitations in Path Generation and Tracking\n\
    Separately, we might consider the various restrictions that aﬀect the path planning\
    \ procedure.\nThese range from geometric, energy-based, internal dynamics to communication\
    \ restrictions (or a\ncombination of them).\n(i) Geometric restrictions. Due to\
    \ the inherent diﬃculty in solving a generic motion planning\nprocedure some authors\
    \ impose artiﬁcial limitations in the types of paths that may result (thus\nsimplifying\
    \ the planning procedure). Most commonly, this means limiting the possible orientations\n\
    of the mobile agent (the UAV) along its path.\nIn [15] the authors consider data\
    \ collection in a\nharsh-undulating terrain with the base station located far\
    \ from the sensing region and the way-point\nselection is simpliﬁed by allowing\
    \ only forward and axial ﬂight (movements across a rectangle-shaped\nregion where\
    \ the cluster heads are positioned in rows and columns). A similar approach is\
    \ followed\nin [16], which proposes a grid division algorithm. [17] forces strip-based\
    \ and zig-zag paths. Authors\nin [49] go further by imposing the avoidance of\
    \ predeﬁned regions. Somewhat diﬀerently [18] groups\nthe sensors in concentric\
    \ shells and maps a spiral path passing between them.\nIf the monitoring zones\
    \ have obstacles or interdicted regions, then they must be circumvented on\nthe\
    \ basis of a predetermined trajectory, if the obstacles are ﬁxed [1], or recalculated,\
    \ if the obstacles are\nnot known in advance or are mobile [46].\n(ii) Energy-based\
    \ restrictions. In [19], a mobile sink routing algorithm is used to compute the\n\
    energy expenditure and distances within the WSN (further used in the generation\
    \ of an optimal path\nfor a single mobile sink). [20] proceeds similarly by limiting\
    \ energy consumption (both due to trajectory\nand communication requirements).\
    \ Noteworthy, [20] considers multiple GDTs to ensure telemetry with\nthe UAV and\
    \ [21] assumes limited buﬀer capacity for the WSN’s sensors and solves simultaneously\n\
    the path generation problem and gives the multi-hop rules within the WSN.\nThe\
    \ limitations of the mobile agent may also inﬂuence the network’s structure: too\
    \ many and too\nfar away clusters may be impossible to reach in a single ﬂight\
    \ by the UAV (due to fuel limitations) [15].\nThis leads to formulations where,\
    \ for a given ﬂight time and/or available energy budget, the optimal\npath which\
    \ passes through the largest number of sensors is computed [17].\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 4690\n10 of 40\nOther performance criteria may be employed, e.g., [50] considers\
    \ a “total ﬂying score”, which\ncombines multiple factors in the path planning\
    \ procedure.\n(iii) Internal dynamics restrictions. In many small to medium scale\
    \ applications (e.g., in precision\nagriculture—sensing weather and soil conditions;\
    \ pest and weeds management; animal attacks and\ncrop morphology) [22,23] the\
    \ UAVs employed are quad (or multi) rotor UAVs. Large scale applications\n(e.g.,\
    \ pesticide spraying [24], crop monitoring, etc.) are mostly handled by ﬁxed-wing\
    \ UAVs. The former\ncan track complex trajectories (where both position and yaw\
    \ angle are controllable outputs) and the\nlater are usually limited to a constant-height\
    \ ﬂight plane (where the velocity and heading angle are\ncontrolled). Overall,\
    \ ﬁxed-wing UAVs have higher cruising speed and longer operation time whereas\n\
    rotor UAVs are more ﬂexible and require less maintenance but have lower autonomy.\n\
    Some common drawbacks aﬀect all trajectory procedures. Foremost among these are\
    \ wind\ngusts [22] and position measurement errors (e.g., location through GPS\
    \ is imprecise; dead reckoning is\ntime-sensitive).\n(iv) Communication restrictions.\
    \ When the ﬁeld contains many obstacles, the communication link\nmay be weakened\
    \ or lost as a result of signal attenuation [25]. Almost all the surveyed papers\
    \ consider\na necessary time for data transmission at the cluster head; they mostly\
    \ dispense with it by assuming\nVTOL (vertical takeoﬀ and landing) UAVs (mini-helicopters\
    \ or, more commonly, quadcopters), which\ncan hover indeﬁnitely. To ensure that\
    \ the mobile agent is within the cluster head communication range\nuntil all the\
    \ information from that ﬁxed agent is retrieved imposes additional restrictions.\
    \ These may be\nimplemented either explicitly by computing the time in which the\
    \ UAV lies within the communication\nradius of the cluster head [20] or implicitly\
    \ by proposing a path guaranteed to spend enough time in\nthe neighborhood (e.g.,\
    \ via loitering [51] or hovering [22]).\n3.3.2. Waypoint Selection, Ordering and\
    \ Passing Through\nComputing a trajectory most often reduces to ﬁnding an ordered\
    \ collection of waypoints through\nwhose neighborhood the UAV has to pass [22].\
    \ This neglects the internal dynamics of the UAV agent\n(the trajectory is simply\
    \ a union of segments that link consecutive waypoints) but is a reasonable\nassumption\
    \ in most cases and is justiﬁed by the fact that most (if not all) commercially\
    \ or academically\navailable autopilots (the ensemble of software that ensures\
    \ path tracking) expects a list of waypoints as\ninput. This simpliﬁcation becomes\
    \ less defensible on smaller distances where the UAV agent dynamics\nbecome signiﬁcant\
    \ (e.g., the turn radius cannot be ignored).\nApplying both geometrical/energy-based\
    \ on one hand and communication restrictions on the\nother hand is challenging.\
    \ Thus, many works ﬁrst consider only geometrical/energy-based restrictions,\n\
    which give an unordered list of waypoints and later apply communication restrictions\
    \ to decide in\nwhich order should the UAV agent cover the waypoints.\nThe ordering\
    \ may be decided online as in [15] where the next way-point is determined by analyzing\n\
    the information provided by the existing nodes (the closest, still not visited\
    \ node, is chosen). However,\nmost papers consider variations of the TSP for ﬁnding\
    \ an optimal route among the waypoints [19].\nA more complex representation appears\
    \ in [24], which considers a second pass through (some) of the\nwaypoints if there\
    \ are still areas uncovered from the ﬁrst pass.\nNoteworthy, the schemes encountered\
    \ consider mostly a single UAV agent. Those that have\nmultiple UAV (hence a multi-agent\
    \ UAV subsystem within the larger, heterogenous, multi-agent\nsystem of WSN plus\
    \ UAVs) usually partition the tasks a priori such that each of the UAVs functions\n\
    independently of the others [27].\nSimply passing through a way-point or through\
    \ its neighborhood is almost never suﬃcient.\nMost applications require a hovering\
    \ time (such that there is enough time to gather the required\ninformation). In\
    \ such cases, the distinction between multi-rotor and ﬁxed-wing UAVs becomes\n\
    signiﬁcant: the former can hover easily and for an arbitrary amount of time whereas\
    \ the later have to\nenter a so-called loitering mode [51] in which they orbit\
    \ around the current way-point (the minimum\nradius depends on the UAV characteristics).\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 4690\n11 of 40\nSome papers consider an explicit communication\
    \ range when imposing hovering conditions [17,20].\nIn conclusion, the path generation\
    \ procedure is aﬀected by multiple restrictions and must consider\nseveral aspects:\n\
    -\nproperties of the WSN: is sensor localization required or available [1]; the\
    \ size of the WSN area;\ndata collection from sensors, sensors activity monitoring\
    \ relay function [52] and energy loading\nby radiation [44];\n-\ncharacteristics\
    \ of the used UAV agent: available energy, type (rotary or ﬁxed wing); type of\n\
    antenna and speed;\n-\ncharacteristics of the environment: if there are obstacles\
    \ or the application is in open ﬁeld; the\navailability of ground base-stations\
    \ along the entire path.\nTable 1 summarizes which of these topics were addressed\
    \ simultaneously in diﬀerent papers.\n3.3.3. Computational Aspects\nThe path generation\
    \ is a complex procedure due to the nonlinear nature of the UAV dynamics\nand\
    \ the various operational constraints (waypoint passing, line-of-sight communication,\
    \ collision\navoidance, etc.). All these elements lead, in its more general form,\
    \ to a nonlinear (in cost and\nconstraints) constrained optimization problem,\
    \ which is often impractical to solve. Even a relatively\nsimple requirement as\
    \ ensuring hovering at the waypoint leads to a mixed integer nonlinear problem\n\
    (MINLP) formulation [15].\nThe usual solution is to simplify the motion planning\
    \ procedure. This may happen either at a\nconceptual level by imposing a limitation\
    \ that lead to a manageable formulation or by solving the ‘hard’\nproblem heuristically\
    \ through algorithms providing sub-optimal but fast solutions. The former means\n\
    considering limitations on the types of paths taken by an UAV (spirals [18]; zig-zags\
    \ [17], etc.). The later\napproach is concerned with problem reformulations and\
    \ the application of heuristic algorithms.\nEven when mixed-integer (MI) formulations\
    \ appear explicitly, they are often solved heuristically\nas in [28], which ensures\
    \ obstacle avoidance through a MI formulation solved by a genetic algorithm.\n\
    Xu et al. [20] also employs binary variables to check whether the UAV is in contact\
    \ with a given\nsensor and relaxes the formulation through time allocation tactics\
    \ and pre-scheduled GDT usage.\nWhen obstacle avoidance is considered, rapidly\
    \ exploring random trees (RRT) and optimal RRT (RRT*)\nalgorithms are often the\
    \ preferred method [46].\nAmong the heuristic algorithms used we may mention:\

    3.4. Data Acquisition\nAs one of the core functions of the integrated UAV–WSN\
    \ monitoring systems, data acquisition is\nconcerned with the correct and timely\
    \ collection of ground level measurements and their propagation\nthrough the network\
    \ hierarchy. This is implemented in various ways, mainly by using the UAV\nplatform\
    \ as a collection agent for the lower level sensors. Key technical challenges\
    \ for UAV–WSN data\nacquisition concern the aggregation at the ground clusters\
    \ and the frequency and route for the data\ncollection based on the design decisions\
    \ at the system level and the optimization problem formulation.\nThe main advantage\
    \ for using UAVs as mobile sinks is that WSN nodes can reduce energy\nconsumption\
    \ by reducing the need for networking overhead at the local level with functions\
    \ such as\ndiscovery, connectivity and maintenance of routing tables being maintained\
    \ by the UAV/mobile sink,\nwhich periodically updates the cluster nodes with the\
    \ required information for packet transmissions.\nIn many cases the UAVs were\
    \ considered as relays for receiving signals from CHs or other UAVs and\nthen\
    \ retransmitting the signal to the GCS. The most important requirements in data\
    \ acquisition in the\nintegrated UAV–WSN systems are the energy eﬃciency (primarily\
    \ to maintain the energy capacity\nof sensory nodes and, secondly, to increase\
    \ the UAV coverage area), the accuracy and the time of\ndata acquisition.\nPerformance\
    \ analysis for WSN with UAV support is carried out by [63]. The UAV play the\n\
    role of mobile sink across clusters of ground sensor networks. A spectrum allocation\
    \ scheme is\nmodeled in order to achieve robust communication with concurrent\
    \ transmissions from the WSN\nand/or multiple UAVs. The data transmission capacity\
    \ at the node and network levels is analyzed.\nMonte Carlo simulations are performed\
    \ to compare theoretical per-node capacity and UAV working\ntime models to varying\
    \ parameters. The per-node capacity is deﬁned in terms of the interval time\n\
    between the collection of accumulated ground data. The multi-UAV scenario assumes\
    \ a returning\npath to avoid collisions of packet transmissions between adjacent\
    \ UAVs. The routing of the UAV is\nbased on pre-deﬁned ground cells, which hosts\
    \ groups of sensor nodes and the optimal number of\ncells can be identiﬁed that\
    \ maximize the per-node capacity of the WSN thus improving the overall\ndata collection\
    \ procedure.\nThe usage of UAV platforms to support mobile devices is underlined\
    \ in [17] as a promising\nsolution for infrastructure less integration. In this\
    \ context infrastructure, less integration is deﬁned\nsuch that the ground sensors\
    \ are deployed independently and they only communicate directly with\nthe UAV,\
    \ without local interactions that requires a pre-established network structure,\
    \ cluster heads or\nadditional base stations. The main approach aims to minimize\
    \ overall system energy consumption\n(mobile devices + UAV) under typical real-world\
    \ constraints for resource allocation, UAV ﬂying path\nand computation oﬄoading.\
    \ The solution to the non-convex formulated optimization problem is\npresented\
    \ by means of decomposition into manageable subproblems. The computational status\
    \ at the\nmobile device level is analyzed by simulations in conjunction with the\
    \ UAV path planning for task\noﬄoading on a slot by slot basis. The metrics against\
    \ which the optimization scheme is analyzed are\nrelated to the average energy\
    \ consumption of the mobile devices and UAV per slot, only the average\nenergy\
    \ consumption of the mobile devices or only of the UAVs, expressed under predetermined\n\
    simulation conditions. Several scenarios are studies where the UAV ﬂying path\
    \ is closer to the mobile\ndevices to provide high channel quality and computational\
    \ oﬄoading resources thereby reducing the\nlocal task queue length to be processed.\n\
    The impact of UAV mobility patterns on the quality of the data collection for\
    \ ground sensor nodes\nis analyzed by [64]. Initial sweep ﬂights at diﬀerent altitude\
    \ levels are performed over the area of\ninterest to discover and enable the sensor\
    \ network. Four mobility patterns are subsequently deﬁned\nas: tractor, angular,\
    \ square and circular patterns. Simulations based on these are implemented in\n\
    OMNET++ and MiXiM frameworks for IEEE 802.15.4 compliant wireless sensor nodes.\
    \ The number of\nclusters formed, and implicitly associated CHs are reported under\
    \ static ground simulation conditions\nand variation of the UAV altitude. The\
    \ metrics used for evaluation include the overall coverage by\nthe UAV, time eﬃciency\
    \ and utilization, time versus coverage eﬃciency. The results can be used for\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 4690\n14 of 40\npreselection of a mobility pattern for the UAV\
    \ upon mission conﬁguration while selecting the ground\nclustering mechanisms\
    \ based on this.\nThe main use cases for symbiosis between UAV and wireless networks\
    \ relevant to the study\nare related to providing IoT uplink connections in an\
    \ energy eﬃcient manner with reliability as well\nas support for disseminating\
    \ information and connectivity enhancement [65]. The UAV is able to\naccess the\
    \ WSN/IoT ground network directly or by means of a machine-to-machine (M2M) dedicated\n\
    gateway and further integrate with new 5G IoT services in various industry verticals.\
    \ The types of\ncommunication protocols that can support such hybrid systems are\
    \ classiﬁed into: proactive protocols,\nreactive protocols and geographic protocols\
    \ where the design trade-oﬀs between metrics such as\nlatency, coverage, energy-eﬃciency,\
    \ etc. are known and established beforehand in the system design\nphase. Security\
    \ and privacy also play a critical role in ensuring that proper safeguard for\
    \ in-network\ninformation collection is in place.\nThe authors of [66] focus on\
    \ the clustering methods for the ground sensor nodes in a single UAV\nscenario\
    \ for environmental monitoring and data gathering. The energy model for the sensor\
    \ nodes is\ncomposed of the energy needed for packet reporting and for packet\
    \ forwarding in the case of mesh\nnetworks where each node can serve as a router\
    \ for neighbor packets towards the sink. UAV path\nplanning uses the 2-opt heuristic,\
    \ which is a local search algorithm to solve TSP for visiting the WSN\nclusters.\
    \ The evaluation consists of a 100 m × 100 m grid with 200 randomly deployed nodes\
    \ according\nto the random Poisson point process. Nodes are modeled with cc2420\
    \ family radio interfaces and for\nthe UAV the characteristics of the DJI Phantom\
    \ 3 drone are used. Optimization problem is solved\nusing the CPLEX solver. Results\
    \ plot the energy consumption of the UAV and of the sensors versus the\nmaximum\
    \ number of hops in the network.\nOptimizing for UAV ﬂight time reduction in data\
    \ collection missions that support ground sensor\nnetworks is discussed by [67].\
    \ The scenario assumes controlled deployment of the WSN in a straight\nline with\
    \ cruising or hovering behavior from the UAV. The aim is to achieve optimal, non-overlapping,\n\
    data collection intervals, UAV speed and sensor transmit power by using a dynamic\
    \ programming\n(DP) approach. The main ﬁnding highlights how the UAV speed should\
    \ be proportional to the\nenergy levels of the sensors and the inter-sensor distance.\
    \ Several scenarios are deﬁned for evaluation\nunder randomness assumptions for\
    \ data requirements, energy and localization of the ground nodes.\nWhile cruising,\
    \ it has been found that even if the data rate of the nodes decreases, the reduction\
    \ in\nthe mission time is able to compensate for this in comparison to hovering.\
    \ This is applicable to low\namounts of data, whereas, beyond a certain threshold,\
    \ the hovering approach is preferable.\nThe problem is framed as an aerial data\
    \ collection problem (ADCP) with increased complexity\ngiven the fact that a set\
    \ of UAVs is tasked to collect information from mobile ground sensor nodes [68].\n\
    ADCP is solved optimally for small instances using mixed-integer linear programming.\
    \ Collected\ndata is relayed back to the central base station using multi-hop\
    \ aerial communication links over\nthe set of UAVs in a multi-tier network architecture.\
    \ Simulations are carried out by means of a\ncustom implementation using the JGraphT\
    \ library and IBM CPLEX solver for the optimization part.\nComputational test\
    \ results and scalability results are presented with various UAV and WSN sizes\
    \ and\ndeployments. Suitability of the approach for real wildlife application\
    \ is foreseen. A heuristic pricing\nscheme shows promise to solve eﬃciently the\
    \ ADCP formulation in the deﬁned 3D-positions of the\ntargets while accounting\
    \ for mobility and connectivity variations.\nData Mule Scenario for Data Acquisition\n\
    Data mulling concerns the eﬀective creation of a communication link between disparate\
    \ network\nsubsets by usage of a mobile node. This helps create a data bridge\
    \ among clusters and earlier works\ndiscussed the implementation of data mules\
    \ by means of mobile robots. In [69] the optimization of\nthe shortest data mule\
    \ path is carried out by an improved clustering-based genetic algorithm, which\n\
    enhances the travelling salesman problem with neighborhoods. For larger geographical\
    \ distances\nwhere a ground robot solution is unfeasible, UAV-based systems have\
    \ been integrated [70]. Although\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690\n15 of 40\nin most of\
    \ cases the communication between WSN and UAV is unidirectional, authors from\
    \ [71]\nproposed dual stack single radio architecture, which allows a UAV to communicate\
    \ in a bidirectional\nmanner with a WSN (UAV-to-WSN and UAV-to-Sink). It is used\
    \ a single radio transmitter both for\ncollecting data from the WSN and for sending\
    \ telemetry data to a Base Station.\nThe GrubiX Wireless network simulator has\
    \ been used to comparatively present the results of\ntwo optimization heuristics\
    \ for path planning, namely the Euclidean travelling salesman problem\n(ETSP)\
    \ and a modiﬁed version with cluster selection rounds. For radio link modeling\
    \ the IEEE\n802.11b standard has been selected in ideal propagation medium with\
    \ 50 m communication range.\nThe scenario in which the UAV is used as a data acquisition\

    \ discussed by [73] in which the\nUAV plays the role of the fog node and provides\
    \ services to the hierarchical ground sensor network.\nThe services include data\
    \ collection and relaying, local processing and cloud interfacing. Several\nrelevant\
    \ use cases are identiﬁed ranging from ground pipeline monitoring and control\
    \ to underwater\nmonitoring, large scale emergency response and military deployments.\
    \ An evaluation is carried out\nby comparing the performance of local and cloud\
    \ service calls in various network conﬁgurations.\nThe resource discovery and\
    \ integration are also enabled through the UAV fog node with additional\nbeneﬁts\
    \ stemming from the inherent mobility of the UAV in assisting the ground level\
    \ devices. Security\nfunctions are also available on the fog level with application-based\
    \ protection levels.\nThe fog computing paradigm applied to UAV-based large-scale\
    \ monitoring systems is analyzed,\nwhich assumes that the path planning, ﬂight\
    \ coordination and task planning are carried out locally\nat the fog coordinator\
    \ level [74]. This is reﬂected in comparison to the usage of a cloud platform,\n\
    which potentially oﬀers more computing resources and knowledge with increased\
    \ data and command\nlatency. A system model is provided for the throughput, power\
    \ consumption and latency analysis with\nmultimedia data over various mobile communication\
    \ technologies such as GSM, UMTS (Universal\nMobile Telecommunications Service)\
    \ and HSPA(+) (High Speed Packet Access).\nA single UAV\nis denoted as fog coordinator\
    \ and it decides on the trade-oﬀ between local processing and cloud\noﬄoading\
    \ of the data streams and planning tasks, based on a genetic algorithm optimization\
    \ method\nwith implementation in MATLAB. The end-user application can be considered\
    \ as an UAV–WSN\ncollaborative monitoring scenario in which the fog computing\
    \ approach is deployed at the higher UAV\nground control station (GCS) level.\n\
    Cloud-based support infrastructure for UAV–WSN mixed data collection platforms\
    \ are introduced.\nIt is argued that the increased availability of cloud resources\
    \ can contribute to the improvement in\nthe ﬂying parameters and information extraction\
    \ from the WSN data [50]. Emerging ground level\nevents are classiﬁed according\
    \ to predeﬁned priority levels and the ﬂying sequence is determined by\nconsidering\
    \ several correlation factors at the node and cluster levels. Results are evaluated\
    \ both in\nsimulation and through experiments on an integrated testbed using a\
    \ quadcopter UAV and CC2530\n2.4 GHz radio sensor nodes with on-board GPS capabilities.\
    \ The proposed method, denoted as\ncloud-assisted and weight event data collection\
    \ (CWC), is compared (in a simulation framework) to a\nfull collection method\
    \ (FCM), event collection method (ECA) and event collection method with priority\n\
    (ECP). CWC performs well in terms of reducing the ﬂight time and distance as well\
    \ as assuring a 97%\ndata integrity compared to 60%, 63% and 26% for ECA, ECP\
    \ and FCM respectively. Data integrity is\ndeﬁned in terms of the sum of the total\
    \ received messages compared to the total messages.\nUAV-enabled WSN data aggregation\
    \ is described by [59] in which the UAV platforms act as data\nmules between the\
    \ CHs of the network. The routing optimization is based on genetic algorithms\n\
    (GA). Energy consumption of data transmission based on a standard energy-per-bit\
    \ transmission\nmodel is used as minimization objective. The OmNET++ simulation\
    \ environment is also used to\ndeploy a modeling scenario of the proposed approach.\
    \ The evaluation is with reference to three other\nprotocols: centre-based, greedy-based\
    \ and clustering-based genetic algorithm (CBGA) and achieves an\nimprovement in\
    \ terms of system-wide energy consumption of 1–28.4%. This is due to the fact\
    \ that the\ncluster member energy expenditure becomes an explicit optimization\
    \ objective. Shorter data update\nperiods are also listed as a secondary beneﬁt\
    \ of the approach.\nThe challenge of information fusion for collected sensor data\
    \ from both ﬁxed and mobile devices\nis illustrated in [75]. The application focuses\
    \ on deep supervised learning in transportation systems\nby integrating GPS, GNSS\
    \ and accelerometer readings with remote sensed imagery. The solution\ncovers\
    \ both the management of the large data quantities as well as analytics for pre-processing\
    \ and\nfeature extraction. Evaluation analysis is performed for a transportation\
    \ mode recognition task when\nvarious data sources are considered, and the best\
    \ accuracy is at 97% for the combination of GPS +\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690\n17\
    \ of 40\naccelerometer + GIS data. The work is relevant also to the large-scale\
    \ hybrid UAV–WSN monitoring\nsystems for distributing the pre-processing and feature\
    \ extraction modules across the nodes of the\nnetwork and re-tasking in accordance\
    \ to the mission objectives.\nAt the ground sensor level, distributed agreement\
    \ schemes such as consensus algorithms can\ncontribute toward intelligent data\
    \ reduction and reducing the burden on the upper UAV layers for\nprocessing and\
    \ transmissions [76]. For event detection where the integrated system has to assure\n\
    the timely observation of mission-speciﬁc events, local analysis can improve the\
    \ overall detection\nlatency. In this manner each of the ground sensors periodically\
    \ communicates their ﬁndings with\nneighboring nodes in order to reach a joint\
    \ decision, such as the event present: yes or no, in as few as\npossible communication\
    \ instances as possible. The weighting scheme accounts for the quality of the\n\
    data as well as the reliability of the information provided by each node. Implementing\
    \ consensus local\ndecision algorithms in large scale UAV–WSN monitoring systems\
    \ can help increase the reliability and\nrobustness of the overall system.\nIn\

    Data communication performs the critical integration function of UAV–WSN large-scale\n\
    monitoring systems. The various protocols, standards and physical interfaces have\
    \ to be interoperable\nand tuned for adjusting the system performance to the (dynamic)\
    \ mission objectives. As previously\nillustrated in Figure 1, these can range\
    \ from low-power and low-range radio communication at\nthe ground level, to higher\
    \ throughput radio links for data streaming, complemented by satellite\ncommunication.\
    \ Though implementation it is mostly wireless also, wired links can serve as a\
    \ data\ncommunication backhaul for the integrated system.\n4.1. Requirements and\
    \ Protocols\nAs a preliminary step in operational deployment of integrated UAV–WSN\
    \ monitoring systems,\nthe deployment strategy of the ground sensor nodes can\
    \ be considered [83]. DeVForce-AP algorithm is\npresented, which allows the elimination\
    \ of coverage gaps in the ground network by means of Delaunay\ntriangulation together\
    \ with DeVForce for maintaining network connectivity. Parameter adjustment\nis\
    \ realized to account for environmental factors. The method evaluation is presented\
    \ in relation to\nrandom deployment, traditional Delaunay triangulation and virtual\
    \ force deployment. The new\nmethod presents an improvement in the data transmission\
    \ success rate, the number of alive sensor\nnodes and the number of available\
    \ neighbor nodes. It is also able to maintain coverage ratio and\nincreased network\
    \ lifetime under varying environment conditions and obstacles.\nThe trade-oﬀ between\
    \ storing and transmitting WSN ground level data is discussed by [44].\nThe UAV\
    \ acts as a mobile base station for the network with a novel scenario in which\
    \ it harbors an\nenergy harvesting module and wireless recharging for the ground\
    \ nodes. Energy harvesting is based\non RF signal energy extraction where part\
    \ of the received signal is used for this and part for standard\ndata collection\
    \ while hovering over a CH. Based on information collected from the nodes, the\
    \ UAV\nschedules appropriately the battery charging and data gathering. Visiting\
    \ the nodes is based on a\nvariant of the travelling salesman problem (TSP) with\
    \ time windows: shortest travelling time trajectory\n(STTT). The model used for\
    \ the battery level of a WSN node is a birth–death process based on the\nobserved\
    \ activity rates in terms of data sensing and transmissions.\nThe system designed\
    \ for an IoT surveillance application is presented by [84] and is based on visual\n\
    ground sensor network with security cameras, patrolling drones and unmanned ground\
    \ vehicles.\nThe integration and the data and command ﬂows are detailed using\
    \ open IoT protocols such as MQTT\nand publish–subscribe data architectures. Performance\
    \ of the combined system is evaluated based\non object detection time under varying\
    \ number of frames. The edge computing approach oﬀers a\nconsiderable improvement\
    \ over conventional cloud implementation in terms of measured detection\nlatency.\
    \ The scalability test shows how the integrated surveillance system performs under\
    \ increased\ndevice numbers. The system provides a blueprint for our reference\
    \ UAV–WSN large-scale monitoring\nscenario by implementing a decentralized solution\
    \ based on the edge and mist computing paradigms.\nPaper [85] focuses on the hierarchical\
    \ system architecture design for hybrid UAV–WSN monitoring\nsystems. It includes\
    \ a central gateway system that coordinates the UAV platforms within the aerial\n\
    level, followed by the distributed ground sensor systems for monitored parameters\
    \ data collection\non the ground. In addition, a binary sensor level can be also\
    \ added in tight connection to the WSN\nand without local processing elements.\
    \ A clustering mechanism is implemented and evaluated under\nthe Contiki embedded\
    \ operating system for resource constrained devices, which considers radio\nlink\
    \ indicators such as received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and link quality\
    \ indicator (LQI) for\nselecting the cluster heads. Static overpass UAV paths\
    \ are simulated to obtain in clustering behavior\nof the WSN using Rime broadcast\
    \ and unicast messages from the nodes. An application of the\nproposed clustering\
    \ mechanism shows improvement in data collection and distributed agreement for\n\
    physical measurements.\nAuthors in [86] present a coordination approach for multiple\
    \ aerial ad-hoc systems integrated\nwith ground systems in order to bridge various\
    \ conﬁguration options and network dynamics.\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690\n21 of 40\n\
    Their main contribution considers the application of fuzzy bee colony optimization\
    \ (fBCO) to implement\ncognitive relaying within the network. Mapping the network\
    \ structure onto the optimization problem\nformulation considers the ground nodes\
    \ serve as employed bees while the aerial nodes act as scout bees.\nThe proposed\
    \ model is evaluated against several existing approaches such as path-aware geographical\n\
    routing (TAG), energy-balancing packet scheduling (EPLA) and greedy selection\
    \ (GS), with 10 UAVs\nand 10–50 ground nodes. The metrics used relate to average\
    \ transfer time, network eﬃciency, average\ncognitive overheads and convergence\
    \ time. It is argued that the new fBCO oﬀers improved scalability,\nlower transfer\
    \ times and lower cognitive overheads.\nThe optimization problem for UAV–WSN data\
    \ acquisition is discussed in [51] considering the\nmain objectives for cluster\
    \ head selection, realistic models of bit error rate (BER), node energy and ﬂight\n\
    time of the UAV, including weather eﬀects. The proposed method is compared with\
    \ the established\nLEACH-C (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering. Hierarchy-centralized)\
    \ for WSN clustering and data\ncollection. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is\
    \ used for the multi-objective method, while prioritizing\nthe average BER over\
    \ energy consumption and travel time, to assure reliable connectivity. Various\n\
    cluster sizes are analyzed, and it is found that PSO outperforms LEACH-C in terms\
    \ of the remaining\nlive nodes after several hundred rounds of simulations. Relative\
    \ weighting of the objectives depends\non particular system and mission objectives\
    \ as well as practical judgment. As an example, reducing\ntravelling time can\
    \ be related to the operational cost of the UAV and support infrastructure and\
    \ limited\nﬂight autonomy.\n4.2. Standardisation and Safety Considerations\nOne\
    \ of the most sensitive and restrictive issues of UAV–WSN’s integrated systems\
    \ is ﬂight safety,\nin terms of the security of people, land and of airspace objectives.\
    \ There are several sources providing\na comprehensive overview of UAV ﬂight regulations,\
    \ implementation status and forecast. A reliable\nsource of information regarding\
    \ UAV development, e.g., the Global Drone Regulations Database [87],\nis providing\
    \ the interested researchers with free access to accurate description of applicable\
    \ regulations\nin each country and standards aiming to minimize the implication\
    \ in the civilian air traﬃc operations.\nVarious studies like [88] compared the\
    \ documents meant to regulate the UAV operations and concluded\nthat there is\
    \ no general approach of the conditions, UAV classiﬁcation or standards. Therefore,\n\
    reviewing the scientiﬁc literature presenting the characteristics considered by\
    \ various countries enabled\nthe authors to have realistic predictions of future\
    \ trends. Recently, the EASA established (in February\n2019) the regulation, which\
    \ enables the circulation of UAVs within the EU based on security and\non increasing\
    \ development of the UAV industry [89]. Since there are diﬀerent sizes of drones\
    \ (from\n10 g to 10 tones), ﬂight levels and path lengths, three categories of\
    \ UAVs have been identiﬁed for\nwhich speciﬁc ﬂight rules have been established:\
    \ (a) the ‘open’ category (below 120 m level, 500 m\ndistance—line-of-sight, and\
    \ does not require a prior authorization), (b) the ‘speciﬁc’ category (requires\n\
    an authorization by the competent national authority) and (c) the ‘certiﬁed’ category\
    \ (requires the\ncertiﬁcation of the UAS, a licensed remote pilot and an operator\
    \ approved by the competent authority).\nAccording to EASA, the UAVs should be\
    \ safety integrated into the existing aviation context in a\nproportionate way.\n\
    For long-distance applications, in which UAVs are ﬂying beyond the line-of-sight,\
    \ a very strict\nregulatory framework needs to be adopted so the UAV’s tracking\
    \ system provides proper support\nfor a safe operation of the remote command and\
    \ control, telemetry communication and datalink\ntransmission. The main challenge\
    \ for the experts of this sector is to determine how to calculate the\nspectrum\
    \ demands that most likely need to be harmonized between several entities that\
    \ will share the\nsame portions of spectrum while ensuring a safe and secure interconnectivity\
    \ with terrestrial WSN for\ncomplex air-ground hybrid networks.\nSome organizations\
    \ are involved in the implementation of the best strategy towards the usage of\n\
    the spectrum dedicated to interconnect the UAVS and terrestrial WSNs into hybrid\
    \ networks and, at the\nsame time, to ensure a safe airspace sharing with aircrafts:\
    \ International Civil Aviation Organization\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690\n22 of 40\n\
    (ICAO), EASA, Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems (JARUS), International\n\
    Telecommunications Union (ITU), etc.\nIn multi agent UAV–WSN applications, communications\
    \ between agents (UAV–UAV, UAV–WSN\nand WSN–WSN are mandatory. Although communication\
    \ within UAV network or within WSN\nwas not the subject of this paper (only communications\
    \ between UAV–WSN), some clariﬁcations\nneed to be made regarding UAV–UAV communications.\
    \ Two solutions can be used for UAV to UAV\ncommunication (U2U): direct communication\
    \ [90] and via GCS (GCS as relay) communication [91].\nDirect U2U communication\
    \ is, on one hand, a diﬃcult problem to solve in terms of frequency regulations\n\
    versus airspace security and, on the other hand, it is a necessary solution in\
    \ some applications of a\nswarm UAVs (examples: collision avoidance, operations\
    \ of search and rescue). The authors in [90]\nanalyzed the throughput and latency\
    \ of the UHF (ultra-high frequency) radio link, which interconnect\ntwo UAVs.\
    \ The advantages, disadvantages and important concerns for the U2U communication\n\
    options are also presented. The indirect communication is presented in more research\
    \ and application\npapers. Thus, in [91] the GCS is presented as a relay in a\
    \ conﬁguration UAV–GCS–UAV system by using\ncommercially available hardware (Wi-Fi)\
    \ components combined with customized software. In [92]\nUAV to UAV communication\
    \ for smart agriculture monitoring is presented using the ad-hoc WiFi\ninfrastructure.\
    \ The ﬁrst UAV serves as a relay between the second UAV and GCS, improving the\
    \ UAV\ncommunication in beyond line-of-sight and cross-obstacle operations. The\
    \ authors present experimental\nresults for various conditions and conﬁgurations\
    \ while implementing the OLSR (optimized link state\nrouting protocol) protocol\
    \ for increasing the quality of service of the network links. Paper [93]\nextends\
    \ this study using RTSP and RTP protocols and in-depth packet and bandwidth analysis\
    \ for\nboth the video processing pipeline and control functions. The reference\
    \ UAV type is a quad copter\nAR drone. The average bandwidth for the UAV system\
    \ is measured at 15.4 Mbps compared to a\npc-only system at 10.91 Mbps. Georeferencing\
    \ the target area enables precise application of herbicides\nleading to improved\
    \ cost-eﬀective productivity. Reference [94] provides a practical assessment of\n\
    2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz UAV communication in emergency response settings. A dedicated\
    \ system\ninfrastructure is illustrated with GPS, embedded PCs and software components\
    \ that support the\nlatency constrained operations.\nA summary of the UAV–WSN\

    Sensors 2019, 19, 4690\n24 of 40\n5. Integrated UAV–WSN System Implementation\n\
    There have been observed many options for system implementation over the recent\
    \ years of\ndevelopment. Many research groups ﬁrst validate their conceptual approaches\
    \ using simulation and\nemulation environments where the main components and their\
    \ interactions are modeled in software.\nGoing from model to real world implementation,\
    \ the ground sensor node platforms are selected based\non their on-board sensors,\
    \ computing capabilities and communication interfaces. The main options for\n\
    the UAV platform related to its type: ﬁxed/rotary wing, autonomy, communication\
    \ interface and other\ncomplex sensing systems, which are not suitable for ground\
    \ implementation, such as high resolution\nand special application imaging.\n\
    Early work in the ﬁeld of integrated robotic aerial platforms and ground based\
    \ sensor networks\nfor security applications is presented in [31]. The data processing\
    \ is organized on three hierarchical\nlevels ranging from target detection, localization\
    \ and recognition. The ad-hoc nature of the ground\nsensor network is emphasized\
    \ as well as the application of intelligent software agents that are able to\n\
    collaborate for joint mission objectives. The decreasing cost of the hardware\
    \ platforms also needed to\nachieve such a system is underlined as an element\
    \ driving the development of pervasive sensing in\nlarge scale monitoring. Adaptive\
    \ parameterization at both the UAV and the WSN levels enables the\nsystem to be\
    \ robust to environment or mission changes while ensuring proper quality of service\
    \ with\nenergy eﬃciency and communication reliability. The combination of low-cost\
    \ sensors on the ground\nand high-performance, high-cost sensors on-board UAV\
    \ sensors allows for data fusion algorithms that\ncan extract relevant information\
    \ in an online fashion.\nLow latency operation requirements and dynamic reconﬁgurable\
    \ network topology are identiﬁed\nas key challenges in the design of suitable\
    \ architectures and algorithms for UAV–WSN joint\ncooperation [99]. Low-latency\
    \ routing algorithm (LLRA) is proposed and evaluated for such scenarios\nin terms\
    \ of link average delay and packet delivery ratio. It assumes an iterative process\
    \ to identify\nthe best relay nodes across the network with periodic route updates.\
    \ This assures connectivity and\nachieving the minimum transmission delay. The\
    \ simulation setup includes a layered UAV network\nwith established parameters\
    \ for directional antenna angle, transmission power, UAV speed and\ninter-layer\
    \ separation distance under ﬁxed radio channel assumptions. The interlayer performance\n\
    of the algorithm is reported favorably with reference to standard routing procedures\
    \ such as ad hoc\non-demand distance vector (AODV) and greedy perimeter stateless\
    \ routing (GPSR).\nBio-inspired optimization heuristics are applied to collaborative\
    \ UAV–WSN networks in order\nto maximize the value of the gathered information\
    \ from the ground level while minimizing UAV\noperational costs [61]. With the\
    \ ground situation known in terms of sensing cells and ﬂying constraints,\nthe\
    \ authors deﬁne four utility functions for the UAV to maximize, in terms of sensing,\
    \ energy, time and\nrisk. The solution to the optimization problem is achieved\
    \ using a combination of genetic algorithms\n(GA) and ant colony optimization\
    \ (ACO). The best parametrization of the method is achieved while\naccounting\
    \ for an additional metric in terms of value of sensor information (VSI) for planning\
    \ of the\nﬂying route among sensing information gathering (SIG) ground cells.\
    \ The GA and ACO approach\nalso present signiﬁcantly better results when compared\
    \ to a classical A* bio inspired algorithm and a\ncombination of A* and GA in\
    \ terms of the optimal utility value.\nA priority-based frame selection scheme\
    \ within IEEE 802.11 MAC (Medium Access Control)\npackets is introduced in [100]\
    \ to mitigate the eﬀect of packet collisions on the overall UAV-assisted\nWSN\
    \ network. This operates by assigning a lower contention window range to the higher\
    \ priority\nframes. The proposed model assumes the operational characteristics\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV in which\nframes, which are overpassed by the UAV, receive\
    \ higher priority thus reducing the risk of a data-less\noverpass. Three algorithms\
    \ are deﬁned and analyzed as contributions: priority-based optimized\nframe collection\
    \ (POFS), priority-based contention window adjustment scheme (PCWAS) and frame\n\
    selection-based routing protocol (FSRP). The evaluation presented highlights the\
    \ performance metrics\nof the proposed scheme in relation to the conventional\
    \ IEEE 802.11 CSMA/CA MAC in terms of average\nthroughput, end-to-end delay, PDR.\
    \ Implementation is carried out in MATLAB for a 300 sqm area with\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 4690\n25 of 40\nvariable number of sensor nodes between 100–1000. By including\
    \ UAV data mule mobility into the\nprioritization of the communication protocol\
    \ improved results can be obtained.\nThe models of UAV–WSN communication integration\
    \ and data collection are reviewed in [101]\nfor hierarchical, clustered WSNs\
    \ where the UAV is tasked at visiting each cluster head in an eﬃcient\nmanner\
    \ to collect the ground level data. The store and forward model are the reference\
    \ approach\nin which non-critical data accumulates and is aggregated at the cluster\
    \ head to be made available to\nthe visiting UAV. Several critical infrastructure\
    \ monitoring applications might require real-time data\nstreaming or event-based\
    \ communication, which implies mechanisms and performance constraints on\nthe\
    \ UAV relays. A hybrid method is also identiﬁed, which can prioritize based on\
    \ the local processing\nof the collected data and operate the UAV relays in an\
    \ on-demand fashion. From the UAV routing\nperspective, a classiﬁcation is deﬁned\
    \ based on its capabilities: from constant speed UAV, to variable\nand adaptable\
    \ speed UAV and up to hovering capabilities with either unlimited or maximum service\n\
    times. These have an important impact on the design of the WSN communication windows,\
    \ which are\navailable to the network.\nThe approach from the perspective of a\
    \ collaborative WSN–mUAV network is described for\nan eﬃcient utilization of the\
    \ network energy resources [102]. The ﬁreﬂy optimization algorithm\n(FFOA) is\
    \ presented for energy eﬃcient relaying of collected data. Beneﬁts are highlighted\
    \ in terms\nof continuous connectivity, better network and node lifetime and improved\
    \ coverage. The studied\nscenarios assume a single base station with the UAV role\
    \ in the system model to relay data eﬃciently\nbetween the ﬁeld nodes and this\
    \ base station. The optimization procedure selects the best UAV for this\nbased\
    \ on attraction value among the set of eligible UAVs in the range of the data\
    \ sink–base station.\nFor performance evaluation the parameters include the followings:\
    \ throughput, mean hops, packet\ndelivery ratio (PDR), delays, lifetime, coverage\
    \ and excessive iterations per segment. One example of\nthe achieved results is\
    \ that FFOA for collaborative UAV–WSN networks achieves 17.2%, 18.01% and\n31.5%\
    \ better PDR when compared to reference methods EEGA, I-ERIDSR and ERIDSR.\nThe\
    \ authors of [103] discuss the issue of optimal wireless sensor network coverage\
    \ by means of\nUAV platforms in terms of an optimization problem. This is formulated\
    \ by means of the travelling\nsalesman problem (TSP) to ﬁnd the best routing of\
    \ the UAV for data collection with regard to minimizing\nthe energy needed for\
    \ data transmission of the sensor nodes. The proposed TSP algorithm outperforms\n\
    particle swarm optimization (PSO) for various ﬂying heights, speeds and network\
    \ sizes. The algorithm\nis implemented in MATLAB and simulations are carried out\
    \ using the OmNET++ network simulator\nwith 802.11b protocol. The reference results\
    \ for the tested conﬁguration show a lower than half total\nenergy consumption\
    \ at the gateway level when deploying BL-TSP as compared to PSO and network\n\
    forwarding. A multiple UAV test shows how the incremental beneﬁts are lower, in\
    \ terms of cost\nfunction decrease, with the addition of new UAVs.\nAnemulationplatform,\
    \ whichservesforgenericIoTscenarios, isdescribedby[104]. Maincomponents\ninclude\
    \ the server-side user interface, the physical hardware nodes and the virtual\
    \ nodes, as well as a\nscript interpreter to handle their functionalities. The\
    \ system supports both ﬁxed and mobile nodes\nand the authors present a reference\
    \ application using Raspberry Pi cards and WiFi communication\nfor the networking\
    \ side. For visualization a 2D mode for network analysis is provided alongside\n\
    a rich 3D environment for more immersive views. Implementation is performed using\
    \ the Java\nprogramming language. Running the system in simulation followed by\
    \ integration with real embedded\nhardware makes it suitable also for integrated\
    \ UAV–WSN systems. The application focus for Smart\nCity deployments could be\
    \ seen as using the ground nodes for environmental sensing with proper\ntask planning\
    \ of the UAV accounting for the 3D environment in data collection.\nThe multiagent-based\
    \ paradigm for developing a highly abstracted simulation model in IoT\nsystems\
    \ is discussed in [96]. It aims for event and data-driven networks with ﬂexibility\
    \ and large\nvariety of nodes in increasing abstraction layers. The FABIoT [105]\
    \ model parameters at the hardware\nlevel include the processing power of the\
    \ nodes, conﬁguration types, percentage of smart objects\n(SO), if the nodes are\
    \ battery-powered or not. The network parameters are the time-to-live (TTL) for\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 4690\n26 of 40\nmessages and the ping frequency for the smart\
    \ objects. Performance is measured using the mean query\ntime (MQT) and plan success\
    \ rate (PSR) over a reference system of 50 random network conﬁgurations\nof 40\
    \ heterogeneous smart objects. Heterogeneity in this case is deﬁned by a mix of\
    \ hardware and\nservices. Several test scenarios are modeled to reﬂect the metric\
    \ variation under typical network\nassumptions e.g., performance degradation with\
    \ a percentage of nodes departing/failing.\nCommunication systems perspective\
    \ for the ground level WSN is discussed in [106] when dealing\nwith radio challenges\
    \ over hybrid MACs for decision fusion. The nodes transmit binary non-coherent\n\
    decisions to the fusion center and the authors analyze and prove several eﬃcient\
    \ methods that\nimplement the decision fusion rule while accounting for the limited\
    \ computing available on the nodes.\nThe proposed hybrid MAC provides advantages\
    \ for detection performance with group size and under\nlow SNR conditions. By\
    \ grouping ground sensors around MAC schemes, in the same sensor group\nnon-orthogonal\
    \ MACs are used. The reference for the optimal fusion is considered the likelihood\n\
    ration (LR) test while three alternatives are developed in order to mitigate computational\
    \ impact:\nweighted energy detector (WED), deﬂection–coeﬃcient- maximization (DCM)\
    \ and two-step (TS) rules.\nEvaluation revolves around the detection of a known\
    \ parameter in Gaussian noise with zero mean and\nunit variance and receiver operating\
    \ characteristics (ROC) for various simulation scenarios for the four\nmethods\
    \ are presented.\nAspects related to the enabling of power eﬃcient communication\
    \ in WSN with external UAV\nsupport are discussed in [107]. A non-convex mixed-integer\
    \ optimization problem is formulated\nto minimize total power consumption of the\
    \ UAV while at the same time oﬀering performance\nguarantees to the ground sensor\
    \ nodes for their transmission rate. Block coordinate descent is used for\nproblem\
    \ decomposition into manageable sub problems. Satisfying of the sensor node quality\
    \ of service\nconstraints implies reducing the distance of the UAV to it. The\
    \ three schemes that provide the evaluation\nimply a power-eﬃcient scheme, propulsion\
    \ eﬃcient scheme compared to a reference circular ﬂight\nscheme, under consideration\
    \ that the UAV propulsion energy cost is dominant against its transmission\nenergy\
    \ cost generated by initiating or receiving radio communication from the ground\
    \ nodes.\nIn previous work we have presented the design of a collaborative UAV–WSN\
    \ network for\nenvironmental large-scale sensing [1]. The main challenges that\
    \ have been tackled relate mostly to\nthe cluster-based self-organization of the\
    \ ground sensor network in conjunction with the discovery\nand path planning optimization.\
    \ A cluster head selection procedure has been implemented based\non the connectivity\
    \ and signal strength levels of each of the ground nodes during the UAV initial\n\
    overpass ﬂight. The optimized paths for improved data collection for the UAVs\
    \ take into account\nthe constraints of the ﬂight zones such as physical obstacles\
    \ and no-ﬂy areas. A cluster-rebalancing\nscheme is also presented in order to\
    \ relieve and balance the energy and processing burden for the\nindividual ground\
    \ nodes. A realistic testbed composed of an octocopter platform and TelosB-type\n\
    sensor nodes is implemented and deployed to validate the simulation results.\n\

    \ speciﬁc applications, most authors use a UAV as a mobile sink in either small\n\
    or large scale WSN. Papers addressing speciﬁc applications usually do not detail\
    \ data gathering or\nadvanced path planning algorithms, but rather how such architectures\
    \ respond to speciﬁc challenges and\nhow a speciﬁc implementation achieved application\
    \ objectives in a certain use-case. The implemented\nfunctions depend on each\
    \ of the application’s objectives.\nThe main applications of integrated\nUAV–WSN\
    \ systems are synthesized in Table 5. More detailed characteristics of applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, environment and disaster management are provided in the following\
    \ subsections.\n6.1. Agriculture\nTraditional WSN topologies are not suitable\
    \ for monitoring small, strictly delimited, dispersed\nand isolated parcels, which\
    \ are commonly found in agriculture applications. WSN nodes might also\nbecome\
    \ unreachable as the vegetation becomes denser and performance is aﬀected by the\
    \ variable\nnode elevation.\nHovering UAVs were used in real conditions for collecting\
    \ data from cluster nodes in such\napplications and in [22] reliability at diﬀerent\
    \ ﬂight heights is evaluated. Di Gennaroa et al. [109] and\nPrimicerio [110] proposed\
    \ the use of micro UAVs equipped with multispectral cameras along with\nWSN meteorological\
    \ data to evaluate the correlation between grapes quality and measured values.\n\
    In the speciﬁc domain of spraying pesticides applications, the following challenges\
    \ were identiﬁed:\n-\nSome areas might not have the proper amount of chemicals,\
    \ while other might have a higher level;\n-\nThe eﬃciency of the process is highly\
    \ inﬂuenced by weather conditions;\n-\nThe chemicals must be spread only inside\
    \ a predeﬁned boundary.\nThe authors in [24,37] developed methods for these operations,\
    \ which use sensor measurement\nvalues to change the UAV route. The sensors are\
    \ deployed in a matrix to be able to apply the proposed\nalgorithm. A chemicals\
    \ concentration map is designed using the available sensor data.\nAn UAV–WSN–IoT\
    \ systems in data-driven agriculture is described in [81]. The UAV ﬂight\nplanning\
    \ is done in conjunction to ground level data depending on the speciﬁc parameters\
    \ to be\ncollected. Duty cycling is applied as well as a scheme that leverages\
    \ wind speed and orientation to\noptimize UAV ﬂight time across the ﬁelds. UAV\
    \ video feeds are compared against measured sensor\nvalues for improving inference\
    \ of speciﬁc agriculture events. A prediction model is evaluated for\ninference\
    \ of precision parameter maps and compared against nearest neighbor (NN) and inverse\n\
    distance-based interpolation schemes.\nA relevant application in agriculture is\
    \ described by [122]. A 1.9 m wingspan ﬁxed wing Skywalker\nUAV is used to remotely\
    \ collect ground sensor reading from commercial Xbee nodes deployed in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ The parameters include temperature and humidity from a Rotronic HygtoClip HC2-S\
    \ sensor.\nThe UAV can be equipped with either a normal camera or an infrared\
    \ camera and the on-board\nembedded control platform of choice is a Raspberry\
    \ Pi. Field trial run results illustrate the autopilot\nenabled operation of the\
    \ UAV over the target crop while analyzing communication and data collection\n\
    performance from the Xbee node. A salient feature of the integrated system is\
    \ that the UAV includes a\nsmall on-board tank for deploying directly fertilizers,\
    \ herbicides or insecticides based on the output of\nthe decision algorithms allowing\
    \ for fast response to critical conditions with a maximum payload of\n2 kg.\n\

    \ domain the integration of WSN with UAV devices led to the development\nof new\
    \ applications, rather than increasing eﬃciency in existing ones, like in agriculture\
    \ or disaster\nmanagement. They cover various topics for air pollution, underwater\
    \ or animal monitoring.\nIn marine applications, the challenges are given by the\
    \ diﬃcult access to sensor nodes dispersed\nover extremely large areas. Thus,\
    \ [10] proposes an application where several buoys are deployed in a\nmarine environment,\
    \ with no ﬁxed positions. They collect environmental data like temperature, wind\n\
    speed, pressure and humidity using the LoRa communication protocol. Subsequently,\
    \ a UAV is used\nas a mobile sink to collect data from these nodes. Tests showed\
    \ that a transmission range of 4 km could\nbe achieved with a data rate of 5.4\
    \ kbps.\nAn advantage of integrating WSNs and UAVs in air pollution is the capability\
    \ of obtaining a\ntridimensional sampling of physical phenomena, allowing further\
    \ analysis and prediction of weather\nimpact and/or pollutant propagation over\
    \ large geographical areas. Orestis et al. [112] have proposed\nthe architecture\
    \ for such an application and used a cube map area to model each pollutant.\n\
    In the case of wild animals monitoring, the algorithms chosen for path planning\
    \ must take into\nconsideration their movement over the monitored area. Authors\
    \ in [80,113] use the metric of value\nof information (VoI) to characterize sections\
    \ of a grid where animal movement was identiﬁed as an\narea where intensive data\
    \ collection is required. This way, the UAV can be directed with priority\ntowards\
    \ the areas where animals are detected and afterwards cover the rest of the network.\
    \ Monitored\ninformation includes the picture, sound and odor.\n6.3. Disaster\
    \ Management\nDisaster management applications are characterized by the requirement\
    \ of operating in harsh\nenvironments, where data needs to be collected from dynamic\
    \ WSNs with high reliability taking into\naccount the fast reaction requirements.\
    \ A broad study of UAV solutions for disaster management is\ncarried out [115]\
    \ while considering ground sensor networks that are deployed on the premises and\
    \ are\nable to leverage eﬃciently the aerial support. The design accounts for\
    \ four stages of disasters ranging\nfrom disaster preparedness, assessment, response\
    \ and recovery. In the ﬁrst case the system must be\noptimized for data acquisition\
    \ and collection while using UAVs as a data mule for relaying in a reliable\n\
    manner the information of interest back to a central disaster management entity.\
    \ In the second case,\nﬁxed-wing UAVs are employed to scan the aﬀected area and\
    \ identify target zones for more precise\nevaluation by means of more maneuverable\
    \ rotary wing platforms. For the ﬁnal stage, more advanced\nsensors and actuators\
    \ are deployed for improving the successful outcome of the missions. In this\n\
    situation, maximizing the data provided by the WSN becomes a critical factor and\
    \ the WSN can oﬀer\nsupport to the UAV platforms.\nWSN and multi-UAV systems working\
    \ together in disaster management applications are\nreviewed [123]. The associated\
    \ wireless communication technologies are identiﬁed, from low-power\nXbee links\
    \ to various types of 802.11 Wi-Fi networks that provide increased bandwidth.\
    \ The disaster\nmanagement scenarios imply the possibility of dynamic reconﬁguration\
    \ of the roles of both the UAV\nand WSN networks depending on changing priorities\
    \ in the ﬁeld. These are focused on human-life\nprotection through fast response\
    \ while integrating the data sources that are available by means of\nintelligent\
    \ aggregation and fusion mechanisms. WSN can be associated also with ground mobility\n\
    platforms in the form of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). Cloud infrastructures\
    \ are able to support\nthe large-scale data processing and optimization needed.\n\
    The AWARE platform proposed in [82], where WSN, BSN and UAV collaborate to gather\
    \ data from\nharsh environments using both static and mobile sensors, gives a\
    \ valuable insight on the capabilities\nand leveraged possibilities in this domain.\
    \ Here UAVs are used as mobile nodes and for sensor\ndeployment. The solution\
    \ is capable to detect emergency events and to ensure autonomous network\nrepair\
    \ and a fast reaction.\nSensors 2019, 19, 4690\n31 of 40\n6.4. Simulators for\
    \ UAV–WSN Systems\nThe great majority of WSN–UAV interactions are done in simulation\
    \ (comparatively few papers\nshow real-life implementations). The simulations\
    \ go from relatively simple (proof of concept validation\ndone preponderantly\
    \ in Matlab or similar scripting languages) to physics-based simulators, which\n\
    aim to give an accurate representation of the WSN/UAV model in real-life functioning\
    \ conditions.\nThe last category uses popular tools like ROS (robot operating\
    \ system) for modeling a control with\nsimulation done, e.g., in Gazebo [124].\
    \ Other options are the ﬂight simulator X-Plane [125], or, for the\nWSN interaction,\
    \ the COOJA environment [126].\nNote that, as far as we are aware, there is no\
    \ tool that provides an integrated solution (at least not\nwithout a fair amount\
    \ of tweaking) for both WSN and UAVs.\n7. Discussion\nThe motion planning strategies\
    \ employed in the papers studied for this review were mostly of\nrelatively reduced\
    \ complexity. Whereas the underlying optimization problem, which led to them,\
    \ can\nbe extremely complex, the paths are most often given as a sequence of segments\
    \ linking consecutive\nwaypoints (whose position and passing-through time are\
    \ determined a priori).\nWhile the complexity issues undoubtedly play a large\
    \ part in the simpliﬁcations usually imposed\n(e.g., predeﬁned types of paths),\
    \ we believed that another reason for the current approaches is an\nattitude of\
    \ “good enough” and “tested and true”. This is defensible in light of the currently\
    \ available\nhardware resources (the UAV autopilot expects an ordered list of\
    \ waypoints and the hardware itself is\ntoo expensive and/or dangerous to be tested\
    \ on unproven strategies). Still, increases in the performance\nof inertial measuring\
    \ units and the availability of global localization infrastructures (GPS, Galileo,\
    \ etc.)\nmean that the practitioners can relax some of these constraints and propose\
    \ more aggressive strategies\n(in the sense of reducing energy costs, operation\
    \ time and the like).\nForemost, using realistic UAV dynamics in the motion planning\
    \ procedure will give paths that\nare more ﬂexible and can still be tracked by\
    \ the autopilot at runtime with increased performance\n(tighter collision avoidance,\
    \ less conservative energy estimation, reduced operation time, etc.). This is\n\
    challenging from the viewpoint of the planning procedure (as the waypoint selection\
    \ and subsequent\nordering can no longer be separated easily but are realistic\
    \ under the expected software and hardware\nimprovements).\nAnother insuﬃciently\
    \ treated aspect in the state of the art is the path planning in the multi-UAV\n\
    context. Virtually all of the works studied ﬁrst partition the tasks among the\
    \ UAVs and then proceed\nto compute their paths independently. While this simpliﬁes\
    \ the analysis, it is conservative since it\nreduces the UAVs’ ﬂexibility. Thus,\
    \ computing overlapping paths or updating them online will allow\na more ﬂexible\
    \ task allocation and will lead to an improved mission outcome.\nKeeping in mind\
    \ that future applications may work in an urban environment and that increased\n\
    WSN interactions may require a low ﬂight level, obstacle detection and subsequent\
    \ avoidance as\nwell as line-of-sight communication will have greater and greater\
    \ importance in the path planning\nprocedures. This will not only increase the\
    \ complexity but will also lead to questions about safety\nregulations, reliable\
    \ functioning (even in the presence of failures) and mission performance in a\n\
    cluttered environment.\nOverall, we consider that the ﬁeld of motion planning,\
    \ in the context of UAV–WSN applications,\nhas many avenues of evolution and will\
    \ evolve signiﬁcantly in the coming years.\nFigure 6 shows the overlapping areas\
    \ of development in UAV, WSN and IoT systems by means\nof a Venn diagram. The\
    \ key topics, also elaborated upon in the current articles, are highlighted. We\n\

    \ WSN systems with IoT aspects. \nRegarding open research questions for integrated\
    \ UAV–WSN systems, the current focus goes \nbeyond optimal communication and data\
    \ acquisition heuristics towards intelligent and adaptive \nsystems. We predicted\
    \ that this would be enabled by designing data and information flows across \n\
    networks that allow distributed and localized inference at the network nodes.\
    \ By adjusting such \nmechanisms to the specific resources and abilities of the\
    \ nodes, the local decision is enabled. This \nimproves the overall robustness\
    \ and resilience of the large-scale monitoring system, allowing it to \nadjust\
    \ to changing process dynamics and mission objectives, with minimal latency. An\
    \ important \nrequirement for this vision to be achieved is to make the intermediate\
    \ gateways transparent at the \nupper levels of the system design in such a way\
    \ that both low-level (ground) information as well as \nhigh level (inferred)\
    \ information is available in both directions. Edge machine learning methods and\
    \ \ntechniques are an increasingly active field of study whose results can be\
    \ successfully assessed in the \ncontext of integrated UAV–WSN systems. \nFurthermore,\
    \ on the communication aspects that enable these collaborative systems will need\
    \ to \nbe integrated into heterogeneous IoT solutions that offer seamless bidirectional\
    \ data and information \nflows over multiple interfaces and network layers. New\
    \ low power long range radio links such as \nLoRa or NB-IoT require different\
    \ systems architecture for the design of large area monitoring \nsystems, potentially\
    \ enabling direct sensor to UAV integration. On the other hand, emerging \ntechnologies\
    \ such as ultra-wide band (UWB), which enables precise local positioning in constrained\
    \ \nenvironments can offer fine grained data to improve WSN–UAV interoperability.\
    \  \nOne common challenge that has emerged from our study was the need for extensive\
    \ scalability \nevaluations, which should prove the robustness of extended designed\
    \ collaborative solutions. In \npractice that leads from current solutions with\
    \ tens to hundreds of SNs and single or several UAVs \nto thousands of SNs and\

    \ go beyond proof of concept systems and include multiple sensor\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 4690\n33 of 40\nnodes and UAVs, integrated into a large scale, geographically\
    \ distributed, WSN. Due to the complexity\nand the multiple functionalities that\
    \ need to be covered (acquisition, processing, collaboration and\ncommunication),\
    \ these systems are, in essence, systems of systems. New concepts such as edge,\
    \ fog\nand cloud computing are now used in data processing. The artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ of the basic elements\n(UAVs and SNs) makes the intersection between the entities\
    \ in Figure 6 (UAV–WSN–IoT) increasingly\nrelevant. Both UAVs and WSNs are increasingly\
    \ considered as halves of a single multi-agent system,\nwhich functions organically\
    \ as a single, indivisible unit. Not in the least, the nodes being part of a WSN\n\
    are increasingly smart, with additional functionalities, which move them toward\
    \ the IoT paradigm.\nThus, we might conclude that systems integrating WSN, UAVs\
    \ and IoT are on an ascendant trajectory\nand will become ubiquitous in commercial\
    \ applications.\nAuthor Contributions: D.P. conceived the paper and revealed the\

    Explore all metrics Abstract Due to recent advancements and the success of versatile
    mobile applications, more and more services around the globe are being moved to
    the cloud. As a result, its limitations have become more evident. The major issues
    that cloud-based applications face include large latency, bottlenecks because
    of central processing, compromised security, and lack of offline processing. The
    drawbacks of cloud computing are reduced by fog and edge computing, where data
    are processed near the places where it is generated—at network edges or fog nodes—most
    importantly in a distributed way. Smart agriculture is an approach based on the
    Internet of Things (IoT) where cloud computing is not an option as the internet
    is usually not available at remote sites. In addition, pure edge computing also
    is not practical, as most sensor nodes are very small and they do not have enough
    computing power. Intermediate fog computing also is not a good choice, as fixed
    fog nodes (getaway nodes) do not work well with high node fluctuation caused by
    bad weather or harsh conditions. Considering these issues and limitations, we
    have proposed the idea of flying edge computing where an unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) acts as an edge-computing machine. This can be an ideal solution for smart
    agriculture, given the size and remoteness of many agricultural areas. This technique
    can be called “wind or breeze computing” because the data are “blown” or moved
    by the current of computing. The Flying-Edge offers fast deployment of edge facilities
    in challenging locations and it can be a major step to accomplish the goal of
    IoT-based smart agriculture. Similar content being viewed by others Enabling Edge

    The agriculture sector faces continuous pressure to feed the population of over
    9 billion that is expected by 2050 amid challenges like climate change and the
    limited availability of arable land. To address this situation, scientists and
    researchers have suggested augmenting this sector with modern technologies including
    the Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [1]. For example,
    IoTs provide updates about crop health, which helps farmers make the right decision
    at the right time. Precision agriculture is all about collecting the right data
    at the right time so that the use of resources can be optimized by considering
    the requirements of every inch of farmland. To make agriculture sustainable using
    the IoT has moved to the forefront of various agricultural operations. Moreover,
    UAVs are being used for various purposes in agriculture like monitoring, aerial
    sensing, tracking, data collection, communication, and security. UAVs, more precisely
    called flying-robots, are used in a wide range of applications where they often
    act as the first responder because of their fast, cost-effective, and safe deployment
    capabilities [2,3,4]. Further, with improved technology and facilities like three-dimensional
    maneuverability, UAVs are playing the crucial role of airborne base stations in
    almost all emerging networks. Because of their involvement in a wide range of
    daily applications, UAVs have become the best candidates to achieve the goal of
    precision farming [5]. Due to these capabilities, UAVs can be used throughout
    the life cycle of crops in such functions as soil health inspections [6], plantation
    [7], plant counting [8], crop health monitoring [9] [10], irrigation, spraying
    fertilizers and pesticides [11], and estimating crop yield. This technology has
    become the point of interest for all the stakeholders related to agriculture—including
    farmers, agronomists, crop insurers, and researchers—because of its suitability
    and advanced functionalities. These include the variety of models, longer flight
    times, greater payload capacities, and the ability to fly in varying conditions.
    In this article UAVs are proposed as an option to overcome the wide range of challenges
    from remote agriculture: They need to cover large geographical areas. A wide range
    of sensors and other devices are needed to monitor various parameters in this
    highly heterogeneous environment. They need to operate in remote locations, where
    sensors operate unattended. Connecting the sensors is a challenge because of unreliable
    and fluctuating communications. Some parameters must report in real-time. Many
    parameters require scalable data storage and processing capabilities. In this
    article, UAVs provide communication and data collection service to IoT nodes.
    Once data are collected, the next question is where to process it and what computation
    model is best suitable to provide the required services to the IoT nodes. For
    instance, cloud services can be used to access information from predictive analysis
    institutes so farmers apply products according to their specific requirements.
    However, for critical IoT-based agriculture applications to operate in such challenging
    areas, they need a reliable communication medium between the deployed objects
    and processing devices, which cannot be guaranteed in large and remote areas.
    Under these circumstances, cloud computing is not a good option because the internet
    may not be available in wide agriculture fields [12]. Furthermore, so-called fog
    computing also does not fit well since fog nodes are difficult to fix in harsh
    environments where node fluctuations are often. Most importantly, when we talk
    about specific applications in agriculture, edge computing may suffer from the
    fact that most nodes are very small, and they might not have sufficient processing
    capabilities. The need for scalability, economy, and node updates can generate
    more challenges. In short, in large farming areas where no reliable communication
    network is available to connect a large number of sensors to provide timely data,
    it is difficult to use existing fog and edge computing platforms. Considering
    the challenge, this paper presents the idea of a Flying-Edge, a UAV-based computing
    platform that aims to fulfill the requirements of smart agriculture. Flying Edge
    platforms, which can comprise one or multiple UAVs, offer the computing capabilities
    of IoT applications operating in remote locations. The proposed platform is highly
    dynamic and flexible, so it can be deployed and can collect data quickly. Most
    importantly, it can be used in tough terrains like the desert and hilly areas,
    removing the barriers to smart agriculture in such locations. The proposed edge
    platform builds an IoT network to collect crop data that will then be used to
    analyze crop health so, ultimately, the farmer can take timely smart actions.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a short background
    of mobile edge computing. Section 3 provides the details of the proposed platform
    along with all the design and functionalities it can perform. Section 4 evaluates
    the proposed idea and compares the results of different parameters while, Section
    5 presents concluding remarks and thoughts for future study. 2 Related work Using
    mobile edge computing is not new. Various authors have proposed mobile systems
    that offer computing facilities. Prominent efforts include mobile fog computing
    [13] [14], mobile cloud computing [15], and mobile edge computing [16]. However,
    these platforms work differently from the proposed idea of flying edge computing.
    The system proposed in [13] offers mobile edge services from a fixed machine.
    It enables integrating mobile devices such as smartphones and vehicles to the
    cloud, but only from a certain geographical area. The important thing about that
    work is that it offers low-latency with the facility of mobility and location
    awareness. Further, [15] [17] proposes mobile cloud computing that offers an infrastructure
    where both data storage and data processing occur in the cloud to support mobile
    devices. In that approach, mobile cloud computing frees mobile devices from storing
    large data and conducting heavy processing. In [13], mobile edge computing extends
    cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the cellular network. Different services
    with low latency can be provided to smartphones and other applications that rely
    on cellular communications. Using UAVs in smart agriculture also is not new. These
    flying robots are used in many ways. Authors in [18] present a hierarchical structure
    based on the collaboration between the UAVs and associated wireless sensors for
    crop monitoring in precision agriculture. That integration of UAVs with ground
    sensors and IoT applications proved to be a robust and efficient solution for
    data collection, control, analysis, and decisions in such specialized applications.
    Key advantages lay in online data collection and relaying the data to a central
    monitoring point, while effectively managing network load and latency through
    optimized UAV trajectories and in situ data processing. Two important aspects
    of the collaboration were considered: designing the UAV trajectories for efficient
    data collection and implementing effective data processing algorithms (consensus
    and symbolic aggregate approximation) at the network level to transmit the relevant
    data. Considering the worth of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
    for smart agriculture, researchers have begun to use edge computing to enhance
    crop production. In a similar effort in [19], the authors proposed a data link
    management solution based on mobile edge computing (MEC) to monitor water requirements
    for agriculture. The results showed that the scheme realizes the network and intelligence
    of agricultural water monitoring system management, and it has a broad market
    prospect. Edge computing plays an important role in smart agriculture, and it
    can be considered an ideal paradigm because of features like its ability to operate
    in remote locations, cover large areas, endure hostile conditions, provide sufficient
    bandwidth, and address connectivity issues. Collecting data at the right time
    and then performing the right steps for a given situation is possible only by
    using edge computing. So, it is crucial for agriculture. Edge computing can be
    the appropriate choice whenever there are connectivity issues. According to the
    proposal in [20], sensors and edge devices collect data from the monitoring area
    and send the data to an edge node. The node conducts a preprocess analysis of
    the data needed then sends the outcome to a server. The server collects and accumulates
    the results to predict and estimate the total harvest yield. By using this framework
    many decisions can be taken according to circumstances. Authors in [21] focus
    on an efficient solution for collecting data and exploiting tasks using edge computing
    for smart agriculture, global food security, and the pervasive issue of internet
    access. Further, [22] presents a platform that can manage the minerals for agriculture
    using saline water. It relies on transferable low-cost hardware which operates
    with edge computing to interact with crop sensors and devices to collect the data
    and perform atomic control actions in real-time monitoring scenarios. In all these
    studies, various features and services are provided to mobile devices to integrate
    with the cloud. However, they rely on fixed locations, such as stationary fog
    machines, fixed wireless stations, or fixed cellular towers. By contrast, Flying
    Edge offers these facilities from a mobile device instead of using only stationary
    devices. 3 Proposed flying edge computing The traditional model has been to use
    cloud computing to acquire and process data from the edge to offer useful services.
    Large cloud data centers provide different services (computing, platform, security,
    and storage) to edge devices through high bandwidth connectivity. Two key challenges
    emerge with this hub-and-spoke model. Public cloud data centers are globally distributed,
    but they are typically limited to one or a few per country (depending on its size).
    The network distance from the edge to the cloud can result in a long round trip
    time (RTT) in the order of thousands of milliseconds. For latency-sensitive cloud
    applications, this may compromise their performance. To overcome this, fog, mist,
    and edge computing have been introduced as extensions of cloud networks, which
    are collections of servers comprising a distributed network. Cloud, fog, and mist
    computing are also known as wet computing in the literature. The difference between
    them is the degree of distribution of services from the internet cloud to edge
    devices. We are introducing a new concept called Flying Edge computing (FEC).
    In contrast to previous forms of computing, we name it “dry” computing because
    data are blown along and dried by with the current of the computing wind. The
    speed and direction of the wind also matter. The faster the speed, the more the
    throughput. At slower speeds, a network is more tightly squeezed to collect the
    data. 3.1 Data evaporation UAV activates ground sensor nodes and provides them
    local computation, database, and communications infrastructure services. In contrast
    to typical fixed-edge computing machines installed near or inside the edge node,
    the UAV acts like a flying edge that moves between edge nodes to provide them
    the desired local and global services. Typical cloud, fog, and mist computing
    are called wet computing, but for Flying Edge we name it dry, wind, or breeze
    computing where data are evaporated from the sensor node to the air and collected
    by a UAV. UAV generates a computing wind in its vicinity, and data are evaporated
    (extracted from sensors) with the current of computing (movement of UAV). The
    speed of the UAV is taken as the current of computing wind, while several UAVs
    act like wind temperature. The more the UAVs, the faster the evaporation process
    (more throughput). Fast-moving UAVs produce shorter clusters with fewer sensor
    nodes, so slowing the computing wind ensures that the sensor nodes are squeezed
    well. We have taken agriculture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) as a case
    study. Crops are mostly grown in circular farms to save water. Our contribution
    is to modernize the KSA agriculture with state-of-the-art technologies to monitor
    crop health so resources can be managed tightly, especially the maximal use of
    water. We map flying edge computing with the perspective of KSA agriculture. Hundreds
    of crop fields are dispersed in a very large and remote area where there is no
    fixed communications infrastructure. It is assumed that all fields are equipped
    with a large number of sensors that monitor crops, soil, and environmental parameters
    at the same time. However, predefined network topologies (cluster heads, communication
    routes) are not possible because of the high fluctuation of sensor nodes caused
    by harsh water. In this scenario, cloud computing does not fit well as IoT devices
    do not have cloud access. In this presentation, a flying edge machine (UAV) moves
    in a predefined path. As it blows the computing wind, the underlying sensors form
    a cluster in the direction of the wind, and they choose a Cluster Head (CH) dynamically.
    As a result, the data are evaporated from CH to UAV, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig.

    of flying edge computing with other technologies, including cloud, fog, mist,
    and edge computing, is shown in Table 1 and represented in Fig. 2. Table 1 Comparison
    of different computing techniques Full size table Fig. 2 Similarities and differences
    of computing techniques Full size image As mentioned above, the Flying Edge is
    a UAV-based platform that acts as an edge node. Most importantly, the acting edge
    node can be reallocated to different locations where various sensors or devices
    need some edge node to complete certain IoT tasks. Moreover, it can provide the
    facility of a gateway to link or integrate IoT services and cloud computing. The
    Flying Edge can be equipped with resources like processors, storage facilities,
    communication devices, and an edge computational platform. This edge platform
    can execute several services to support IoT applications required for smart agriculture.
    One possible configuration for flying edge computing is shown in Fig. 3. In that
    figure, a UAV with edge computing facilities can move in any area where IoT services
    are required. It provides a set of services like low latency to the IoT applications
    in that area while it enables the integration of the IoT applications and the
    cloud. Fig. 3 Flying Edge supporting the smart agriculture Full size image The
    Flying Edge can facilitate smart agriculture based on IoT applications. Major
    opportunities that it can provide are: Fast deployment: because of its nature,
    the Flying Edge can be deployed at remote locations to facilitate IoT services.
    It is a turnkey system that can be used even where there is no communications
    infrastructure. Scalability: the system can be upgraded or enhanced in terms of
    coverage area, number of sensing devices, number of UAVs operated, and services
    provided. Flexibility: the system is flexible enough to adapt to any change in
    applications, required services, or the geography of the monitoring area. Location
    awareness: location services are provided by the flying edge machine, so IoT nodes
    do not require a GPS device. Power effectiveness: this scheme is very power efficient
    for end nodes (IoT nodes), as most of the services that require computation are
    provided by flying edge robots (UAVs). Because the Flying Edge can be deployed
    in an area where IoT devices are already deployed, most of the communication between
    these IoT devices and UAV is done through a personal area network (PAN) such as
    IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) and 801.15.1 (Bluetooth). Both protocols are characterized
    by lower bandwidths and shorter communication ranges. However, they also need
    low energy during the communication phase. Depending on the requirements, communication
    can be done through alternative protocols that support longer ranges like a local
    area network (LAN) such as IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi). On the other hand, all the communication
    between the Flying Edge and the cloud is done through protocols that are commonly
    used for wide area networks (WANs) including IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) and cellular.
    The choice of communications medium and protocol depends on the nature of the
    application and its location. 3.3 Proposed system architecture The proposed system
    has two components: an edge device and the Flying Edge computing machine, as shown
    in Fig. 4. The edge device (sensor or actuator) can get services from a UAV through
    a services request interface. Most of the computational services required by the
    IoT are provided by the local service response module, which is connected to several
    services built into the flying machine. In rare cases, the IoTs might require
    global services from the cloud, and they will be granted through a global services
    response module. Fig. 4 Flying Edge computing architecture Full size image 3.4
    Proposed system models Mobile devices and Internet-of-things (IoT) have been introduced
    in our lives very rapidly. They have brought ease to our work, but they also raised
    new challenges that needed cloud-based solutions including i) the need to transfer
    huge amounts of data to the cloud, ii) high communication latencies, and iii)
    the inability of this model to respond in some domains that require a rapid reaction
    to events. Different computing techniques like cloud, fog, and mist/edge computing
    have been introduced to address these issues and provide three basic services
    to the IoT devices: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), “Platform as a Service
    (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). The basic difference between these techniques
    is the layer in the network hierarchy from which the service is provided. This
    means the distance between the services and the source of data, as shown in Fig.
    5. In cloud computing, all the services are provided from the cloud (a central
    location) while fog computing is a distributed computing technique in which services
    are provided in network fabrics. In edge or mist computing, processing and services
    are provided near the end node (the source of data). Fig. 5 Typical cloud-to-edge
    computing hierarchy Full size image A typical computing hierarchy is shown in
    Fig. 5. As far as WSN is involved, many factors (lack of a communication link,
    limited processing capabilities, insufficient power) may restrict the use of any
    kind of computing technique. In such conditions, a UAV can replace any of the
    computing layers. In this article, we introduce four basic types of UAV replacement:
    1- UAV as a flying cloud 2- UAV as a flying fog 3- UAV as a flying edge 4- A swarm
    of UAVs as a distributed services provider 3.4.1 UAV as a flying cloud This configuration
    is applicable in a scenario where all the ground sensing nodes can communicate
    with each other but do not have access to the outer world (no internet). This
    type of scenario is applicable in battlefields, disaster areas, wildlife habitats,
    and remote farm fields. As all sensors are connected with each other, they maintain
    their local network in terms of clusters and routes independently. Local decisions
    are made either at the edge or the fog layer. Global services (data collection,
    localization, security, or software) and decisions are provided by the UAV as
    a Flying Cloud Machine (FCM) on a demand basis (see Fig. 6). Fig. 6 UAV a Flying
    cloud machine Full size image 3.4.2 UAV as a flying fog In this configuration,
    field sensors are equipped with local services (network and storage) through edge
    nodes. The UAV provides only communication services as a flying fog machine (FFM)
    to approach the cloud layer where all global services exist. FFM provides a bridge
    between the edge layer and the cloud layer, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Flying
    fog computing Full size image 3.4.3 UAV as a flying edge In this scheme, UAV provides
    computation and services to the IoT nodes by visiting them, and it provides services
    and computation close to the data source. It helps to improve latency and bandwidth,
    and it also enhances the network life by improving battery utilization of end
    nodes. All the sensors’ nodes are dump nodes. Their functionality is limited to
    sense and log parameters from the environment only. All the services (clustering,
    network, storage) and computation are provided to them by a UAV. If the UAV cannot
    fulfill a demanded service, it can render it from the cloud. A flying edge machine
    (FEM) is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Flying edge computing Full size image 3.4.4 UAV
    as a distributed flying edge machine A coordinated swarm of UAVs can provide edge
    services as shown in Fig. 9. Different services like network, storage, and localization
    are provided by separate UAVs. Hence each service will be provide by a specialized
    flying machine which will enhance the provided quality of service, throughput,
    and data collection. Swarm of UAVs can also work in a coordinated way such that
    they can share or take over the responsibilities if any one fails, distracted
    or power exhausted. This model will provide robust solutions in hardship conditions.
    Fig. 9 Distributed flying edge computing machine Full size image 4 Simulation
    and results A Flying Edge prototype was implemented using a distributed Java agent
    environment. This environment provides a middleware infrastructure that enables
    the implementation of different distributed programming models and advanced platform
    services for distributed heterogeneous environments. These heterogeneous environments
    may comprise multiple heterogeneous nodes with different capabilities. In addition,
    this middleware infrastructure provides scalability solutions to deploy, operate,
    monitor, and control large-scale distributed applications. Each agent in the environment
    can provide runtime support to securely execute some code. An edge machine provides
    broker services, invocation services, and location-based services. There is also
    a mechanism that allows each edge broker to forward a service search request to
    other brokers if it does not have the requested service. Both local and remote
    service invocations also are implemented and added to the prototype implementation.
    For the IoT side, we used the Arduino board, which is open-source hardware for
    embedded systems. For this prototype implementation, the Arduino was used as the
    IoT payload subsystem—the onboard device requesting services. Some sensors were
    connected to the Arduino board, such as the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature
    and humidity. Some LEDs and a buzz were installed to represent actuators. In addition,
    we installed an Adafruit CC3000 Wi-Fi board to connect the Arduino to a local
    area network and the Flying Edge machine. The Arduino code was developed using
    the Arduino IDE with the Adafruit CC3000 library. Each IoT service was implemented
    with a RESTful API. At the UAV edge computing side, there is a service that represents
    each sensor or actuator attached to the Arduino. The primary function of these
    services is to map a call from the SOAP APIs to RESTful APIs. All sensor and actuator
    services are registered with the local broker. In addition, the global broker
    is periodically updated with these services. For the experiments, we used three
    computers, which represented the cloud, the Flying Edge machine, and the IoT node.
    In addition, we used WAN emulators among these machines to introduce the effects
    of using long distances and/or the internet to connect the machines. Experiments
    were conducted for four configurations: Call1: a local IoT service call responded
    by the distributed flying edge machine Call2: a local IoT service call responded
    by the flying edge machine Call3: a remote IoT service call responded by the cloud
    through a flying fog machine Call4: a remote IoT service call responded by the
    flying cloud The experiment was repeated for two types of services. The first
    was to get the current temperature (CurTemp) and the second was to turn on the
    LED (LEDon). The average results of 10 runs of multiple service calls are shown
    in Fig. 10. The recorded times for these calls do not include the service lookup
    times. The response times for all service calls are shown in Fig. 10. It is evident
    that flying edge shows best results in term of response time by adding the benefits
    of battery efficiency of end nodes. It is also analyzed that the services provided
    by flying fog machine or through flying fog machine gives same results and are
    better than cloud. Fig. 10 IoT service call response time Full size image The
    average service lookup times for three services are shown in Fig. 11. Local services
    were provided by the local network. Remote 1 services were provided by the flying
    machine UAV to the end node. Remote 2 services were provided by the cloud through
    flying machines. There is a big difference between Remote 1 and Remote 2 service
    lookup times. This means that flying computing machines (UAVs) can provide services
    to IoT devices in a much faster way. Fig. 11 IoT service lookup Full size image
    5 Conclusion In this research article, we proposed a new concept of a computation
    mechanism for IoT devices. The processing and the services will be provided to
    the end devices neither from central location (cloud) nor by end device itself.
    Both cloud and edge computing have different pros and cons ranging from bottlenecks
    to poor resource utilization. The proposed system fulfills the service demand
    very close to the point of data generation without using additional network resources
    (energy, memory, or processor). Our aim is to provide these services to the IoTs
    by using the Flying Edge machine. This means the computational machine itself
    goes closer to the data-generation node and provides the demanded services. The
    architecture of the proposed Flying Edge machine is introduced, and the performance
    of the system is evaluated through simulation and lab test bed. The results showed
    the effectiveness of the proposed computational mechanism. As a result, we can
    say this system is very suitable for implementation in the case study presented
    (agriculture) but it is not limited to that use. References Friha O, Ferrag MA,

    Metrics Abstract: Internet of Things (IoTs) is a big world of connected objects,
    including the small and low-resources devices, like sensors, as well as the full-functional
    computing devices, such as servers and routers in the core network. With the emerging
    of new IoT-based applications, such as smart transportation, smart agriculture,
    healthcare, and others, there is a need for making great efforts to achieve a
    balance in using the IoT resources, including Computing, Communication, and Caching.
    This paper provides an overview of the convergence of Computing, Communication,
    and Caching (CCC) by covering the IoT technology trends. At first, we give a snapshot
    of technology trends in communication, computing, and caching. As well, we describe
    the convergence in sensors, devices, and gateways. Addressing the aspect of convergence,
    we discuss the relationship between CCC technologies in collecting, indexing,
    processing, and storing data in IoT. Also, we introduce the three dimensions of
    the IoTs based on CCC. We explore different existing technologies that help to
    solve bottlenecks caused by a large number of physical devices in IoT. Finally,
    we propose future research directions and open problems in the convergence of
    communication, computing, and cashing with sensing and actuating devices. Published

    rights and content Abstract In recent years, some official reports, to produce
    best products regarding quality, quantity and economic conditions, recommend that
    the farming sector should benefit with new tools and techniques coming from Information
    and Communications Technology (ICT) realm. In this way, during last decade the
    deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture.
    This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates
    activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or
    perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization. Apart from sensing devices,
    which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are
    the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data
    provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers
    in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production.
    In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable
    of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm,
    with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine.
    The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows
    some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability. An example of this
    platform has been deployed in a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of
    Vilafamés (Castelló, Spain). Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    agricultureVineyardDowny mildewGoidanich 1. Introduction The Food and Agricultural
    Organization (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion people
    by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 [1]. To keep pace, food production must
    increase 70% by 2050. There are some obstacles to increase food production and
    produce such amount of food. Some of them are climate change; restricted availability
    of arable land; reduced productivity growth; water necessity; the impact of urbanization
    over agricultural labour; high price and low availability of energy, mainly from
    fossil fuels; among many others. Moreover, the average age of farmers is increasing
    because young people prefer going into the industry [2]. A report from the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [3] enumerates all effects of climate change on
    agriculture. They are: 1) changes in extreme weather with severe flooding and
    acute water shortages areas will increase around the globe; 2) Since agriculture
    consumes 70% of the world''s fresh water supply, water management should be an
    adequate and controlled process. To mitigate these challenges, the FAO [4] recommends
    that all farming sectors should be equipped with new tools and techniques coming
    from the Information and Communications Technology (ICT). During the last decade,
    a new movement to implant digital technology on agriculture was born, which is
    known as precision agriculture [5]. It aims to optimize the yield per unit of
    farming land by using ICT tools and technologies [6]. The objective of precision
    agriculture is to achieve the best products concerning quality, quantity and economic
    conditions. Traditionally, precision agriculture makes use of sensors to monitor
    environmental conditions. To attain this objective, networks of these sensors
    are created to cover larger areas. Precision agriculture is not only attached
    to deploying on-site sensors but involving many areas related to robotics, computer
    science, and remote sensing. An example of this is the use of smartphones, which
    have been used to visualize on the field the data provided by sensors and offer
    the possibility to apply different strategies to improve productivity [7]. The
    works presented in [8], [9] exploit the use of advances in neural networks for
    weed detection and plant species identification with the purpose of optimizing
    the herbicide application. Finally, the review introduced in [10] showed the improvements
    of the spatial resolution in aerial and satellite imagery for precision agriculture
    since the late 80s, which now allows fine-grained analysis at the expense of high
    data storage and computational resources. In the last decade, a new approach to
    connect everything (sensors or actuators), as well as to monitor and act [11]
    using the Internet, was implanted in every aspect of our daily lives; this process
    has come to be called the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT describes how in the real
    world, physical things are integrated into the digital world of bits and bytes
    [12]. In general, it involves the integration of each object, such as a sensor
    or device that is connected via wired or wireless networks using the Internet.
    To connect things, the Internet Protocol (IP) is used, in which each device has
    an IP address. The IoT devices need a mechanism to communicate with the cloud
    side, which is called Machine to Machine (M2M) communications. M2M will work with
    new developments and contributes to the future of Internet [13]. Nowadays, the
    future of the Internet will not only consist of connecting people but also to
    the approach of a digital world where, ideally, everything will be connected.
    Every day farmers are producing large amounts of data that are published on the
    cloud, with the aim of delivering benefits concerning data access, synchronization
    storage and to apply some analysis, the so-called Cloud Computing (CC), to make
    decisions. New trends that appeared after CC move the computation towards the
    smart devices; the benefit is to distribute the computing between different things.
    This paradigm is called Edge Computing (EC) [14]. The connection between the IoT
    and M2M with precision agriculture have produced a new concept called “smart agriculture”
    following other M2M based implementations such as smart cities. One of the realms
    in which more great adaptation of such technologies has been incorporated is the
    viticulture. Viticulture has historically been characterized by obtaining a high-quality
    product. This has been made possible by many factors: the selection of suitable
    soil and climatic zones, the varietal vineyards and the work of the winegrowers
    in managing their vineyards. Many threats can affect quantity and quality of the
    wine. Concretely, there are some well-known plagues attacking vineyards, and they
    produce substantial losses. The vine is exposed to different types of diseases
    or harmful agents; these are classified into four types [15]. The first category,
    physiological damage or disorders in the vine that are not caused by pest and
    diseases, are generated by lack or excess of irrigation, extreme conditions due
    to meteorological factors, natural ageing, deficiencies or excesses of nutrients
    in the vine, lousy soil, irrigation with saline water, among many others. The
    second category, fungus, they can even grow in both wet and dry regions. Some
    examples of this disease are powdery mildew, downy mildew, and bunch rot and they
    can even grow well in both wet and dry regions. The third category, vine pests,
    and insects, the most damaging are those that feed on grapes, examples of them
    are: Tetranychus urticae, Meloidogyne, Heterodera, Ditylenchus, Lobesia botrana,
    Colomerus viti, Eriophyes vitis or Phylloxera vastatrix, among others. Finally,
    the last category is vine diseases generated by viruses and bacteria, like grapevine
    degeneration, grapevine decline, leafroll complex or rugose wood complex. All
    these diseases impoverish the quality of the grape, and as a result, they might
    cause severe economic losses to farmers and people related to the wine industry.
    Downy mildew is probably the most studied disease, as it produces critical economic
    losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries1 . Within this context, this
    paper introduces the SEnviro platform for vineyards, which integrates the downy
    mildew model [16] for detecting the most suitable moment to treat the downy mildew
    disease. In summary, the main contributions of this work are: 1. to apply a model
    to alert when would be the suitable moment to treat the downy mildew disease in
    the vineyard context; 2. to monitor vineyard fields through a new version of the
    SEnviro platform following the IoT paradigm and; 3. to follow the edge computing
    paradigm and to mitigate the communication between ends. The remainder of the
    paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background of the IoT in
    edge computing, open hardware and smart agriculture. Section 3 presents the SEnviro
    Platform. Section 4 details the Goidanich model used to detect the suitable moment
    to apply treatment for the downy mildew disease. Section 5 shows the experimentation
    done to test the platform. Section 6 reviews the related work. The paper concludes
    in Section 7 with conclusions and future work. 2. Background This section is devoted
    to showing the background of the IoT, Edge Computing, and Open Hardware paradigms.
    Also, their relation with precision agriculture through GIS is detailed. 2.1.
    IoT in the edge Cisco''s report anticipates that 50 million smart objects will
    be connected to the Internet by 2020 [17]. This situation will cause “data tsunami”
    which refers to the use of the IP to achieve connectivity between these smart
    objects. This trend produces streams of potential information, which challenge
    today''s data analysis systems in a centralized server in the Cloud [18], [19],
    [20]. IoT movement has been successfully applied in healthcare [21], [22], [23],
    [24] (ambient-assisted living and telemedicine), smart home and smart metering
    [25], [26] (devices that enable the automation of common in-house activities),
    video surveillance [?] (intelligent video systems), automotive and smart mobility
    [27], [28] (intelligent transportation systems) and smart energy and smart grid
    (intelligent management of energy distribution and consumption) [29]. All these
    applications have boosted up the popularity of “smart things” connected to the
    Internet, and the networks created with them. In this way, the traditional WSNs
    have been updated to follow an IP protocol to apply all the benefits that it entails.
    The new paradigm, namely cloud computing, has been added to improve and provide
    more advantages over the IoT [30]. The low bandwidth lacks between the producer
    (smart objects) and consumer parts (cloud server) and the improved performance
    at both computing and consumer of smart objects, has led to a new paradigm called
    edge computing. The main feature of edge computing is that data can be processed
    locally in smart devices, rather than being sent to the cloud for being processed.
    The edge computing essentially means that instead of staying and working from
    a centralized cloud, edge nodes work at the ends of the networks. Edge computing
    puts some of the transactions and resources on the edge of the cloud; instead
    of establishing channels for storage and use in the cloud, it reduces the need
    for bandwidth by not sending every bit of information through channels to the
    cloud and instead adds it in specific access points. By using this type of distributed
    strategy, we can reduce costs and increase efficiency and reduce bandwidth consumption.
    Edge computing arose from the need to address three issues: 1) being able to act
    in real-time with the incoming data; 2) working within the limits of available
    bandwidth; and 3) distributing the computing between the nodes, to relive the
    centralized server. Edge computing address applications and services that do not
    fit the paradigm of the cloud, such as applications that require very low latency
    and being predictable; geospatial distributed applications; fast mobile applications;
    distributed control systems on a large scale. Fig. 1 details the work-flow for
    connecting sensor nodes to users using a cloud and edge computing infrastructure.
    On the one hand, this figure divides the physical and cyber worlds and the IoT
    part with traditional IT. The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is used to pass
    the barrier between the IoT device cloud and the IT cloud [31]. It is responsible
    for the interworking between the GPRS network and Internet. On the other hand,
    the figure shows where the edge computing is located. The results offered by the
    edge computing can be sent to the cloud or directly to the clients without using
    any cloud infrastructure. Download : Download high-res image (165KB) Download

    and IT, that it is divided between the physical and cyber world. 2.2. Open-hardware
    to make smart objects Nowadays, the open movement has gained attention [32]. Traditionally,
    this idea was applied with more acceptance over source code and provoked the open-source
    movement. More recently, the same idea has been applied to the hardware (open-hardware).
    This situation has permitted to offer complete open systems, where both source
    and hardware are open. The users can contribute to improve the system and propose
    improvements. One of these improvements is the ability to offer more interoperability
    between components because they can be adapted for each usage. In this way, it
    reduces compatibility issues. This advantage can establish a standard IoT approach.
    In this work, we apply different Geographic Information Systems (GIS) standards
    to communicate with each IoT device; these standards will be explained in following
    paragraphs. Another advantage is the low cost of these devices compared with commercial
    solutions. As concluded by [33], open initiatives are cheaper, but they have also
    shown that open hardware is more powerful and has better performance than commercial
    solutions. Also, the same work demonstrates that the open hardware project can
    be considered reliable. Currently, there are several different alternatives regarding
    the micro-controller based platform, and the most remarkable platforms are Arduino2,
    Raspberry Pi3, BeagleBone4 or MSP430 Launchpad5 . All these platforms can be expanded
    easily, and used for other applications. Using these platforms different applications
    have been developed thanks to the acceptance of the IoT movement above described.
    2.3. GIS role in smart agriculture As commented in the Section 1, one way to address
    these issues and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production
    is by using ICT to make farms more “intelligent” and more connected through the
    so-called “precision agriculture” also known as “smart agriculture”. Nowadays,
    there is a high quantity of proprietary IT solutions to help farmers manage their
    farms more effectively [34]. More advanced systems track geospatial zones, weather
    patterns and perform expert predictions [35]. These kinds of systems are called
    Farm Management Information Systems [36], and focus on specific tasks and use
    their specifications to implement the functionality provided. Currently, this
    field is slowly moving to use the Internet and is starting to use some of the
    networking solutions to improve what they offer to the end users. However, it
    is widely accepted that the Internet faces some shortcomings, especially in handling
    vast numbers of networked devices (IoT) or stakeholders. Moreover, there is still
    no standardized solution to enable cohesive and straightforward interoperability
    among services and stakeholders. To solve this issue, we look at GIScience. It
    can offer an excellent opportunity to standardize the ways of connecting different
    “things”, offering an interoperable connection; and it should help to deploy the
    new smart cities. GIScience can be defined as “the discipline that uses GIS as
    tools to understand the world” [37]. It can contribute by offering a crucial essential
    component for the IoT movement, which is interoperability using the use of standards.
    The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)6 is a non-profit international organization
    which develops open standards for the global geospatial community. OGC defines
    standards in a wide variety of domains including environment, defense, health,
    agriculture, meteorology, sustainable development, and smart cities. The OGC has
    standardized Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) as a set of specifications related to
    sensors, sensor data models, and sensor web services that will enable sensors
    to be accessible and controllable via the web [38]. It is composed of a set of
    standards; the most popular are: Observations and Measurements (O&M), SensorML,
    Sensor Observation Service (SOS), Transducer Model Language (TransducerML), Sensor
    Planning Service (SPS), Sensor Alert Service (SAS) or Web Notification Service
    (WNS). Another proposal is OGC SensorThings API7 . It is a new candidate standard
    that provides open access built on web protocols, based on the current SWE standard
    and following the architectural REST style. The aim is to provide a standardized
    a way to expose the IoT world to the real world, where things have limited resources.
    3. SEnviro platform This section presents the sensorized platform used in a smart
    agricultural context. As commented in the above sections, the platform Sense Our
    Environment (SEnviro) [39] follows the IoT and Web of Things (WoT) [40] paradigms
    by means of a low-cost, open-hardware and open-software, energetically efficient
    and autonomous and interoperable solution. The SEnviro platform uses the IP protocol
    to establish the connection. With these features, it can be considered that each
    SEnviro Thing is a smart object. A network is formed by joining several SEnviro
    Things. This platform makes use of standards when publishing data. It guarantees
    the interoperability of the services provided by the platform. Another important
    feature of this platform is that it is energetically efficient and autonomous
    through a battery cell, which is charged with the energy provided by a solar panel
    attached to it. To save as much energy as possible, we are using a sleep mode,
    in which during this period the micro-controller and connectivity module consume
    as little as possible. 3.1. How is SEnviro made of? At the hardware level, the
    sensorized platform has been designed to be a node acting as a smart object, which
    provides measures of environmental variables. Each SEnviro Thing is composed of
    different components, which are organized into four groups depending on their
    function: Core, Sensors, Power Supply and Communication. At the same time, the
    Core is formed by four parts: Micro-controller, Connectors, Clock, and Memory.
    For this work, we developed an enhanced SEnviro using the LinkIt One development
    board. The LinkIt ONE board is an open source, high performance, Arduino footprint
    board for prototyping IoT devices. The board is based around a powerful ARM7 EJ-S
    processor but has onboard GSM, GPRS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth BR/EDR/BLE, GPS, Audio codec,
    and SD card connector. Pin-out similar to Arduino boards, including Digital I/O,
    Analog I/O, PWM, I2C, SPI, UART and power supply, compatible with Grove 4-pin
    interface. In Section 5, we detail all components used to develop the SEnviro
    node for monitoring vineyards. 3.2. How does SEnviro work? At an operational level,
    SEnviro Thing can change its behaviour, updating the information about what sensor
    is active and the frequency at which measures are taken. The SEnviro Thing''s
    behaviour has two stages, initial and repetitive periodic. In the initial stage,
    a set of procedures are executed when it is initiated, for instance, one procedure
    could initialize the clock using the current time. The repetitive periodic stage
    defines the procedures that are repeated during the SEnviro Thing''s life cycle
    before going to sleep. Fig. 4 shows the design of the complete infrastructure
    with all of the system''s components, and describes each of them in different
    layers. If we analyze SEnviro from a GIS context and specify what is happening
    in each of its layers, we obtain Fig. 2, which we are going to detail below. In
    the content layer, there are different SEnviro Things to cover an area to measure
    the phenomena by the included sensors in each sensorized platform. In this figure,
    we can see the two functionalities mentioned above. Download : Download high-res
    image (253KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. General overview about
    the SEnviro work-flow following three layers architecture. As detailed in [39],
    different observations are periodically taken from the installed sensors to monitor
    the environment. When the SEnviro Thing takes a new observation, it invokes the
    Sensor Data Management (SDM) module. This component is implemented as a RESTful
    web service. The SDM module is responsible for publishing observations in different
    services that we want to offer, such as SensorThings API, SOS or others. Thus,
    it offers the same content using different interfaces; depending on the context
    it may be more or less appropriate. Different adapters for each of these services
    are offered. If we want to support new services/standards, we only need to add
    a new adapter for the service. We use the adapter software pattern to implement
    this feature. The service layer offers the services described above. One of the
    objectives of the SEnviro platform is to offer a standard service, to provide
    connectivity in an interoperable way. To meet this challenge, a candidate OGC
    standard, SensorThings API, has been used to offer an interoperable service to
    access the SEnviro platform. The most remarkable thing about this standard is
    that it breaks away from all “standard topics” [41] and offers access to restrictive
    devices, such as smartphones. Also, it offers the SOS interface to increase the
    interoperability, because this standard is widely used [42]. Finally, a lightweight
    RestFul service is created to connect this service in a more agile way [43]. The
    last layer, the application layer has been designed for different clients, mobile,
    web-based or desktop. The SEnviro Thing can adapt its behavior, updating the information
    about which sensor is active and the frequency at which measurements are taken.
    At regular intervals, the platform requests a new behavior to a server using a
    RestFul service. Then, the SEnviro Thing will get a new behavior following the
    new configuration received. The sensorized platform sends the taken observations
    to a server. A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this integration.
    Different operations are available to collect the observations measured. When
    one SEnviro Thing takes a new observation it invokes these operations to send
    data to the server using SDM module. When the SDM receives a new observation,
    it connects with the different adapters to send the data for each available service.
    To accomplish this objective, we have followed previous work [43], [39] to connect
    with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate standard SensorThings
    API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors access using RestFul
    interface used in [43]. To offer all these interfaces, we provide different adapters
    to publish the sensor data in different services or databases. To offer a SensorThings
    interface, we use an external server to test this API, which is offered by the
    SensorThings API candidate proposal. For SOS, the 52° North implementation (SOS
    version 2.0) is used. In this case, the server is deployed using an Apache Tomcat
    server and sensor data are stored in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database8 following
    the documented standard installation guides. Finally, for the last interface,
    a Lightweight RestFul service is implemented using JAX-RS9, Jersey 10 and one
    MongoDB database11 is used to store the observations. 4. Goidanich model to detect
    downy mildew disease Downy mildew is a fungal disease caused by the plasmopara
    viticola oomycete. It is one of the worst diseases of vine cultivation under specific
    weather conditions. Downy mildew is the most studied disease, as it produces critical
    economic losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries [44]. Downy mildew
    is the result of the presence of a fungus in the green elements of the vines,
    and its life cycle is well established [44]. Its biological cycle is developed
    in four phases: contamination, incubation, and sporulation and propagation phase.
    • Contamination phase: in spring, the oospores reach maturity and germinate as
    zoospores. These may be transported by rain and wind, reaching the vine green
    parts and colonizing them. The needed conditions for contamination are: an air
    temperature around 10 °C, a young plant of at least 10 cm, and a rain rate of
    at least 10 mm/day. • Incubation phase: it takes from 4 to 21 days, depending
    on the temperatures and relative humidity. • Sporulation phase: during this step,
    the fungus is propagated along the vine. • Propagation phase: dissemination to
    nearby plants with the help of rebounding raindrops and wind. The optimal condition
    for ambient temperature is between 20 and 25 °C, with the help of rain during
    the night. There are some models with more complexity and better precision than
    Goldanich [45] such as MILVIT [46], [47]. Some other works simulate only a particular
    phase of the epidemic cycle [48], [49]. Moreover, some other works simulate only
    the first date of primary infection followed by the second cycle with quantitative
    outputs [50], [51]. More recently, new models are presented which use exploratory
    simulations based on newly available computing power [52]. Our work, unlike the
    ones found in the bibliography, is the pioneer in using devices of IoT for monitoring
    this kind of models. Although Goldanich''s model has been improved over time,
    it is an ideal candidate for testing our platform. As a future work, we intend
    to use other more complete models to improve the predictions of this type of disease.
    The Goidanich model is used to follow the evolution of the downy mildew fungus
    [16]. It takes into account three different phenomena: relative humidity, temperature,
    and rainfall. The model starts when a traditional method is reached, the “rule
    of the three ten”, which predicts that primary infections will occur once the
    average temperature has exceeded 10 degrees, the sprouting exceed 10 cm and on
    a day when there is at least 10 mm of rainfall. This rule, though simple, gives
    a rough idea of when to start looking for these primary infections. To follow
    the evolution of the fungus, it is necessary to know the average temperature (Tm),
    the average relative humidity (Hm) and daily rainfall. Goidanich presents a daily
    table (Table 1) in which, for each temperature, the daily growth of the fungus
    is set according to whether the Hm is high or low. The author defines each Tm
    in two columns, one when the Hm is lower than 75% and the other when it is higher
    than 75%, providing, therefore, two numerical values of daily development for
    each case. Table 1. Daily cumulative percentage of downy mildew incubation. Tm(C)

    records 10 or more mm of rain, starting from the next day, the estimation of the
    daily growth is recorded, and the model is calculated by adding every day until
    reaching the value of 100. At this moment, the theoretical incubation period ends,
    and the fungus contamination is evident due to the appearance of stains of oil
    and the asexual fruiting. The model works in that if the sum of the daily development
    accumulated is over 70%, the risk is high, so treatment is needed as soon as possible.
    If a fungicide product is applied, the development of the fungus restarts and
    remains in suspension for a certain number of days, or until the product has been
    washed away by rain. 5. Case study: SEnviro for agriculture This section details
    how we have developed the sensorized platform in a smart agricultural context.
    5.1. Building a SEnviro Thing for Smart Agriculture For this work, we have developed
    a new version of the sensorized platform presented in [39]. For the current case
    study, we only need three different phenomenon sensors, such as temperature, humidity
    sensor and rain gauge (Fig. 3). Also, for this case, the new sensorized platform
    uses a GPRS connection to offer easy installation and wireless connection in the
    field. The LinkIt One board offers an integrated GPRS module. Table 2 shows a
    general description. Fig. 3 shows a SEnviro Thing assembled with all components
    used to follow the Goidanich model. Download : Download high-res image (166KB)

    Ion Battery 2200mAh 3.7V Empty Cell Solar panel 3W Solar Panel 138X160 To offer
    an energetically efficient and autonomous platform, we use a lithium battery of
    2200 mAh12 that supplies an output voltage of 3.7 V and is charged with the power
    generated with a 3W solar panel13 that supplies an output voltage of 5.2 V. Those
    two elements and the microcontroller are attached to a board (Lipo Rider V1.114)
    that handles the power ow between the various components. Finally, to protect
    all parts of the SEnviro Thing, two boxes have been used. A waterproof box15 to
    protect the Core, Communication and Power supply and a pagoda box to protect the
    sensors. 5.2. Applying Goidanich model This section describes the behavior that
    follows the developed SEnviro node for monitoring the downy mildew. The SEnviro
    has two different objectives: 1) to take and send observations at a defined rate,
    which by default is every ten minutes. 2) to calculate the Goidanich model, and
    if an alert state happens, the SEnviro node will send an alert via SMS. The Fig.
    4 shows these two functionalities as general overview following different layers.

    Fig. 4. On top) the figure gives information about the realization of the different
    components of the infrastructure and the sequence diagram of an exemplary usage
    to send SEnviro''s observations; on bottom) it gives a sequence diagram of an
    alarm. The first functionality was explained in [39], but in this work, some changes
    have been introduced. The first functionality has been the connectivity used.
    We have selected GPRS connectivity due to lack of other connectivity in the context
    in which it is experienced. The sensorized platform sends the observations to
    a server (Section 3). A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this
    integration. Different operations are available to collect the observations measured.
    When one SEnviro Thing catches a new observation, it invokes these operations
    and sends the data to the server using the SDM module. When the SDM receives a
    new observation, it connects with the different adapters to send the data for
    each service available. To accomplish this objective, we have followed our previous
    work [43], [39] to connect with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate
    standard SensorThings API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors
    access using RestFul interface used in [43]. To complete the SEnviro Thing integration,
    we proposed a SEnviro application to access sensor data provided by each SEnviro
    Thing. The SEnviro APP is a web-application in charge of integrating the sensor
    data provided by the installed SEnviro Things. Furthermore, the application is
    built using the mobile-first approach. In this way, it can be easily tested on
    a mobile device. The second functionality, which is of high importance for this
    work, is the possibility to apply the Goidanich model in each SEnviro node. We
    follow the fog computing paradigm to distribute the computation between the devices,
    in this case, SEnviro nodes. To calculate the Goidanich model, we need to know
    the temperature and humidity averages per day and the amount of rainfall accumulated.
    Each platform will have the capability to execute a method as depicted in Fig.
    5. The Pseudocode 1 shows how each SEnviro Thing can calculate the Goidanich model.

    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Goidnich model workflow. Download
    : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size image The first
    step is to accumulate the rain gauge. When it starts to rain, the algorithm will
    calculate the rain quantitative uninterruptedly while it is raining. The accumulative
    value will be reset when in one-day rainfall has been recorded. When the accumulative
    rainfall exceeds 10 mm, the SEnviro starts to calculate the temperature and humidity
    means. To offer these means, we will add up all of the observations taken in one
    day and divide them by the number of observations. These means will be used to
    determine the percentage of downy mildew incubation, and the selected value will
    be accumulated. When this value reaches 100, an alarm will be sent to the farmer
    to inform him/her about the downy mildew incubation level, and the specialized
    treatment can begin. We have selected SMS-based services as the way to connect
    with the farmers. It is due to the high penetration of mobile phones used by the
    stakeholders. Also, using SMS notifications, we can guarantee that the notification
    will arrive at the farmer. Other mobile technologies that use Internet connection
    do not guarantee the notification delivery, because the receiver needs permanent
    Inter-net connection. It involves farmers having a smartphone with an Internet
    connection data plan that will also receive the alarm. It is important to remark
    the potential of the developed SEnviro node. Although this subsection has described
    the behavior that it followed for a particular disease, its development could
    be modified to follow other models using the meteorological data collected by
    the node. Therefore, we consider that the SEnviro node could also be useful for
    detecting different diseases in vineyards or other crops. 5.3. Results In a first
    phase, the platform has been tested in a lab environment. It was working correctly
    without huge losses. The sensors obtained measurements between predictable values.
    The rain gauge has also been tested with rain recreation, and it was working correctly.
    These tests were carried out both indoors and outdoors. In a second phase, we
    have been deployed within a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafamés
    (Castelló, Spain). The parcel has a 23633.4 m2. Fig. 6 shows the location of each
    SEnviro Thing. A SEnviro node was deployed in this vineyard parcel during May
    2016 (Fig. 7), the month when downy mildew can begin to arise at the chosen location.
    As mentioned, this platform is capable of measuring three different phenomena
    which are temperature, humidity and the amount of rainfall that are all involved
    in the Goidanich''s model. During this month, observations were taken every 10
    minutes and were sent to the central server. Each platform can calculate the temperature
    and minimum humidity, in addition to calculating cumulative rainfall every day.

    the platform registered correct observations. During this period, the rain gauge
    did not reach 10mm to activate the alert, so our system does not detect downy
    mildew. During the 30 days that is was running almost all observations (96,9%
    successful deliveries) have been measured and sent in real-time although there
    were some that were undetected due to the loss of the signal in the area. These
    lost observations were sent in following deliveries. 6. A comparative between
    some similar works In the literature, some approaches are similar to our proposal.
    The following items describe the works that have been analyzed. All of them talk
    about IoT in the smart agriculture context, more concretely on monitoring vineyards.
    • In [53], the authors propose a WSN where each node takes images from the field
    and internally uses image processing techniques to detect any unusual status in
    the leaves. • The paper [54] presents a smart embedded system that will aid vineyards
    and which is cost-effective and flexible. They monitor ambient temperature and
    humidity and send an SMS with the values. • Authors in [55] do not describe a
    single platform, they show a variety of sensor network configurations and applications
    that can address different priorities in the vineyard. • Authors in [56] present
    the results from an operational sensor network. The network is based on the Berkeley
    mote (Mica II mote). The basic sensor board is equipped with a temperature sensor.
    The network consisted of sixty-five motes distributed in a grid-like pattern ten
    to twenty meters apart covering about two acres. • Authors in [57] present a general
    sensor network designed to connect agriculture to the IoT. A customized sensor
    node and developed the application for agriculture on top of TinyOS 2.x are detailed.
    A common access interface of the sensor networks for agricultural applications
    was created to enable further integration of the sensor networks on the IoT. •
    A sensor network built using TelosB platforms is presented in [58]. They show
    the experience of maturated during the design and deployment of a prototypal WSN-based
    system for monitoring the productive cycle of high-quality wine in a Sicilian
    winery. They propose two networks, one for the vineyard, and another for the wine
    cellar. The objective is to provide some of the basic functionalities that may
    be extended to obtain complete product traceability, from the grapes to the bottle.
    To compare the formerly reviewed works, Table 3 shows a comparison between the
    detailed works. The following features to characterize each one have been proposed:
    • Platform: it refers to the microcontroller model that the system uses. • Real-Time:
    it indicates if the system works in real-time. Possible values: Yes/No. • Connection:
    it refers to the wireless connections available for the system. Possible values:
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS, others. • Phenomena: it refers to the phenomena that the
    system can measure. Possible values: Temp., Hum., Dust, Bar., Noise, others. •
    IoT-WoT: it indicates if the system follows the IoT and WoT paradigms. Possible
    values: Yes/No. • Analyze: it shows if the system offers a RESTFul interface.
    Possible values: Yes/No. • Client: it indicates if the system provides a client
    for visualizing the sensors and observations. Possible values: Yes (what kind)
    /No. • OGC standards: it shows if the system offers OGC standards. Possible values:
    Yes (what kind) /No. Table 3. Comparison between different sensorized platforms.

    works and our work using the characteristics listed at the beginning of this section,
    and the results are shown in Table 3. As indicated, most of the analyzed works
    use different platforms to build the different nodes. In our case, we use LinkIt
    ONE, because it has different ways to connect, GPRS, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It also
    includes useful operations to use the different features. Like some other works
    analyzed, our work offers sensor data in real-time. It is possible because our
    SEnviro node, to monitor vineyards, is provided with GPRS connection to the Internet.
    SEnviro, as we show in [39], it can include a huge variety of phenomena. For this
    proof of concept, to detect downy mildew disease, we adopt the nodes to offer
    only three phenomena: temperature, humidity and rain gauge. Only three analyzed
    projects [56], [57], [58] follow the IoT and WoT paradigms. SEnviro follows these
    paradigms and offers a RESTFul interface. Finally, our project aims to be interoperable,
    and for this purpose, an OGC standard has been chosen, such as the OGC SensorThings
    API. If you look at the works that apply some analysis over the observations from
    the sensors, only two works, apart from SEnviro, apply some analysis to increase
    the value of the observations and offer decision-making models. Our work, as we
    detailed in the previous work [39], provides a client to these paradigms and offers
    a RESTful interface using the OGC SensorThings API. 7. Conclusions The primary
    concern of this work is to apply the new improvements in the ICT area, within
    the smart agriculture context. In this way, the applied model to detect the suitable
    moment to treat downy mildew disease can help the farmer in different ways. The
    first improvement is the reduction of costs of chemical products. The proposed
    support system detects the best moment to apply the downy mildew control treatments,
    which are only applied when they are strictly necessary. At the same time, it
    reduces the chemicals in the soil. It redounds in less external elements in the
    environment, improving the ecological footprint of the crop. Also, it reduces
    costs concerning person-hours; each treatment that is not needed represents some
    working hours that could be used for other tasks. Consequently, the farmer does
    not need to visit the vineyards to know the status. Our work applied a sensorized
    platform called SEnviro detailed in [39], whose objective was to monitor vineyards.
    For this purpose, we have designed a new version of the sensorized platform to
    measure different phenomena to provide follow up models to detect the best moment
    to treat downy mildew. To achieve this, we propose an improved version of the
    SEnviro platform that follows different computer science paradigms, such as IoT
    or edge computing. In this way, our platform can process and apply short algorithms
    to compute the information at the same moment when the data are collected. The
    objective of the work is not to evaluate or validate the Goldanich model since
    there are different works in the bibliography related to that. Our work only shows
    a single experimentation to test the presented IoT platform. It has offered good
    results during the month that the SEnviro platform has been installed and has
    correctly reported the observations to the central server, the platform had some
    isolated losses caused by coverage problems to send the observation in real-time.
    Temperatures and humidities average for the monitoring of the Goidanich model
    have also been calculated. As future work, new fungal disease models in the field
    of viticulture could be included, such as Powdery mildew, Black rot or Botrytis.
    All of these diseases are based on meteorological phenomena, and they are included
    in the SEnviro node. New kinds of crop could be supported if the disease models
    are based on these meteorological phenomena. Support other crops with other phenomena
    require to add these sensors, in this case, more efforts are needed. Acknowledgments

    the pressure on the agriculture sector. With the advent of technology, this decade
    is witnessing a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed both the quality and quantity of
    the agriculture sector. Hybridization of species along with the real-time monitoring
    of the farms paved a way for resource optimization. Scientists, research institutions,
    academicians, and most nations across the globe are moving towards the practice
    and execution of collaborative projects to explore the horizon of this field for
    serving mankind. The tech industry is racing to provide more optimal solutions.
    Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless
    sensor networks can provide sufficient scope to predict, process, and analyze
    the situations and improve the activities in the real-time scenario. The concept
    of heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices by providing flexible, scalable,
    and durable methods, models are also opening new domains in this field. Therefore,
    this paper contributes towards the recent IoT technologies in the agriculture
    sector, along with the development of hardware and software systems. The public
    and private sector projects and startup''s started all over the globe to provide
    smart and sustainable solutions in precision agriculture are also discussed. The
    current scenario, applications, research potential, limitations, and future aspects
    are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of IoT a precision farming framework
    is also proposed in this article. A graphical abstract for Recent developments

    is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’ means ‘Cultivation’.
    It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one of the benchmark areas.
    This field is the withstander of the economies of various nations. According to
    the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), more than
    60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival and around 12%
    of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted by FAO,
    the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year 2025
    and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of this
    data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of 70%
    in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is also
    the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based fertilizers,
    biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations, the agriculture
    sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution in the
    growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture
    for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained
    from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study,
    the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided
    by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions
    of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual,
    and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has
    been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices
    like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been
    discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been
    discussed. The significance and key differences of MIoT in agriculture have been
    discussed along with related studies. Studies limited to a specific domain has
    been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in
    agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe
    for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions
    to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements,
    future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper
    has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for
    the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into

    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture
    of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based
    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different
    models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like
    a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc,
    it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino
    Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers.
    Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and
    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.
    It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost
    open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in
    the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments,
    it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75
    mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of
    power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks
    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
    as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware
    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE
    5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT
    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7
    Sensors Based on Their Fields of Application FIGURE 6. Sensors and their types.

    Things in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is
    being conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided

    for agriculture have been discussed. Elijah et al. [67], gave an overview of IoT
    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios
    were also presented. Misra et al. [68], discussed the concepts and role of IoT,
    AI and big data in the field of agriculture. In the review, focus was laid on
    green- house monitoring, disease detection, usage UAV machines and drones agriculture

    employed for forecasting and designing decision support systems. The challenges
    and constraints of designing the decision support system were highlighted. The
    most available and published data present online in terms of pest management was
    also discussed. A differentiation between the documented and existing decision
    support systems was highlighted. The advancement and role of the internet of things
    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their

    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.

    to generate crop health maps. Deep neural networks were implemented for classification
    and provided the optimal classification. Some studies of the articles incorporating
    IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary
    of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play
    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.
    Parameters like air temperature, leaf wetness, air humidity, and soil wetness
    were considered and studied for model design. For digital communication between
    field and farm GSM module was used. Truong et al. [155], real-time data monitoring
    capable system was designed with IoT and cloud storage for disease detection and
    recognition. The fungal diseases of rural crop fields with detected. Environmental
    data conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall were employed
    for designing decision support. A Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) model
    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,
    firstly the agriculture sector along with its challenges and economic importance
    is presented. The domain of IoT along with the communication technologies and
    goals, protocols, architectures are studied and put forward. The various IoT OS,
    their specifications and features with respect to agriculture are discussed. An
    analytic study of various articles in the field of agriculture is presented, highlighting
    their most focused sections and gaps or areas not addressed. The sensors based
    on their field of application are also discussed. A systematic review of different
    articles focusing especially on crop monitoring, irrigation, disease detection,
    and farm management is offered. The articles considered for study range from the
    time frame of the year 2015 to 2020. From the studies, certain issues are put
    forward that demand research and experimentation in the future. Various existing
    public and private sector platforms or start-ups which work for precision farming
    are also presented and discussed with their specifications and applications. Making
    precision farming a base, a layout of an IoT based architecture is proposed. The
    communication technologies and the hardware platforms of IoT are also discussed.
    The applications of IoT in agriculture are also discussed. The issues, challenges,

    \ high-accuracy measurements, traditional air quality monitoring and\nprediction\
    \ systems adopt high-accuracy sensors. However, high-accuracy sensors are accompanied\n\
    with high cost, which cannot be widely promoted in Internet of Things (IoT) with\
    \ many sensor nodes.\nIn this paper, we propose a low-cost air quality monitoring\
    \ and real-time prediction system based on\nIoT and edge computing, which reduces\
    \ IoT applications dependence on cloud computing. Raspberry\nPi with computing\
    \ power, as an edge device, runs the Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm, which improves\n\
    the accuracy of low-cost sensors by 27% on the edge side. Based on the KF algorithm,\
    \ our proposed\nsystem achieves the immediate prediction of the concentration\
    \ of six air pollutants such as SO2, NO2\nand PM2.5 by combining the observations\
    \ with errors. In the comparison experiments with three\ncommon predicted algorithms\
    \ including Simple Moving Average, Exponentially Weighted Moving\nAverage and\
    \ Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, the KF algorithm can obtain the optimal\n\
    prediction results, and root-mean-square error decreases by 68.3% on average.\
    \ Taken together, the\nresults of the study indicate that our proposed system,\
    \ combining edge computing and IoT, can be\npromoted in smart agriculture.\nKeywords:\

    \ Raspberry Pi\n1. Introduction\nThe IoT (Internet of Things) is an important\
    \ part of the new generation of information technology. It\nrefers to a huge network\
    \ formed by combining various information sensing devices with the Internet [1].\n\
    In recent years, the widespread use of IoT terminal equipment has led to a spurt\
    \ of terminal data and\nconnections, requiring a more computationally eﬃcient\
    \ IoT network architecture to enable timely data\nanalysis and processing. At\
    \ the same time, IoT business is continuously derived and widely used in\nsmart\
    \ agriculture, smart home, intelligent transportation and other ﬁelds. Many special\
    \ application\nscenarios, such as security monitoring, real-time road condition\
    \ information collection, automatic\ndriving, etc., require the network to further\
    \ reduce the data transmission delay [2]. The processing and\ncomputing power\
    \ of the traditional wireless network architecture is insuﬃcient to support the\
    \ deep\ncoverage and massive connection of the intelligent IoT. Moreover, the\
    \ cloud computing platform is\nfar from the IoT terminal, which is diﬃcult to\
    \ meet the real-time data requirements of low-latency\nservices [3].\nThe proposed\
    \ edge computing [4] provides a new way to solve the development bottleneck of\n\
    IoT and is considered to be the key enabler of IoT. Edge computing refers to an\
    \ open platform that\nintegrates network, computing, storage and application core\
    \ capabilities on the edge of the network,\nwhich nears the things or data source.\
    \ It provides edge intelligence services, to meet the key needs\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 1831; doi:10.3390/app9091831\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 1831\n2 of 23\nof industry digitalization in agile connectivity, real-time\
    \ business, data optimization, application\nintelligence, security and privacy\
    \ protection, etc. Edge computing features are like human nerve\nendings, which\
    \ can self-process simple stimuli and feedback the processed features to the cloud\
    \ brain.\nSmart agriculture makes the application of IoT technology in traditional\
    \ agricultural production\nmore “intelligent” by using sensors and software to\
    \ control agricultural production through mobile\nplatforms or computer platforms.\
    \ In smart agriculture, establishing a real-time monitoring and\nprediction system\
    \ for air quality (AQ) is the most basic and most important solution [5]. The\
    \ prediction\nfor AQ is based on the analysis of the monitoring data. In other\
    \ words, the accuracy of the monitoring\ndata aﬀects the accuracy of the prediction\
    \ to a certain extent [6]. At the same time, the Environment\nAgency also has\
    \ speciﬁed speciﬁc values for AQ [7]. Once current AQ exceeds the threshold, people\n\
    should take appropriate countermeasures. However, when the prediction is inaccurate,\
    \ it will lead\nto decision errors. In order to obtain high-precision monitoring\
    \ data, many AQ monitoring schemes\ncurrently existing use high-precision sensors.\
    \ However, high-precision sensors are often accompanied\nby higher costs. A complete\
    \ system consists of multiple sets of sensors [8], so there is a trade-oﬀ\nbetween\
    \ cost and accuracy. In addition, in a traditional IoT-based AQ monitoring system,\
    \ the data\ncollected by the sensing layer needs to be uploaded, analyzed and\
    \ processed in the cloud computing\nplatform at the network layer [9]. However,\
    \ in China, most agricultural areas are in remote locations\nand harsh environments\
    \ limited by bandwidth and network connectivity [10]. The timely uploading of\n\
    monitoring data and the analysis of prediction results cannot be guaranteed, which\
    \ aﬀects the timeliness\nof decision-making. Therefore, edge computing with real-time\
    \ computing power should be considered\nto solve the bottleneck of traditional\
    \ cloud computing solutions in agricultural application scenarios.\nIn order to\
    \ improve the real-time performance and reduce the cost of the traditional monitoring\n\
    system, this paper combines edge computing and IoT application in smart agriculture.\
    \ Under a\nrelatively low hardware cost, the air quality monitoring and prediction\
    \ system based on the Kalman\nFilter (KF) algorithm can greatly improve the accuracy,\
    \ both in monitoring and predicting values.\nBy ﬂexibly arranging inexpensive\
    \ sensors throughout the monitoring area, the system monitors the\nconcentration\
    \ of six air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 in real time.\
    \ According\nto the dynamic characteristics of diﬀerent air pollutants, the KF\
    \ algorithm constructs the short-term\ndynamic prediction model via 100 iterations\
    \ of the initial sampling data with error. Therefore, the\ninstantaneous prediction\
    \ of pollutant concentrations is achieved, and the sensor accuracy is improved\n\
    from the algorithm level on the edge side. This process of correcting the monitoring\
    \ data to obtain\nthe best predictive value is a local process, which is used\
    \ as a concrete example of edge computing.\nRaspberry Pi (RPi) 3B is a low-power,\
    \ low-cost card computer with a built-in quad-core 1.2 GHz 64\nbit processor,\
    \ which has very good computing and processing power. Therefore, this paper chooses\n\
    RPi as the carrier of edge computing and the central node of the sensor network.\
    \ After collecting\nthe monitoring data from various sensors, RPi runs the KF\
    \ algorithm to obtain the best prediction\nresults of various air pollutant concentrations,\
    \ and then uploads the monitoring data and prediction\nresults to the cloud through\
    \ the Wi-Fi module. The cloud stores data and sends feedback to client\nrequests.\
    \ Through this marginalized low-cost wireless solution, farmers and agricultural\
    \ experts can\ncollect more accurate concentrations of air pollutants, and analyze\
    \ the current and subsequent AQ\nthrough the client, which provides a more real-time,\
    \ accurate and scientiﬁc basis for taking appropriate\ncontrol measures.\n2. Related\
    \ Work\nThere are a wide range of studies covering the issue of application of\
    \ edge computing on\nIoT [11–19], as well as monitoring [20–28] and prediction\
    \ [29–37] for AQ.\n2.1. Edge Computing on IoT\nThe continuous decline in sensor\
    \ prices and computing costs has changed the architecture of\ntraditional IoT\
    \ with more “things” to be connected to the Internet, resulting in pushing computing\
    \ to\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n3 of 23\nthe edge of the network [11,12]. As more\
    \ networked devices become available, edge computing [13] is\nan important change\
    \ required to make IoT systems more eﬃcient and scalable, which will be used in\n\
    all walks of life, especially in some areas where cloud computing is ineﬃcient.\
    \ Compared to cloud\ncomputing, edge computing shows the following advantages\
    \ [14]. (1) A focus on real-time, short-cycle\ndata analysis and better support\
    \ big data analysis for cloud applications. (2) Real-time or faster data\nprocessing\
    \ and analysis. Data processing is closer to data sources, rather than in an external\
    \ data center\nof the cloud, so latency can be reduced. (3) Low cost. It costs\
    \ less on data management solutions for\nlocal devices than on the cloud and data\
    \ center networks. (4) Higher application runtime eﬃciency. As\nlatency decreases,\
    \ applications can run more eﬃciently at a faster rate. (5) Impairing the role\
    \ of the\ncloud also reduces the likelihood of a single point of failure, and\
    \ reducing the reliance on the cloud\nalso means that some devices can run oﬄine\
    \ smoothly.\nFrom autopilot to smart agriculture, edge computing on IoT has been\
    \ used in many areas.\nCompanies like PointGrab and Gooee partner to provide IoT\
    \ enabled lighting solutions with the help\nof real-time edge computing [15].\
    \ Brzoza-Woch et al. present a fog-enabled embedded system for\nenvironmental\
    \ monitoring [16]. Intel partner with AVOB to develop edge-enabled remote control\
    \ and\nmonitoring for IoT based smart energy management [17]. Datta et al. propose\
    \ an IoT architecture for\nconnected vehicles and utilized fog computing as a\
    \ platform for providing IoT services to connected\nvehicles [18]. Bakheder et\
    \ al. use cloudlets for big data analytics in a mobile cloud computing\nenvironment\
    \ [19].\nThe development of smart industry requires not only the high cloud but\
    \ also the ubiquitous\nedge computing. Regardless of the eﬃciency of use of IoT\
    \ applications, time delays or security\nconsiderations, edge computing is the\
    \ key to the popularity of the IoT.\n2.2. Air Quality Monitoring System\nWith\
    \ the rise of IoT and the combination of miniaturized sensor devices and wireless\
    \ technologies,\nnowadays, many of the AQ monitoring solutions are based on the\
    \ traditional IoT architecture to\nbuild a remote monitoring system for AQ [9].\
    \ Composed of various sensor devices, the perception\nlayer identiﬁes various\
    \ air parameters and collects the data. The network layer, composed of wireless\n\
    technology, network management system and cloud computing platform, transmits\
    \ and processes\ndata information collected from the perception layer, then makes\
    \ corresponding decisions according to\ncurrent AQ conditions. The application\
    \ layer presents relevant information back to the user.\nGómez et al. [20], designed\
    \ and used an IoT-based, multi-purpose architecture for monitoring\nenvironmental\
    \ variables in urban areas. In their four-tier architecture, customer service\
    \ interface\nhandles requests from clients via the HTTP protocol, when the management\
    \ layer receives the data and\nstores it in the database. Raipure and Mehetre\
    \ [21] proposed a large city pollution monitoring system\nbased on wireless sensor\
    \ network. The system uses AVR (Atmel AVR) ATmega-32 microcontroller\nto transfer\
    \ the values from ADC (Analog to Digital Converters) to the server, and uses a\
    \ Bluetooth\nmicrocontroller to build a communication channel between gas delivery\
    \ to the server. In the agricultural\nsector, Shinde et al. [22] established an\
    \ IoT-based monitoring and control system for AQ in greenhouses.\nXiaojun et al.\
    \ [23] proposed a system which can reduce hardware costs to the previous 1/10\
    \ by replacing\nmonitoring devices that use traditional empirical analysis with\
    \ sensor networks in IoC (Inversion of\nControl) technology. Kiruthika and Umamakeswari\
    \ [24] used the Raspberry Pi to build an IoT-based\nlow-cost air quality monitoring\
    \ system. As shown in Figure 1, the RPi [25–27] just as a sensor network\nnode,\
    \ only collects monitored data and pushes data to the gateway layer. The gateway\
    \ layer ﬁlters\nand predicts data, then uploads the results to the cloud layer\
    \ through the ESP 8266 wireless module.\nThe cloud layer analyzes the received\
    \ data and responds to various requests from the client. Similarly,\nJadhav et\
    \ al. [28] also used the RPi as a bridge between the sensor network and the web\
    \ server. The\nreasons that the above solutions adopt RPi are due to its low cost\
    \ and card-like features.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n4 of 23\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\

    \ [10]. \nData analysis and processing through the cloud computing solution at\
    \ the network layer cannot meet \nthe requirements of low latency [7]. In addition,\
    \ the accuracy of the sensors selected in the existing \nstudies will be different,\
    \ which will have different degrees of influence on the accuracy of the \nmonitoring\
    \ data, thus failing to guarantee the scientific nature of the prediction results.\
    \ \n2.3. Prediction Model \nIn recent years, many studies on air quality have\
    \ focused on prediction air pollutant \nconcentrations and assessing AQ in a given\
    \ area. There are two main methods for constructing \npredictive models: traditional\
    \ statistical methods and methods based on machine learning (ML) or \nmulti-model\
    \ fusion. \nAt the statistical method level, Lanzafam et al. [29] propose a model\
    \ of AQ prediction based on \nSimple Moving Average (SMA). The model predicts\
    \ the concentration of pollutants in the next period \nor periods by the average\
    \ of a set of recent actual data. Because of its simple calculation method, it\
    \ is \nvery suitable for immediate prediction. Donnelly et al. [30] propose the\
    \ Exponentially Weighted \nMoving Average model (EWMA). The principle of the model\
    \ is the different weighting factors of the \npollutant data in different historical\
    \ periosd on the prediction process. Without considering the \nperiodicity, the\
    \ influence of the variable far from the target period is relatively low. Therefore,\
    \ the \nprediction results based on EWMA model are smoother and closer to recent\
    \ data than the SMA. The \nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [31,32]\
    \ model is widely used in AQ prediction. \nThe model filters the non-stationary\
    \ factors in the original sequence by using the data difference \nmethod, so that\
    \ the model can obtain better prediction results. \nAlthough the traditional statistical-based\
    \ prediction model has better performance in terms of \ninterpretability and computational\
    \ cost, it is limited by the single feature expression and lacks the \nability\
    \ to deal with complex prediction problems such as nonlinear processes. With the\
    \ development \nof ML, many studies have chosen to use ML methods or multi-mode\
    \ fusion [33,34] to predict AQ. In \nthe study of Rybarczyk and Zalakeviciute\
    \ [35], based on the J48 decision tree algorithm, two different \ndecision models\
    \ are constructed to predict the concentration of PM2.5 in the two adjacent regions.\
    \ In \nthe study of Raipure and Mehetre [21], the ID3 algorithm in the decision\
    \ tree is applied to calculate \nthe percentage of air pollutants. The algorithm\
    \ is used to predict specific areas and provide early \nwarning information for\
    \ highly polluted areas. Xiaojun et al. [23] propose a multi-input and multi-\n\
    output AQ prediction model based on ANN (Artificial Neural Network). Based on\
    \ the relationship \nbetween current and past 24 hours of pollutant concentration,\
    \ a 24 hour prediction network is \nFigure 1. Functional model of the proposed\
    \ system.\nAlthough the existing studies have proposed a very mature and extensive\

    \ latency [7]. In addition, the accuracy of the sensors selected in the existing\
    \ studies\nwill be diﬀerent, which will have diﬀerent degrees of inﬂuence on the\
    \ accuracy of the monitoring data,\nthus failing to guarantee the scientiﬁc nature\
    \ of the prediction results.\n2.3. Prediction Model\nIn recent years, many studies\

    \ between current and past 24 h\nof pollutant concentration, a 24 h prediction\
    \ network is established. To predict ozone concentrations,\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9,\
    \ 1831\n5 of 23\nSousa uses multiple linear regression and ANN based on principal\
    \ components [36]. Feng Xiao and Li\nQi [37] propose ANN to predict the average\
    \ daily concentration of PM2.5 two days in advance based\non AQ trajectory analysis\
    \ and wavelet transform.\n3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. The Proposed System Architecture\n\
    The hardware part of the system is mainly composed of Raspberry Pi, the sensor\
    \ network and the\nWi-Fi module. The software part is mainly the cloud data storage\
    \ and client system. Composed of\nseveral types of sensors, the sensor network\
    \ realizes real-time monitoring of the concentration of air\npollutants such as\
    \ SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and PM10. After the periodic sampling is completed,\n\
    the sensor network sends the various pollutant concentration data to the RPi.\
    \ As the carrier of edge\ncomputing, RPi runs the Kalman Filter algorithm after\
    \ receiving the data. Then, after several iterations\nand updates in a very short\
    \ time, the predicted values of various pollutant concentrations at the\nnext\
    \ moment are obtained. After completing the relevant prediction work, RPi uploads\
    \ the data\nto the cloud through the Wi-Fi module. The cloud stores the data,\
    \ communicates with the client,\nand presents the user with information, such\
    \ as the current air quality status and the trend of each\npollutant concentration.\n\
    3.2. Hardware\n3.2.1. Raspberry Pi\nRaspberry Pi 3 Model B: The Raspberry Pi (RPi)\
    \ 3B [38] is a portable and powerful SBC (Single\nBoard Computer), meaning that\
    \ it runs a full operating system and has suﬃcient peripherals (memory,\nCPU,\
    \ power regulation) to start execution without the addition of hardware. It has\
    \ been proved to be\nan immediate access due to the low price of $35. By adding\
    \ an SD storage, it is possible to quickly have\na fully working computer running\
    \ Raspbian, a Debian-based Linux operating system, which is free\nand optimized\
    \ for the RPi hardware. The RPi has a built-in quad-core 1.2 GHz 64 bit CPU, which\
    \ gives\nit very good computing and processing power. Therefore, in many of IoT\
    \ applications, RPi has been\ndeployed as an edge node, see for example [39–42].\n\
    Based on the processing power and computing characteristics of the RPi, this paper\
    \ also uses the\nRPi as the edge computing device and the central node of the\
    \ sensor network (as shown in Figure 2).\nThe RPi periodically reads parameter\
    \ data from various sensors based on the corresponding connection\npins. After\
    \ obtaining the monitoring data, the background process is awakened from the sleep\
    \ state,\nactively runs the Kalman Filter algorithm, and calls the monitoring\
    \ data to iteratively update it (see\nSection 4 for details). When the calculation\
    \ is completed, the predicted data of various air pollutant\nconcentrations at\
    \ the next moment can be obtained. At this point, the RPi will upload the prediction\n\
    results and monitoring data to the cloud through the Wi-Fi module, and the cloud\
    \ stores the data.\n3.2.2. Sensors\n(1) ZH03A Laser Dust Sensor\nThe ZH03A laser\
    \ dust sensor (Zhengzhou Winsen Electronics Technology Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou,\n\
    China), with a minimum resolution particle diameter of 1.0 micron, is a versatile,\
    \ miniaturized module\nthat uses the principle of laser light scattering to detect\
    \ dust particles present in the air. By designing\ndiﬀerent channels to distinguish\
    \ the size of the particles, the PM2.5 and PM10 concentration values can\nbe obtained\
    \ separately. Besides, ZH03A has good consistency, stability, real-time response,\
    \ and also\nprovides a rich interface with digital output, PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)\
    \ output and analog output.\nThe 24 bit data packet is sent to the RPi by UART\
    \ (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)\ntransmission, and the PM2.5 and\
    \ PM10 concentrations are obtained by reading the value of the speciﬁc\nbit. The\
    \ price of ZH03A is around $11.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n6 of 23\nestablished.\

    \ \nof several types of sensors, the sensor network realizes real-time monitoring\
    \ of the concentration of \nair pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and\
    \ PM10. After the periodic sampling is completed, \nthe sensor network sends the\
    \ various pollutant concentration data to the RPi. As the carrier of edge \ncomputing,\
    \ RPi runs the Kalman Filter algorithm after receiving the data. Then, after several\
    \ \niterations and updates in a very short time, the predicted values of various\
    \ pollutant concentrations \nat the next moment are obtained. After completing\
    \ the relevant prediction work, RPi uploads the \ndata to the cloud through the\
    \ Wi-Fi module. The cloud stores the data, communicates with the client, \nand\
    \ presents the user with information, such as the current air quality status and\
    \ the trend of each \npollutant concentration.  \n3.2. Hardware \n3.2.1. Raspberry\
    \ Pi \nRaspberry Pi 3 Model B: The Raspberry Pi (RPi) 3B [38] is a portable and\
    \ powerful SBC (Single \nBoard Computer), meaning that it runs a full operating\
    \ system and has sufficient peripherals \n(memory, CPU, power regulation) to start\
    \ execution without the addition of hardware. It has been \nproved to be an immediate\
    \ access due to the low price of $35. By adding an SD storage, it is possible\
    \ \nto quickly have a fully working computer running Raspbian, a Debian-based\
    \ Linux operating system, \nwhich is free and optimized for the RPi hardware.\
    \ The RPi has a built-in quad-core 1.2 GHz 64 bit \nCPU, which gives it very good\
    \ computing and processing power. Therefore, in many of IoT \napplications, RPi\
    \ has been deployed as an edge node, see for example [39–42].  \nBased on the\
    \ processing power and computing characteristics of the RPi, this paper also uses\
    \ the \nRPi as the edge computing device and the central node of the sensor network\
    \ (as shown in Figure 2). \nThe RPi periodically reads parameter data from various\
    \ sensors based on the corresponding \nconnection pins. After obtaining the monitoring\
    \ data, the background process is awakened from the \nsleep state, actively runs\
    \ the Kalman Filter algorithm, and calls the monitoring data to iteratively \n\
    update it (see Section 4 for details). When the calculation is completed, the\
    \ predicted data of various \nFigure 2. The architecture of air quality monitoring\
    \ and prediction system.\n(2) SGA-700 Intelligent Gas Sensor\nThe SGA-700 series\
    \ of intelligent gas sensor (Shenzhen Singoan Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.,\n\
    Shenzhen, China) modules carry out signal ampliﬁcation, data processing, temperature\
    \ and humidity\ncompensation, and it has the beneﬁts of a smaller size, lower\
    \ price and more stable performance.\nSGA-700 can directly output voltage signals\
    \ such as 0.4–2 V, 0–1.6 V, 0–4 V, 0–5 V, and serial port signals\nare reserved.\
    \ The standard signal after processing can be directly collected and uploaded\
    \ to the control\nhost RPi. The price of the SGA-700 series gas sensor is less\
    \ than $3. SGA-700-CO, SGA-700-NO2,\nSGA-700-SO2 and SGA-700-O3 are used to measure\
    \ CO, NO2, SO2 and O3 concentrations, respectively.\n(3) ESP8266 Wireless Sensor\n\
    The ESP8266 (ESPRESSIF SYSTEMS (SHANGHAI) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) is a low-power,\n\
    low-cost, highly integrated Wi-Fi microchip with a full TCP/IP stack, which adds\
    \ Wi-Fi capabilities to\nthe RPi via a UART serial connection. When the RPi is\
    \ networking, it can send the predicted results of\neach pollutant and the data\
    \ monitored by the sensor to the cloud.\nAt present, the price of the existing\
    \ AQ monitoring system ranges from $750 to $3000, while the\ntotal cost of our\
    \ proposed solution is only around $75, which has been reduced by nearly one-tenth,\n\
    and each module is easily accessible.\n3.3. Kalman Filter Algorithm\nThe traditional\
    \ statistical method-based prediction model [43] has the advantage of high\ninterpretability\
    \ and low computational cost. Its prediction principle is based on linearly ﬁtting\n\
    historical data. Therefore, the predicted result can have higher precision when\
    \ the trend of change\nis not severe. However, it is no longer applicable when\
    \ the concentration of various air pollutants\nis not a stable sequence. For example,\
    \ the concentration of pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10, and\nSO, will suddenly\
    \ increase due to the increase in vehicle exhaust emissions when traﬃc is at a\
    \ peak\nin the morning and evening [44]. Therefore, models such as SMA, EWMA,\
    \ and ARIMA [29–32]\ncannot eﬀectively predict these change points, but these\
    \ data have higher predictive value (directly\ncorresponding to measures).\nIn\
    \ the application scenario of AQ prediction based on IoT devices, the prediction\
    \ model is\nlimited by the storage capacity and computing power of the device\
    \ itself. In order to achieve higher\nprediction accuracy, many ML models not\
    \ only require a large amount of historical data for training\n(storage problem),\
    \ but also have a high time complexity throughout the training process (calculation\n\
    problem) [45]. For example, the decision tree model [21,35] can improve the prediction\
    \ accuracy via\nthe increase in the number of training samples and the depth of\
    \ the tree, however, the time complexity\nO(N × M × D) is also multiplied (N is\
    \ the number of samples, M is the vector dimension, and D is the\ntree depth).\
    \ The ANN [23,36,37] also has the similar problem. Therefore, although the ML\
    \ model\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n7 of 23\nhas higher prediction accuracy, it\
    \ cannot meet the requirements of the edge computing node for the\nlightweight\
    \ model.\nIn order to solve the shortcomings of the above models, and in the case\
    \ of ensuring the prediction\naccuracy, the space complexity (storage) and time\
    \ complexity (calculation) of the model are simpliﬁed\nas much as possible, making\
    \ it adaptable to the application scenario of edge computing. This paper\nproposes\
    \ an AQ prediction model based on the Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm.\nThe KF is\
    \ an eﬃcient autoregressive ﬁlter model (recursive ﬁlter model) [46]. It occupies\
    \ very\nlittle memory and only needs to retain data for one state on the system,\
    \ rather than a long span of\nhistorical data. The actual measured data are used\
    \ to correct the prediction results, which can reﬂect\nthe objective results in\
    \ the most realistic way. The operation speed of the KF is very fast, so it is\
    \ very\nsuitable for solving real-time problems and applying to the edge computing\
    \ of IoT.\nThe core idea of the KF is to use a set of state-space expression equations\
    \ to represent a dynamic\nsystem, and to predict the system state ˆxk|k−1 (called\
    \ prior estimate) at the next moment k according to\nthe optimal estimate (prediction)\
    \ ˆxk−1 of the system state at time k − 1. At the same time, the system\nstate\
    \ at time k is observed, and the observed value zk is obtained. Due to the observation\
    \ error, zk and\nˆxk|k−1 deviate from the truly accurate system state, so the\
    \ predicted value ˆxk|k−1 needs to be corrected by\nthe observed value zk. Then\
    \ the optimal estimate (prediction) ˆxk of the system state at time k is obtained.\n\
    The KF algorithm is diﬀerent from the general timing prediction method [47]. Firstly,\
    \ there is\nno need to assume that the error term satisﬁes the normal distribution.\
    \ Secondly, it can estimate the\nsystem state based on a set of incomplete observations\
    \ (some time points missing in time series data)\nor that contain noise (measurement\
    \ error). Furthermore, compared with the model based on single\nobservations,\
    \ the KF considers the joint distribution of observations according to time series\
    \ data at\ndiﬀerent times and estimates the unknown factors that may aﬀect the\
    \ system. Therefore, the prediction\nof the KF will be more accurate.\nIn summary,\
    \ the KF algorithm has the following characteristics:\n1.\nThe object of the KF\
    \ algorithm research is a stochastic process, with sequential data.\n2.\nThe goal\
    \ of ﬁltering is to predict all random processes even with useless noise.\n3.\n\
    Diﬀering from the least squares method, the white noise existing in the dynamic\
    \ system or the\nobservation error existing in the observation data does not need\
    \ to be ﬁltered. The statistical\ncharacteristics of this noise information will\
    \ be used by the model in the prediction process.\n4.\nThe KF algorithm uses a\
    \ recursive algorithm, and spatial state representation equations are\nused to\
    \ construct time-domain ﬁlters for prediction of multidimensional random variables\
    \ (the\npredicted system state consists of multiple features).\n5.\nCompared to\
    \ the ARIMA model, the time series data used for prediction can be smooth or not.\n\
    6.\nThe prediction process only considers the process noise, the noise generated\
    \ by the observation\nmethod and the statistical characteristics of the system\
    \ at the current time point. Besides, the\nmodel calculation is small, which is\
    \ very suitable for real-time prediction.\nBased on the characteristics of the\
    \ Kalman Filter algorithm, this paper constructs the KF algorithm\non the edge\
    \ device (Raspberry Pi) to predict the concentration of various air pollutants\
    \ in real time.\nAlthough there are certain measurement errors in low-cost sensors\
    \ and processing noises in the\nmodel, the KF can improve the accuracy of sensors\
    \ from the algorithm level by combining the errored\nobservation data. Moreover,\
    \ the predicted value of the next moment can be obtained from the data of\nthe\
    \ previous moment, so that the system has predictability for various pollutants\
    \ and improves the\ndecision-making eﬃciency. As shown in Figure 3, the KF is\
    \ used in the edge computing environment\nof this paper.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9,\

    4.2. Kalman Filter Algorithm Implementation\nThe Kalman Filter algorithm is an\
    \ autoregressive ﬁltering model. Therefore, the optimal estimate\nof the system\
    \ state at the current time, can be obtained by the optimal estimate of the system\
    \ state at\nthe previous moment and the observation of the system state at the\
    \ current time.\nFirstly, the state of the KF is represented by the following\
    \ two variables:\n•\nˆxk|k represents an estimate of the system state at time\
    \ k;\n•\nPk|k represents the covariance matrix of the state estimation error at\
    \ time k, which measures the\naccuracy of the estimation.\nThe KF estimates a\
    \ process by using a form of feedback control: the ﬁlter estimates the process\n\
    state at some time and then obtains feedback in the form of (noisy) measurements.\

    \ is not the optimal estimate at time k, it is necessary to correct\nˆxk|k−1 in\
    \ combination with the observation of the sensors.\n4.2.2. Correction\nIn the\

    \ model proposed in this paper, it is assumed\nthat all kinds of pollutants do\
    \ not change state every hour and there are no control variables, so in\nEquation\
    \ (5), Fk can be set as an identity matrix and the value of Bkuk is zero. In Equation\
    \ (6), Rk is the\ncovariance matrix of the measurement error of sensors, and zk\
    \ is an observation matrix consisting of\nobservations of various pollutant concentrations\
    \ by 100 samples in ﬁrst 10 min/h (100 samples are\nrequired because, after several\
    \ experiments, the algorithm can achieve optimal convergence and steady\nstate\
    \ after 100 iterations).\nIn Equation (6), the process noise error Qk is usually\
    \ diﬃcult to predict as we typically do not\nhave the ability to directly observe\
    \ the process we are estimating. Statistically speaking, excellent\nﬁlter performance\
    \ can be obtained by tuning the ﬁlter parameter Qk. The tuning is usually performed\n\
    oﬀ-line, frequently with the help of another (distinct) Kalman Filter in a process\
    \ generally referred to\nas system identiﬁcation. Then, under the condition that\
    \ Qk is actually constant, both the estimation\nerror covariance Pk|k and the\
    \ Kalman gain Kk will stabilize quickly and then remain constant [49]. In\nthis\
    \ paper, assuming that Qk is a constant value Q, then we can determine the value\
    \ of Q for each\npollutant. The smaller the Q value, the higher the trust in the\
    \ prediction model. If Q is 0, it means that\nonly the prediction model is trusted.\
    \ And as Q decreases, the system will converge more easily, but\nwhen Q is reduced\
    \ to a certain extent, continuing to decrease may cause the system to start diverging.\n\
    Conversely, a larger Q value indicates a lower degree of trust in the predictive\
    \ model, and accordingly,\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n11 of 23\nthe degree of trust\
    \ in the measured value is increased. If Q tends to inﬁnity, it means that only\
    \ the\nmeasured value is trusted.\nThis paper uses the grid search method to tune\
    \ the Q, the speciﬁc process is as follows.\n(1)\nSelect data.\nThe Panyu Middle\

    5.1. Accuracy Improvement Analysis\nOne of the diﬀerences between the Kalman Filter\
    \ algorithm and other time series prediction\nmodels is that the statistical information\
    \ of process noise and observation error can be eﬀectively\nutilized in the prediction\
    \ process, which can correct the a priori estimation of the model. Therefore,\n\
    from the predictive perspective, the KF uses observation data obtained by the\
    \ sensor network to\nimprove prediction accuracy. From the monitoring perspective,\
    \ even with low-cost and low-precision\nmonitor sensors, the KF can correct the\
    \ error of the measurement data from the algorithm level, which\nimproves the\
    \ accuracy of sensors on the side.\nIn order to verify that the KF algorithm can\
    \ eﬀectively improve the accuracy of sensor observations,\nthis paper designs\
    \ a comparing experiment to obtain the error size. The experiment compares the\n\
    predicted value of the KF and the observed value of the sensor with the data of\
    \ the oﬃcial monitoring\nsite, respectively. The main indicators for measuring\
    \ errors includes MSE (mean-square error), RMSE\nand MAE (mean-absolute error).\
    \ The experimental results are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1. Error comparison between\

    \ Ability Analysis\nAlthough Section 5.1 proves that the KF algorithm can improve\
    \ the accuracy of the sensors, it\ndoes not explain the advantages of the KF in\
    \ predicting performance. Since most ML-based prediction\nmodels are limited by\
    \ the storage power (requiring a large amount of historical data for training\n\
    to obtain better prediction results) and computing power (model training and prediction\
    \ processes\nare computationally intensive tasks, requiring high computational\
    \ components like CPU) of edge\ncomputing nodes, they are not suitable for use\
    \ in IoT scenarios [45]. Therefore, this paper designs the\ncomparison experiment\
    \ between KF algorithm and three other commonly used time series prediction\n\
    algorithms that are based on statistical methods, including SMA (Simple Moving\
    \ Average), EWMA\n(Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) and ARIMA (Autoregressive\
    \ Integrated Moving Average).\nSMA, EWMA, and ARIMA need to use historical data\
    \ for training. In order to have a comparative\njudgment criterion, this paper\
    \ selects the data of various air pollutant concentrations per hour from 15\n\
    to 16 February of 2019, in PMS, which is used as the training set for model and\
    \ as the comparison data\nfor the algorithm prediction results.\n(1)\nKalman Filter\
    \ Prediction.\nFirst of all, determine the hyperparameters of the KF algorithm\
    \ as described in Section 4.2.3. Then,\nin the actual prediction process, the\
    \ observation data used by the KF in the correction state is the hourly\nmonitoring\
    \ data of the air pollutant concentration in PMS (from 0:00 to 23:00 on 16 February\
    \ 2019). The\nspeciﬁc process of each prediction is as follows: (1) during each\
    \ prediction period, the sensors of the\nsystem sample 100 times of the concentration\
    \ of each air pollutant in the ﬁrst ten minutes; (2) the KF\nalgorithm is iteratively\
    \ updated based on the sampling data; (3) the results of the iterative convergence\n\
    are used as the predicted values of each pollutant concentration in this period.\n\
    (2)\nSMA Prediction\nSMA is a method for predicting the average value for a certain\
    \ period in the future. The method\ncalculates the arithmetic mean of several\
    \ historical data in the past and uses the arithmetic mean as the\npredicted value\
    \ for the later period [51]. SMA can be expressed as:\nFt = (At−1 + At−2 + At−3\
    \ + . . . + At−n)/n\n(11)\nwhere Ft is the predicted value for the next period,\
    \ and n is the number of periods of the moving average,\ngenerally between 3 and\
    \ 200. At−1 is the actual value of the previous period, and At−2, At−3, At−n are\n\
    the actual values of the ﬁrst two periods, the ﬁrst three periods and the ﬁrst\
    \ n periods, respectively.\nThe number of n is determined by the experimental\
    \ results of multiple cross-validation [52] on\nthe training set before the SMA\
    \ prediction. It is found that the prediction eﬀect is best when n = 3.\nTherefore,\
    \ in the actual prediction process, the model input data of the ﬁrst period (predicted\
    \ value at\n0:00 on the 16 February 2019) is the three-hour data from the monitoring\
    \ site, which is from 21:00 to\n23:00 on 15 February 2019. The model input data\
    \ of the second period (predicted value at 1:00 on the\n16 February 2019) is the\
    \ data from 22:00 to 23:00 on 15 February 2019 and 0:00 on 16 February 2019. By\n\
    analogy, the predicted values of 24 h on the 16 February 2019 are obtained.\n\
    (3)\nEWMA Prediction\nEWMA is an improvement to SMA and is a common sequence processing\
    \ method [53]. This\napplies a non-uniform weighting to time series data so that\
    \ a lot of data can be used, but recent data\nis weighted more heavily. As the\
    \ name suggests, weights are based upon the exponential function.\nFormulated\
    \ as follows:\nEWMAt = λYt + (1 − λ)EWMAt−1(t = 1, 2, . . . , n)\n(12)\nwhere\
    \ EWMAt is the estimated value at time t, Yt is the observation at time t, n is\
    \ the number of\nobservations to be monitored including EWMA0, and 0 < λ ≤ 1 is\
    \ a constant that determines the depth\nof memory of the EWMA. The parameter λ\
    \ determines the rate at which “older” data enter into the\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9,\
    \ 1831\n17 of 23\ncalculation of the EWMA statistic. A large value of λ (closer\
    \ to 1) gives more weight to recent data and\nless weight to older data, while\
    \ a small value of λ (closer to 0) gives more weight to older data. In this\n\
    paper, the value of λ is 0.4, and the model input of each period is the same as\
    \ the SMA.\n(4)\nARIMA Prediction.\nThe ARIMA model, also known as the diﬀerential\
    \ autoregressive moving average model,\ntransforms nonstationary time series into\
    \ stationary time series, learning from historical data to\npatterns that change\
    \ over time [54]. After learning, this rule is used to predict the future. The\
    \ ARIMA\nmodel can be written as ARIMA(p, d, q) and is an extension of the ARMA(p,\
    \ q) model. In ARIMA(p, d, q),\nparameters p, d and q are non-negative integers,\
    \ p is the order (number of time lags) of the autoregressive\nmodel, d is the\
    \ degree of diﬀerencing when the time series becomes stationary, and q is the\
    \ order of the\nmoving-average model. ARIMA(p, d, q) can be expressed as:\n\n\
    1 −\np\nX\ni=1\n∅iLi\n\n(1 − L)dXt =\n\n1 −\nq\nX\ni=1\nθiLi\n\
    \nεt\n(13)\nwhere L is a lag operator. Since the parameters of each diﬀerence\
    \ in the model need to be determined\nbefore the ARIMA prediction, this paper\
    \ selects the 70 h data of the monitoring site before 0:00 on 16\nFebruary 2019\
    \ as the training set for the ARIMA model. The speciﬁc training process is: (1)\
    \ determine\nthe minimum diﬀerence order d that transforms the original data into\
    \ a stationary sequence S; (2)\ncalculate the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation\
    \ coeﬃcients of sequence S, to determine the\nvalues of p and q; (3) estimate\
    \ the parameters of each diﬀerence after completing the ARIMA model.\n(5)\nComparison.\n\
    In order to compare the prediction accuracy of KF, SMA, EWMA, and ARIMA more intuitively,\
    \ the\nveriﬁcation data set selected is the concentration of various air pollutants\
    \ collected by the monitoring\nsite on 16 February 2019, in PMS. Three evaluation\
    \ indicators, MSE, RMSE, and MAE are also chosen\nto measure the performance of\
    \ each model. As shown in the following table:\nAs illustrated in Table 3, the\
    \ MSE, RMSE, and MAE of the KF in predicting the concentration of\neach pollutant\
    \ are the lowest, compared with the other three algorithms. In detail, the average\
    \ RMSE\nis reduced by 68.3%. That is to say, the KF algorithm shows the smallest\
    \ prediction error as a whole,\nand its prediction performance is the best.\n\

    This section presents the predictive trend of four algorithms KF, SMA, EWMA and\
    \ ARIMA via\ncomparing the predicted values with the published values by the oﬃcial\
    \ monitoring site. As shown in\nFigure 11, the predicted values of four algorithms\
    \ and real values at diﬀerent moments reveal whether\nthe four algorithms can\
    \ accurately reﬂect the characteristics of the data. It is a 24 h prediction trend\
    \ for\nthe concentration of six pollutants SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 on\
    \ 16 February 2019, in PMS.\nThe black solid line represents the data collected\
    \ in PMS, as a benchmark for comparison. The dashed\nline in four diﬀerent colors\
    \ is the predicted value according to four diﬀerent algorithms, including\nSMA,\

    \ PM2.5; (f) PM10.\nAs illustrated in Figure 11, compared with the data of the\
    \ oﬃcial monitoring site, the prediction\nresults of the KF for six kinds of air\
    \ pollutant concentrations are the closest to the real data. The KF\nshows the\
    \ best prediction eﬀect reﬂecting the characteristics of real data at diﬀerent\
    \ times.\nIn detail, the blue dotted line reﬂects the trend of SMA algorithm for\
    \ various pollutants. On the\nwhole, SMA is only eﬀective when dealing with horizontal\
    \ historical data, such as the time from 2:00\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n19 of\
    \ 23\nto 5:00 in Figure 11c and the time from 2:00 to 23:00 in Figure 11e,f. However,\
    \ data with trend or step\ncharacteristics, such as Figure 11b,d, the moving average\
    \ does not always reﬂect its trend well, showing\nobvious hysteresis. Since it\
    \ is an average value, the predicted value always stays at the past level, and\n\
    it cannot be expected to cause higher or lower ﬂuctuations in the future. However,\
    \ ﬂuctuations in the\nconcentration of various air pollutants are not always horizontal,\
    \ so the results of SMA predictions\nwill produce very large deviations.\nThe\
    \ orange dotted line reﬂects the predicted trend of the EWMA algorithm among various\n\
    pollutants. As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the EWMA algorithm is very eﬀective\
    \ for the processing of\nhorizontal historical data. Although the prediction of\
    \ trend or step data has been greatly improved\ncompared with SMA, there is still\
    \ signiﬁcant hysteresis. The results of each pollutant concentration\nprediction\
    \ are still far from the data released by the oﬃcial monitoring site.\nThe green\
    \ dotted line reﬂects the predicted trend of the ARIMA algorithm for various pollutants.\n\
    Overall, compared with SMA and EWMA, the ARIMA can better reﬂect the trend of\
    \ data, whether for\nhorizontal or step data. However, ARIMA requires that the\
    \ time series data be stable or to be stable\nafter being diﬀerentiated, so in\
    \ a short period of time, ARIMA can get a good prediction eﬀect. When\nthe data\
    \ suddenly ﬂuctuates, as illustrated in Figure 11a, the concentration of SO2 suddenly\
    \ rises at\n6:00 and 8:00, ARIMA still shows obvious hysteresis, resulting in\
    \ large errors in the prediction results.\nThe red dotted line reﬂects the prediction\
    \ trend of the KF for various pollutants. It can be seen from\nthe ﬁgures that\
    \ even though the system uses inexpensive sensors with low precision, the correction\
    \ of\nthe KF algorithm can make the prediction results of various pollutant concentrations\
    \ very close to the\ndata of the oﬃcial monitoring site. The KF can well reﬂect\
    \ the trend of the data both in step-type data\n(Figure 11b) and horizontal data\
    \ (Figure 11e), showing no obvious hysteresis or very large volatility.\nBased\
    \ on the above analysis and comparison results, the KF is very suitable for the\
    \ air quality\nmonitoring and prediction system proposed in this paper. After\
    \ the hyperparameter is determined, the\nKF does not need to train the historical\
    \ data. Therefore, the calculation amount of the model is so small\nduring each\
    \ iteration and update process that it can be completed quickly on the RPi. By\
    \ correcting the\nmodel by the real-time monitoring data of the sensors, the trend\
    \ of various pollutant concentrations\ncan be accurately reﬂected, and the problem\
    \ of low sensor accuracy is solved from the algorithm level.\n5.4. Client Interface\
    \ Design\nAfter the KF algorithm completes the prediction of the concentration\
    \ of the pollutants at the next\nmoment, RPi will send the prediction results\
    \ and monitoring data to the cloud, which stores the data\nin the database and\
    \ feedbacks results to the client. Users can view the current air quality and\
    \ the latest\n24-h AQI (air quality index) trend through the browser’s access,\
    \ as shown in Figure 12.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n22 of 25 \n\

    \ edge computing and IoT in smart agriculture, this paper establishes a\nlow-cost\
    \ air quality monitoring and prediction system via Raspberry Pi, which is an edge\
    \ device to run\nthe Kalman Filter algorithm. Compared to the traditional air\
    \ quality monitoring and prediction system\nthat processes in the cloud, this\
    \ paper puts the machine learning algorithm on the edge, which can\navoid the\
    \ problem of data transmission delay due to bandwidth and network connection limitations\n\
    in the agricultural environment, and improves the real-time decision-making. By\
    \ running the KF\nalgorithm on the RPi, which has strong computing power and is\
    \ used as the edge device, the immediate\npredictions of six type of air pollutants\
    \ such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 are realized.\nCompared with the other\
    \ three algorithms SMA, EWMA and ARIMA, it can be seen that even with\nlow-accuracy\
    \ sensors, the error of the prediction results based on the KF is the smallest.\
    \ RMSE is\nalso reduced by an average of 68.3%. In addition, compared with the\
    \ observation data of sensors, the\naccuracy of the predicted value by the KF\
    \ algorithm is improved by 27%, which improves the accuracy\nof sensors from the\
    \ aspect of the algorithm. Compared to other air quality monitoring equipment,\
    \ the\ncost of our proposed solution is reduced by at least 10% with the same\
    \ observation accuracy. In other\nwords, our proposal avoids the trade-oﬀ between\
    \ cost and accuracy in traditional solutions.\nIn the process of applying the\
    \ Kalman Filter algorithm to predict the concentration of various air\npollutants,\
    \ this paper ignores the inﬂuence of the external environment on concentration\
    \ of pollutants.\nSuch factors as factory emissions, wind speed, and other factors\
    \ will have a direct impact on the\ncurrent concentration of pollutants. In future\
    \ work, if we can get this data, we can further improve\nthe accuracy of the model.\
    \ For the proposed system, the edge computing layer based on the sensor\nnetwork\
    \ and the Raspberry Pi was designed to be too centralized [55]. When the RPi that\
    \ is in the\ncenter breaks down, the problem of disaster recovery backup will\
    \ emerge, resulting in long-term\nparalysis of regional functions (requiring human\
    \ intervention to troubleshoot) and data loss. At the\nsame time, the monitoring\
    \ and early warning mechanism of the edge computing layer itself is not\nperfect.\
    \ In summary, it is necessary to consider the above two problems on the algorithm\
    \ and the\nsystem when applying the system to the actual production environment\
    \ in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization—X.L. Writing—original\

    Abstract: This paper describes the development trends and prospects of green-energy-based\
    \ off-road\nelectric vehicles and robots in the agricultural sector. Today, the\
    \ agriculture sector faces several\nchallenges, such as population growth, increasing\
    \ energy demands, labor shortages, and global\nwarming. Increases in energy demand\
    \ cause many challenges worldwide; therefore, many methods\nare suggested to achieve\
    \ energy independence from fossil fuels and reduce emissions. From a long-\nterm\
    \ point of view, the electriﬁcation of agricultural vehicles and renewable energy\
    \ sources appear to\nbe an essential step for robotic and smart farming in Agriculture\
    \ 5.0. The trend of technological growth\nusing fully autonomous robots in the\
    \ agricultural sector seems to be one of the emerging technologies\nto tackle\
    \ the increased demand for food and address environmental issues. The development\
    \ of\nelectric vehicles, alternative green fuels, and more energy-efﬁcient technologies\
    \ such as hybrid\nelectric, robotic, and autonomous vehicles is increasing and\
    \ improving work quality and operator\ncomfort. Furthermore, related digital technologies\
    \ such as advanced network communication,\nartiﬁcial intelligence techniques,\
    \ and blockchain are discussed to understand the challenges and\nopportunities\
    \ in industry and research.\nKeywords: agricultural autonomous vehicles; digital\
    \ agriculture; electric tractors; sustainability;\nhybrid electric powertrain;\
    \ smart farming; robotics\n1. Introduction\nToday, the agricultural industry faces\
    \ serious challenges such as population growth,\nthe energy crisis, climate change,\
    \ a shortage of labor, and the risk of pandemic diseases.\nThe population is projected\
    \ to increase from 7.9 billion in 2022 to 10 billion in 2050, and agri-\ncultural\
    \ production is expected to continue to rise [1]. Meanwhile, agricultural workers\
    \ are\nbeing drawn to other industries, and the average age of farmers is increasing\
    \ [2], which\nincreases the farm workers’ demand. Agricultural scientists, farmers,\
    \ and breeders are\nalso required to produce more food from less land in a sustainable\
    \ manner to meet the\nneeds of the projected population. Coupled with the reduction\
    \ of rural labor, this demon-\nstrates the inevitable need to increase efﬁciency\
    \ by introducing more automation systems\non farms [3]. In fact, due to limited\
    \ land, water, and labor resources, it is estimated that\nagricultural productivity\
    \ needs to be improved by at least 25% to meet the global food de-\nmand [4].\
    \ As some authorities claim, robots could help farmers to address these challenges\n\
    by improving yields and productivity while reducing fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ and water\nwaste. Additionally to the rural drawbacks, greenhouse gas (GHG)\
    \ emissions are doubled,\nand climate change reduces productivity in agriculture\
    \ and available farm ﬁelds. It means\nthat around 25% of all farmland is already\
    \ degraded [5]. Furthermore, the energy demand\nin different sectors is increasing\
    \ [6,7].\nMany countries are working to extract energy from alternative fuels\
    \ obtained from\nrenewable energy sources (RES) [8] instead of fossil fuels for\
    \ economic and environmental\nVehicles 2022, 4, 843–864. https://doi.org/10.3390/vehicles4030047\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/vehicles\nVehicles 2022, 4\n844\nreasons. The International\
    \ Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA) have\
    \ developed a consistent baseline scenario to limit the global\naverage temperature\
    \ rise to 2 °C by 2100, which is the goal of the Paris Agreement.\nAs shown in\
    \ [9], biofuels, hydrogen, and electricity could play an increasingly im-\nportant\
    \ role in decarbonizing the transport sector before 2050, as vehicles will consume\n\
    more biofuels and electricity than gasoline in 2050 [10]. Researchers and manufacturers\n\
    have introduced new technologies, such as battery electric vehicles, hybrid electric\
    \ vehicles,\nand hydrogen-powered vehicles.\nAgricultural engineering researchers\
    \ focus primarily on increasing crop production ef-\nﬁciency and decreasing the\
    \ difﬁculty of agricultural work, and different levels of technology\nhave been\
    \ deﬁned in the last few decades. The future concept of agriculture contemplates\n\
    more intelligent farms that are more efﬁcient and environmentally more sustainable,\
    \ with\nsensors, machines, robots, and information technology (IT). Robotics and\
    \ autonomous\nvehicles can play an essential role in meeting agricultural production\
    \ needs in the near\nfuture [11]. Additionally, agricultural ﬁeld robots could\
    \ help to increase operational safety,\nimprove soil health, and increase yields\
    \ [12]. Replacing heavy equipment with lighter\nremote or autonomous machinery\
    \ can reduce the problems associated with topsoil com-\npression in agriculture\
    \ [13]. Robots and electric tractors have many advantages, including\ndeveloping\
    \ precision agriculture, improving working conditions, limiting environmental\n\
    impacts, and increasing crop proﬁtability [14]. The development of electriﬁed\
    \ off-road\nvehicles, such as agricultural electric vehicles, is still in the\
    \ initial stages, but it attracts\ninterest among researchers and industry. Although\
    \ progress has been made in wheel\nloaders and other industrial vehicles [15],\
    \ tractors and agricultural mobile robots have\nnot received enough attention.\
    \ Machinery electriﬁcation has several advantages, such as\neasier control in\
    \ sensor integration, active navigation, and task applications, compared to\n\
    traditional types. Moreover, renewable energy contributes to the supply of energy\
    \ needed\nwith lower emissions to take the electric vehicle one step further.\n\
    This paper outlines some of the latest achievements in agricultural electric vehicles\n\
    and robots driven by renewable energy resources in the line of autonomous hybrid\
    \ electric\noff-road vehicles. The primary purpose is to discuss the challenges\
    \ of agricultural electric\nvehicles and robots in incorporating alternative renewable\
    \ energy sources and highlight\nrelated opportunities for future agriculture.\
    \ Furthermore, emerging digital technologies are\ninvestigated to understand their\
    \ applicability in hybrid electric autonomous vehicles for\nagricultural applications.\
    \ The innovation of this work could be a survey on the challenges\nand opportunities\
    \ ahead in the possibility of integrating new technologies, such as robotics,\n\
    artiﬁcial intelligence, blockchain, and renewable energy sources, including hydrogen,\
    \ for\nfuture agricultural electric vehicles.\nThe structure of this article is\
    \ as follows. A brief historical review and a general\ndescription of the concept\
    \ of Agriculture 5.0 can be found in Section 2. A literature review on\nresearch\
    \ and development in the agricultural sector, which includes robotics, autonomous\n\
    electric vehicles, hybrid electric powertrain, on-site energy production, and\
    \ available\nsources of renewable energies, is presented in Section 3. Recent\
    \ enabling and future\ndigital technologies are described in Section 4. Section\
    \ 5 discusses research challenges and\npotential opportunities in the context\
    \ of Agriculture 5.0. Finally, a summary of ﬁndings is\ngiven in Section 6.\n\
    2. From Traditional Agricultural Practices to Smart Farming and Agriculture 5.0\n\
    Population growth forces farmers to change their farm management methods to\n\
    meet the growing demand for high-quality foods. Figure 1 shows the roadmap for\
    \ the\nagricultural revolution. The traditional agricultural practice from ancient\
    \ times to the late\n19th century, when farmers relied heavily on indigenous tools\
    \ for cultivation, is called\nAgriculture 1.0 [16]. Such peasant farming required\
    \ much manual labor, but productivity\nwas very low. Taking advantage of the ﬁrst\
    \ Industrial Revolution around 1784–1870,\nagricultural production increased in\
    \ the early 20th century, when farmers used many\nVehicles 2022, 4\n845\ntypes\
    \ of machinery to increase food production and reduce manual labor forces, called\n\

    \ 1. Development roadmap for the agricultural revolution from Agriculture 1.0\
    \ to Agriculture\n5.0 [17].\nFurther development of embedded systems, software\
    \ development, and communica-\ntion technology have further improved the automation\
    \ capabilities of production plants.\nThese above developments led to the next\
    \ agricultural revolution, known as Agriculture\n3.0. Green renewable energies\
    \ such as solar power and wind power were also considered\nin the production process.\
    \ Additionally, information technology through yield monitor-\ning, variable rate\
    \ applications, and farm guidance systems also help to explore precision\nagriculture\
    \ [18]. It is expanding due to the availability of large amounts of data due to\n\
    the growing agricultural knowledge system. This new philosophy focused on agricultural\n\
    data is expressed in several terms: Agriculture 4.0 and Digital Farming [19].\
    \ As a result,\nprecision agriculture principles have been introduced, where producers\
    \ use systems that\ngenerate data on their farms that are processed to make appropriate\
    \ strategic and oper-\national decisions. Encouragingly, the application of Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies to tackle\nthe COVID-19 pandemic is presented in [20]. However,\
    \ it seems that the current level of\ntechnology in agriculture could not respond\
    \ to the food demands, increasing trends, and\nexisting challenges around the\
    \ world. For instance, food prices have risen during the pan-\ndemic situation.\
    \ Therefore, it is necessary to use new and innovative sustainable methods to\n\
    enhance farming efﬁciency and productivity while considering other environmental\
    \ issues.\nThe intended progress in agricultural robotics aims to overcome the\
    \ challenges posed\nby population growth, the acceleration of urbanization, the\
    \ high competitiveness of high-\nquality products, the shortage of resources and\
    \ skilled workers, and environmental protec-\ntion. In short, the four preceding\
    \ industrial revolutions have gradually changed the shape\nof agricultural activities.\
    \ Traditional labor-intensive agriculture needs to be replaced by\nautonomous\
    \ robotic farming, which works in an environmentally friendly procedure in\nsustainable\
    \ ways. Therefore, the agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation driven\n\
    by new technologies that appear to be highly promising to enable this primary\
    \ sector to\nreach the next level of farm productivity and proﬁtability. Additionally,\
    \ young people in\nwealthy countries such as the US and Canada are looking for\
    \ employment opportunities in\nurban areas because agricultural jobs are considered\
    \ “hardworking” and unproﬁtable [21].\nAs a result, farmers are looking for new\
    \ ways to automate their operations. One solution to\nthis labor shortage is the\
    \ use of agricultural robots with integrated artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) capabilities.\n\
    As mentioned above, precision agriculture consisting of the necessary components\n\
    further improves the management efﬁciency of agricultural companies by adding\
    \ a digital\nsystem that enhances the knowledge of producers. Based on the literature,\
    \ there is a\ndistinction between precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0. Precision\
    \ agriculture is often\nassociated with ﬁeld variability and speciﬁc analytical\
    \ and technological issues, such as\nVehicles 2022, 4\n846\napplying agricultural\
    \ inputs in areas with the highest production potential. On the other\nhand, Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 goes beyond ﬁeld variability analysis to manage farms based on\nin-depth\
    \ knowledge of speciﬁc contexts and situations, aimed to create a value chain\
    \ that\nfully integrates and engages technologies and agricultural processes [22].\n\
    Moreover, if this process contains a robot structure with AI algorithms on the\
    \ system,\nthe overall concept is called Agriculture 5.0 [23]. This concept means\
    \ that the farm follows\nprecision agriculture principles and uses equipment that\
    \ includes unmanned operations\nand autonomous decision support systems.\n3. Research\
    \ and Development in the Agricultural Sector\nThe move to Agriculture 5.0 will\
    \ be on the agenda of most major farm tool and\nautonomous equipment manufacturers\
    \ for the next decade. The agricultural robot is taking\nfarming practices to\
    \ a new phase by turning them into brighter, energy-independent, and\nenergy-efﬁcient\
    \ tools and adapting their performance for complex tasks. Accordingly,\nfarmers\
    \ could tackle the challenge of high energy prices and labor shortages.\nIn addition\
    \ to utilizing different robotic systems and the electrification of agricultural\
    \ vehi-\ncles, on-site renewable energy production could be a potential strategy\
    \ for efficiency enhance-\nment and energy independence to provide the needed\
    \ power as a future-oriented approach.\nResearch has already received considerable\
    \ attention in designing independent energy\necosystems, including on-site hydrogen\
    \ production and photovoltaic farms and even\nphotovoltaic-powered agricultural\
    \ monitoring robots [24]. The following sections describe\ngreen technologies\
    \ that could be essential in the sustainable development of autonomous\nrobotic\
    \ vehicles in agriculture.\n3.1. Current Applications and Trends in Agricultural\
    \ Robots\nRobots are well used in industrial applications such as material processing,\
    \ transporta-\ntion, and quality control inspection. Many agricultural robots\
    \ have been proposed and\ndeveloped, bringing automation and intelligence to agricultural\
    \ machinery. Agricultural\nrobots are self-contained machines used to improve\
    \ efﬁciency and yield performance,\nreduce reliance on labor, and improve overall\
    \ productivity [25]. Lightweight robots can\nreduce the soil damage produced by\
    \ heavy agricultural machinery [26]. Moreover, robots\nutilized in farm applications\
    \ should be no heavier than human workers because this sit-\nuation could increase\
    \ soil damage. Small and lightweight robots should also be cheaper\nand more affordable,\
    \ to increase the presence of robots on farms. Recently, several research\narticles\
    \ have been presented regarding the development of small robots. In [27], a mobile\n\
    robotic platform is used to carry a multi-sensor platform to perform ground mapping.\n\
    The terrain information is critical to improve the operation of robots since it\
    \ can be used\nto improve the robot’s control, increase fuel efﬁciency, and reduce\
    \ soil compaction effects.\nMoreover, an automatic terrain estimation and classiﬁcation\
    \ system that can be used for\nself-driving small robots was presented in [28].\
    \ Since small and lightweight robots have\nseveral advantages over heavier robots,\
    \ such as reducing soil damage and better mobility\namong crops, more research\
    \ about this type of agricultural robot is needed [29].\nAgricultural robots are\
    \ generally equipped with sensors or actuators for a wide\nrange of tasks, such\
    \ as weed control, sowing and planting, aerial data collection, ﬁeld\nmapping\
    \ [27], fertilization and irrigation, intercropping work, treatment, soil analysis,\n\
    and environmental protection monitoring. The use of automatic equipment and robot\
    \ in\nagriculture is the most obvious, and there are many success stories in robot\
    \ agriculture.\nThe Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) reported\
    \ that agricultural robotics\nwould become a mainstream technology by 2020 and\
    \ be widely adopted and applied on\nfuture farms [30]. Consulting ﬁrms and research\
    \ institutes have made market forecasts\nfor agricultural robotics. According\
    \ to Statista [31], shipments of agricultural robots will\nincrease to 594,000\
    \ in 2024, with sales rising from USD 3 billion in 2015 to USD 74.5 billion\n\
    in 2024.\nVehicles 2022, 4\n847\nAgricultural robotics can overcome restrictions\
    \ such as low productivity and inten-\nsive manual labor. Robots can perform tasks\
    \ that humans cannot perform due to harsh\nconditions, such as environmental monitoring\
    \ and control, crop monitoring, and care and\ntreatment. In addition, the use\
    \ of robots in agriculture could reduce operating costs and\nfarming lead times\
    \ [17]. Another reason to use agricultural robots is to improve food\nquality\
    \ and productivity and reduce labor costs and working hours. Market demand and\n\
    better technology will enable researchers to develop agricultural robots for more\
    \ purposes,\nincluding vegetable and fruit harvesting, with higher accuracy and\
    \ productivity.\nThe literature shows that various technologies are already used\
    \ in the research of\nagricultural robots around the world. For instance, recent\
    \ review presented in [21] reveals\nthat 37% of robotic systems are 4WD, and 22.06%\
    \ are used in weeding tasks. Moreover, 50%\nuse cameras, 20% RTK/GNSS/INS, and\
    \ 16% LiDAR as the main sensors for navigation.\nAustralian and US companies and\
    \ research institutes design 17% and 14% of agricultural\nrobots, respectively.\
    \ In the near future, the integration of many new technologies such as\nengineering,\
    \ computer vision, AI, and control systems in the agricultural robotics sector\n\
    will facilitate the advent of autonomous system architectures. The autonomous\
    \ concept in\nagriculture will allow the opportunity to develop a new range of\
    \ agricultural equipment\nbased on small intelligent machines that can perform\
    \ many tasks accurately and in an\nenvironmentally friendly way. For instance,\
    \ smart tractors [32] could work together to\ngenerate operational routes and\
    \ intelligently avoid ﬁeld obstacles to ensure the safety of\nboth farmland and\
    \ people. The robotic cultivator [33] can distinguish between weeds and\ncrops\
    \ by computer vision and apply the herbicide accurately only to the weeds. Harvesting\n\
    robots [34] help farmers to collect various products more efﬁciently. Finally,\
    \ autonomous\nrobots in agriculture also contribute to livestock, such as automatic\
    \ feeding, milking,\nand grazing.\n3.2. Design Architecture of Autonomous Agricultural\
    \ Robots\nFuture agricultural robots and vehicles are considered to work independently\
    \ and au-\ntonomously. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) deﬁned six levels\
    \ of autonomous\ndriving in vehicular applications [35]:\n•\nLevel 0—No Driving\
    \ Automation or Manual Driving: the driver is entirely responsible\nand permanently\
    \ carries out all aspects of the driving task.\n•\nLevel 1—Driver Assistance System:\
    \ the driver can perform steering, accelerating,\nor braking. In this approach,\
    \ the system performs one of the driving tasks.\n•\nLevel 2—Partial Driving Automation:\
    \ the driver must permanently monitor the\nsystem, where several tasks might be\
    \ performed with the automation system.\n•\nLevel 3—Conditional Driving Automation:the\
    \ driver can turn attention away from\nthe road in certain situations but must\
    \ always be ready to take complete control. This\nsystem can control the vehicle\
    \ autonomously on deﬁned routes.\n•\nLevel 4—High Driving Automation: the driver\
    \ can transfer complete control to the\nsystem and devote himself to other activities\
    \ while taking control at any time. This\nsystem could perform all driving tasks.\n\
    •\nLevel 5—Full Driving Automation: no driver needed means that the system controls\n\
    the vehicle autonomously under all conditions.\nConsequently, various automation\
    \ systems for agricultural vehicles have been proposed\nand introduced. Currently,\
    \ there are four categories of autonomous and semi-autonomous\nagricultural vehicles\
    \ [14]:\n•\nVehicles with driver assistance: Vehicles with various driver assistance\
    \ tools such as\nmarkers, safety sensors, and indicators. This reduces the complexity\
    \ and increases the\nefﬁciency of ﬁeld use.\n•\nVehicles with automatic steering:\
    \ Vehicles with automatic steering, such as tractors\nand other farm vehicles.\
    \ The driver controls other tasks, such as object avoidance,\nsafety, vehicle\
    \ detection, turning at the end of the line, and other non-automated tasks.\n\
    Vehicles 2022, 4\n848\n•\nVehicles with supervised autonomy: Vehicles that function\
    \ in supervised autonomy\nemploy vehicle-to-vehicle technology and have a wireless\
    \ connection between two or\nmore vehicles to share data [36]. The vehicle in\
    \ front (with the operator) determines\nthe speed and direction, which is sent\
    \ to the other self-driving vehicles to be imitated.\n•\nUnmanned vehicles: Unmanned\
    \ Ground Vehicles (UGVs) are fully autonomous ma-\nchines with an array of sensors\
    \ that enable them to respond to obstacles and unforeseen\ncircumstances on the\
    \ farm.\nModern autonomous vehicles use speciﬁc sensors such as data acquisition\
    \ devices\nto monitor environmental variables and vehicle status. The collected\
    \ data are sent to the\nfusion algorithm to predict the next variable state, and\
    \ ﬁnally, the actuator is controlled by\nthe control algorithm. Autonomous vehicles\
    \ in agriculture use GPS technology to track\nthe path of a vehicle. In addition,\
    \ this allows the reception of accurate map data over the\nInternet (e.g., precision\
    \ planting, variable rate applications, or yield monitoring). Various\nmultispectral\
    \ imaging devices and LiDAR sensors were installed and used to monitor and\ngenerate\
    \ images of trees and plants [37]. Subsequently, automated machinery in agriculture\n\
    has speciﬁc technical requirements. Unlike the industry, it can be challenging\
    \ to automate\nthese applications fully. Agricultural robots and vehicles are\
    \ exposed to highly dynamic\nenvironments, but they are expected to touch accurately,\
    \ feel, and manipulate crops and\nenvironments [38]; thus, increasing efﬁciency\
    \ and minimizing impact should be prioritized.\nSome industrial robot platforms\
    \ are available with high precision and speed [39].\nNonetheless, their application\
    \ in agriculture is limited due to an unstructured environment\nand the uncertain\
    \ tasks that present signiﬁcant challenges. On the one hand, the demand\nfor fruit\
    \ and vegetable cultivation in the off-season requires various aspects of automation\n\
    and robotics in closed-ﬁeld crop production environments such as greenhouses [39].\
    \ On the\nother hand, ﬁeld robots should work in dynamic, complex, and uncertain\
    \ environments to\nfunction efﬁciently under real conditions. This is much more\
    \ sophisticated than an indus-\ntrial robot that picks and places huge bolts on\
    \ the assembly line. Despite the importance\nof automation in agriculture, it\
    \ faces more restrictions than industries; some of them are\nas follows:\n•\n\
    Dependence on the type of operation (greenhouse, small or large open ﬁelds);\n\
    •\nEnvironmental conditions that can affect sensor observations (rain, fog, dust,\
    \ tempera-\nture, moisture, radiance);\n•\nChanging conditions of workspace (spread\
    \ and large workspaces);\n•\nGround surface conditions and characteristics can\
    \ change unexpectedly;\n•\nPlants should be protected from damage (e.g., by navigation\
    \ errors or operation mistakes);\n•\nDesign of system should be optimized in performance\
    \ and cost [40].\nIt should be noted that the farm environment, in some cases,\
    \ such as orchard gardens\nand greenhouses, is more straightforward than one of\
    \ the urban autonomous vehicles on\npublic roads. In such cases, ﬁeld dimensions\
    \ and ﬁeldsets are well deﬁned, as are areas that\nare or need to be planted for\
    \ a particular product. In addition, boundaries and obstacles\nare deﬁned, and\
    \ transit areas are approved for vehicles.\n3.3. Research Trends in Autonomous\
    \ Agricultural Vehicles\nResearchers are now looking to achieve fully autonomous\
    \ agricultural vehicles. Agri-\ncultural vehicle and robotic research ranges from\
    \ automated harvesting with professional\nmanipulators and innovative grippers\
    \ integrated into a custom-designed mobile platform\nto autonomous target spraying\
    \ for pest control [41]. Most of the recent literature published\nin this research\
    \ area includes visual-based control, advanced image processing techniques,\n\
    gripper designs for automatic harvesting of valuable crops, terrain assessment\
    \ using vehi-\ncle modeling [28,42], and navigation for ﬁeld robot development.\
    \ Moreover, agricultural\nrobots’ impacts, ethics, and policy points of view are\
    \ studied in [26], where the social,\nenvironmental, and economic beneﬁts of robots\
    \ in agriculture are highlighted.\nSome design guidelines and parameters for plant\
    \ care robots have been evaluated\nin [43]. The results show that design parameters\
    \ such as work capacity, function, damage,\nVehicles 2022, 4\n849\neconomy, environment,\
    \ renewable energy use, weight, and attractiveness are essential.\nAccording to\
    \ [44], the most common sensors employed in autonomous farm vehicles can\nbe categorized\
    \ into three classes:\nMotion measurement including odometry (from driven wheels\
    \ or from separate odometry\nwheels) and inertia sensors (accelerometers and gyroscope);\n\
    Artiﬁcial landmarks using laser positioning and millimeter-wave radar; and\nLocal\
    \ feature detection using sonar and computer vision.\nThe autonomous agricultural\
    \ vehicle navigation systems use typically some of the\nfollowing base algorithms\
    \ [45]:\n•\nNeural networks and genetic algorithms;\n•\nFuzzy logic control;\n\
    •\nDead reckoning algorithms;\n•\nImage processing;\n•\nStatistical-based engineering\
    \ algorithms; and\n•\nKalman ﬁlters.\nA speciﬁc architecture called RHEA has been\
    \ proposed and developed in [40]. This\nwork included robot design and control,\
    \ WiFi communication, and software interfaces for\nhuman users. However, the authors\
    \ recognized the need to reduce agricultural robots’ size,\ncomplexity, and cost.\n\
    Many researchers and companies work on agricultural robots in various applications\n\
    for research purposes, and some commercial robot systems [46–48]. Such applications\n\
    include solar-powered systems for weed control robots, targeted spraying robots,\
    \ compact\nrobots for inspection and data collection, harvesting robots, and robots\
    \ for recognition\nand operation in greenhouses. Other applications of agricultural\
    \ robots are crop scouting,\nphenotype determination, milking, and sorting. Most\
    \ of the robots in agricultural applica-\ntions are still in the prototype stage.\
    \ Recent studies about agricultural robots [49,50] and\nUGVs [11] present the\
    \ evolution from early attempts to the latest developed prototypes.\nThey highlight\
    \ that if agricultural robots are efﬁciently included and implemented, they\n\
    can play a key function in lowering manufacturing costs, growing productiveness\
    \ and\nquality, and allowing custom-designed plant and crop remedies.\nIn addition\
    \ to autonomous agricultural robots, some researchers and engineers have\ndeveloped\
    \ unmanned tractors. Most of them adopted an industrial farming style, all\nknown\
    \ in advance, where the machine could fully function in a predeﬁned way, similar\n\
    to a production line. Early prototypes with guidewire control systems date back\
    \ to the\n1950s and 1960s [14]. In the 1980s, combining computers and image sensors\
    \ opened up the\npossibility of computer vision-based guidance systems. In the\
    \ mid-1980s, Michigan State\nUniversity and Texas A&M University researchers investigated\
    \ a computer vision guidance\napproach [51]. The Claas autonomous navigation system\
    \ offers Cam Pilot steering and 3D\ncomputer vision tracking features [52]. This\
    \ idea could be of interest as the need for more\nefﬁcient vehicles is increasing,\
    \ and some ﬁeld operations may be fully automated thanks\nto autonomous technology.\
    \ However, they have not entirely succeeded in their mission\nbecause they cannot\
    \ reﬂect the complexity of the real world.\nFuture research on autonomous agricultural\
    \ vehicles involves the development of\nelectriﬁed powertrain systems, improved\
    \ guidance system accuracy, and safe operations\nrelated to machine, environment,\
    \ and human interactions. Furthermore, from the long-term\npoint of view, the\
    \ electriﬁcation of the agricultural vehicle seems to be a more important\nstep\
    \ for robotic and smart farming in the context of Agriculture 5.0.\n3.4. Overview\
    \ of Agricultural Vehicle Electriﬁcation\nInternational emission regulations force\
    \ the industry and scientiﬁc community to\nexplore new alternative powertrain\
    \ solutions for off-road vehicles. A more efﬁcient and\nless polluting machine\
    \ is essential. Today, some manufacturers in the agricultural sector are\nalso\
    \ developing new electrical solutions that enable both emission regulation compliance\n\
    and increased overall productivity by introducing higher levels of automation.\
    \ Due to\nVehicles 2022, 4\n850\nrecent regulations on pollutant emissions, off-road\
    \ equipment manufacturers are working\non research and development to meet stringent\
    \ limits. Therefore, alternatives have been\nconsidered to solve the emission\
    \ problem in recent years. In this direction, electric and\nhybrid vehicles have\
    \ proven to be viable alternative solutions.\nElectriﬁcation of agricultural drive\
    \ systems leads to improved overall efﬁciency, perfor-\nmance, productivity, and\
    \ ﬂexibility [14]. One of the beneﬁts of using electrical accessories\nsuch as\
    \ radiator fans, water pumps, and air conditioner compressors to separate traditional\n\
    mechanically driven components from the engine is the potential reduction of parasitic\
    \ loss\nand fuel consumption [53]. In addition, overall agricultural performance\
    \ can be improved\nby improving operator comfort and machine performance. Another\
    \ advantage of electrical\naccessories is the ﬂexibility of the tractor’s component\
    \ arrangement to improve power\ntake-off (PTO) load response, enhance transport\
    \ acceleration, and increase productivity [54].\nElectriﬁed agricultural propulsion\
    \ systems have some direct and indirect beneﬁts.\nBesides the emission reduction\
    \ potential of the electriﬁed powertrain in agricultural ve-\nhicles, there are\
    \ some further advantages to their use for various tasks in farming. Such\nadvantages\
    \ include more accurate controllability than conventional tractors, making more\n\
    comfortable and productive farming possible [14], and lower maintenance costs\
    \ and fewer\nmoving components, reducing repair costs. All the mentioned advantages\
    \ could facilitate\nthe development of an autonomous agricultural electric vehicle.\n\
    Based on the literature, there are three main types of green electric vehicles\
    \ [55]:\nbattery electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell electric. Each concept\
    \ has some advantages\nand disadvantages. For example, a battery electric vehicle\
    \ has a limited battery lifetime,\nlong recharging time, high cost, environmental\
    \ emissions related to battery production,\nand limited recharging infrastructure.\
    \ These limitations would be more drastic in off-road\nvehicles, such as tractors,\
    \ which usually require more energy in a short time [56]. Thus,\nhybrid electric\
    \ vehicles (HEVs) have been proposed as an interim solution to interact with\n\
    this technological and sustainable development. An HEV uses at least two energy\
    \ sources\nto increase driveline efﬁciency. The basic beneﬁts of vehicle powertrain\
    \ hybridization\nare downsizing engines by running the internal combustion engine\
    \ (ICE) at maximum\nefﬁciency, eliminating idle fuel consumption by turning off\
    \ the engine (stop-and-go),\nand recovering energy during deceleration, the aim\
    \ of the regenerative braking system.\nUsing an electric or hybrid propulsion\
    \ system makes it possible to use small electric\nactuators that consume less\
    \ power and can apply treatment to small areas using unmanned\nrobots [57]. These\
    \ new technologies based on clean energy sources can signiﬁcantly reduce\nair\
    \ pollutants and greenhouse gases. Alternating the ICE and introducing an alternative\n\
    electrical energy storage system allows small agricultural tractors to run large\
    \ machines.\nSuch a distributed system is important, particularly in precision\
    \ agriculture. Although\nsome progress has been made in construction vehicles,\
    \ farming tractors and mobile robots\nhave started receiving attention [15]. Nevertheless,\
    \ there is no in-depth analysis concerning\nthe designing and developing approaches\
    \ for off-road agricultural applications. We have\nto highlight that the electriﬁcation\
    \ of agricultural vehicles is still in the early stages.\n3.5. Research Trends\
    \ in Agricultural Vehicles\nAs mentioned before, the electric propulsion of agricultural\
    \ machinery has three\nmain applications: tractors, equipment, and agricultural\
    \ robots. Usually, a tractor is a\nmultipurpose machine used to pull trailers\
    \ and run attachable tools that do not have their\nown power unit. Today, almost\
    \ all agricultural vehicles use an ICE powered by gasoline or\ndiesel [58]. Off-road\
    \ vehicles with ICE can attain low efﬁciency and offer reliability with\ntrustable\
    \ attributes in maintenance and replacements. On the other hand, electric vehicles\n\
    can attain comparatively high efﬁciency and less mileage with feasible maintenance\
    \ and\nreplacements. Hybrid conﬁgurations for agricultural vehicles can be a solution\
    \ to increase\nproductivity and allow them to operate all day without the concern\
    \ of the battery charging\npresent in some electric solutions [55], especially\
    \ when there is poor access to electric\ninfrastructure for battery charging on\
    \ the farm.\nVehicles 2022, 4\n851\nIn an HEV, electrical and electronic components\
    \ are integrated into the mechanical\nsystem to supply power to other propulsion\
    \ units. The proper combination of powertrain\ncomponents allows for many powertrain\
    \ topologies. Based on the literature, generally, there\nare three main possible\
    \ topologies: pure electric, series hybrid, and parallel hybrid [59].\nHybrid\
    \ electric architectures in construction, handling, and agriculture machines have\n\
    been studied in [60]. Based on this study, there are a few electriﬁed architectures\
    \ for\nagricultural vehicles. For instance, an example of a hybrid architecture\
    \ is the diesel-electric\nfour-wheel-drive (4WD) architecture for the RigiTrac\
    \ EWD 120 tractor from a project of the\nTechnical University of Dresden [60].\
    \ Regarding powertrain hybridization concepts in the\nliterature, the series hybrid\
    \ concept is more commonly used in high traction and heavy\nload applications\
    \ such as tractors, and the parallel hybrid approach is widely used in the\nautomobile\
    \ industry.\nThe timeline for a well-known commercial hybrid electric tractor\
    \ in agriculture is\nshown in Figure 2. For example, in 1954, the International\
    \ Harvester introduced the\nFarmall 400 tractor to support electric farming equipment\
    \ and accessories. Interestingly,\nthe world’s ﬁrst fuel cell vehicle was a tractor\
    \ manufactured by Allis Chalmer in 1959. It\nfeatured 1008 individual alkaline\
    \ fuel cells connected to 112 nine-cell units located in four\nbanks, producing\
    \ enough power to drive a 20 hp DC motor. In this regard, an FC tractor\nconcept\
    \ called NH2 was released by New Holland Co. in 2009. The fuel cell NH2 produces\n\
    approximately 106 horsepower, allows farmers to reduce the cost of purchasing\
    \ fossil fuels,\nand increases autonomy [14].\n1954\n1959\nFarmall 400 tractor,\

    \ commercial hybrid electric tractors in agriculture [14].\nAll-electric tractors\
    \ have been introduced by several manufacturers recently. In 2016,\nJohn Deere\
    \ unveiled an all-electric prototype of the 6R SESAM that is equipped with two\n\
    electric motors that drive the gearbox and PTO [61]. The onboard battery pack\
    \ is said to\nwithstand four hours of mixed work. The Fendt company unveiled the\
    \ e100 Vario as the\nﬁrst all-electric special tractor [62]. A single electric\
    \ motor is used to drive both the rear\nand front axles (if all-wheel drive is\
    \ required). The system runs on a 100 kWh battery and,\naccording to the manufacturer,\
    \ lasts all day on a single charge. Some known companies\nhave developed and introduced\
    \ autonomous guided tractors and agricultural machinery\nwith local and global\
    \ sensors in row crops and orchards. For instance, John Deere’s\nconcept offers\
    \ an auto-steering vehicle with a farm management system that reduces driver\n\
    mistakes and overtaking, resulting in improved fuel efﬁciency. Other companies,\
    \ such as\nCase New Holland (CNH), offer similar systems. In 2020, ELMEC introduced\
    \ the fully\nelectric self-driving tractor robot ERION.\nRecently, some tractor\
    \ manufacturers have adapted their equipment to operate on\nalternative fuels\
    \ such as electricity and biofuels, solar panels, and hydrogen FC. However,\n\
    technical information on these prototypes is not available to the public. Therefore,\
    \ this\nsection’s focus will be on future electric drives. Some research has focused\
    \ on other\nsustainable green energy sources, such as biofuels and solar energy,\
    \ to replace traditional\nfossil fuels in agricultural vehicles, with direct beneﬁts\
    \ for the environment and society [63].\nVehicles 2022, 4\n852\nThe research results\
    \ show that a hybrid electric multifunction tractor produced around\n17% less\
    \ emission than comparable diesel-powered tractors. One should highlight that\
    \ the\nhigh life cycle costs of electric tractors are due to the vehicle’s battery\
    \ and its replacement\ncosts (around 52% of the total price). As mentioned above,\
    \ due to the low durability of\nthe battery and the long charging time, the ability\
    \ of off-road electric vehicles to gain a\nlong-term market presence is diminished\
    \ [64]. These properties limit the use of a purely\nelectric powertrain in tractors\
    \ that require large amounts of energy in a short period.\nAnother alternative\
    \ energy resource to batteries is hydrogen fuel cells. Unlike batteries\nthat\
    \ require a long recharging time, hydrogen fuel cells operate if hydrogen fuel\
    \ is available\nin the tank, and it can be recharged as quickly as the gasoline\
    \ tank at a refuelling station [65].\nA comparison of battery electric vehicles,\
    \ hydrogen FC electric vehicles, and hydrogen FC\nplug-in hybrid vehicles is presented\
    \ in [66]. This research work reveals that battery electric\nand hydrogen FC plug-in\
    \ hybrid vehicles have similar life cycle costs. The life cycle costs\nof the\
    \ electric vehicles mentioned are higher than those of internal combustion engines;\n\
    however, they could be reduced by 2030. In this regard, in [57], the authors investigated\
    \ the\npossibility of fuel cell hybrid powertrains for an agricultural tractor.\
    \ The results showed\nthat the fuel cell system still suffers from disadvantages\
    \ such as limited lifetime, high cost,\nhydrogen storage issues, and inaccessibility\
    \ of infrastructure. However, they can reduce\nfuel consumption by almost one\
    \ third compared to diesel engine vehicles with conventional\npower sources [55].\
    \ From previous ﬁndings, using various sources of alternative renewable\nenergies\
    \ in agricultural vehicles could be one solution to the farm’s energy demand increase.\n\
    3.6. On-Farm Renewable Energy Production and Availability\nRenewable energy is\
    \ widely used in various industries, and agriculture is one of the\nmost promising\
    \ applications in the near future. Farms usually are far from the fuel stations,\n\
    especially in developing countries. Therefore, providing fuels for agricultural\
    \ vehicles\nmight increase the farming costs. In this case, an independent on-site\
    \ renewable energy\nsupply system can offer a signiﬁcant opportunity to provide\
    \ the farm’s required energy\nor promote energy to the nearby community, even\
    \ selling electricity to the local network.\nMoreover, this may assist in the\
    \ performance enhancement and decrease the dependency on\nfossil fuels and present\
    \ distributed electricity generation. Renewable energy resources seem\nof tremendous\
    \ signiﬁcance for the fulﬁlment of electric-powered vehicles in agriculture,\n\
    especially for regions far away from the fueling stations [67]. Moreover, renewable\
    \ electrical\nenergy can be combined with wireless power transfer (WPT) technology\
    \ to ensure the\nenergy supply of outdoor sensors [68]. Distributed or dynamic\
    \ WPT can be extended to\nrobots and agricultural vehicles to reduce the size\
    \ of embedded energy storage. Regarding\nthe mentioned potentials, on-site renewable\
    \ energy production and agricultural powertrain\nelectriﬁcation are more promising\
    \ methods in future agriculture.\n•\nSolar energy: for heating or photovoltaic\
    \ electricity production, this is farms’ primary\nrenewable energy source. Solar\
    \ energy can be used in agriculture in various ways,\nincluding power generation,\
    \ pumping, heating, and crop drying. Key beneﬁts include\nits wide availability\
    \ and low cost. However, due to the intermittent nature of the solar\nsystem and\
    \ its low energy density, other auxiliary energy resources such as batteries\n\
    are usually needed to provide short-term continuous energy [47].\n•\nSmall wind\
    \ power: small wind turbines are other potential renewable energy sources\nfor\
    \ agriculture. However, their utilization is limited by the wind energy potential\
    \ that\ndepends on the mean wind speed. This source has a highly stochastic behavior;\
    \ thus,\nit needs energy storage for proper integration.\n•\nBiofuels and biomass:\
    \ there are primary resources abundant in farms that can be used\nfor generating\
    \ biofuels. They include agricultural waste from product residues, food\nwaste,\
    \ and forest bioenergy resources. These materials can be used to produce other\n\
    green energy sources, such as biodiesel, bioethanol, biomass pellets, and bio-methane\n\
    gas [69]. Ethanol as a biofuel is generated from sugar-wealthy vegetation through\n\
    a fermentation process [70]. Biodiesel can also be produced from renewable oils,\n\
    Vehicles 2022, 4\n853\ntogether with animal fats and seed oil [71]. In addition,\
    \ biogas is produced through\nthe anaerobic digestion of vegetation and waste\
    \ [72].\n•\nMicro-hydro power: this is a potential renewable energy source for\
    \ agriculture that\ncould offer controllable electricity production. We must emphasize\
    \ that small dams\nwith turbines were one of the ﬁrst options for mechanical force\
    \ generation (e.g., mills)\nand electricity production in the agricultural sector.\n\
    Hydrogen as energy vector: hydrogen is being promoted as a potential fuel and\n\
    energy vector, as indicated by subsidized programs from several government agencies\n\
    worldwide. Hydrogen can be produced from various primary energy carriers using\
    \ var-\nious techniques. Approximately half of hydrogen is produced by thermal\
    \ catalysts and\ngasiﬁcation processes that use natural gas as the primary source.\
    \ There are several ways to\ngenerate hydrogen from solar energy [73]. Electrolysis,\
    \ which could use electricity from\nrenewable energy sources such as solar energy,\
    \ is the most commonly proposed method for\nbreaking down water into hydrogen\
    \ and oxygen. New technologies for converting organic\nmaterials to fuel, e.g.,\
    \ to produce hydrogen, are available. These include the cultivation\nof cyanobacteria\
    \ or microalgae and thermochemical or fermentation processes. Biomass\ngasiﬁcation,\
    \ for instance, is the fastest and cheapest way to produce sustainable renewable\n\
    hydrogen [74]. However, more research is needed on many issues, such as transfer\
    \ and\nprocessing techniques for producing hydrogen from biomass. Artiﬁcial photosynthesis\
    \ is\nanother promising concept. Several studies have been conducted to mimic\
    \ the enzymatic\nprocesses that green plants use to capture sunlight and break\
    \ down water molecules into\noxygen and hydrogen. Therefore, environmentally friendly\
    \ hydrogen could be a future\noption for using hybrid power systems in agriculture.\
    \ However, there are still many chal-\nlenges in producing hydrogen from renewable\
    \ energy on energy-independent farms and\nusing it in future eco-friendly vehicles,\
    \ such as economic and technical problems.\nFigure 3 shows a schematic ecosystem\
    \ of an energy-independent farm. This schema\nsuggests that all renewable energy\
    \ sources could be converted to electricity. Then, this\nenergy could be used\
    \ on other electriﬁed devices such as sensors, vehicles, and robots.\nThe energy\
    \ produced using renewable sources may be stored in batteries for a short time\n\
    and hydrogen tanks for long-term storage. Depending on the application, the electricity\n\
    conversion can be bypassed, and the source can be used directly to produce mechanical\
    \ or\nthermal energy.\nHydro-power\nWind \nSolar \nElectricity\nWaste and \norganic\

    \ Agriculture 5.0\nAgriculture stands to gain more beneﬁts from technology than\
    \ many other industries.\nAgriculture is essential to the lives of individuals,\
    \ farmers, and society. Therefore, everyone\nbeneﬁts from the fact that academia\
    \ and industry introduce new technologies to optimize\nagricultural processes.\
    \ The integration of such technologies provides the opportunity to\npromote the\
    \ basis for intelligent and automated agriculture. As summarized in Table 1,\n\

    \ trends\nin the Agriculture 5.0 context.\nVehicles 2022, 4\n854\n•\nAgricultural\

    \ systems controlled remotely by a human operator or operate autonomously\nby\
    \ an onboard computer. UAVs are widely used in agriculture [75], industry, and\
    \ com-\nmerce. The labor-saving and high-efﬁciency characteristics of UAVs are\
    \ in line with\nthe development goals of Agriculture 5.0. For instance, UAVs are\
    \ used in crop spray-\ning, photography, mapping, and surveying applications.\
    \ Research on agricultural\nUAVs focuses primarily on crop protection measures,\
    \ ﬁeld monitoring, plant pollina-\ntion, and herd placement [75,76]. UAVs for\
    \ agricultural applications include electric\nmulti-rotor UAVs, ﬁxed-wing UAVs,\
    \ and single-rotor UAVs. Today, electric multirotor\nUAVs boast a signiﬁcant market\
    \ share due to their low cost, low failure rate, ease of\noperation, and environmental\
    \ protection.\n•\nFifth- or Sixth-Generation of Communication (5G and 6G): 5G\
    \ and 6G are next-\ngeneration wireless communication technologies with high-frequency\
    \ electromag-\nnetic waves and low-latency characteristics [77]. These networks\
    \ offer faster data\ntransmission speeds and better throughput than previous wireless\
    \ communication\ntechnologies, providing device communications, user-side AI algorithms,\
    \ distributed\nfault diagnostic methods, and complex security strategies, which\
    \ might be applicable\nin agriculture [78].\n•\nInternet of Everything (IoE):\
    \ While the Internet of Things (IoT) focuses primarily on\nsensor-based smart\
    \ facility machine-to-machine communication, the IoE aims to serve\npeople through\
    \ the IoT. The IoT represents a physical object with sensors, processing\ncapabilities,\
    \ software, and other technologies connecting and exchanging data with\nother\
    \ devices and systems over the Internet or other communication networks [79,80].\n\
    In agriculture, IoT can be used in autonomous agricultural equipment, robots,\
    \ UAVs,\nlivestock and water management systems, and remote sensors combined with\
    \ data\nanalysis tools to monitor crops and ﬁelds to help farmers in farm management\
    \ to save\ntime and money.\n•\nData Analysis: This technology uses detailed surveying\
    \ and data processing methods\n(machine learning, statistical analysis, and big\
    \ data) to extract useful information [81].\nTechnologies based on artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ can play an important role in agriculture\nwith modeling and inference capabilities,\
    \ helping us to understand all the data avail-\nable [82]. Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ could be used for deep learning, neural networks,\nfuzzy logic, genetic algorithms,\
    \ and expert systems. Artiﬁcial intelligence can analyze\nbig data, select valuable\
    \ information, and provide unique systems to improve agricul-\ntural productivity\
    \ [83]. Many researchers are studying AI technology and its multiple\napplications\
    \ [84]. In agriculture, the main research on AI includes intelligent robots\n\
    based on machine learning models and computer vision technologies for agricultural\n\
    tasks such as seeding and harvesting [85]. In addition, some researchers are working\n\
    on monitoring using computer vision technology and deep learning algorithms to\n\
    analyze soil health and crop condition data [86].\n•\nFog and Edge Computing:\
    \ Fog computing is a computing paradigm that reduces\ncommunication latency by\
    \ moving cloud computing equipment and services to access\nnetworks. Edge computing\
    \ technology signiﬁcantly reduces trafﬁc and lag by deploy-\ning artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ algorithms on devices rather than cloud servers [87]. As a\nresult, based on\
    \ the technologies mentioned above, manual operation is replaced by\nintelligent\
    \ machinery and decision-making systems that contribute to an intelligent\nagricultural\
    \ context [88]. An example of a mobile edge-computing-based Internet of\nAgricultural\
    \ Things application is shown in [89].\n•\nBlockchain: A blockchain is a system\
    \ that records information in ways that make\nchanges, hacks, or cheats difﬁcult\
    \ or impossible [90]. The blockchain has the potential\nto help farmers in many\
    \ aspects, including insurance, ﬁnance, product traceability,\nand security [91].\
    \ These technologies could be helpful in the agricultural market for\npurposes\
    \ such as distributed ledgers and smart contracts. It permits eliminating coun-\n\
    Vehicles 2022, 4\n855\nterfeiting in production and supply chains, bringing healthier\
    \ products to consumers,\nand building trust among business players [92].\n•\n\
    Software-Deﬁned Networking (SDN): Software-deﬁned networking is called a central-\n\
    ized control network. Custom virtualization and programming perform routing and\n\
    control separately, adding ﬂexibility and reliability to network management [93].\
    \ Re-\ncently, multi-domain SDNs that control large networks have become a hot\
    \ topic in new\nconcepts such as smart agriculture and renewable energy system\
    \ management [94].\nThis technology can effectively simplify and manage heterogeneous\
    \ networks with\nvarious devices.\n•\nVirtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR,\
    \ AR, and MR): VR is a simulation experi-\nence that is similar to or completely\
    \ different from the real world. AR is a technology\nthat overlays virtual objects\
    \ in the real world. Mixed reality is a blend of physical and\ndigital worlds,\
    \ unlocking natural and intuitive 3D human, computer, and environ-\nmental interactions\
    \ [95]. Although VR is widely used as an educational method in\nthe industry,\
    \ few studies have been done on VR for agriculture purposes for farmers’\neducation\
    \ simulation [96] and technical training in the maintenance of agricultural\n\
    machinery [97]. Both VR and AR technologies contribute to the automation and intel-\n\
    ligence of Agriculture 5.0. For example, farmers can remotely and accurately control\n\
    agricultural robots through VR, AR, or MR devices from the control center or home.\n\
    •\nCybersecurity: Cybersecurity is a technology, process, and control application\
    \ protect-\ning systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from cyberattacks.\
    \ As a critical\nsector, smart agriculture increasingly relies on digital systems\
    \ to work efﬁciently; the\nthreat of large-scale cyberattacks is increasing; therefore,\
    \ protecting these systems\nfrom attacks is a vital issue [79,98]. Cybersecurity\
    \ can be divided into ﬁve domains:\ncritical infrastructure security, application\
    \ security, network security, cloud security,\nand IoT security [99].\n•\nAdditive\
    \ Manufacturing and 3D printing: 3D printing is revolutionizing the manufac-\n\
    turing industry [100]; it can also bring some beneﬁts to agriculture. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ 3D\nprinting can be used in agriculture for manufacturing tools, urban agriculture,\
    \ scale\nmodels, spare parts, and indoor gardening.\nVehicles 2022, 4\n856\nTable\

    \ mentioned previously, the agricultural sector is crucial for human survival,\
    \ and there\nare many challenges, such as population growth, increasing energy\
    \ demands, and climate\nchange. Advances in agriculture are crucial for growing\
    \ production and tackling the chal-\nlenges in the coming years. In this scenario,\
    \ the technological potential can be exploited\nto meet the high-quality food\
    \ needs of the human population, without damaging the\nenvironment, in efﬁcient\
    \ ways.\nThe number of studies associated with sustainable agriculture shows that\
    \ technologi-\ncal adoption and environmentally friendly green solutions can develop\
    \ resilient agriculture.\nAgricultural production processes are now mechanized\
    \ and computerized in developed\ncountries, but the lack of digitization and intelligence\
    \ is a signiﬁcant obstacle to improv-\ning automation capabilities. Large machines\
    \ such as tractors and other equipment favor\nagricultural monopolies, while small\
    \ technologies such as robots and drones can be devel-\noped at a lower cost,\
    \ with new features such as artiﬁcial intelligence to aid small farmers\nin accumulating\
    \ crop variability data and in precision agricultural tasks. For instance,\nweeding\
    \ and harvesting robots have received more attention in recent years. However,\n\
    robotics for agricultural applications have not yet reached a commercial scale,\
    \ except for\nsome limited tasks such as milking robots and harvesting automated\
    \ machines. In the case\nof picking valuable fruits with robots, the technology\
    \ is close to being implemented in a\ncommercial product in the near future [101].\
    \ In [102], the agricultural robots have been\nclassiﬁed based on the type of\
    \ application. The results showed that navigation systems,\nrobot–crop interactions,\
    \ and agronomy–robot fusion are scientiﬁcally important to promote\nadvances in\
    \ agricultural robot technology. The speed and accuracy of robots for agricultural\n\
    applications are the most important issues addressing the generalization of robotic\
    \ systems.\nTherefore, many researchers are working on developing robot systems\
    \ that can operate\nfaster than humans.\nThe complex and dynamic working environments\
    \ of agricultural robots make their\ndesign more challenging than industrial robots\
    \ [29,103]. Therefore, it is required to consider\nspeciﬁc characteristics while\
    \ developing such machines. Developing an affordable and\neffective agricultural\
    \ robot requires interdisciplinary cooperation in some areas, such as\nagricultural\
    \ engineering, computer science, mechatronics, dynamic control, machine learn-\n\
    ing, intelligent systems, sensor and instrument specialists, software designers,\
    \ and system\nintegration [49,104]. These could be available in universities,\
    \ where international networks\nof scientists with different knowledge and experiences\
    \ cooperate on the same projects.\n5.1. Speciﬁc Features of Agricultural Green\
    \ Vehicles\nThere are still some challenges for agricultural electric vehicles\
    \ that should be solved,\nincluding multi-power sources and multi-drive systems\
    \ that make energy management\nsystems more complex. Moreover, there is no standard\
    \ driving cycle for evaluation or a\nmethod for component sizing. Therefore, most\
    \ of the powertrains in this application are\ndesigned based on customers’ average\
    \ needs. These speciﬁc characteristics have made the\ndesign of agricultural HEVs\
    \ complicated.\nThe utilization of robotics, electric drives, and alternative\
    \ green fuels in agricultural\nvehicles and machinery offers energy efﬁciency\
    \ and enhanced overall performance. Re-\ngarding the challenge and development\
    \ level of the new technologies in the agricultural\nsector, having a fully autonomous,\
    \ robotic, energy-independent farm is not achievable\nyet. However, new automated\
    \ machines could perform tasks such as weeding, seeding,\nand harvesting for some\
    \ straightforward plants and trees in the coming years. Technologies\nwidely used\
    \ in other industry sectors, such as machine learning, big data, blockchain,\n\
    simulation, and augmented reality, have not yet been thoroughly studied in agriculture.\n\
    The Internet of Things seems to be related to security and blockchain, highlighting\
    \ that\ntechnological advances also bring complex data security and privacy issues.\
    \ Concerns\nabout information conﬁdentiality and data integrity are major challenges\
    \ for farmers [105].\nVehicles 2022, 4\n858\nIn high-tech scenarios, these concerns\
    \ increase researchers’ and practitioners’ efforts\nto ﬁnd better encryption and\
    \ security techniques to mitigate the risk of cyberattacks and\nboost the security\
    \ and privacy of their data [106]. Furthermore, other digital technologies\nsuch\
    \ as advanced communication networks, artiﬁcial intelligence, and blockchain seem\
    \ to\nbe viable for future research in the digital farming era to evaluate innovation\
    \ capabilities\nto help to develop technological innovations in smart agriculture.\
    \ In this sense, two\nsigniﬁcant challenges can be considered: the ﬁrst challenge\
    \ is sustainability issues, such as\nthe continued growth of the world’s population\
    \ and global warming and their negative\nimpact on agriculture. The second strand\
    \ is associated with technical challenges, such\nas mastering and adapting technical\
    \ tools and guiding them in the best possible way for\noptimal proﬁts.\nThese\
    \ challenges are revealed by technologies that are subtopics of thematic network\n\
    structures such as machine learning, deep learning, drones, cloud computing, big\
    \ data,\nblockchain, artiﬁcial intelligence, artiﬁcial neural networks, and computer\
    \ vision [107].\nDiscussions related to these challenges are represented by sub-themes,\
    \ such as food security,\nconservation agriculture, climate change adaptation,\
    \ agroforestry, vegetation indexes,\nresilience, and mitigation.\nAmong the main\
    \ challenges of digital technology, technological adoption is one of the\nfeatures\
    \ and peculiarities of emerging technologies, which are often complex given small-\n\
    holder farmers’ level of technical knowledge [108]. In addition, many developing\
    \ countries\nhave signiﬁcant problems with digital infrastructure. They are gradually\
    \ developing ways\nto deliver digital devices and applications to smaller manufacturers\
    \ at a lower cost to\nimprove proﬁtability and product quality. Key challenges\
    \ related to the adoption of digital\ntechnology have been identiﬁed, mainly associated\
    \ with the complexity of technologies,\nagricultural culture, and their adaptation\
    \ [22].\n5.2. Opportunities for Research and Practice\nThe development of sustainable\
    \ agriculture relies on various social stakeholders, such\nas universities, farmers,\
    \ businesses, communities, industries, and governments. The uni-\nversity’s involvement\
    \ is essential for research to develop methods and techniques that help\nfarmers\
    \ to manage farms efﬁciently. Moreover, governmental programs and their ﬁnancial\n\
    aid can support the digital transformation of agriculture, promoting the production\
    \ and\nconsumption of sustainable products, reduction of waste, and consciousness\
    \ of recycling.\nAdopting the latest technologies allows the transformation of\
    \ value chains into digital\necosystems, potentially integrating businesses and\
    \ stakeholders, beneﬁting every player\ninside the ecosystem [109]. In industries,\
    \ value ecosystems can directly affect economic\nperformance and commercial enterprise\
    \ agility in agriculture. National innovation sys-\ntems can help to transfer\
    \ knowledge between industries and universities [110], facilitating\nthe development\
    \ of digital innovation. As a result, the number of start-ups working in\nthe\
    \ agricultural sector would grow. They can develop low-cost technologies to meet\
    \ the\nrequirements of small agricultural businesses. In addition, these advanced\
    \ technologies\nshould be cost-effective to meet most of the farmers’ demands\
    \ for accurate control of\nagricultural robots.\nTechnologies such as big data\
    \ facilitate the collection and analysis of a large amount of\ndata. Moreover,\
    \ the IoT can be used in all types of environments through its small sensors\n\
    and actuators. In addition, cybersecurity can be used to address farmers’ concerns\
    \ about\nprivacy and security. Moreover, using green technologies such as renewable\
    \ energy sources\nand electriﬁed powertrains could help in energy independency,\
    \ tackle environmental issues,\nand improve farming machines’ controllability.\
    \ Furthermore, integrating these technologies\nin agricultural robots could accelerate\
    \ farming progress to enhance the net farming yield.\nOverall, these approaches\
    \ can facilitate the digital transformation of agriculture for farms\nof different\
    \ sizes in different scenarios.\nBased on the literature, some of the challenges\
    \ related to robotics for Agriculture 5.0\nand digital farming include optimizing\
    \ the driving system, object detection, reliability in a\nVehicles 2022, 4\n859\n\
    harsh environment, sensor optimization, and path planning to work autonomously.\
    \ Major\nareas for future research to improve current agricultural robotic systems\
    \ could be mapping\nand localization technologies, path planning and obstacle\
    \ avoidance methods, sensor fusion,\ncomputer algorithms, locomotion systems,\
    \ and IoT technologies. Researchers need to ﬁnd\nways to introduce these advanced\
    \ technologies cost-effectively and adaptably into the ﬁeld\nof agricultural robots\
    \ to meet farmers’ demands for accurate control of agricultural robots.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    According to the agriculture sector’s challenges, such as population growth, labor\n\
    shortage, and environmental issues, additional efforts are required to feed people\
    \ by in-\ncreasing productivity in sustainable ways in the coming years. In recent\
    \ years, to tackle\nthis issue, signiﬁcant technological progress has appeared\
    \ to exploit the optimal properties\nof the technology by using advanced computer\
    \ technology, agricultural data, satellites,\nand robots. Using robotics, electric-powered\
    \ devices, and alternative green fuels in agricul-\ntural vehicles and machinery\
    \ offers advantages in terms of energy production and enhanced\nfunctionality.\
    \ Moreover, there is potential for the independent use of such devices in farm-\n\
    land with on-site energy production and autonomous systems. Moving to Agriculture\
    \ 5.0\nis on the agenda of major farm tool manufacturers for the next decade.\
    \ Therefore, off-road\nequipment manufacturers will play a key role in this move\
    \ towards agricultural robots,\nand autonomous renewable electric vehicles are\
    \ considered the next smarter generation\nof farm machines. This review introduced\
    \ the necessity, beneﬁts, challenges, successful\napplications, and potential\
    \ opportunities of using autonomous robotics, hybrid electric\ndrivetrains, and\
    \ renewable energy sources in the agricultural sector looking towards Agri-\n\
    culture 5.0. Moreover, the following points summarize some of the speciﬁc ideas\
    \ that could\nbe extracted from this study.\nRobotics could have great potential\
    \ for many uses in agriculture. In the next step,\ndata-driven farms integrate\
    \ robotics and AI algorithms into their systems. This supports\nthe idea of farming\
    \ in the form of digital solutions combined with robotics and artiﬁcial\nintelligence,\
    \ which represent the next idea for Agriculture 5.0. However, robotics for agri-\n\
    cultural applications has not yet reached a commercial scale widely, and more\
    \ technological\ndevelopments are necessary for robotic control algorithms and\
    \ security issues.\nAutonomous smart agriculture is a pathway to highly automated\
    \ farms using an\nautonomous robotic system in Agriculture 5.0. It could help\
    \ to reduce costs and make\nfarm operations more comfortable to manage in all\
    \ situations, day and night. This is a\nstep towards an intelligent agricultural\
    \ system. However, future research on autonomous\nagricultural vehicles should\
    \ involve the development of electriﬁed powertrain systems,\nimproved guidance\
    \ system accuracy, and safe operations related to machine, environment,\nand human\
    \ interactions.\nA hybrid electric powertrain for agricultural vehicles could\
    \ bring advantages such as\nimproved overall efﬁciency, performance, productivity,\
    \ and ﬂexibility, which might cause\nimproved levels of automation. However, there\
    \ are some limitations in current technologies\nand challenges related to the\
    \ speciﬁc features of agricultural vehicles, including different\nworking environments,\
    \ multi-power sources, and multi-drive systems, that make energy\nmanagement systems\
    \ and component sizing more complex.\nOn-farm energy production using renewable\
    \ sources such as small hydro, solar panels,\nand wind turbines is a promising\
    \ solution to energy crisis issues. Moreover, other green\ntechnologies, such\
    \ as renewable energy-based hydrogen production, could effectively\nprovide clean\
    \ sources for the agricultural sector. However, there are still many challenges\n\
    to producing hydrogen from renewable energy on energy-independent farms and using\
    \ it\nin future eco-friendly vehicles, such as economic and technical problems.\n\
    To summarize, future research will need to consider the following aspects to enable\n\
    autonomous renewable electric vehicles and robots on farms:\n•\nImprove energy\
    \ storage and recharging technology for agricultural electric vehicles;\n•\nDeﬁne\
    \ new standards for electric agricultural vehicles, robots, and machinery;\nVehicles\
    \ 2022, 4\n860\n•\nUse lightweight, small agricultural vehicles in a group instead\
    \ of heavy vehicles to\ndecrease environmental impacts, reduce costs, be accepted\
    \ by customers, and provide\nﬂexibility;\n•\nDevelop advanced technologies, control\
    \ systems, intelligent setups such as collab-\norative and connected vehicles,\
    \ Internet database analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence,\nblockchain, IoT, new sensors,\
    \ and computer algorithms.\nIn this regard, the support of academic or industrial\
    \ research projects and the foundation of\nstart-ups to develop promising solutions\
    \ for sustainable agriculture need to be considered.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    the data quality of sensors, but little is known about the exact effects. We studied
    the effects of artificial and real biofilm fouling on dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors
    in full-scale water resource recovery facilities, and how this can automatically
    be detected. Biofilm fouling resulted in different drift direction and bias magnitudes
    for optical (OPT) and electrochemical (MEC) DO sensors. The OPT-sensor was more
    affected by biofilm fouling compared to the MEC-sensor, especially during summer

    of the automatic air cleaning system in the DO sensor. The IR is an effect of
    a temporal increase in DO concentration during the automatic air cleaning. The
    IRs received distinct pattern changes that were matched with faults including:
    biofilm fouling, disturbances in the air supply to the cleaning system, and damaged
    sensor membrane, which can be used for fault diagnosis. The results highlight

    process control. biofilm fouling, condition-based maintenance, dissolved oxygen
    sensor, fault detection, wastewater INTRODUCTION Listen The dissolved oxygen (DO)
    concentration is a key measured variable in water resource recovery facilities
    (WRRFs). Two measurement technologies are common, membrane electrochemical (MEC)
    and optical fluorescent (OPT) measurement techniques. The MEC type was originally
    described in Clark (1959) and the OPT type was introduced by Demas et al. (1999).
    On-line DO measurements have been commercially available since the 1970s and have
    enabled the development of automatic DO control (Olsson et al. 2005). Typically,
    the DO concentration is maintained at different DO set-points at different zones
    using multiple DO sensors to enhance biological nitrogen removal. Moreover, multiple
    parallel treatment lines result in a large total number of installed DO sensors.
    As an example, the two WRRFs in this study, Bromma (Sweden) WRRF (about 300,000
    p.e. (population equivalent)) and Henriksdal (Sweden) WRRF (about 750,000 p.e.),
    make use of 30 and 21 DO sensors, respectively. Regardless of measurement technology,
    a sensor has to be clean to provide accurate measurements. Inaccurate measurements
    used in a feedback control loop may result in an undesired DO concentration and
    potentially reduced treatment efficiency or unnecessary aeration (with associated
    increasing costs). Therefore, visually inspecting the sensor, its manual cleaning,
    and readings verification are needed on a regular basis to guarantee accurate
    readings. Current sensor verification practice, as in International Organization
    for Standardization (2012), rely on assessing sensor readings under predefined
    conditions. For DO sensors, oxygen free water solutions and water saturated air
    are commonly used. Such actions are, however, time-consuming, especially for WRRFs
    with many and possibly remotely located DO sensors. In sewage measurements, specific
    systems have been developed to resist biofilm fouling and prolong maintenance
    intervals (Li et al. 2017). The need for prolonged sensor maintenance is also
    highlighted in (Thürlimann et al. 2018), where a qualitative soft-sensor approach
    was developed to replace an ammonium sensor with high maintenance requirements.
    There are multiple sensor fouling sources in WRRFs that originate both from the
    influent wastewater stream and the treatment process itself. The fouling sources
    include: solids deposition (biofilm formation, chemical precipitation, sludge,
    and plastic products), hair and fibres, and grease (WEF 2013). In this study we
    consider DO sensors located in the activated sludge process (ASP) where the main
    fouling substance is from biofilm formation. In the following we use the term
    biofilm fouling to distinguish fouling from biofilm formation and other fouling
    sources. In WRRFs, most sensor manufacturers provide optional automatic air cleaning
    that extends the required time interval for manual cleaning. The air cleaning
    results in a temporal increase in the DO concentration, which we further denote
    as an air cleaning impulse response (IR). Andersson & Hallgren (2015) showed that
    the IRs contain information about the degree of biofilm fouling. A similar approach
    was suggested by Spanjers & Olsson (1992), where a change in the time constant
    of the DO sensor was shown to be a good indication of an artificially fouled DO
    sensor. Although there are reasons to believe that the IR of an automatic air
    cleaning system can be used to detect biofilm fouling, we lack knowledge about
    the robustness and sensitivity of using the IRs to detect different levels of
    biofilm thickness. Andersson & Hallgren (2015) detected a bias in an OPT-sensor
    of −0.6 and −0.8 mg/L due to biofilm fouling during two 1-month experiments. Additional
    experiments are required to study the IRs during clean and fouled conditions in
    order to extend the knowledge about IRs for biofilm fouling detection. In this
    study, we were therefore interested to investigate: the lowest detectable bias
    due to biofilm fouling using the response time method the variations in IR patterns
    of repeated biofilm fouling procedures and at different process conditions whether
    both MEC and OPT DO sensors are applicable to bias detection with IRs. It is a
    common assumption that biofilm formation on a DO sensor affects its readings.
    As an example, Yoo et al. (2008) assumed that sludge clogging of the DO sensor
    can result in a complete sensor failure as a part of a simulation study. Hsu &
    Selvaganapathy (2013) used yeast and nutrient mixture in laboratory experiments
    to compare the effect of biofilm growth (in terms of protein absorption) on Teflon-coated
    DO sensor membranes with silicone rubber alternative. Janzen et al. (2007) found
    indications of negative drift due to biofilm fouling in a redesigned MEC-sensor
    positioned in the ocean. Carlsson & Zambrano (2016) studied how bias in DO sensors
    could be detected by comparing the air-flow ratios. There are few studies, apart
    from Andersson & Hallgren (2015), that have investigated the effect of biofilm
    fouling on DO sensors under real conditions in WWRFs. Our general understanding
    about the effects of biofilm fouling is further complicated by WRRF-specific process
    conditions, seasonal variations, and differences between sensor types and brands.
    These aspects are fundamental to understand in order to design a cost-effective
    sensor maintenance schedule. Therefore, we were also interested to study the bias
    progression due to biofilm fouling under real conditions for MEC- and OPT-type
    DO sensors. In this study, we conducted long-term experiments under full-scale
    conditions with artificial and real biofilm fouling with two sensor techniques:
    MEC and OPT DO sensors. Further, we studied the applicability of the response
    time method to detect biofilm fouling and worn-out sensor membranes. MATERIALS
    AND METHODS Listen Two experiments were conducted, one with artificial biofilm
    fouling (grease) and one with real biofilm fouling. The purpose of evaluating
    both artificial and real biofilm fouling was to study two aspects: variation in
    IRs during different process conditions and long-term time effects on IRs and
    bias from biofilm fouling. The two aspects require different studies since long-term
    studies are difficult to repeat under different conditions. Both aspects need
    to be considered to evaluate the usefulness of IRs for fouling detection. The
    experimental set-ups differed between the two experiments and are detailed in
    the following two sections. Experiment 1 – artificial biofilm fouling experiments
    in Henriksdal WRRF Listen The first experiment was conducted in Henriksdal WRRF
    with artificial biofilm fouling to investigate: the shape change of a fouled sensor''s
    IR at a small bias (<0.2 mg/L), i.e. the detection sensitivity of using IR for
    biofilm fouling detection the effect of different process conditions on the IRs,
    including varying DO and suspended solids (SS) concentration variation in the
    response time during clean and fouled conditions during repeated experiments the
    difference between MEC- and OPT-sensors in terms of a response to artificial biofilm
    fouling. The artificial biofilm fouling experiments were carried out in Henriksdal
    WRRF during summer conditions with a wastewater temperature about 19 °C. Four
    locations in the ASP, both in aerated and unaerated zones, were considered to
    study the impact of different DO concentrations. Parts of the measurements were
    conducted in the return sludge channel to study the impact of SS concentration
    on the IRs. Artificial biofilm fouling Listen In the artificial biofilm fouling
    experiments, the goal was to decide and apply a fouling substance to the DO sensor
    that fulfilled the following three criteria: It should be simple to repeatedly
    apply and remove without damaging the sensor. It should be similar to organic
    biofilm, or at least result in a small negative bias. It should remain fixed to
    the sensor during repeated air cleaning impulses. During one experiment, the fouling
    procedure consisted of the following three steps: compare test sensor measurements
    with reference DO sensors repeat IR measurements with clean test sensor manually
    foul test sensor with an artificial biofilm fouling substance and repeat IR measurements
    during fouled conditions. Sensor set-up and data collection Listen Five DO sensors
    (Cerlic O2X DUO) were connected to a data acquisition system with hardware and
    software from National Instruments, with the software LabVIEW. Data were stored
    in a PostgreSQL database in the same laptop computer. Each DO sensor could be
    switched between MEC and OPT measurement technology by simply changing the top
    part of the sensor. A photograph of the experimental equipment is given in the
    Supplementary materials (available with the online version of this paper). Two
    of the DO sensors, one OPT- and one MEC-sensor, were used to study IRs (test sensors)
    and two were used as references (both MEC-sensors). The third reference sensor
    was used as a back-up in case of a failing sensor. All sensors were mounted on
    rods according to the manufacturer''s instruction at a slight angle (5–30°) and
    at 0.5 m depth. All membranes were replaced with new ones and calibrated in the
    beginning of the experiments. The length of an air cleaning impulse was set to
    15 s at 2 bar for the two test sensors, which was expected to be sufficient to
    obtain a clear IR, even for high DO concentrations (4 mg/L). Data pre-processing
    Listen Data were sampled with 8 Hz and later down-sampled to resemble full-scale
    conditions. First, the data were low-pass filtered (anti-alias filter) and afterwards
    down-sampled to 1 Hz. Details about the data pre-processing are given in the Supplementary
    materials. A reference DO concentration was calculated from the two reference
    sensors by their weighted least squares (WLS) estimate, see for example Kay (1993).
    Then, the bias for a test sensor for a given IR was calculated as the difference
    between the test sensor and WLS estimate for the time interval between two IRs.
    Measurements Listen The measurements were conducted at two positions in the aerated
    zone, in the anoxic zone, and in the return sludge channel. At each position,
    the three-step fouling procedure was repeated multiple times. Experiment 2 – real
    biofilm fouling on a full scale in Bromma WRRF Listen In the second experiment
    conducted in Bromma WRRF, real biofilm growth was studied during 7 months to investigate:
    fault progression in terms of bias due to biofilm fouling difference in bias magnitude
    between MEC- and OPT-type sensors due to biofilm fouling sensitivity to detect
    bias using the response time of an IR variation in the response times for IRs,
    both for normal and fouled conditions impact of seasonal variations on biofilm
    growth and bias. Bromma WRRF has a conventional ASP operated at six parallel lines
    with seven zones per line. The sensors in the ASP experience severe biofilm growth
    compared to other facilities in the city. Despite the automatic air cleaning system
    in the DO sensors, manual cleaning is required and conducted between once a week
    and once a month, depending on the biofilm growth magnitude. Sensor set-up and
    data collection Listen One MEC- and one OPT-sensor were used as test sensors.
    The sensors were positioned in the ASP in zone 5 (OPT-sensor) and zone 6 (MEC-sensor)
    about 1 m from the existing DO sensors that were used as references (MEC-sensors,
    Cerlic O2x DUO). Both zones were continuously aerated, but their DO set-points
    differed slightly (4.0 mg/L in zone 5 and 3.5 mg/L in zone 6). Both test and reference
    sensors were equipped with an automatic air cleaning system, performing a cleaning
    cycle every second hour. The air pressure was set between 0.8 and 1.1 bar for
    each sensor. Both test and reference sensors in each zone were cleaned simultaneously
    so that their initial DO concentration would be equal. Data from test and reference
    sensors were stored in the existing process database with 1 s sampling time. Measurements
    Listen Each experimental period consisted of monitoring the biofilm growth on
    two test sensors until both received a bias larger than 0.3 mg/L. The bias was
    calculated as the mean difference in DO concentration between the reference and
    test sensor during the period bounded by two consecutive IRs, i.e. 2 hour mean
    values. The reference sensors were manually cleaned and inspected in addition
    to the automatic air cleaning, which was assumed to be sufficient to remove biofilm
    growth on the reference sensor. We expected a time between 1 and 4 weeks to obtain
    a bias above 0.3 mg/L in the test sensor. Software calculations and data availability
    Listen The response time of an IR was defined as the time to reach 63% of the
    peak amplitude, see Figure 1(a) for an illustration. The initial DO concentration
    was calculated as the average DO concentration 5 s before the IR. A short function
    computing the response time is provided in the Supplementary materials. All calculations
    and data pre-processing were performed off-line in MATLAB. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE (a) Ten IRs from a non-faulty MEC-sensor (solid grey lines) and the estimation
    of the response time for one of the curves (dashed black line). All IRs were normalised
    by subtracting the initial DO concentration of its IR for illustrative purposes.
    The response time (RT) is indicated as the time from the start of the cleaning
    procedure (time after impulse = 0) to reach 63% of the peak value. (b) Correlation
    between the initial DO concentration and the IR rise magnitude of clean MEC-sensors.
    The straight line, which is the least squares fit, indicates a small negative
    correlation (−0.29mg/L per 1mg/L). The pre-processed data from both artificial
    and real biofilm growth experiments are available at www.ivl.se/english/startpage/pages/publications

    The results from the experiments in Henriksdal and Bromma WRRFs are described
    in separate sections. Experiment 1 – artificial biofilm fouling experiments in
    Henriksdal WRRF Listen The results include illustrations of the selected artificial
    biofilm fouling substance, motivation for discarding experimental data, and graphs
    showing variations in IRs during non-faulty and different faulty conditions. A
    wide variety of fouling agents were evaluated. A mixture of ball-bearing grease
    and floating grease from the pre-sedimentation fulfilled the three criteria for
    artificial biofilm fouling described in the ‘Materials and methods’ section. Both
    MEC- and OPT-sensors obtained a negative bias when fouled with the grease mixture.
    The same effect was seen for the OPT-sensor with organic biofilm fouling (Andersson
    & Hallgren 2015). Similarly, our own (unpublished) experience suggests that a
    completely fouled MEC-sensor displays 0 mg/L, thus a negative bias as well. Photos
    of artificially fouled sensors can be compared with real biofilm fouling in Figure
    2. Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE (a) Artificially fouled MEC-sensor with a
    mixture of ball-bearing grease and pre-sedimentation grease before an experimental
    procedure (24 July 2015). (b) MEC- and (c) OPT-sensor after repeated air cleaning

    resulted in a partly cleaned MEC-sensor in (b). Different stages of biofilm fouling
    on MEC-sensor (d–f) and OPT-sensor (g). Fouling time: (d) 12 days (18 October),
    (e) 27 days (14 November), (f) 62 days (19 December), and (g) 62 days (19 December).
    Note that the biofilm starts to grow in the circular gap between the sensor and
    the sensor body (d), and further expands over the entire sensor and rod (e, f).
    During the experimental start, the OPT-sensor was damaged and data from the OPT-sensor
    were not further considered. Instead, both test sensors were of MEC type which
    allowed the simultaneous comparison of fouled and clean MEC-sensors. A majority
    of the fouling procedures for the MEC test sensor resulted in the desired bias
    magnitude between 0 and 0.2 mg/L with clear IRs. However, for two of the initial
    fouling procedures, the average bias was larger (−1.7 and −0.35 mg/L). Similarly,
    a negative bias between −0.27 and −0.51 mg/L was also seen for the clean test
    sensor during the same time period. The data were studied in detail, which revealed
    that part of the bias was an effect of large variations in the reference measurements
    (see the Supplementary materials, available with the online version of this paper).
    Since it was not possible to explain the reason for the variations, data with
    an absolute bias larger than 0.2 mg/L were not further evaluated. Also, seven
    IRs showed deviating shape with double peaks. Those IRs were discarded and removed
    from the normal dataset. The double peak behaviour was noticed after repeated
    manual fouling and subsequent cleaning, which could have affected the membrane.
    The potentially damaged membrane was replaced after noticing the double peak behaviour.
    The remaining data were pre-processed and the IRs were extracted from the pre-processed
    data and grouped according to their status (normal or fouled). This resulted in
    50 normal IRs and 2,628 IRs for fouled conditions. Variations in IRs during normal
    conditions Listen Well-defined IRs were obtained for the MEC-sensor. A typical
    set of IRs at non-faulty conditions are shown in Figure 1. The rise magnitude
    variation (the difference between initial and maximum DO concentration during
    one IR) was about 0.5 mg/L (Figure 1(a)). Part of this variation was a consequence
    of a changing initial DO concentration (Figure 1(b)). Identification of common
    sensor faults Listen In addition to the artificial biofilm fouling, accidental
    faults occurred over the experimental period, common faults that could happen
    during everyday operations. The accidental faults resulted in distinct changes
    in the IRs, specific to the different accidental faults. The mean of the faulty
    IRs are visualised in Figure 3. Figure 3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Mean MEC-sensor
    IRs for: (a) fouled membrane (grease mixture); mean IR of fouled test data (black
    solid and dashed lines, n = 2,628), (b) low air pressure during the automatic
    air cleaning procedure (n = 9), (c) the effect of increasing the SS from 2,500mg/L
    (normal SS, n = 9) to 8,500mg/L (high SS, n = 10), (d) a potential gradual wear-out
    effect by repeated IRs on a fouled MEC-sensor; an increased wear-out of the membrane
    is indicated by darker grey (n = 2,180), (e) a mechanically perforated membrane
    during manual cleaning (n = 2), (f) the effect of using harsh cleaning liquid
    to remove excess grease (n = 98); the air cleaning impulse was between time 20
    and 35s. Fouling the MEC-sensor with grease mixture resulted in a dampened IR
    with an extended time to regain the original DO concentration (Figure 3(a), solid
    and dashed black lines). The small tweak during the impulse rise was not a typical
    pattern, but was merely an effect of combining IRs with two different shapes:
    one part of the dataset of the fouled IRs displayed a ‘double peak behaviour’
    similar to Figure 3(d), whereas one set had a straight increase with dampened
    IRs similar to Figure 3(b). In the end of the experimental period, a long-term
    test for 11 days was conducted, where the MEC-sensor was fouled and subject to
    repeated cleaning events about 200 times per day. This was far more than the recommended
    amount of cleaning procedures, which resulted in a gradual change of the IR, potentially
    due to wearing out the membrane (Figure 3(d)). It is interesting that the shape
    of the IR changed from a dampened IR to exhibit an increasingly pronounced double
    peak behaviour. A double peak was also seen for the damaged membrane (perforated
    during manual cleaning) (Figure 3(e)). We have no clear explanation for the double
    peaks although they were present more frequently in faulty data, especially where
    the membrane was mechanically damaged. The first peak coincided with the duration
    of the air cleaning impulse whereas the second peak was delayed compared to a
    normal IR. A decreased air pressure for the automatic air cleaning system resulted
    in a dampened peak (Figure 3(b)). Measurements in the return sludge channel with
    high SS only indicated a slight increase in the peak height of the same order
    of magnitude as the normal variation (compare Figures 1 and 3(c)). This indicates
    that the SS-level had none or minor impact on the IR. A large increase of the
    IR''s peak value after cleaning the MEC-sensor with harsh cleaning liquid (Figure
    3(f)) indicates that the membrane became more sensitive. Experiment 2 – real biofilm
    fouling experiments in Bromma WRRF Listen The results show the impact of biofilm
    fouling on bias progression and the correlation with IR response time values.
    Further, variations in the response time values for clean sensors are shown together
    with the impact on the IRs of damaged sensors. Finally, uncertainties in the results
    due to sensor maintenance during the experiments are detailed. Bias progression
    due to biofilm fouling Listen Different stages of biofilm-growth fouled sensors
    can be seen in Figure 2 with resulting bias progression in Figure 4. Figure 4
    VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Bias and response time values during experimental periods
    1–6 in Bromma WRRF for (a) optical sensor (OPT) and (b) membrane sensor (MEC).
    Manual cleaning of reference sensor is indicated with dashed vertical lines. The
    bias progression differed between the MEC- and OPT-sensors in several aspects
    (top graphs in Figure 4(a) and 4(b)). Firstly, the OPT-sensor had an increasing
    bias in all six periods in contrast to the MEC-sensor, which mainly had a decreasing
    bias (period 1, 2, and 5). Secondly, the bias magnitude was larger for the OPT-sensor
    compared to the MEC-sensor. Lastly, the OPT-sensor showed a transition in bias
    progression from linear to exponential increasing after 10–14 days during period
    1–3 and after 28 days during period 4–5. The MEC-sensor showed a linear bias trend
    throughout all periods. Note also that the bias in the OPT-sensor temporarily
    decreased after reaching a large value (above 2–3 mg/L) in period 2–5. Bias detection
    with the response time estimation method Listen The changes in response times
    due to bias (bottom graphs in Figure 4(a) and 4(b)) were not as evident as expected.
    For the OPT-sensor, there was a clear change in period 2–5 for bias larger than
    1 mg/L and a correlation between bias and the response time values was identified
    (see details in the Supplementary materials). For the MEC-sensor, there was no
    obvious change in response time that correlated to the bias magnitude in any of
    the periods (Figure 4(b)). Only a slight increase in the variance for the response
    time values in period 2 (days 15–20) and period 5 (days 35–60) was indicated.
    Variations in response time values Listen Surprisingly, the response times also
    changed for the reference sensors during the experiments. Firstly, a small trend
    of decreasing response times with about 1 s per 30 days can be seen for the OPT-sensor''s
    reference (period 1–3) and for the MEC-sensor''s reference (period 1–2). This
    is similar to the artificial biofilm fouling experiments where the MEC-sensor
    had a decreasing response time during the wearing-out experiment (Figure 3(d)).
    A similar decrease can also be noted for the OPT test sensor by comparing the
    response times during the first days in each test period (period 1–5). Note that
    there is an opposite trend with increasing response time values for the OPT-sensor''s
    reference and for the MEC test sensor (period 4–6). Secondly, the new MEC-sensor''s
    reference had larger variations in its response time values, with a large increase
    in variation during period 5–6. The OPT-sensor had in general a smaller response
    time than the MEC-sensors (recall that all reference sensors were MEC-sensors).
    Note also that the MEC sensors had different response times at clean conditions
    with new membranes. The response time values for the OPT test sensor in period
    6 deviated considerably from previous periods. The reason was an accidental kink
    in the air supply hose that blocked the air supply to the sensor''s air cleaning
    system, disabling all IRs after period 5. The estimated response time values were
    therefore randomly obtained. At the same time, its reference sensor was instead
    given a surplus of air resulting in an increase in IR peak value (see the Supplementary
    materials). Surprisingly, there was no large change in the response time for the
    reference sensor (Figure 4(a), period 6) despite the increased air flow and pressure.
    Damaged sensors Listen After the final experimental period, both test sensors
    were deliberately damaged to study mechanically worn-out sensors. The MEC-sensor''s
    membrane was perforated with a needle and later with a screw driver and the OPT-sensor''s
    fluorophore coating was scratched with an iron brush. Photos of the damaged sensors
    together with corresponding IRs are provided in the Supplementary materials. For
    the MEC-sensor, both the needle and screwdriver perforation resulted in a double
    peak behavior as was seen in Figure 3(d), although with a smaller initial peak
    than previously observed. About half of the IRs with needle perforation showed
    a dip instead of a double peak. There was only a minor change in bias due to the
    perforation events (before perforation 0.37 mg/L, after needle perforation 0.49
    mg/L, and after screwdriver perforation 0.42 mg/L). For the OPT-sensor, the IRs
    maintained a one-peak shape characterised by decreasing response time values with
    increasing amount of scratches. The first scratches did not result in any bias
    change although the following scratches, which removed >50% of the fluorophore
    coating, resulted in a large negative bias (before scratching −0.54 mg/L, after
    first scratching −0.51 mg/L, and after second scratching −1.54 mg/L). Sensor maintenance
    Listen After period 2, a new membrane was installed in the MEC reference sensor.
    The existing membrane was moved to the OPT-sensor reference sensor. The reason
    for replacing the membrane already after 2 months was to assure that the observed
    small bias was an effect of biofilm fouling and drift in the test sensor, and
    not of a drift in the reference sensor. In period 3, the MEC test sensor showed
    a segmented line with both increasing and decreasing bias trends within the segments.
    The cause of the segmentation was the manual cleaning of the reference sensor
    (vertical dashed lines), which coincides with the line segments (Figure 4(b),
    period 3). Since the bias changed when the reference sensor was cleaned, this
    indicates that the reference was also affected by biofilm fouling. This was not
    seen in the remaining periods where a weekly cleaning interval seemed to be sufficient.
    For period 3, it is therefore hard to draw conclusions about the bias direction
    since we are not certain whether it was the reference or test sensor (both of
    MEC type) that was actually drifting. In addition, the last three manual cleanings
    were conducted during the vacation period by personnel unfamiliar with the experiments.
    This resulted in an uncertainty as to whether only the reference sensor or both
    the test and reference sensors were manually cleaned. The third last cleaning
    (day 21 for MEC-sensor and day 12 for OPT-sensor) introduced a change in bias,
    similar to what would be expected after cleaning the test sensor. In addition,
    the exact time locations for the last three manual cleaning events were not obtained,
    but only the actual date. Therefore, these cleanings were marked at 12:00 and
    should be interpreted with a +/− 4 hours'' uncertainty. DISCUSSION Listen The
    outcomes of Experiment 1 (artificial biofilm fouling) and Experiment 2 (biofilm
    fouling) are discussed and compared with existing results. Further, implications
    of the findings are discussed with the perspective of using IRs for fault detection
    on a full-scale application. This includes the aspects of bias progression linked
    to sensor maintenance, DO process control, and factors with an impact on the IRs
    and their potential limitations on a full-scale fault detection and diagnosis
    application. Bias progression in oxygen sensors due to biofilm fouling Listen
    The purpose of using grease in the artificial biofilm fouling experiments was
    to resemble organic biofilm growth. The results showed that the MEC-sensor received
    a negative bias for both artificial and real biofilm foulings. However, the effect
    on the IRs was larger for small bias with grease compared to the real biofilm.
    It is hard to find a good explanation for the difference. Although we can intuitively
    expect that grease resulted in a denser film compared to a water-permeable biofilm,
    which may have contributed to the difference. For the OPT-sensor, all real experiments
    resulted in a positive bias, which is in contrast to the results by Andersson
    & Hallgren (2015). Despite the difference in bias direction, the detection sensitivities
    were in the same range (1.0 mg/L compared to 0.6–0.8 mg/L in the previous study).
    The OPT-sensor had in addition a faster increase in bias than the MEC-sensor.
    No results for the MEC-sensor were reported by Andersson & Hallgren (2015), but
    their unpublished data suggest that the bias was small for the MEC, in contrast
    to the OPT-sensor, which is in agreement with this study. A potential explanation
    for the large impact on OPT-sensor is that the small fluorophore area was more
    easily covered by biofilm, compared to the larger membrane area in the MEC sensor
    (compare Figure 2(g) with Figure 2(f)). Additional studies are needed to verify
    whether this is valid in general or only for the specific sensor brand in this
    study. Future studies should compare parallel treatment lines and different WRRFs
    as this may contribute to variations in a biofilm growth. As expected, both sensor
    types had a faster bias increase during summer conditions compared to winter conditions.
    However the magnitude of this seasonal effect was larger than expected. The time
    to reach a bias of 0.3 mg/L was less than 1 week for the OPT-sensor during summer
    conditions, and beyond 60 days for the MEC-sensor during winter time. The large
    span shows the importance of designing an adaptive sensor cleaning schedule when
    compared to a fixed interval of 1 or 2 weeks, which is common practice today.
    Oxygen sensor bias implications for process control Listen As seen from a process
    control perspective, knowledge about the bias progression is important. That is,
    does a fouled sensor result in a positive or negative bias, or even alternate
    between the two? When a DO sensor is used in a feedback control loop (which is
    de facto standard), a bias in the sensor will lead to different consequences depending
    on the bias direction, the controller structure, and the controlled process. Consider
    a MEC sensor with a strictly negative bias that is operating in a feedback loop
    with a fixed DO set-point. The true DO concentration will be underestimated resulting
    in excess air supply with a higher DO concentration than desired. Consider instead
    the same MEC-sensor but in an ammonium cascade controller where the effluent ammonium
    adjusts the DO set-point. In such a situation, the exact DO concentration will
    be less important since the bias will be partly compensated for by the DO set-point
    given by the ammonium master controller. The opposite argumentation applies for
    a strictly positive bias as was indicated for the OPT-sensor. Whether a positive
    or negative drift direction is bad or worse depend on the process configuration.
    This raises the question whether the most likely bias direction for a specific
    sensor should be included in the early process design. Factors affecting the impulse
    responses and response time values Listen One of the questions in this study was
    to investigate the impact of changed process conditions on the IRs and the corresponding
    response time values. This was mainly conducted for the MEC-sensor due to the
    damaged OPT-sensor in Experiment 1. Some of the factors, such as varied SS or
    initial DO concentration, were well studied during the artificial biofilm fouling
    experiments, but the interpretation of normal variations in response time values
    remains uncertain. The main problem was that the response time values differed
    between the clean MEC-sensors. The variation in response time values for the new
    membrane in the MEC-sensor''s reference sensor in period 3 was larger than for
    the other MEC-sensors. In addition, it was not possible to define the cause of
    the long-term small change in response time values with both decreasing and increasing
    values. As seen in the artificial experiments, decreasing response time values
    could be a consequence of wearing out the membrane, but the results in Experiment
    2 indicate that the decrease could equally well be related to a temperature, seasonal,
    or unknown effects. Only a few sensor individuals were used in the study, which
    raises the question whether some of the noted changes are effects of variation
    among sensor individuals. Note that it is not clear from the results whether variations
    in the IR and its related response time are due to factors that are independent
    of sensor bias or, for example, seasonal effects that only affect the dynamics
    of the IR. Future studies should therefore study potential seasonal effects in
    the response time as well as multiple parallel sensors to distinguish variations
    in sensor individuals from general effects. In future studies it is also important
    to avoid ambiguities in bias estimation about whether it is the reference sensor,
    test sensor or both that are affected by biofilm fouling. Regular checks of the
    sensor reading in known zero-valued and saturated oxygen conditions should be
    used as supplement to the reference measurements. Fault detection and diagnosis
    based on impulse responses Listen The lowest detectable bias with the response
    time method was larger than the desired 0.3 mg/L. It is therefore interesting
    to further study if other fault detection algorithms can improve the detection
    sensitivity. Based on the bias progression, biofilm fouling detection would be
    most valuable during summer condition when the biofilm growth is fast with a high
    likelihood of obtaining a bias. Summer is also the time of year when personal
    resources may be restricted due to vacations; furthermore, ammonium effluent permits
    can be stricter in summer than during winter time (in Sweden). Therefore, automatic
    biofilm fouling detection in DO sensors has the largest potential to improve process
    treatment during summer time. The results also showed that the IRs contained information
    about different faults including: reduced air supply in the air cleaning system
    of the sensors and damaged sensor membrane. These faults gave rise to distinct
    pattern changes in the IRs, fault signatures, extending the possibility of fault
    detection to diagnosis. Most importantly, double peaks were evident in both Experiment
    1 and 2. By studying unpublished data in the study by Andersson & Hallgren (2015),
    we noted that both the double peak behaviour (Figure 3(d)) and the extreme peaks
    (Figure 3(f)) were present in that dataset. The results suggest that a double
    peak indicates a damaged membrane, although the size of the first peak differed
    for different wearing or perforation causes. We have no physical explanation for
    the double peaks, although it seems like the first peak is aligned with the 20
    s long air cleaning phase. As repeated perforation experiments are costly, the
    existence and occurrence of double peaks should be evaluated on a full scale,
    studying a more natural occurrence of double peaks. An important question to answer
    is how early before complete sensor failure a double peak arises. CONCLUSIONS
    Listen The results have improved our knowledge of how biofilm fouling impacts
    the data quality of DO sensors. The bias progression speed due to biofilm fouling
    differed between sensor types, which needs to be considered in fall-back strategies
    for process control. In addition, the bias progression was faster during summer
    conditions compared to winter conditions. The results could be used to design
    effective sensor maintenance routines and to detect and diagnose sensor faults.
    This is a step towards an increased robust wastewater treatment with decreased
    environmental impact. The results showed that IRs and related response time values
    contained information about the status of both MEC- and OPT-sensors. Bias due
    to biofilm fouling was detected for bias above 1 mg/L in OPT-sensor but not for
    values up to 0.8 mg/L in the MEC-sensor. Surprisingly, changes in the pattern
    of IRs were matched to common sensor faults in the MEC-sensor, suggesting that
    such fault signatures can be used for fault diagnosis. The OPT-sensor was affected
    by biofilm growth to a greater extent than the MEC-sensor, with a positive bias
    compared to the MEC-sensor with mainly a negative bias. Without manual cleaning
    or fault detection, it is likely that a DO-controlled process will be operated
    at a different (unknown) DO concentration than desired, especially when an OPT-sensor
    is used. Whether this is a general draw-back for the OPT-sensor compared to the
    MEC-sensor or not should be studied in future studies. Future studies should also
    consider the following questions. Can other fault detection methods be applied
    to the IRs and improve the bias detection sensitivity? Which type of faults can
    be diagnosed based on IR data, and which fault diagnosis methods are suitable
    for this task? What is the normal variation in response time values and shapes
    of IRs with respect to seasonal variations, among multiple sensor individuals
    of the same brand, and in relation to sensor bias? ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Listen The

  description: 'Automatic fault detection is becoming increasingly important in wastewater
    treatment plant operation, given the stringent treatment standards and the need
    to protect the investment costs from the potential damage of an unchecked fault
    propagating through the plant. This paper describes the development of a real-time
    Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) system based on an adaptive Principal Component
    Analysis (PCA) algorithm, used to compare the current plant operation with a correct
    performance model based on a reference data set and the output of three ion-specific
    sensors (Hach-Lange gmbh, Düsseldorf, Germany): two Nitratax® NOx UV sensors,
    in the denitrification tank and downstream of the oxidation tanks, where an Amtax®
    ammonium-N sensor was also installed. The algorithm was initially developed in
    the Matlab environment and then ported into the LabView 8.20 (National Instruments,
    Austin, TX, USA) platform for real-time operation using a compact Field Point
    ®, a Programmable Automation Controller by National Instruments. The FDI was tested
    with a large set of operational data with 1 min sampling time from August 2007
    through May 2008 from a full-scale plant. After describing the real-time version
    of the PCA algorithm, this was tested with nine months of operational data which
    were sequentially processes by the algorithm in order to simulate an on-line operation.
    The FDI performance was assessed by organizing the sequential data in two differing
    moving windows: a short-horizon window to test the response to single malfunctions
    and a longer time-horizon to simulate multiple unrepaired failures. In both cases
    the algorithm performance was very satisfactory, with a 100% failure detection
    in the short window case, which decreased to 84% in the long window setting. The
    short-window performance was very effective in isolating sensor failures and short
    duration disturbances such as spikes, whereas the long term horizon provided accurate
    detection of long-term drifts and proved robust enough to allow for some delay
    in failure recovery. The system robustness is based on the use of multiple statistics
    which proved instrumental in discriminating among the various causes of malfunctioning.

    with 1 min sampling time from August 2007 through May 2008 from a full-scale plant.
    After describing the real-time version of the PCA algorithm, this was tested with
    nine months of operational data which were sequentially processes by the algorithm
    in order to simulate an on-line operation. The FDI performance was assessed by
    organizing the sequential data in two differing moving windows: a short-horizon
    window to test the response to single malfunctions and a longer time-horizon to
    simulate multiple unrepaired failures. In both cases the algorithm performance
    was very satisfactory, with a 100% failure detection in the short window case,
    which decreased to 84% in the long window setting. The short-window performance
    was very effective in isolating sensor failures and short duration disturbances
    such as spikes, whereas the long term horizon provided accurate detection of long-term
    drifts and proved robust enough to allow for some delay in failure recovery. The
    system robustness is based on the use of multiple statistics which proved instrumental
    in discriminating among the various causes of malfunctioning. This content is

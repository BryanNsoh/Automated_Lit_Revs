  description: Irrigation is an important factor that affects crop yield. In order
    to control irrigation of facility crops more effectively and accurately, this
    study took "Zhangji" strawberry as an example, introduced crop real-time growth
    characteristics into irrigation decision-making, and combined Penman-Monteith
    (P-M) model and knowledge reasoning to study the irrigation of strawberry. In
    the first step, the influencing factors and expert experience in identifying strawberry
    growth period of "Zhangji" strawberry irrigation were standardized, and the strawberry
    irrigation data structure based on Resource Description Framework (RDF) was established.
    The second step was to collect expert experience of strawberry irrigation according
    to the standardized knowledge structure model. Firstly, all data were unified
    into structured data, and then were stored in *.csv format together with expert
    experience, and strawberry irrigation knowledge map based on Neo4j was constructed.
    The third step was to collect the environmental data and plant data of strawberry
    in each growth period. The fourth step was using P-M model to calculate the initial
    irrigation value of strawberry, and then adjusted the initial irrigation value
    by knowledge reasoning.The fifth step was to conduct experimental planting and
    evaluate the sampled fruits. In knowledge reasoning, irrigation adjustment strategies
    of each expert was different. In strawberry irrigation experiment based on P-M
    model and path sorting algorithm, a group of irrigation reasoning values with
    the highest probability value were selected to adjust irrigation with the goal
    of maximizing strawberry yield. The experimental results showed that under the
    condition of harvesting at a specified time, The total fruit yield, average fruit
    yield per plant and average fruit weight percentage increased by 2478.5 g, 20.65
    g and 12.15% (average fruit weight increased by 1.65 g per fruit) based on P-M
    model and path sorting algorithm compared with traditional P-M model, respectively.
    First, on the basis of P-M model, the yield-first irrigation adjustment strategy
    was adopted. Based on knowledge reasoning, the irrigation frequency and amount
    were adjusted timely according to the crop growth situation, which improved the
    yield. Second, under the condition of harvesting and recording yield at a specified
    time, the experiment accurately controlled the growth period to ensure early fruit
    ripening, while the other three groups of fruits were not fully mature and the
    yield of immature fruits were not calculated. Under the method of strawberry irrigation
    based on Penman-Monteith model and path sorting algorithm, the fruit was picked
    within a fixed time and reached 0.39 kg/cm2, which increased by 0.1 kg/cm2. Because
    the planting goal of this study was yield first, only the influence of irrigation
    on yield was considered. The experimental resulted show that the irrigation method
    based on model and knowledge reasoning could improve the yield of strawberry,
    and can provide a new idea for precise irrigation.

    agricultural activities more economically efficient has always been one of the
    main objectives throughout human agrarian history. However, this objective has
    not been achieved to the desired level due to the difficulty in establishing quality/cost
    balance. To get quality products, agricultural production areas need to be visited
    frequently, thus, it may be possible to affect all necessary precautions during
    crop production. As farmers spend time and resources on each visit, they increase
    the cost of the crop. Smart agriculture has become necessary, given that farmers
    spend much of their time monitoring and evaluating their crops. “Internet of things”
    (IoT)-based technologies offer remote and precise monitoring, making managing
    crops not only smart but also cost-effective [1]. However, real-time monitoring
    of agricultural activities is not enough to make agriculture smart. Smart agriculture
    should follow the cycle of observation, diagnosis, decision, and action. In this
    continuously repeating cycle, data should be collected and used quickly to make
    changes that optimize the farming process. During the observation phase, data
    can be obtained and recorded using sensors capturing features from natural resources
    like crops, livestock, atmosphere, soils, water, and biodiversity. During the
    diagnostic phase, the sensor values are transmitted to a cloud-hosted IoT platform
    based on predefined decision models that determine the state of the object under
    investigation. During the decision phase, the components based on machine learning
    techniques determine whether an action is required. During the action phase, the
    end-user evaluates the situation and applies the action. Then the cycle starts
    all over again [2]. In this century, it is not enough to have a passion for agriculture
    to be a farmer. Farmers need expert knowledge in agriculture, law, economics,
    accounting, and data analysis to achieve sustainable agriculture [3]. Since in
    some regions the majority of agricultural enterprises consist of family farms,
    an expectation of high levels of expertise is not realistic [4]. In the 20th century,
    in most regions, growers continued to follow established farming methods, using
    more fertilizers and pesticides, causing irreversible effects on the environment
    [1]. With consciousness-raising, it became known that every plant should be treated
    by determining the need of plant, instead of dealing with every farm and crop
    in the same way. In recent years, farmers have increasingly sought the advice
    of experts, which is not always affordable. With the intelligent agricultural
    system consisting of IoT and machine learning techniques, it is possible for farmers
    to get such advice at an affordable price. These systems use the most advanced
    methods to automate crop monitoring and thus require minimum human intervention
    [4]. SECTION II. Deep Learning In the early days of artificial intelligence, it
    was discovered that mentally challenging problems for humans were simple for computers
    as long as they could be described as a list of mathematical and logical rules.
    As the field of artificial intelligence expands and evolves, to benefit from the
    experience, to recognize sound and image, and to make intuitive decisions became
    the focuses of research [5, p. 1]. Machine learning, which is a sub-branch of
    artificial intelligence, uses a self-learning approach to derive meaning from
    presented data. Instead of manually creating rules by analyzing large amounts
    of data, machine learning gradually improves prediction performance by capturing
    information in the data. This approach provides a more effective solution that
    can make evidence-based decisions [6, p. 2]. Machine learning, to extract meaningful
    relationships from data, uses learning rules such as supervised learning, unsupervised
    learning, reinforced learning, and hybrid learning [7]. Deep learning is a type
    of machine learning that uses artificial neural network principles. Deep networks
    are distinguished from neural networks by their depth. Before the big-data age,
    most machine learning techniques have been used in shallow architecture. These
    architectures generally consist of up to one or two layers containing nonlinear
    transformations. Shallow architectures are effective in solving well-structured
    problems, but they are inadequate for more complex real-world data applications
    such as images, human speech, natural voice, and language. With deep learning,
    it became possible to process these data [8, p. 205]. Single-layer artificial
    neural networks, which have been used as shallow architecture since the 1940s,
    lack the ability to process such data. Deeper architectures were needed to process
    more complex data. After the successful training of complex neural networks in
    the 1980s, it became possible to use neural networks effectively. This paved the
    way for designing more complex and deeper architectures. Since the application
    of neural networks has increased, it has gone through many changes. Currently,
    neural networks that use deep learning are of great interest [9, p. 165]. As its
    name suggests, artificial neural networks are computational networks that imitate
    the networks of nerve cells in the central nervous system [10, p. 1]. Simple processing
    units called artificial neurons, which communicate with each other, form an artificial
    neural network [11, p. 15]. The artificial neuron, after receiving binary or floating-point
    input from one or more sources, multiplies and aggregates with weights. The resulting
    total is transferred to the activation function to be transmitted to the output.
    Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of an artificial neuron [9, p. 31].
    FIGURE 1. A schematic representation of an artificial neuron [81]. Show All The
    data obtained from the output layer of one artificial unit can feed the input
    layer of the other artificial unit. The inputs are represented like x 1 , x 2
    , x 3 ,… x n as mathematical expressions [12]. The weights show how strongly the
    incoming data are transmitted to the output via the inputs. The mathematical expression
    of weights is shown as w 1 , w 2 , w 3 ,… w n [13, p. 8]. The sum function produces
    net input by correlating each input value with the weights. The most commonly
    used addition function is the sum of each incoming input multiplied by its own
    weight. The mathematical form of the addition function is defined as [14]: NetInput=∑
    w i x i = w 1 x 1 + w 2 x 2 +…+ w i x i (1) View Source The activation function
    sets limits for the output of the artificial nerve unit. Linear, threshold, sigmoid,
    hyperbolic, tangent, and softmax functions are the most commonly used activation
    functions. The selection of the activation function affects the data transmitted
    to the output [9, p. 48]. In feed-forward networks, the output is a value determined
    by the activation function, sent to another cell or outside world. In feedback
    networks, feedback is made by transmitting the output value to the input at the
    same time [12]. Assuming that in the learning process of the neural network, the
    desired output of the network is y and the network produces output y ^ , the difference
    between the predicted output and the desired output is y ^ -y. The difference
    value is converted to a metric known as the loss function (J) [15]. When the neural
    network makes too many errors, the loss is high, and when it makes fewer errors,
    it becomes low. The purpose of the training process is to determine the weight
    that minimizes the loss function in the training set [15]. During the training
    process, having a sufficient amount of data is important for the success of the
    network. With the development of the Internet, it has become easy to provide the
    amount of data required for training artificial neural networks. Large amounts
    of data provide an opportunity of developing many approaches to improve the learning
    performance of artificial neural networks. One of these approaches is the deep
    learning approach. An artificial neural network with more than one hidden layer
    is defined as a deep network and the learning style it exhibits is called deep
    learning [8, p. 206]. However, experimental studies have shown that it is more
    difficult to train deep architectures than shallow architectures. For example,
    as the architecture deepens the “local minimum” or “vanishing gradient” problem
    becomes more evident. Besides, as the architecture deepens, the training period
    takes more time. To overcome such problems in deep architectures, new solutions
    have been proposed in the literature [16, p. 34]. A rectified linear unit (ReLU)
    that produces particularly useful experimental results despite its simple structure
    became widely adopted with deep learning. The ReLU activation function is defined
    as f(x)=max(0,x) . It gives zero for negative values and increases linearly for
    positive values [17, p. 68]. This activation function brings the predictions closer
    to the desired output more quickly. ReLU the activation function is considered
    an advantageous function in deep networks because it is relatively easy to calculate
    and does not suffer from the vanishing gradient problem due to its shape [15].
    However, the ReLU activation function also has some disadvantages, later leaky
    ReLU, softplus, PReLU, ELU, swish activation functions were developed to overcome
    these disadvantages. In deep networks to reduce training time and not to be trapped
    in a local minimum, several optimization techniques were developed [5]. Commonly
    used optimization algorithms in deep learning are the gradient descent algorithm
    and its faster version the gradient descent algorithm with momentum. Efforts to
    improve these algorithms led to the development of algorithms such as Nesterov
    accelerated gradient, Adadelta, AdaMax, Adam, Nadam, Adagrad, AMSGrad, RMSprop
    [18]. The challenges mentioned above are just a part of the work that should be
    done when deeper networks are used. Model selection is always a major challenge
    in deep networks because the model should be selected in such a way that it fits
    sufficiently. Inadequate compliance or overfitting of the model’s data structure
    significantly influences predictions. To prevent problems such as inadequate learning
    and overfitting of the network, a trade-off between bias and variance is required
    [19, p. 102]. To solve the problem of over-fitting, more data can be collected
    to change the model. If data collection is not possible, the existing training
    set can be enhanced by data augmentation techniques [20]. In addition to data
    enhancement, terminating training early also solves overfitting problems. By looking
    at the performance of the validation set, the training should be stopped as soon
    as a decline occurs. To reduce the overfitting of the network it is also possible
    to apply regulation or dropout methods [21, p. 25]. SECTION III. Method The bibliographic
    analysis in the domain based on databases of the Science Citation Index (SCI)
    included full-text papers published in peer-reviewed journals. A keyword-based
    search for these papers was done by using search terms, “deep learning”, and “agriculture
    or farming”. Through that query, 133 papers were obtained. Articles containing
    keywords “deep learning” but not related to the agricultural area have been eliminated.
    As a result of this search, 133 articles were identified, initially. Some articles
    were excluded due to the lack of meaningful findings and the initial number of
    papers was reduced to 130. Then review papers were excluded from the scope of
    the study, and the final number of papers was 120. After collection of related
    work, a detailed review, and analysis of this work were undertaken. Considering
    the following research questions, the 120 papers selected were analyzed individually:
    What are the topics, where deep learning is implemented in the agriculture domain?
    What are the problems they addressed? What approaches were employed to solve the
    problems? What are sources of data used? What is the benefit of deep learning
    relative to other solutions? SECTION IV. Results In the Appendices, a list of
    the 120 reviewed works is given, indicating the research domain, problem the research
    address, proposed methods for the solution, and sources of data used. The summary
    tables obtained from analyzes are given in Appendix A. The highest number of deep-learning-based
    agriculture-relevant papers on the database of the SCI appeared in 2019 (76) and
    there were no papers before 2016. The time trend analysis given in Table 1, displays
    the eight most productive countries. With its rapidly growing publications in
    2019, China was a leader throughout the period. Similarly, the growth rate of
    publications in the USA was much faster than the other six predominant countries.
    As shown in Table 1, the distribution of the topics focused in all countries is
    almost equal, expect papers by Chinese authors that concentrate on topics such
    as disease detection (6), land cover identification (6), object recognition (6),
    pest recognition (5), plant classification (4), and precision livestock farming
    (8). As shown in Table 2, those topics appear to be the most common topics. Therefore,
    it seems that China determines the trend of deep-learning-based agriculturally-relevant
    studies. TABLE 1 The Most Productive Countries During 2016 – 2019 TABLE 2 The
    Most Productive Subjects During 2016 - 2019 The full list of those topics obtained
    from the analysis of 120 articles for the deep-learning-based agriculture domain
    is given in Table 2. Disease detection and plant classification are the most common
    topics, with 19 records, followed by land cover identification with 18 records,
    and precision livestock farming with 13 records. Table 3 was created to obtain
    information about the number of authors per article. Of the 120 papers, 48 (40%)
    were written by teams consisting of up to three authors whereas the remaining
    72 (60%) were written by teams consisting of four or more authors. Algorithms
    created for deep learning study are complex and obtaining suitable data is also
    a laborious process, so it is natural that articles were written with the contribution
    of large teams. One hundred and thirteen papers (94%) were written by teams consisting
    of up to six authors. Notably, four articles of the remaining seven are written
    by Chinese authors. Especially the article written with a team of 14 authors is
    noteworthy. TABLE 3 Number of Authors Per Article for the Most Productive Countries
    A total of 39 journals published papers in this area during 2016-2019. The distribution
    of the 120 papers across these journals is given in Table 4 and shows that more
    than 63% of the deep-learning-based agriculture-relevant articles appear in the
    three journals. TABLE 4 The Most Productive Journals During 2016 - 2019 Computers
    and Electronics in Agriculture is the journal with the most relevant articles
    (55), followed by Sensors with 11 articles, and Remote sensing with 10 articles.
    Deep learning appears to still be a slow-developing topic in some important journals
    in agriculture, such as Plant Methods and Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture,
    which published only two relevant articles each. There are some other journals
    (not listed in Table 3) that published articles in a related domain. Those were
    Oriental Insects, Journal of Arid Land, Genetics Selection Evolution, International
    Journal of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Acta Agriculture Scandinavica,
    American Dairy Science Association, Acta Microscopica, Animals, Journal of Dairy
    Science, Field Crops Research, The Plant Journal, and Precision Agriculture. The
    distribution of 662 of keywords used in 120 articles is shown in Table 5. “Deep
    learning” is the most common keyword, with 68 uses, followed by “convolutional
    neural network” with 51 uses and “image processing” with 23 uses. The remainder
    of the list contains keywords related to area of use, such as “disease detection”,
    “crop classification”, “pest detection”, “weed detection”, “fruit detection”,
    “unmanned aerial vehicle”, “yield estimation”, and “smart agriculture”. TABLE
    5 The 20 Most Popular Keywords in 120 Articles Since the majority of articles
    shown in Table 5 were published in journals with computer science perspective,
    there are also keywords related to techniques, such as “computer vision”, “deep
    neural network”, “machine learning”, “transfer learning”, “hyperspectral imaging”,
    and “artificial intelligence”. Detailed information about how deep learning was
    applied to the most common domains is given in subtopics below, as well as in
    Appendix B. A. Disease Detection Plant diseases are among the important production
    losses in agriculture. It is critical to monitor the condition of the products
    and to control the spread of diseases. The prevention methods of plant diseases
    as well as disease diagnosis methods differ from plant to plant. The plant-specific
    disease detection methods are reported in the literature. Lu et al. [22] proposed
    a wheat disease diagnosis method that functions automatically in fields. Fuentes
    et al. [23] proposed a deep-learning-based detector for recognition diseases and
    pests in tomato plants. Kerkech et al. [24] proposed deep leaning approaches for
    vine diseases detection using vegetation indices and colorimetric spaces, applied
    to images collected by UAV. Hu et al. [25] proposed a low shot learning method
    for disease identification in tea leaves. Coulibaly et al. [26] proposed an approach
    for the identification of mildew disease in pearl millet, which is using transfer
    learning with feature extraction. Cruz et al. [27] proposed an artificial intelligence-based
    approach for detecting grapevine yellows symptoms. Deep convolutional neural network-based
    approach for crop disease classification on wheat images proposed by Picon et
    al. [28]. It was validated under real field conditions by deploying on a smartphone.
    These and other studies focusing on disease detection are given in Appendix B
    have made useful contributions to the prevention of plant diseases. B. Plant Classification
    Harvesting is laborious and time-consuming task in fruit production, with harvesting
    mostly done manually, so new developments are directed towards automated harvesting
    robots. Since automation techniques cannot be generalized across crops, researchers
    focused on developing crop-specific systems. Grinblat et al. [29] proposed plant
    identification based on vein morphology. Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard [30] proposed
    automatic yield estimation based on robotic agriculture for tomato plants. Veeramani
    et al. [31] and Altuntaş et al [32] applied deep convolutional networks (CNN)
    for sorting haploid maize seeds. Knoll et al. [33] proposed a self-learning CNN,
    to distinguish individual classes of plants using the visual sensor data in real-time.
    Häni et al. [34], Tian et al. [35], Gené-Mola et al. [36], and Kang and Chen [37]
    proposed detection and counting methods for apples in orchards. Yu et al. [38]
    proposed fruit detection for a strawberry harvesting robot. Koirala et al. [39]
    compared the performance of six deep learning architectures. Detection of mango
    fruit has been achieved using images of tree canopies [39]. Arad et al. [40] present
    the case study of robotic harvesting for sweet pepper. Further studies on plant
    classification are given in Appendix B. C. Land Cover Identification Land cover
    and crop type maps have emerged as an area where deep learning could be used efficiently.
    Multi-source satellite images are often used to capture specific plant growth
    stages. Several studies used deep learning for land productivity assessment and
    land cover classification. Kussul et al. [41] present a workflow for developing
    sustainable goals indicators assessment using high-resolution satellite data.
    Persello et al. [42] combined a full CNN with globalization and grouping to detect
    field boundaries. Zhou et al. [43] presented a deep learning-based classifier
    that learns time-series features of crops and classifies parcels of land. Using
    these parcels, a final classification map was produced. Zhao et al. [44] proposed
    a method for rice mapping which combined a decision tree method and a CNN model.
    Satellite data is not the only source of data for land cover classification. With
    development IoT-based technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have become
    an effective tool for crop monitoring. Yang et al. [45] present a deep CNN for
    rice grain yield estimation. This method using remotely sensed images collected
    by UAV is able to make estimations at the ripening stage. Dyson et al. [46] integrated
    a radiometric index with terrain height images for segmenting crops and trees
    over the soil. High-resolution images collected by UAVs were used in the study.
    Nevavuori et al. [47] applied CNNs to crop yield prediction using RGB and NDVI
    data collected by UAVs. More studies on land cover identification are given in
    Appendix B. D. Precision Livestock Farming As a part of precision farming, managing
    the livestock is also one of the current challenges for agriculture and is considered
    as a special topic, precision livestock farming techniques. These techniques include
    monitoring of animal health indicators, such as the comfort of animal, pose estimation,
    and behavior detection, as well as other production indicators. Gorczyca et al.
    [48] used machine-learning algorithms for predicting skin, core, and hair-coat
    temperatures of piglets. Kvam and Kongsro [49] proposed a method for estimating
    the IMF on ultrasound images. A noninvasive in vivo method, constructed using
    deep CNNs, by (Huang et al. [50] and Yukun et al. [51] provided a low-cost method
    based on machine vision and deep learning for evaluation of body condition scores.
    Zhang et al. [52] proposed a real-time sow behavior detection algorithm based
    on deep learning. Li et al. [53] proposed deep cascaded convolutional models for
    estimating cattle pose. A full list of studies focused on precision livestock
    farming is given in Appendix B. E. Object Recognition Providing automation of
    processes in precision farming, the detection of anomalies that may occur in the
    system is a specific area of study. Anomaly detection can be defined as detecting
    unexpected items or unusual behavior in data sets, which differ from the normal
    situation. According to the notions in the field of agriculture, elements that
    are not natural for the environment are known as anomalies. An algorithm combining
    anomaly detection and deep learning proposed by Christiansen et al. [54] performed
    anomaly detection with the exploitation of the homogenous characteristics of a
    field. Ma et al. [55] proposed an unsupervised deep hyperspectral anomaly detector.
    Rong et al. [56] proposed two different CNN structures for automatic segmentation
    and detection of foreign objects of different sizes that can be either natural
    or man-made. The proposed structures were applied to walnut images. Rasmussen
    and Moeslund [57] trained CNN models for kernel fragment recognition in RGB images
    of silage. Intelligent management and the automation of agricultural machinery
    is now a realistic option, with an increase in the level of agricultural mechanization.
    However, agricultural machinery recognition differs from plant recognition in
    the data acquisition methods used. For capturing agricultural machinery images
    vehicle terminal camera is used, so the images need preprocessing. Zhang et al.
    [58] designed and trained AMTNet network to automatically recognize agricultural
    machinery images that produced acceptable results. F. Pest Recognition Although
    some insects are economically beneficial, some species can severely damage to
    agricultural production and products. These destructive insects, known as agricultural
    pests, need to be correctly identified and treated according to their species
    to minimize the damage they cause. Pest recognition is not just objected recognition;
    it is a more complex task that should be treated in a special way. Cheng et al.
    [59] performed pest identification via deep residual learning in a complex background.
    Ding and Taylor [60] and Zhu et al. [61] used deep learning techniques for the
    classification of moth images. Shen et al. [62] applied a deep neural network
    for the detection and identification of stored-grain insects. Partel et al. [63]
    utilized artificial intelligence to develop an automated vision-based system that
    can be used for monitoring pests, such as the Asian citrus psyllid. Thenmozhi
    and Reddy [64] and Dawei et al. [65] proposed techniques for the recognition of
    pests by image-based transfer learning. Li et al. [66] proposed an effective data
    augmentation strategy for CNN-based pest recognition and localization in the field.
    G. Smart Irrigation Due to the continuing decline of water resources available
    to the world, efficient use of water is an important concern for all countries.
    Many studies have been conducted to efficiently manage the irrigation process
    in agriculture and this has become a specific research area known as smart irrigation.
    For efficient management of the irrigation process, it is important to detect
    the water status of plants. AlZu’bi et al. [67] proposed image processing concepts,
    where IoT sensors work with machine learning methods to make smart irrigation
    decisions. Song et al. [68] proposed a novel model combining deep belief network
    with macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) approach to predict the soil moisture
    content over an irrigated cornfield. Sirsat et al. [69] used almost all available
    regression methods to predict four key soil nutrients and fertility indices for
    soil organic carbon. Zambrano et al. [70] predicted the reduction of drought-related
    agricultural productivity in Chile using rainfall estimates, and climate oscillation
    indices. H. Phenotyping Phenotype is a set of observable features that result
    from the interaction of an individual genotype with the environment. Plant phenotyping,
    which can be defined as the identification and quantification of effects on the
    phenotype, is laborious and time-consuming because it is typically a manual task.
    Therefore, phenotyping of large populations in plant breeding programs have high
    costs. An automation of phenotyping tasks can bring great benefit to plant improvement.
    Uzal et al. [71] proposed a deep-learning-based computer vision method that estimates
    the number of seeds into soybean pods. Ampatzidis et al. [72] used small UAVs
    equipped with sensors for the rapid acquisition of phenotypic data. This method
    simplified the surveying procedure, decreased data collection time, and reduced
    the cost of phenotyping. Yang et al. [73] used deep CNNs and leaf images for the
    identification of the three Cinnamomum species. Milella et al. [74] proposed methods
    for automated grapevine phenotyping. Feng et al. [75] combined machine learning
    with hyperspectral imaging to develop a tool for salt-stress phenotyping. I. Weed
    Detection Weeds are undesirable plants that grow in agricultural crops and cause
    yield losses because they compete for the resources needed by the crop. Smartweed
    detection makes it possible to apply herbicide treatments specifically to detected
    weeds. Santos Ferreira et al. [76] used CNN to perform weed detection in soybean
    crop images and classify them as grass and broadleaf weeds. Moshia and Newete
    [77] proposed a deep learning neural network, for automatic identification of
    weeds from the main crop using row-guided robots. Bah et al. [78] proposed a learning
    method using CNN for weed detection from images collected by UAV that automatically
    performed unsupervised training dataset collection. Kounalakis et al. [79] combined
    classifier for weed recognition with transfer learning techniques for deep learning-based
    feature extraction. Partel et al. [80] designed and developed a smart sprayer
    using machine vision and artificial intelligence. This smart sprayer distinguishes
    target weeds from crop and precisely sprays the targeted weed. SECTION V. Discussion
    In agriculture manual activities, such as yield monitoring, fruit counting, phenotyping,
    pest recognition and disease detection, are slow, labor-intensive, expensive,
    and error-prone, reducing real-time performance and increasing costs [60]. Considerable
    work has been done on automating these activities in recent years. This review
    of the relevant articles highlights that success has been achieved in many studies,
    especially with the use of deep learning approaches. When applying deep learning
    the user does not need to be an expert at detecting disease or having other specific
    knowledge [27]. The system does not need preprocessing of images, so this makes
    it more advantageous than the current standard techniques. As a result of analyzing
    120 articles, the topics of the studies were observed to change over time. Earlier
    studies compared manual, current methods, and deep learning techniques. The result
    of these studies showed that by applying deep learning approaches it is possible
    to obtain high order features or more accurate results [29], [30], [59], [76],
    [82]–[87]. However, there are some studies showing that the current methods are
    better than deep learning or give the same result, concluding that there is no
    value in applying complex structures [23], [31], [88], [90], [91]. Sometimes simple
    models that are formulated by carefully selecting the best estimators and then
    by examining a specific situation they give better results than complex models
    [70]. However, it is not always possible to have the necessary knowledge to examine
    specific situations. In these cases, the generalizing ability of deep learning
    architecture provides an advantage. Also, for the data that is too small to capture,
    the associated characteristics and variations, deep learning approaches are not
    meaningful [90]. It should be also noted that the data collection process, which
    is the basic condition for success in deep learning models, can also be time-consuming
    and laborious. As a technology that aims to address this issue, UAV-aided IoT
    networks have enormous potential in agriculture practices [24], [45]–[47], [78],
    [110], [128]. This approach reduces the technical workforce, is more cost-effective
    and consistent than the manual methods based on the expertise of existing staff
    [72]. Given that high maneuverability, high mobility, and low maintenance cost,
    UAVs were used in studies related to almost all topics. In addition to being an
    effective tool, UAVs can contribute to the change from current practices to practices
    that protect the environment. Standard broadcast sprayers integrated with UAVs,
    treating the entire area, resulting in unnecessary application to areas that do
    not require treatment. With the AI-based UAVs, a fast and precise treatment can
    be applied to specific areas, which can significantly reduce the amount of agrochemicals
    used [80]. Therefore, UAV-aided studies were not analyzed as an independent topic,
    and UAV can be considered as an integral part of smart farming. Although UAVs
    are a key technological advance, they have some difficulties in their use in agriculture.
    Given their high power consumption during their flight, the flight time of UAV
    is quite limited [84]. It is known that it takes much longer than the normal flight
    time to train a deep neural network system even on a very fast central processing
    unit. Therefore, UAVs have to be equipped with a graphics processing unit to speed
    up training, which brings extra costs [77]. This kind of tradeoff between accuracy
    and computational cost could be addressed in technologies supporting AI in agriculture.
    So when there are some limitations and speed constraints, the more important metrics
    should be taken into account and compared to help to choose the right method [79].
    However, there are studies that improve the accuracy of detection and speed of
    processing to make these suitable for real-time applications [50], [52], [103].
    Employment of Big Data for smart agriculture is a completely new concept [114].
    Although Big Data applications in smart agriculture are not that common, they
    are meant for cloud computing and IoT-based smart agriculture application [67].
    Systems that support reasoning from real-time sensor data have the potential to
    deliver digital data sources for online services, operations, farmers, and processes
    by integrating a large number of data sources [131]. Having the opportunity of
    direct access to infrastructures that support advanced data discovery and image
    processing services, researchers, farmers, or companies involved in smart farming
    could obtain value from these data. SECTION VI. Conclusion Using bibliographic
    methods, the characteristics of deep-learning-based agriculture-relevant literature
    from 2016 to 2019 based on the SCI database were examined. The study reveals that
    the literature on deep learning has grown exponentially over the past 2 years.
    China was revealed to be an important contributor to the deep learning literature
    with the highest number of publications (40), followed by the USA (14). The study
    also found that three core journals, namely Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,
    Sensors and Remote sensing published about 63% to the articles on deep-learning-based
    agriculture. Disease detection, plant classification, land cover identification,
    and precision livestock farming were found to be the key subjects with the deepest
    learning publications in the agricultural domain. The most common agriculture-relevant
    keywords used were “disease detection”, “crop classification”, “pest detection”,
    “weed detection”, “fruit detection”, “unmanned aerial vehicle”, “yield estimation”,
    and “smart agriculture”. UAV-aided IoT networks have enormous potential for application
    in agriculture. Given their high maneuverability, high mobility, and their low
    maintenance cost, they were used in studies related to almost all topics. Therefore,
    UAV-aided studies were not analyzed as an independent topic and UAV can be considered
    as an integral part of smart farming. With the integration of UAVs into smart
    farming, equipped with sensors and cameras, the articles tended towards artificial
    intelligence applications that produce faster results working with real-time data.
    In addition to datasets collected with sensors and cameras, in deep learning studies
    there are also other data sources like satellite data, open-access databases,
    and synthetic datasets. The focus of this study was to identify where deep learning
    has been used for improving various agricultural practices, to rank the topics
    in order to help new researchers in this area, and to emphasize practices that
    could direct future research. This survey should motivate more researchers to
    focus on deep learning topics, related to data analysis, image analysis and computer
    vision, applying it for classification or prediction in smarter farming. Appendix

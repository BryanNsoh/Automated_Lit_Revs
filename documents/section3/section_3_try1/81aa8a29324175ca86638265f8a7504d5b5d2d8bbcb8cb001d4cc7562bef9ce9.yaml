    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    recommendation. Full size image A confusion matrix is an illustrative format that
    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Because there is more demand for freshwater around the world and the
    world’s population is growing at the same time, there is a severe lack of freshwater
    resources in the central part of the planet. The world’s current population of
    7.2 billion people is expected to grow to over 9 billion by the year 2050. The
    vast majority of freshwater is used for things like cooking, cleaning, and farming.

    billion by the year 2050. The vast majority of freshwater is used for things like

    system using IoT Article 05 January 2022 1 Introduction A particular volume of
    water is required to be provided to a crop at predetermined intervals throughout
    the period in which it is developing. Irrigation is critical to the accomplishment
    of any agricultural project. The process of supplying water to plants via the
    use of mechanical methods is referred to as irrigation. Particularly helpful in
    areas prone to drought or subject to unpredictable rainfall. It is impossible
    to overestimate the significance of water in the life of a plant. Because the
    principles of water management vary depending on the weather, it is essential
    to have a solid understanding of how the soil and plants interact with one another.
    The soil may be sandy, silty, clay, or any number of other textures. Every type
    of soil has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it was formed.
    Consider, for example, the high water absorption capacity of sand. However, the
    nutrients are immediately flushed down the drain. On the other hand, silty soil
    is made up of extremely small particles and has an exceptional capacity to store
    water for extended periods of time. Sadly, water has a difficult time draining
    through this soil because of its structure. The quality of the soil in all of
    its facets, including its ability to retain water and nutrients, is absolutely
    necessary for agricultural production. Therefore, in order to effectively manage
    the water requirements of the various types of soil, it is essential to have a
    solid understanding of the characteristics of the soil [1]. Even if there is sufficient
    precipitation in many agricultural places, there is not enough moisture for crop
    development for a number of different reasons. These causes include a lack of
    storage capacity and/or precipitation that falls at inconvenient times. It has
    been stated that the rainfall is insufficient if it is less than one hundred centimeters,
    as the irrigation system requires at least that much rain in order to function
    properly [2]. Irrigation is also necessary in regions that see fluctuating amounts
    of precipitation, such as the dry Sahel, which receives a lot of rain during the
    monsoon season but suffers from dryness during the winter months. In order to
    assist in the development of crops at times of the year when there is a deficiency
    in rainfall, water irrigation is necessary. The majority of the newest and highest-quality
    hybrid crop varieties need for a substantial amount of watering. As a consequence
    of this, it is very necessary to manage the flow of water in order to improve
    the yield and quality of the crops. Even the most common varieties of sugarcane
    and rice require a substantial amount of water to cultivate, which is demonstrated
    by the extensive and illustrious history of irrigation in the basin. This is something
    that has been well researched and written about. Each individual farmer is responsible
    for carrying out all aspects of agricultural labor, from sowing seeds and picking
    weeds to fertilizing, watering, and harvesting their crops. This process requires
    a significant investment of both time and water, in addition to a substantial
    amount of manual labor [3]. The method includes a number of decision-making phases
    that are spread out across the course of the agricultural cycle to enhance the
    productiveness of farming. Precision agriculture assists farmers in mitigating
    these issues while also increasing crop yields. This is accomplished by continuously
    measuring the soil’s temperature, humidity, temperature gradient, and pH. There
    are a number of industrialized countries in which precision farming is carried
    out exclusively through the use of the Internet of Things. The process of a computer
    being able to learn new abilities by itself through observation and repeated practice
    is referred to as machine learning [4]. In order for the algorithms to learn from
    the input datasets, gradually train the samples, and increase their performance,
    the equations need to be modified. Its foundation in real-world settings enables
    it to develop decision-making capabilities with relatively minimal input from
    humans. Machine learning-based algorithms are increasingly being used in every
    sector of the economy. On the other hand, the accuracy might be very different
    depending on the quality of the data that was utilized. As a consequence of this,
    the representations of the datasets and the variables that are being targeted
    are both essential components of the machine learning approaches [5]. The ability
    to predict the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level,
    together with other meteorological information, is vital for the irrigation action
    timing plan used in precision agriculture. When designing irrigation schedules,
    it is important to highlight the kind of water distribution and to take into account
    the buffer time of the system. Whether deciding when to water plants, the moisture
    level of the soil is an extremely important aspect. As soon as the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded. When it comes to the
    Internet of Things, new agricultural systems are beneficial because of the simplicity
    with which they make farm maintenance. The creation of such an automated system
    makes it possible to hydrate plants without the need for human involvement. Several
    different sectors have begun implementing IoT in order to increase their level
    of production. In today’s world, the Internet of Things is also being applied
    in farming in the form of smart farming. Devices connected to the internet of
    things have the ability to monitor the weather, find solutions to problems with
    irrigation, and assist farmers in increasing their crops in incremental steps.
    Innovative ideas are now necessary in the agriculture industry as a direct result
    of the growing population around the world and the accompanying rise in food consumption.
    Farmers can benefit from the Internet of Things in a number of ways, including
    increased crop productivity, improved harvesting yield, and proper field management;
    water monitoring; water usage limitation; crop monitoring; environmental impact
    prediction in advance; use of fewer people and fewer resources; prediction of
    environmental impact in advance; monitoring of water; and monitoring of crops.
    As a result of increased worldwide demand for freshwater and the concurrent expansion
    in global population, the central area of the planet is currently facing a severe
    lack of available freshwater resources. It is anticipated that by the year 2050,
    the current world population of 7.2 billion would have increased to over 9 billion.
    The vast majority of freshwater is consumed for uses related to household and
    agricultural production. The majority of industrialised countries are in dire
    need of intelligent irrigation systems since the rapid advancement of technology
    has rendered them indispensable [6]. The Smart Irrigation System is equipment
    that is considered to be at the cutting edge of technology when it comes to managing
    the flow of water in agricultural infrastructure. The SIS controller will automatically
    change the irrigation schedule so that it is optimal for the conditions of the
    soil, the current weather, and the prediction for the next week. The water-soil
    interaction as well as the crop water demand that goes along with it may both
    be established via the process of characterising the soil feature. Embedded system
    components, such as a microprocessor, together with the associated timers, sensors,
    and electrical valves, are responsible for regulating the flow of water in autonomous
    irrigation systems. As a result of this, the system is able to work in a more
    efficient manner. Controls for volume and timing, in addition to sensors that
    monitor the moisture content of the soil, are a few examples of automated irrigation.
    The controllers of the intelligent irrigation system each have their own embedded
    intelligence, which works in conjunction with the other integrated components
    of the system. These sophisticated controls keep an eye on the weather as well
    as other aspects of the surrounding environment. Based on their findings, they
    modify watering schedules and quantities so that water is neither wasted nor wasted
    too quickly. You have to be aware that the most recent generation of intelligent
    irrigation controllers set the watering schedule for the irrigation system based
    on weather forecasts. People’s confidence in the correctness of the data projected
    is essential to the operation of such a system since it relies on their input.
    This article presents IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity and soil sensors are used to collect
    soil related data. This data is stored in a centralized cloud. Features are selected
    by CFS algorithm. This will help in discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of
    data is performed by K means algorithm. This will help in keeping similar data
    together. Then classification model is build using the SVM, Random Forest and
    Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained, validated and tested using the acquired
    data. Historical soil and humidity related data is also used in training the model.
    Section 2 presents literature survey of existing work related to intelligent irrigation
    system. Section 3 depicts the methodology part. Section 4 presents result analysis
    and discussion. This section includes performance comparison on the basis of certain
    parameters. Section 5 contains conclusion. 2 Literature survey Weakly-Secured
    Networks, often known as WSNs, are an emerging technology that have the potential
    to completely transform the agricultural industry. Maurya and Jain were kind enough
    to supply details on how to make efficient use of fuzzy logic in agricultural
    precision farming [7]. They assert that the information collected by field sensors
    is transmitted to a base station, which is then delivered to a centralised location.
    Through the use of a threshold hybrid route, the information that has been received
    by the sensors is transmitted to the base station. The authors use fuzzy logic
    to select the best cluster head in order to bring down the total amount of energy
    consumed. Farmers are able to utilise the data received by the base station to
    figure out how much water should be used for irrigation in various parts of their
    property by using the information. Farmers need to implement practises of precision
    agriculture in order to enhance their productivity. If this is the case, implementing
    WSN may significantly help farmers and other players in the agricultural sector,
    notably government irrigation agencies, make great judgements that aid in the
    forecasting of irrigation demands and crop yields. This might be a significant
    benefit of adopting WSN. A method for autonomous precision farming was developed
    by Dong et al. [8], and it makes use of centre pivot irrigation systems. This
    technological advancement makes use of sensor networks that are placed in the
    ground in order to monitor environmental elements in a field, such as the temperature
    of the soil and the moisture levels. As a result, sensors are installed, initial
    power settings are defined, and the network is maintained on a consistent basis
    in order to guarantee the most efficient utilisation of energy. In the past, a
    number of different user applications have been developed to automate and make
    the task of managing and scheduling irrigation systems more straightforward. Vellidis
    and his colleagues came up with a system that allows for more effective watering
    of cotton crops [9]. In order to establish the soil water balance in their system,
    the researchers analysed data sets collected from a variety of cotton-growing
    locations. An android mobile application was developed by the author with the
    help of the datasets. In addition to that, they have designed their app in such
    a way that it can pull weather information from surrounding weather stations.
    In order to achieve optimal levels of cotton production, the software was designed
    to carry out automated planning of the irrigation systems on the basis of the
    calculated irrigation requirements arrived at by applying both local and downloaded
    meteorological data. Imam et al. [10] conducted a study of the challenges associated
    with the design of wireless sensor networks and intelligent humidity sensors for
    use in precision agriculture. This was done with the goal of maximising the benefits
    that could be obtained. In the context of precision farming, they compared the
    performance of several microcontroller families and sensor node units with one
    another. In addition to this, an inventory of relative humidity sensor requirements
    along with modelling and interface methodologies was produced by them. Chen et
    al. [11] suggested that precision farming would be impossible without the use
    of agricultural IoT systems. Several farmers have benefited greatly from the automated
    control and data monitoring systems. The agriculture industry is rapidly turning
    to the use of machine learning in response to the pressing need to enhance traditionally
    employed practises. The capabilities of the IoT to perform remote monitoring and
    data collecting help farmers save both time and effort thanks to the utilisation
    of preexisting internet infrastructure as well as mobile and web-based applications.
    The Internet of Things system used in agriculture incorporates a wide range of
    functions, one of the most important of which is irrigation. As a result of developments
    in technology that have rendered conventional farming methods archaic, people
    are more interested in modern irrigation methods than they are in traditional
    farming. Traditional agricultural methods are no longer viable. The Internet of
    Things would be of enormous use to farmers since it would save them the time and
    effort necessary for manual monitoring of their fields. This is a big deterrent
    for many people living in metropolitan areas, despite the abundance of farmland.
    Farmers would gain greatly from the IoT. Data from sensors stored in the cloud
    might potentially be combined with methods of machine learning in order to provide
    users with assistance in planning for future output. A novel Internet of Things
    (IoT) enabled smart system was presented by Akshay and Ramesh [12] to predict
    the quantity of irrigation that is required for the field by sensing characteristics
    such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature using a machine learning algorithm.
    This was accomplished by Akshay and Ramesh’s novel smart system. We resort to
    the K-closest neighbour strategy in order to circumvent the overfitting problem
    that occurs with the more traditional K-means and SVM methods. The outcomes of
    processing data using 3 weeks’ worth of predefined data are detailed, illustrating
    how the recommended method''s usage of the K-nearest neighbour algorithm may produce
    a completely automated irrigation system. The predictions made by the recommended
    system have a high degree of accuracy. The groundwater that is utilised for irrigation,
    home uses, and industrial reasons was analysed by Sarakutty et al. [13] in this
    particular paper. The writers also mention that in many extensive rural regions,
    irrigation is done with groundwater rather than surface water. Due to the fact
    that water is required for all forms of life on Earth, the problem of water conservation
    is an urgent one that has not yet been resolved. The global water system boosts
    the incomes and productivity of rural areas by providing assistance to farmers
    in reducing the impacts of drought and the variable nature of the weather. Irrigation
    is the most significant consumer of drinkable water but also contributes significantly
    to the depletion of ground water. The use of ground water is an unavoidable outcome
    brought about by the rising demand for agricultural goods. Because of this, it
    is very necessary to adopt cutting-edge technology in irrigation in order to make
    more efficient use of the water that is available. In a smart irrigation system
    enabled by the Internet of Things, in order to minimise the amount of water that
    is used for irrigation while yet being able to accurately estimate the rate at
    which soil moisture is being drained, Singh and others Data collected from field
    sensors and forecasts of the weather that may be available online are used to
    generate estimates of the amount of moisture in the soil. The GBRT has been demonstrated
    to be the most accurate of the several ML approaches that can be used to estimate
    the soil''s moisture content. The presented strategies have the potential to be
    a fruitful research avenue for reducing the amount of water required for irrigation.
    Pratyush Reddy and colleagues [14] have developed an intelligent irrigation system
    that is able to forecast the amount of water that a crop will require by making
    use of an algorithm that is designed for machine learning. The amount of water
    that is required for agricultural purposes may be approximated based on a number
    of different criteria, the moisture content, temperature, and humidity being the
    three most essential of these. The system’s sensors for measuring temperature,
    humidity, and wetness send data to a central CPU, which then links the device
    to the cloud. These sensors are placed in an agricultural field. The data gathered
    in the field is input into a decision tree algorithm, which is an effective tool
    for machine learning and enables efficient result prediction. Kirtana et al. [15]
    produced a work that combines the power of the internet of things (IoT) with an
    algorithm for machine learning in order to automate and speed up the process of
    developing new agricultural techniques. The planning and implementation of a smart
    irrigation system are described in depth in this article. This system makes use
    of machine learning techniques in order to fully and correctly automate the watering
    process. The sensor module is powered by solar energy, which results in a reduction
    in the system''s overall energy consumption and an improvement in the lifetime
    of the system. Singh and Sobti [16] investigated the potential applications of
    several ML algorithms in the field of agriculture as part of their research. In
    addition, the report shed light on the difficulties associated with merging IoT
    and WSN in order to achieve precision agriculture. It has come to light that the
    primary problems stem from a deficiency in intelligent infrastructure, accurate
    sensing technologies, careless water use, and an inability to predict important
    components that are required for irrigation. Therefore, according to the author,
    there is a significant demand for methods of machine learning that are both effective
    and efficient. 3 Methodology In this section, Fig. 1 presents IoT based Sensor
    integrated intelligent irrigation system for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity
    and soil sensors are used to collect soil related data. This data is stored in
    a centralized cloud. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. This will help in
    discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of data is performed by K means algorithm.
    This will help in keeping similar data together. Then classification model is
    build using the SVM, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained,
    validated and tested using the acquired data. Historical soil and humidity related
    data is also used in training the model. Fig. 1 IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent
    irrigation system for agriculture industry Full size image Important features
    are selected using CGS algorithm. K-Means Clustering [17] is one of the most common
    “Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques,” and if you want to evaluate the organisation
    of your data, you may make use of this technique, which gives you the opportunity
    to do so. It is a process that divides the dataset into a predetermined number
    of subsets in an iterative manner (clusters). In addition to making certain that
    the clusters do not intersect with one another, we checked to see that the data
    points contained within each cluster were as analogous to one another as was practically
    possible. The elements were grouped together into clusters according to their
    distances from the cluster''s centre, with the elements that were located the
    furthest away receiving the least amount of weight. The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
    was successful in explaining 86.6% of the variation in the data that was observed.
    K indicates that there is less variance inside a group but a greater degree of
    diversity between groups. A classifier known as a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    [18] can be utilised to accomplish the task of separating data into linear and
    nonlinear categories. If you have more than one different group, support vector
    machine analysis can guide you through the process of building a hyperplane that
    maximises the distances that separate them. The number of classes must be added
    to the number of features to arrive at the total number of hyperplanes. The precise
    positioning and orientation of the hyperplanes can be determined by examining
    the points that make up the supports vector. With the assistance of these support
    vectors, it is possible to expand the margins of the hyperplanes. Support vector
    machines, often known as SVMs, are comprised of mathematical functions known as
    kernels. These kernels accept data as input and output it in the appropriate format.
    SVM kernels are available in a wide variety of shapes, such as linear, radial
    basis function, polynomial, and sigmoidal, amongst others. These kernels are included
    in accordance with the manner in which the data is dispersed. During the course
    of this investigation, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) classification
    model by making use of radial basis functions. A random forest (RF) is a type
    of statistical analysis in which numerous individual decision trees are blended
    to generate a single forest. In the end, the ensemble forecast that was generated
    by many disparate models (tress) is superior to the prediction that was generated
    by any one prediction model. RF can be applied in classification in addition to
    its use in regression analysis, which is one of its more common applications.
    The research led to the development of the classification RF, which utilises three
    hundred trees. Out of bag error decreases with rising tree counts, but eventually
    levels off at 50 trees, which may be used to analyse the error rate by creating
    a plot. In other words, the error rate can be evaluated by drawing a plot [19].
    The Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning that is
    based on Bayes'' theorem as well as the concept that the features that are utilised
    as predictors are independent of one another within a particular class. The Naive
    Bayes model outperforms a large number of other sophisticated classifiers and
    is notably helpful for making multiclass predictions with enormous datasets. It
    is possible to calculate the posterior probability with the assistance of Bayes''
    Theorem. The posterior probability, denoted by the symbol P(W|Y), is computed
    using the formula P(Y|W) * P(W)/P(Y), where P(W) represents the prior probability
    of the predictor, P(Y|W) represents the probability of the predictor given class,
    and P(Y|W) represents the prior probability of the class. We were able to generate
    a density map for each of the seven predictor variables with the help of the Naive
    Bayes function [20]. 4 Result analysis and discussion We created a dataset of
    several environmental parameters such as soil moisture, Humidity, Temperature,
    Pressure, and Luminosity. To create comprehensive data set with all important
    parameters, we have used data sets available at [21]. Rice crop related data set
    has 42665 records. 35000 records used to train the classification model and 7665
    records used to test the classification model. IoT based soil and humidity sensors
    are used to acquire data. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. Results are
    represented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Amount of fresh water saved by proposed
    technique is presented in Fig. 7. Accuracy, precision, specificity, recall and

    the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level and other weather
    information. This is important for the irrigation timing plan. When making irrigation
    schedules, it''s important to pay attention to the type of water distribution
    and take the system''s buffer time into account. The level of moisture in the
    soil is a very important part of deciding when to water plants. When the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded.This article presented
    an Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for the agricultural sector. In order to collect data pertaining to the soil,
    humidity and soil sensors based on the internet of things are utilised. This information
    is kept in a centralised cloud storage system. The CFS algorithm is responsible
    for the selection of features. This will aid in removing irrelevant data. The
    K means approach is used to conduct the clustering of the data. This will assist
    in keeping related data together in one place. The SVM, Random Forest, and Naive
    Bayes algorithms are utilised next in the construction of the classification model.
    Using the data that was obtained, the model is then trained, verified, and tested.
    The training of the model additionally makes use of data relating to the soil''s
    history and the humidity. The K-means SVM hybrid classifier is producing superior
    results for classification, the forecast of water demand, and the conservation
    of fresh water through intelligent irrigation. Hybrid Kmeans SVM is saving fresh
    water up to 20 percent by intelligent irrigation. Data availability The data that

    formation process. This lightweighted combination allows the model to reduce delay,
    maintain lower energy consumption, with better communication throughput even under
    multiple attack scenarios. This model is necessary due to the growing demand for
    sustainable and accurate agricultural practices. The quality of the soil is crucial

    including moisture content, pH level, and nutrient levels for various farm types.
    Incorporating sensors and low-power microcontrollers, the model enables on-site
    analysis and timely farmer feedbacks. The decreased energy consumption extends
    the battery life of deployed devices, whereas the decreased delay ensures that

    1. Introduction In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use
    of technology to improve agricultural practices and address the challenges facing
    the farming community. Monitoring and managing soil quality is an essential aspect
    of agriculture, as it directly influences soil yield, resource allocation, and
    environmental sustainability. For farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other management practices, accurate and timely soil condition
    data is essential. However, conventional soil analysis and monitoring methods
    are frequently time-consuming, labor-intensive, and require specialized knowledge
    sets (Fan et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2020, Toth et al., 2020). Tiny Machine Learning
    (TinyML), an emerging field, offers promising solutions to overcome these limitations.
    TinyML involves deploying machine learning models on Internet of Things (IoT)
    ecosystem devices with limited resources, such as microcontrollers. Real-time
    deployment of complex machine learning models is difficult on these devices due
    to their limited computational memory, and power. Due to the requirement for real-time
    decisions, energy efficiency, and low-latency operations, deploying TinyML models
    for the monitoring and management of soil quality in agriculture presents unique
    challenges. Conventional machine learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Q Learning, are often unsuitable
    for deployment on TinyML devices due to their high computational complexity and
    memory requirements via Information Theory Modelling (ITM) (Micheli et al., 2022,
    Wu et al., 2022, Wu et al., 1 Sept. 1, 2020,) process. In this paper, a power-aware
    and delay-aware TinyML deployment strategy is proposed for the monitoring and
    management of soil quality in agriculture. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling
    (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting,
    and Task Partitioning comprise proposed method reduce energy consumption, reduce
    delay, and maintain accuracy comparable to existing CNN, RNN, and Q Learning algorithms
    by employing these techniques. This research''s primary objective is to develop
    a practical and efficient solution for real-time monitoring and management of
    soil quality, which will enable farmers to optimize resource utilization, increase
    soil yield, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. By deploying TinyML
    models directly on the field using low-power microcontrollers and integrated sensors,
    farmers can continuously monitor key soil quality parameters, such as moisture
    content, pH level, and nutrient levels. This real-time data allows farmers to
    make decisions based on data, respond quickly to changing soil conditions, and
    implement targeted irrigation, fertilization, and pest control interventions.
    The proposed power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model has great potential for
    a variety of real-time agricultural scenarios. Its compatibility with advanced
    machine learning techniques such as CNNs, RNNs, and Q Learning enables the analysis
    of spatial and temporal soil data, thereby facilitating soil disease detection,
    weed identification, and yield prediction. Farmers can efficiently manage agricultural
    operations while minimizing chemical inputs and environmental impact sets by utilizing
    the model''s reduced energy consumption and low-latency capabilities. This paper
    concludes by addressing the need for a power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model
    for the monitoring and management of agricultural soil quality. Combining DVFS,
    Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting, and Task
    Partitioning, the proposed model reduces energy consumption, decreases delay,
    and maintains precision. By enabling real-time decision making, this model has
    the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices, increase soil productivity,
    and promote sustainable resource management. The following sections of this paper
    will describe the methodology, experimental setup, results, and implications of
    our proposed approach, thereby providing valuable insights into the application
    of TinyML for agricultural soil quality monitoring and management scenarios. 2.
    Review of existing methods for deploying efficient soil quality monitoring & management
    techniques Numerous models are proposed for deploying monitoring and management
    techniques for soil quality in real-time scenarios. These consist of: Conventional
    Soil Analysis Techniques Conventional soil analysis techniques involve laboratory-based
    techniques that require collecting soil samples, transporting them to a laboratory,
    and conducting various tests to evaluate soil quality parameters and scenarios.
    Although these methods are accurate, they have time, cost, and scalability limitations
    (Agarwal et al., 2021, Chen et al., 1 Sept. 1, 2021,, Hänsch et al., 2021). They
    are not suitable for monitoring and managing soil conditions in agricultural fields
    in real time (Gopalakrishnan et al., 1 March 1, 2021,, Leanza et al., 2022, Tang
    and Yan, 2022). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs): WSNs are widely used in agriculture
    for soil quality monitoring. These networks consist of sensor nodes that are spatially
    dispersed and collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and other relevant parameters.
    However, there are obstacles regarding energy consumption and scalability. High-power
    sensor nodes and frequent data transmission can rapidly deplete the network''s
    energy resources, resulting in limited deployment range and maintenance issues
    (Efremova, Seddik, & Erten, 2022; Yuan, 2020) through the use of CycleGAN (Generative
    Adversarial Networks) and similar modeling techniques. Remote Sensing: Techniques
    for remote sensing, such as satellite imagery and aerial surveys, provide valuable
    information on soil conditions on a large scale. These techniques can detect large-scale
    patterns of soil quality, plant health, and water stress. Nevertheless, they frequently
    lack the spatial resolution necessary for detailed site-specific monitoring applications.
    Moreover, delays in data acquisition and processing can impede real-time decision-making
    (Li et al., 2023, Ren et al., 2020). Cloud-based systems employ machine learning
    algorithms to analyze vast quantities of soil data gathered by distributed sensors.
    These systems provide a high level of computational power and storage capacity,
    allowing for advanced analytics and decision support. The dependency on cloud
    infrastructure for processing and analysis, however, introduces latency, rendering
    it unsuitable for real-time applications. In addition, it necessitates constant
    connectivity and may be subject to data security and privacy concerns (Lin and
    Hao, 15 April 15, 2021,, Luo et al., 2022). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
    CNNs have been implemented in soil image analysis for tasks such as identifying
    soil contaminants and classifying soil types. They are difficult to deploy on
    resource-constrained devices & sets (Cui, 2021, Wong, 2021) due to their high
    accuracy, which necessitates significant computational resources. RNNs have demonstrated
    promise in time-series analysis for soil moisture prediction and soil yield forecasting.
    Nevertheless, their computational complexity and memory requirements can limit
    their deployment on low-power devices and in low-power scenarios (Hong et al.,
    2022, Monsiváis-Huertero, 2022). Reinforcement Learning (RL): In precision agriculture,
    RL algorithms such as Q Learning have been used to optimize irrigation scheduling
    and nutrient management. Despite their efficacy, these methods frequently require
    substantial computational resources and extensive training of temporal instances
    with the Double Instrumental Variable Method (DIVM) for various scenarios (Bannari
    et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2022). To address the limitations of deep learning
    methods, lightweight machine learning algorithms have been investigated. Decision
    trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM) are examples
    of algorithms that are computationally efficient and suitable for resource-constrained
    devices and situations. (Carnier, de Abreu, & de Andrade, 2023) These algorithms
    can achieve acceptable levels of precision while minimizing computational complexity.
    Existing methods for deploying efficient monitoring and management techniques
    for soil quality encompass a variety of approaches. Traditional methods of soil
    analysis are precise, but time-consuming and therefore unsuitable for real-time
    applications. WSNs and remote sensing techniques provide valuable data, but energy
    consumption and scalability continue to be obstacles. The machine learning techniques
    CNNs, RNNs, and RL provide accurate predictions, but their use cases can be computationally
    intensive. Cloud-based systems provide a high level of computational power, but
    introduce latency and network connectivity dependency levels. Since crop production,
    resource optimization, and environmental sustainability are all directly influenced
    by soil quality, monitoring and maintaining soil quality in agriculture is an
    essential area of research and development. The accompanying literature review
    provides a synopsis of recent studies and innovations in the field, emphasizing
    the need for a fast, energy-efficient, and secure TinyML model for controlling
    and monitoring soil quality in real time scenarios. Quality control and management
    of soil: Soil quality has a major impact on crop yields, nutrient availability,
    water retention, and agricultural sustainability as a whole (Ren et al., 2022,
    Xu et al., 15 March 15, 2022,, Zhou et al., 1 June 1, 2022,). Efficient methods
    of soil monitoring and management are needed for resource allocation, irrigation,
    and fertilizer optimization in order to boost agricultural growth while minimizing
    environmental repercussions. Monitoring soil by methods like hand sampling and
    laboratory analysis may be laborious and time consuming, and it often fails to
    give real-time datasets & scenarios (Akrasi-Mensah, 2023, Qian et al., 2023, Saputhanthri
    et al., 2022, Wang et al., 15 June 15, 2023,). Therefore, there is a growing need
    for reliable soil monitoring devices that can collect data in real time scenarios.
    New opportunities for agricultural decision-making and real-time soil monitoring
    have emerged as a result of recent advancements in machine learning, data analytics,
    and sensor technologies (Alrubei et al., 2022, Bataineh et al., 2022, Ma et al.,
    2022). Tools like this facilitate the collection of detailed information and the
    development of prediction models for assessing soil quality levels. The deployment
    of machine learning models on resource-constrained devices, such as low-power
    microcontrollers, allows local data processing and real-time analytics at the
    network''s edge. This is known as TinyML. TinyML has attracted a lot of attention
    in the agricultural industry because of its potential for on-site analysis, less
    reliance on cloud computing, and increased battery life of deployed devices &
    scenarios. Several studies have investigated TinyML''s potential uses in agriculture,
    particularly in the areas of crop production prediction, disease detection, and
    irrigation management (Hao et al., 2022, Sadawi et al., 2022, Zheng et al., 2022).
    These studies demonstrate the viability and utility of using machine learning
    models for use in agricultural applications on low-power hardware. TinyML Models
    with Low Energy Consumption: Energy efficiency is crucial when deploying TinyML
    models in low-resource environments. A farm''s viability and battery life are
    both directly tied to how much energy is used. Numerous strategies for enhancing
    TinyML models'' power effectiveness have been proposed by the research community.
    Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) (Deebak et al., 2023, Kaur et al.,
    2022, Zhang et al., 2023) adjusts the processor''s voltage and frequency to suit
    the workload. As per (Goh et al., 2022, Wan et al., 2023) Sleep/arousal Energy
    consumption may be decreased by optimizing the device''s sleep and wake cycles
    using genetic algorithms. TinyML devices may be powered autonomously using energy
    collecting techniques like as solar or kinetic energy (Mishra et al., 2023, Zhang
    et al., 2022) levels. Algorithms for task partitioning distribute workloads over
    a network of computers to cut down on power usage levels. Combining TinyML and
    the IoT Internet Safety: Since they collect, analyze, and transfer sensitive data,
    TinyML and IoT networks need the highest level of security. Any vulnerability
    in a network raises the prospect of hostile assaults, unauthorized access, and
    compromised data. Validation attacks including Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and
    Man-in-the-Middle attacks are among the many IoT network security challenges that
    have been examined in (Ayub Khan et al., 2022, Li et al., 2022) for real-time
    scenarios. Attacks like this exploit holes in our current systems of identity
    verification, trust, and network infrastructure sets. Researchers have proposed
    using Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency (PoEE), a lightweight consensus mechanism, to
    reduce the energy requirements of blockchain-based systems and, in turn, improve
    their security (Alshehri et al., 2023, Li et al., 2022) levels. Sidechain creation
    using reinforcement learning methods, such as Q Learning, improves network throughput
    and security levels. Methods Currently Available for Assessing and Controlling
    Soil Quality Various approaches to measuring and controlling soil quality have
    been proposed for use in agricultural settings. Data integrity is ensured by using
    ITM (Insertion Through Mining) technologies built on the blockchain. CycleGAN
    (Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network) generates synthetic soil images
    using deep learning techniques. The DIVM (Decentralized Intelligent Voting Model)
    takes into account soil management decisions. Energy efficiency and security in
    TinyML and IoT networks, soil quality monitoring and management in agriculture,
    the potential of TinyML for real-time analytics, and existing methodologies are
    all highlighted at the end of the literature review. Given this requirement and
    impetus for further study, here propose a TinyML model that is low-energy, secure,
    and quick to run in order to address the drawbacks of existing approaches and
    provide viable solutions for real-time soil quality monitoring and management
    in agriculture process. Thus, researchers have investigated lightweight machine
    learning algorithms and techniques for deploying TinyML models in order to overcome
    these obstacles. These strategies aim to reduce energy consumption, minimize latency,
    and preserve acceptable levels of precision. Utilizing low-power microcontrollers,
    task partitioning, DVFS, genetic algorithm-based sleep/wake strategies, and energy
    harvesting, agriculture scenarios can deploy efficient and real-time soil quality
    monitoring and management systems. 3. Discussion on deploying an efficient power-aware
    & delay-aware TinyML for soil quality monitoring and management in agriculture
    This section discusses the design of a power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model
    for soil quality monitoring and management in agricultural scenarios. As shown
    in Fig. 1, the proposed method combines an enhanced fusion of Dynamic Voltage
    and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms,
    Energy Harvesting, and Task Partitioning processes. The goal is to reduce energy
    consumption, minimize delay, and keep precision comparable to existing methods.

    and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a power management technique that dynamically
    adjusts the processor''s operating voltage and clock frequency based on the load.
    By adjusting these parameters, the system''s power consumption can be optimized
    while performance requirements are met. DVFS is commonly used to reduce power
    consumption in real-time scenarios for devices with limited resources. In this
    instance, the DFVS Model initially estimates device power using Eq. (1), (1) The
    power consumed by a device is the product of its operating voltage and current,
    thus, by reducing either voltage or current, the power consumption can be reduced
    for different scenarios. Similarly, the energy is estimated via Eq. (2), (2) Similarly,
    the performance level of the device can be observed from Fig. 3, (3) Where, represents
    total instructions executed per cycle, while represents the clock frequency levels.
    Performance is a measure of how many instructions can be executed per clock cycle
    for the clock frequency sets. Download : Download high-res image (413KB) Download

    under real-time scenarios. To maintain adequate performance levels while reducing
    power, the clock frequency can be adjusted accordingly for different scenarios.
    Thus, in terms of clock frequency, the energy levels of the device can be estimated
    via Eq. (4), (4) Consequently, the energy consumption of a device is proportional
    to the square of its voltage and clock frequency. By decreasing voltage or clock
    frequency, energy consumption can be reduced significantly for various workloads.
    Voltage and clock frequency are dynamically adjusted based on workload and performance
    requirements to reduce power consumption via DVFS. When the workload is light
    or the computer is idle, the voltage and clock frequency can be decreased to reduce
    energy consumption. In contrast, voltage and clock frequency can be increased
    to ensure adequate performance levels during periods of high computational demand.
    Eq. (5) is used to estimate the Q Level for each classification on the TinyML
    Model in order to accomplish this task, (5) Where, represents total number of
    classifications that were performed on the TinyML Device, while tc & T represents
    total number of correctly classified samples, and total number of samples used
    during the classification process. Similar classifications were done for different
    samples, and a reward value was estimated via Eq. (6), (6) Where, represents a
    discounting factor for the learning process. If the reward value , then there
    is need to modify the Voltage & Frequency levels via Eqs. (7), (8), otherwise
    the Voltage & Frequency is modified via Eqs. (9), (10), (7) (8) Else, (9) (10)
    Based on this process, the model is able to optimize operating frequency for efficient
    DVFS operations. By optimizing the voltage and clock frequency based on the workload,
    DVFS allows for power reduction in TinyML deployments. This technique is crucial
    for resource-constrained devices as it helps extend battery life, reduce energy
    consumption, and enhance energy efficiency without sacrificing performance levels.
    Similar to this, an efficient Genetic Algorithm-based Sleep/Wake Strategy is employed
    to conserve power during idle temporal instance sets. Genetic algorithms are used
    to optimize the sleep/wake scheduling based on historical data and environmental
    conditions. The genetic algorithm iteratively evolves a population of potential
    solutions and selects the fittest individuals for the next generations. To perform
    this task, initially a set of Solutions are generated, and each solution has stochastic
    values of Sleep Cycles (SC), which are estimated via Eq. (11), (11) Based on this
    Sleep Cycle, the TinyML Model is evaluated, and its fitness is estimated via Eq.
    (12) (12) Where, represents the delay needed to perform given classifications.
    Using this fitness value from all solutions, the fitness threshold is calculated
    via Eq. (13), (13) Solutions with are ‘mutated’ and regenerated via Eqs. (11),
    (12), while other solutions are passed directly to the next set of iterations
    via ‘crossover’ operations. This process is repeated for Iterations, and Solution
    with minimum fitness is selected for the final estimation of sleep cycles. This
    process allows for identification of optimal sleep cycles for efficient processing
    of data samples with high-speed levels, and is cascaded with an efficient energy
    harvesting process. Energy harvesting techniques involve capturing and converting
    ambient energy sources (such as solar power, kinetic energy, or thermal energy)
    into electrical energy to power the TinyML devices & samples. This reduces dependence
    on batteries and extends the operational lifetime of the devices under different
    scenarios. Energy harvesting is a technique that involves capturing and converting
    ambient energy sources into electrical energy to power TinyML devices for different
    scenarios. By utilizing energy harvesting, the dependence on batteries can be
    reduced or eliminated, thereby extending the operational lifetime of the device
    and reducing power consumption levels. The power harvested ( ) is initially calculated
    via Eq. (14), (14) Where, is the power efficiency of a given source, while represents
    current levels from that set of sources. The power harvested from the ambient
    energy source is determined by the energy conversion efficiency of the harvesting
    system and the intensity of the available energy sources. The energy conversion
    efficiency represents the effectiveness of the energy harvesting system in converting
    the captured energy into usable electrical power levels. Based on this, the energy
    stored (ES) on the device is estimated via Eq. (15), (15) The harvested energy
    is stored for future calculations. Total stored energy is equal to the product
    of the amount of energy harvested and the amount of time it has been accumulating
    for the given source sets. This stored energy can be used to power TinyML devices
    while they are in operation. The proposed energy harvesting system takes advantage
    of Solar Energy, Thermal Energy, and Radiofrequency Energy, as it is connected
    to farms with abundant Solar Radiation, Heat, and RF signals. Rechargeable batteries
    store the harvested energy. During operation, the stored energy is used to power
    the TinyML device, reducing the need for external power sources. By incorporating
    energy harvesting techniques into TinyML deployments, power consumption was decreased
    and the device''s operational lifetime was increased for various scenarios. This
    allows for continuous and autonomous operation, making it ideal for applications
    in remote or inaccessible environments where frequent battery replacements are
    impractical under real-world conditions. Similar to Sleep Cycle optimizations,
    an effective Task Partitioning Method was implemented, which assisted in reducing
    energy & delay levels for various TinyML operation sets. The power & delay-aware
    task partitioning equation aims to minimize the TinyML system''s energy consumption
    while maximizing task execution levels. The model uses Genetic Algorithm to partition
    tasks stochastically, and then estimates Task Partitioning Fitness using Eq. (16),
    (16) Where, represents Number of Stochastic partitions which were done during
    generation of GA solutions. Based on similar ‘mutation’ & ‘crossover’ operations,
    this model is able to identify efficient value of which can minimize the delay
    & energy levels during execution on TinyML device sets. A combination of these
    methods was deployed on the TinyML device, which assisted in reducing energy consumption,
    reduce delay needed for processing, while maintaining higher accuracy levels for
    different scenarios. The model is able to efficiently perform communications with
    different sensors, and process their data samples with high precision, accuracy
    & recall levels. To further strengthen the deployment capabilities of the model,
    all processed data samples are stored on blockchains. To maintain better energy
    performance, an effective Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency (PoEE) based consensus is
    used while addition of new blocks. The PoEE Model requests an augmented cluster
    of nearby nodes with higher energy efficiency to perform consensus. This is facilitated
    via Eq. (17), where an augmented consensus score (CS) is calculated for each node,
    (17) Where, represents energy consumed by the node during the communication, while
    represents residual energy of the current node, and represents number of communications
    that are done by the node during temporal evaluation process. Nodes with lower
    value of are used for the mining process, which ensures that nodes that have consumed
    lower energy during previous communications, and have higher residual energy are
    selected for the consensus process. These nodes are used to add new blocks to
    the chain, which assists in securing the model from data modification attacks.
    But as the number of blocks increase, the energy requirement for adding these
    blocks also increases. To overcome this issue, an iterative Q Learning based model
    is used to form multiple sidechains. This model estimates an iterative Q Value
    after a stochastic set of communications. The number of stochastic communications
    is evaluated via Eq. (18), (18) Where, is a reward value, which is estimated by
    the Q Learning process (initially set to 1), while is the previous number of communications
    used for the evaluation process. After each set of communications, a Q Value is
    estimated via Eq. (19), (19) Where, THR & d represents the throughput obtained
    and delay needed during these communications. After estimation of this value consecutively
    for more than 2 set of communications, a reward value is estimated via equation
    (20), (20) Where, represents Learning Rate for the model, while represents discount
    factor for the evaluation process. If the value of , then it indicates the current
    set of communications required lower energy consumption, and had higher throughput,
    thus the current blockchain configuration is not modified, else, the blockchain
    is split into 2 equal sidechains. New blocks are added to any of the sidechains.
    This allows the model to securely communicate different data samples while maintaining
    lower delay and lower energy consumption for different communications. Evaluation
    of this model was done in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, delay and energy
    levels in the next section of this text. 4. Comparative result analysis The proposed
    secure, delay-aware & energy-aware model for TinyML deployments uses a fusion
    of DVFS, Energy Harvesting, Sleep Cycle Optimization, Task Partitioning & Q Learning
    with PoEE, which assists in reducing the delay & energy during classification,
    while maintaining higher Precision (P), Accuracy (A), & Recall (R) levels even
    under attacks. To validate performance of this model, this section is segregated
    into 2 parts. Part 1 demonstrates the QoS & classification performance of the
    model under non-attack ideal conditions, while part 2 showcases the QoS performance
    of the model under attacks. This will assist readers to identify model’s performance
    under real-time scenarios. 4.1. QoS & classification performance under non-attack
    (ideal) scenarios In this section, the proposed model is estimated under non-attack
    (ideal) scenario, and levels of precision (P), accuracy (A), and recall (R), were
    estimated under these scenarios. These levels were estimated via Eqs. (21), (22),
    (23) as follows, (21) (22) (23) Where, represents the standard true & false rates
    for different operations. Similar to this, the delay & energy levels were estimated
    via Eqs. (24), (25) as follows, (24) (25) Where, represents timestamps for completion
    & starting the classification operations, while represents residual energy levels
    of the node during different communication operations. These metrics were estimated
    using Mini VGGNet, Tiny ImageNet, and Tiny GoogLeNet Models, each of which were
    tested on the following datasets & samples, • Soil Geographic Databases (https://www.isric.org/explore/soil-geographic-databases).
    • European Soil Datasets (https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resource-type/datasets).
    • NLDAS Soils Datasets and Illustration (https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/soils).
    A fusion of these sets resulted in 500 k different image samples, out of which
    400 k were used for training, while 50 k each were used for validation & testing
    use cases. A sample of these images can be observed from Fig. 2, Fig. 3, where
    different disease types, and soil yield levels can be observed for multiple scenarios.
    The model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi Board, and the ensemble techniques were
    integrated in it for multiple classification scenarios. Based on this strategy,
    the precision of classification was estimated and compared with ITM (Wu et al.,
    2022); CycleGAN (Efremova, Seddik, Erten, & Using, 2022), & DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022), which can be observed from Fig. 4 as follows, Download : Download high-res
    image (128KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Precision levels obtained
    during the classification process. On the basis of this evaluation, it can be
    concluded that the proposed model is capable of predicting soil yield with high
    precision under real-time conditions. Due to the use of true-positive levels during
    the Genetic Algorithm optimization process, this precision is maintained. Similarly,
    the accuracy obtained during these evaluations is depicted in Fig. 5 as follows,

    Fig. 5. Accuracy levels obtained during the classification process. Based on this
    assessment, it can be seen that the suggested model can continue to predict soil
    yields with high accuracy levels in real-time scenarios. Due to the use of true-positive
    levels during the Genetic Algorithm & DVFS Q Learning optimization process, this
    accuracy is preserved. Similar to that, Fig. 6 shows the recall obtained during
    these evaluations as follows, Download : Download high-res image (169KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Recall levels obtained during the classification
    process. This evaluation shows that the suggested model can consistently predict
    disease and soil yield with high recall levels in real-world scenarios. The use
    of true-positive levels during the Genetic Algorithm & DVFS Q Learning optimization
    process ensures that this recall is maintained for different scenarios. Similar
    to Fig. 6, the following can be seen from Fig. 7 regarding the delay required
    during these evaluations, Download : Download high-res image (227KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Delay needed during the classification process.
    On the basis of this evaluation, it can be concluded that the proposed model can
    reduce soil yield prediction delay by 8.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022),
    10.0 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 15.4 % compared to DIVM
    (Yang et al., 2022) under real-time conditions. This delay is decreased due to
    the utilization of ensemble Models that employ Genetic Algorithm & Q Learning
    in conjunction with harvesting optimizations, which aids in high-seed yield prediction
    for various soil types. Similarly, the energy required for these evaluations is
    depicted in Fig. 8 as follows, Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Energy needed during the classification process.
    On the basis of this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can reduce
    the energy required for soil yield prediction by 15.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et
    al., 2022), 18.3 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 16.5 % compared
    to DIVM (Yang et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios. Multiple optimizations, such
    as Task Partitioning, Energy Harvesting, Sleep Scheduling, and DVFS operations,
    reduce this energy consumption in real-time scenarios. Consequently, the proposed
    model exhibited optimal levels of accuracy, precision, and recall while maintaining
    a higher rate of operation and reduced energy consumption levels. These features
    enable the model to be deployed for a wide range of TinyML use cases and real-time
    scenarios. 4.2. QoS performance of the model under different attacks To further
    validate the model’s performance under real-time scenarios. It was evaluated under
    Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. The Finney attack
    is illustrative of the kind of validation attacks that may be launched against
    IoT networks. An enemy who is also a miner on the blockchain network conceals
    a valid transaction inside a fraudulent one. The attacker operates in concert,
    launching a network transaction and mining a block that includes it concurrently.
    An adversary may then use the extracted block in a transaction, such as making
    a purchase or sending money. This allows the opponent to gain from the exchange
    without bearing any of the burdens. The Sybil attack is another common kind of
    validation attack in IoT networks. A bad actor creates a network of fake nodes,
    each of which is an identity. The network may be manipulated or controlled using
    these bogus identities. By adopting several false identities inside the network,
    an adversary might trick other nodes into believing false information or taking
    part in malicious activities by exploiting the network''s trust mechanisms. This
    kind of attack has the potential to cause a wide range of security and integrity
    problems, including tampered with data, interrupted communications, and unwanted
    access to sensitive information sets. Masquerade attacks, sometimes called impersonation
    attacks, target IoT networks by assuming the identity of a trusted actor. In this
    kind of attack, sensitive information or resources are accessed by pretending
    to be a trusted device or user. By masquerading as a trusted entity, an attacker
    may bypass protections and carry out malicious activities including taking complete
    control of a device, stealing sensitive information, or executing illegal commands.
    The need of secure access control and authentication mechanisms in IoT networks
    was brought home by this assault. MitM refers to a “man-in-the-middle” assault.
    This validation attack takes advantage of the insecurity of IoT network communication
    channels. An attacker changes legitimate communication between two parties in
    this attack. An attacker may do harm by intercepting communications, tampering
    with the data in transit, or even injecting harmful orders or data. The confidentiality,
    integrity, and validity of the communication might be jeopardized by this assault,
    which could lead to data breaches, unauthorized device control, or other undesirable
    outcomes in the Internet of Things. Secure communication mechanisms, such encryption
    and digital signatures, are needed to combat this risk and safeguard the confidentiality
    and authenticity of information shared across IoT networks. After application
    of these attacks, values of end-to-end communication delay, energy needed during
    communications, throughput during communication and PDR levels were estimated
    for evaluation purposes. A total of 10 % of all network communications were stochastically
    simulated as attacks, and average levels of delay, energy, throughput & PDR were
    estimated for each of these attack scenarios. Based on this strategy, the delay
    levels under attack can be observed from Fig. 9, Download : Download high-res
    image (136KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Average level of delay
    under different attacks. On the basis of this evaluation, it can be concluded
    that the proposed model can reduce delay during communication under attack for
    soil prediction scenarios by 4.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 12.4 % compared
    to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 8.3 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022) under real-time conditions. This delay is decreased due to the utilization
    of Q Learning for the formation of sidechains, in conjunction with PoEE based
    consensus, which aids in higher-speed of the network even under multiple attacks.
    Similarly, the energy required for these evaluations is depicted in Fig. 10 as
    follows, Download : Download high-res image (235KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. Average level of energy under different attacks. On the basis of
    this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can reduce the energy required
    for communication by 4.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 16.4 % compared
    to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 18.5 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022) in real-time scenarios. Multiple optimizations, including Q Learning & PoEE
    consensus, reduce this energy consumption in real-time scenarios. Similarly, the
    throughput levels can be observed from Fig. 11 as follows, Download : Download
    high-res image (181KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Throughput
    levels for different communication scenarios. On the basis of this evaluation,
    it is clear that the proposed model can improve the throughput during communication
    by 10.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 12.5 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova
    et al., 2022), and 18.3 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios.
    This is due to use of throughput during Q Learning optimizations, which assists
    in formation of sidechains. Similarly, the PDR levels can be observed from Fig.
    12 as follows, Download : Download high-res image (153KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. PDR levels for different communication scenarios. On
    the basis of this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can improve
    the PDR during communication by 1.9 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 2.4 %
    compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 2.5 % compared to DIVM (Yang
    et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios. This is due to use of PDR during Q Learning
    optimizations, which assists in formation of sidechains. Due to these optimizations,
    the proposed model is capable of deployment for an augmented & wide variety of
    real-time scenarios. 5. Conclusion and future scope In conclusion, this paper
    presents an innovative method for deploying an energy-efficient, secure, and high-speed
    TinyML model designed specifically for agricultural soil quality monitoring and
    management. The proposed model addresses the urgent need for precise and sustainable
    agricultural practices by enabling real-time decision-making in environments with
    limited resources. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies
    based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting, and Task Partitioning are among
    the optimization techniques incorporated into the model. In comparison to cutting-edge
    techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks
    (RNNs), and Q Learning, these techniques effectively reduce the model''s energy
    consumption by 8.5 % and delay by 10.4 % without compromising accuracy. To ensure
    the security and integrity of the model, a consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency
    (PoEE) is utilized. The model employs a lightweight consensus supported by sidechain
    formation based on Q Learning, which increases security without significantly
    increasing energy needs. The performance of the model is rigorously evaluated
    under multiple attack scenarios, such as Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and Man-in-the-Middle
    attacks, demonstrating its resilience and efficacy in real-time scenarios. Significant
    practical implications result from the proposed model in the agricultural field.
    By continuously monitoring soil quality parameters like moisture content, pH level,
    and nutrient levels, farmers can optimize irrigation, fertilization, and resource
    allocation, leading to an increase in soil yield and a decrease in environmental
    impact. Incorporating sensors and low-power microcontrollers into the model enables
    on-site analysis and immediate feedback to farmers, thereby facilitating timely
    interventions and treatments. The performance evaluation of the model demonstrates
    its superiority to existing techniques. The proposed model reduces communication
    delay by 4.5 % relative to ITM, 12.4 % relative to CycleGAN, and 8.0 % relative
    to DIVM under real-time conditions. Furthermore, its energy consumption is reduced
    by 4.5 % compared to ITM, 16.4 % compared to CycleGAN, and 18.0 % compared to
    DIVM. The model also demonstrates an increase in throughput of 10.5 % versus ITM,
    12.5 % versus CycleGAN, and 18.3 % versus DIVM, as well as an increase in Packet
    Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 1.9 % versus ITM, 2.4 % versus CycleGAN, and 2.5 % versus
    DIVM. The proposed energy-efficient, secure, and high-speed TinyML model provides
    an innovative solution for real-time monitoring and management of soil quality
    in agriculture. By reducing energy consumption, minimizing communication delay,
    and increasing throughput and PDR levels, the model enables farmers to make timely
    decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and practice sustainable agriculture.
    The model''s efficacy, dependability, and applicability to a vast array of real-world
    scenarios are ensured by the incorporation of advanced optimization techniques
    and robust security measures. With the potential to revolutionize soil management
    practices, the proposed model holds great promise for future agricultural productivity,
    environmental impact reduction, and food security promotion process. CRediT authorship

    Bamboo, a versatile and rapidly renewable resource, has played an essential role
    in human civilization for centuries (Bystriakova et al., 2004). The Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) estimates that 2.5 billion people, or 40% of the world''s population,
    rely on bamboo for economic livelihood. Additionally, bamboo serves as a traditional
    housing material for at least one billion individuals. It is distributed across
    the globe in the form of grass with a remarkable range of 1707species from 128
    genera, each with unique characteristics and water requirements, which holds a
    key to sustainable development and resource conservation (Liese and Köhl, 2015,
    Sawarkar et al., 2023). In this context, water management emerges as a critical
    factor in nurturing bamboo ecosystems, ensuring their vitality, and harnessing
    their full potential. Bamboo encompasses a diverse array of species, with each
    exhibiting distinct growth patterns, sizes, and habitat preferences (Ramakrishnan
    et al., 2020). From the towering giants of the Bambusa genus to the delicate,
    clumping forms of Chusquea, bamboo thrives in diverse environments across the
    globe (M. Chen et al., 2021). These variations in species contribute to the plant''s
    adaptability and resilience, making it an invaluable natural resource for land
    restoration (Liese and Köhl, 2015, Sawarkar et al., 2023). Water, the lifeblood
    of bamboo and all living organisms, assumes different levels of significance for
    various bamboo species (Páscoa et al., 2020). Some species exhibit remarkable
    drought tolerance and can thrive with minimal water resources, while others demand
    a more abundant water supply to achieve their full potential (Liese & Köhl, 2015).
    Understanding these unique water requirements is fundamental to the sustainable
    management of bamboo forests and plantations (Yuan et al., 2017). Effective water
    management in bamboo ecosystems is not only essential for the health and vigour
    of the plants but also holds broader implications for ecosystem services, environmental
    sustainability, and human well-being (Emamverdian et al., 2020, Ramakrishnan et
    al., 2020). Water management practices that balance the needs of bamboo with those
    of the surrounding environment can help mitigate soil erosion, maintain water
    quality, and provide habitat for diverse flora and fauna (Liese & Köhl, 2015).
    Moreover, bamboo''s capacity for rapid growth and carbon sequestration positions
    it as a valuable ally in the fight against climate change (Ashour et al., 2023).
    This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of bamboo, its various
    species, their specific water requirements, and the crucial role of water management
    in harnessing the potential of this remarkable resource (M. Chen et al., 2021).
    As the world grapples with the increasing challenges of water scarcity and environmental
    conservation, efficient water management becomes paramount in bamboo cultivation,
    echoing the broader principles of responsible resource utilization (D. Chen et
    al., 2014). This paper explores the transformative potential of AquaBamboo, an
    innovative precision irrigation system meticulously designed to cater to the specific
    water needs of bamboo, ultimately advancing its sustainable growth and ecological
    significance (Schöning et al., 2023). Historical records emphasize the dire consequences
    of water scarcity on agriculture, underlining the urgency of seeking innovative
    solutions (Ntaliani et al., 2008). Traditional irrigation methods, while functional,
    fall short when applied to bamboo (Erenstein, 2002). They are often marred by
    indiscriminate water application, resulting in uneven moisture distribution, wastage
    of this precious resource, and potential stress on bamboo crops, thereby affecting
    yields (Gupta, 2022). Furthermore, the reliance on fixed irrigation schedules
    and the absence of real-time data integration exacerbates these limitations (D.
    Chen et al., 2014). This lack of adaptability hinders the precise delivery of
    water tailored to varying soil conditions and the unique requirements of bamboo
    species, compounding inefficiencies and compromising the health of the bamboo
    (Cheng et al., 2022). These challenges not only undermine bamboo productivity
    but also strain water resources and contribute to environmental degradation (Surya
    & Aroquiaraj, 2018). In the pursuit of harnessing bamboo''s full potential, precise
    water management emerges as a critical factor. The AquaBamboo Precision Irrigation
    system, born out of a necessity to address the nuanced water requirements of bamboo,
    has undergone a remarkable evolutionary journey. Originating from insights gained

    Performance Evaluation 3.5.1. Precision water management principles for sustainable
    bamboo growth The incorporation of a comprehensive hardware and software configuration
    empowers AquaBamboo with the dynamic capability to respond to ever-changing environmental
    conditions and optimize water usage for the sustainable growth of bamboo (Sawarkar
    et al., 2023, Sawarkar et al., 2023, Yadav and Mathur, 2021) This integrated approach
    addresses the shortcomings of traditional irrigation methods, positioning AquaBamboo
    as a promising solution for advancing sustainable precision agriculture. Penman-monteith
    equation for bamboo evapotranspiration (ET): The Penman-Monteith equation, a foundational
    tool in precision irrigation (Fao et al., 2015), is adept at estimating evapotranspiration,
    which encompasses the collective water loss due to bamboo transpiration and soil
    evaporation. This equation accounts for crucial environmental factors, including
    temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. Where:ET is the evapotranspiration
    rate (mm/day).∆ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa/°C).
    is the net radiation (MJ/m²/day).G is the soil heat flux density (MJ/m²/day).γ
    is the psychrometric constant (kPa/°C).T is the air temperature (°C). is the wind
    speed at 2 m above the surface (m/s). is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa).
    is the actual vapor pressure (kPa). Crop water requirement calculation for bamboo:
    The crop water requirement can be calculated based on the evapotranspiration rate
    and other factors specific to the bamboo''s growth stage and environmental conditions.
    Where: is the crop coefficient representing bamboo''s water use efficiency.A is
    the area of the bamboo cultivation field (m²). These fundamental equations are
    at the core of precision irrigation systems like AquaBamboo, enabling the determination
    of the optimal amount of water needed for bamboo based on a comprehensive understanding
    of various environmental factors (Rao et al., 2022). Parameters such as and A
    are fine-tuned to match the bamboo species and local conditions. Advanced bamboo-specific
    crop water requirement calculation: AquaBamboo takes precision to the next level
    by employing a sophisticated model for calculating bamboo-specific evapotranspiration
    ( . This model considers a range of influencing parameters: Where: represents
    bamboo-specific evapotranspiration (mm/day), accounting for water transpiration
    by bamboo and evaporation from soil and crop surfaces. is the bamboo-specific
    crop coefficient, indicating bamboo''s water usage concerning reference evapotranspiration
    ). is the reference evapotranspiration, representing water loss from a well-watered
    grass reference crop under standard conditions. are reduction factors due to mulching
    or ground cover, soil water stress, and salinity stress, respectively (Fao et
    al., 2015). AquaBamboo''s data-driven irrigation approach aligns seamlessly with
    this intricate model. By collecting real-time data from IoT sensors, which encompass
    critical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, AquaBamboo
    determines to reflect the specific state of the bamboo and its immediate environment
    (Nkeuwa et al., 2022). Additionally, acts as a benchmark for gauging bamboo water
    requirements. AquaBamboo continuously calculates through the integration of weather
    data and sophisticated analytics, allowing it to adapt to dynamic weather patterns
    and ensure precise irrigation. Moreover, the reduction factors ( ) are influenced
    by various variables, all of which AquaBamboo incorporates into its decision-making
    process (Tiwari et al., 2019). Real-time soil moisture data helps assess soil
    water stress ( ), guiding precise irrigation interventions. The system''s adaptability
    to changing weather conditions and its ability to tailor irrigation schedules
    to bamboo needs contribute to mitigating salinity stress ( ). 3.5.2. Equation:
    Precision Irrigation in Action The equation I = k * D represents the core principle
    behind precision irrigation, where \"I\" denotes the irrigation amount required,
    \"D\" signifies the soil moisture deficit, and \"k\" represents the irrigation
    efficiency factor (Nkeuwa et al., 2022). Precision irrigation is a critical practice
    in modern agriculture, aimed at optimizing water usage for healthy crop growth.
    • I (Irrigation amount): This variable quantifies the amount of water needed for
    irrigation, calculated by multiplying the soil moisture deficit (D) by the irrigation
    efficiency factor (k). • D (Soil moisture deficit): Soil moisture deficit signifies
    the shortfall in soil water content compared to the ideal level required for healthy
    plant growth. It considers factors such as evaporation, plant water uptake, and
    precipitation. • k (Irrigation efficiency factor): The irrigation efficiency factor
    reflects the system''s effectiveness in delivering water to the root zone. It
    takes into account various factors like system losses and distribution efficiency.
    In the context of AquaBamboo and precision bamboo agriculture (Nkeuwa et al.,
    2022), this equation plays a pivotal role. By continuously monitoring soil moisture
    levels through IoT sensors (Cabarcas et al., 2019), AquaBamboo accurately calculates
    the soil moisture deficit and determines the precise amount of water needed to
    optimize soil moisture levels for bamboo growth. The efficiency constant (k) embodies
    AquaBamboo''s capacity to maximize water usage efficiency, ensuring that each
    unit of water applied contributes effectively to bamboo hydration and growth while
    minimizing wastage In essence, AquaBamboo''s data-driven approach seamlessly harmonizes
    with the complexity of the advanced bamboo-specific crop water requirement model.
    This alignment empowers AquaBamboo to optimize water delivery with unparalleled
    precision, thereby enhancing bamboo health and yield while contributing significantly
    to sustainable water management practices (Rao et al., 2022). The Fig. 3 illustrates
    the AquaBamboo data-driven precision irrigation system. It commences with IoT
    sensors collecting real-time bamboo-specific data, including soil moisture, temperature,
    and other critical parameters (A) (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh, 2020). This data
    is then transmitted to the Control System (B), where it is integrated and amalgamated
    for analysis (C) (Yousaf et al., 2023). The Control System performs data analysis
    (D), utilizing advanced algorithms to derive actionable insights from the collected
    data. Download : Download high-res image (75KB) Download : Download full-size

    analyzed insights, informed irrigation decisions are made (E) (Nkeuwa et al.,
    2022). These decisions thoughtfully factor in bamboo water requirements, dynamically
    evolving weather conditions, and other relevant variables. Subsequently, the Control
    System translates these decisions into specific instructions to regulate the Irrigation
    Infrastructure (F) (Yen et al., 2021). This infrastructure meticulously manages
    the delivery of water (G) (Yen et al., 2021), ensuring that each bamboo plant
    receives the precise amount of water tailored to its unique needs. This intricate
    and interconnected system, from data collection to precise water delivery, embodies
    the core principles of AquaBamboo''s data-driven precision irrigation, facilitating
    not only efficient but also adaptive bamboo water management (Tiwari et al., 2019).

    Precision Irrigation The empirical implementation of AquaBamboo across diverse
    scenarios has unveiled its remarkable potential to revolutionize bamboo agriculture.
    By harnessing real-time data and intelligent decision-making, AquaBamboo consistently
    demonstrates its capacity to optimize water usage, elevate crop health, and significantly
    increase yields. AquaBamboo unequivocally demonstrated its ability to minimize
    water wastage while ensuring optimal bamboo hydration (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh,
    2020). Through the continuous monitoring of soil moisture levels facilitated by
    its network of IoT sensors (Cabarcas et al., 2019), AquaBamboo dynamically adjusted
    irrigation schedules and water distribution. The results were striking: a substantial
    reduction in water consumption without any compromise in bamboo crop health (Xu
    et al., 2022). AquaBamboo''s precision in tailoring irrigation interventions to
    the actual needs of bamboo plants emerged as a game-changing solution, particularly
    in regions facing water scarcity challenges (Abioye et al., 2020). Furthermore,
    AquaBamboo''s data-driven approach translated into remarkable improvements in
    bamboo crop health and yield (Sawarkar, Shrimankar, Kumar, et al., 2023). The
    system''s analytics provided critical insights into bamboo plant responses to
    varying water levels, empowering farmers to fine-tune irrigation strategies (Kleinhenz
    & Midmore, 2001). This precision resulted in healthier bamboo plants with well-established
    root systems, leading to a significant overall increase in bamboo yield (Tiwari
    et al., 2019). Additionally, AquaBamboo''s adaptability allowed for swift responses
    to sudden weather shifts, shielding bamboo crops from water stress during unexpected
    dry spells (Prasad Nirala et al., 1996). The success of AquaBamboo can be attributed
    to the harmonious synergy of data integration, advanced analytics, and responsive
    irrigation (Boursianis et al., 2021). Through continuous data collection and analysis
    (Lin et al., 2019), the system adeptly identified patterns and trends, enabling
    it to predict optimal irrigation schedules. This predictive capability ensured
    that bamboo crops received water precisely when needed, fostering accelerated
    growth rates and higher overall yields (Ranieri et al., 2020). In Fig. 4 (insights
    based on (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh, 2020)), we visually depict the fundamental
    contrast between two distinct bamboo irrigation approaches: Traditional Irrigation
    and AquaBamboo''s Data-Driven Approach. This graphical representation employs
    two columns to illustrate the flow of water distribution for each method. • Traditional
    Irrigation (Left Column): This conventional approach relies on a uniform irrigation
    schedule, often leading to inefficient water distribution (Field, 2021). Uneven
    moisture levels across the bamboo field result in over-watering in some areas
    and under-watering in others, failing to address specific water requirements of
    different bamboo types and soil conditions. • AquaBamboo''s Data-Driven Approach
    (Right Column): AquaBamboo''s innovative methodology leverages real-time data
    collection to guide precise water delivery (Field, 2021). It considers factors
    such as soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and the unique needs of different
    bamboo varieties. By integrating IoT sensors and advanced analytics (Field, 2021),
    AquaBamboo ensures water is delivered precisely where and when it is needed the
    most. This targeted approach optimizes water usage, prevents over-watering or
    under-watering, and significantly enhances bamboo health and growth. Download

    vs. Tradition: Transforming Bamboo agriculture. In summary, this diagram effectively
    highlights the fundamental distinctions between traditional and data-driven bamboo
    irrigation methods (Xu et al., 2022). It visually portrays how AquaBamboo''s approach
    overcomes the limitations of uniform irrigation by utilizing real-time data for
    tailored water distribution, resulting in more efficient water utilization and
    improved bamboo outcomes (Tiwari et al., 2019). Fig. 5 (insights based on (Kleinhenz
    & Midmore, 2001)) visually portrays the correlation between soil moisture levels
    and both crop health scores (measured on a scale of 0–100) and crop yield (measured
    in kilograms). The x-axis represents soil moisture levels as a percentage, while
    the left y-axis quantifies crop health scores, and the right y-axis represents
    crop yield. As soil moisture levels increase, both crop health scores and crop
    yield exhibit a positive trend (Abioye et al., 2020). This correlation underscores
    the significance of maintaining optimal soil moisture levels for optimal bamboo
    crop performance. AquaBamboo''s precise water management, driven by real-time
    data, contributes to this positive correlation by ensuring that bamboo plants
    receive the right amount of water at the right time, leading to improved health
    and higher yields (Boursianis et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image

  description: By quantifying the soil water movement (SWM) in crop planting systems,
    we can better understand the soil water consumption (SWC) and crop yield relationship;
    this finding is significant for determining the field water cycle and reducing
    agricultural water waste. In this paper, a case study was conducted on cotton
    production. Soil moisture sensors were set at depths of 10–110 cm under three
    cotton cropping systems (monoculture cotton (MC), wheat/delayed intercropped cotton
    (WIC), and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (WDC)) based on spatial grid methods; a
    geostatistical grid calculus was used to calculate SWM; and the crop and meteorological
    influence mechanisms on cotton lint yield were comprehensively analyzed. At the
    squaring stage, SWC and vertical SWM were significantly correlated with light,
    temperature and water conditions. At the flowering and boll development stage,
    SWC and vertical SWM were collectively affected by meteorological conditions and
    crops, and they were positively correlated with lint yield. The aboveground and
    belowground biomass accumulation at the flowering and boll development stage positively
    affected vertical SWM in and between cotton rows. Vertical SWM in cotton rows
    increased SWC in cotton rows. SWC in cotton rows and aboveground biomass positively
    impacted lint yield formation; SWC between rows negatively impacted lint yield.
    The SWC and vertical SWM between rows in the MC seedling stage exceeded those
    in cotton rows, and more precise irrigation at the seedling stage reduced water
    waste. The WIC horizontal SWC at the squaring and flowering and boll opening stages
    was relatively high, moving from the row midline to cotton row. A better SWC distribution
    in and between cotton rows promoted water utilization in the cotton rows; this
    method was feasible for improving cotton yield in diverse planting systems. The
    results could optimize precision irrigation management at different cotton growth
    stages and provide a theoretical reference for promoting sustainable agricultural
    production and climate adaptation.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Quantifying soil water movement using novel
    geostatistical grid calculus method. • Diversified planting systems promotes horizontal
    soil water movement. • Water and cotton yield relationship are strongest at flowering
    and boll development stage. • Soil water consumption and vertical movement in
    cotton rows increase lint yield. Abstract By quantifying the soil water movement
    (SWM) in crop planting systems, we can better understand the soil water consumption
    (SWC) and crop yield relationship; this finding is significant for determining
    the field water cycle and reducing agricultural water waste. In this paper, a
    case study was conducted on cotton production. Soil moisture sensors were set
    at depths of 10–110 cm under three cotton cropping systems (monoculture cotton
    (MC), wheat/delayed intercropped cotton (WIC), and wheat/direct-seeded cotton
    (WDC)) based on spatial grid methods; a geostatistical grid calculus was used
    to calculate SWM; and the crop and meteorological influence mechanisms on cotton
    lint yield were comprehensively analyzed. At the squaring stage, SWC and vertical
    SWM were significantly correlated with light, temperature and water conditions.
    At the flowering and boll development stage, SWC and vertical SWM were collectively
    affected by meteorological conditions and crops, and they were positively correlated
    with lint yield. The aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation at the flowering
    and boll development stage positively affected vertical SWM in and between cotton
    rows. Vertical SWM in cotton rows increased SWC in cotton rows. SWC in cotton
    rows and aboveground biomass positively impacted lint yield formation; SWC between
    rows negatively impacted lint yield. The SWC and vertical SWM between rows in
    the MC seedling stage exceeded those in cotton rows, and more precise irrigation
    at the seedling stage reduced water waste. The WIC horizontal SWC at the squaring

    midline to cotton row. A better SWC distribution in and between cotton rows promoted
    water utilization in the cotton rows; this method was feasible for improving cotton

    water movementSoil water consumptionPlanting system 1. Introduction Freshwater
    is widely regarded as an important natural resource and has become a globally
    scarce and overexploited resource (Bartram, 2008, Falkenmark, 2008). Agricultural
    activities are important methods for consuming freshwater resources worldwide.
    With climate change becoming increasingly serious, the frequent occurrence of
    high temperatures and drought seriously affects agricultural water security, thus
    impacting regional agricultural production (IPCC, 2014). The climate sensitivity
    of agriculture is affected by technological changes (Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2018).
    While narrowing the gap in crop yield (Mueller et al., 2012), sustainable agricultural
    water management technology has become increasingly important for reducing water
    waste, promoting agricultural adaptation and ensuring food security (Zhang et
    al., 2021b, Howden et al., 2007). In recent years, with the addition of precision
    agriculture sensor technology, the variability and characteristics of soil moisture
    have been monitored. On this basis, combined with a decision support system, sustainable
    precision irrigation technology has been implemented (Zhang et al., 2021a). In
    precision irrigation technology, monitoring the spatiotemporal changes in soil
    moisture in the field is highly important (Mertzanides et al., 2020). Previous
    studies have been conducted from the landscape to the plot scale (Booker et al.,
    2015, Wu et al., 2023), proving the relationship between soil moisture change
    and agricultural productivity (Hu et al., 2020, Pabuayon et al., 2019). Soil water
    movement (SWM) is the cause of spatiotemporal changes in soil water (Liu et al.,
    2020). In farmland ecosystems, atmosphere–plant–soil interactions form a unity
    that plays a key role in the field water cycle; water moves within and among the
    three (Schulze et al., 2019, Jones and Tardieu, 1998). Several studies have shown
    that diversified crop planting systems and crop residues reduce the runoff of
    field water (Zougmore et al., 2000, Sissoko et al., 2013). Different crop planting
    systems adjust the spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture; however, the dynamics
    of topsoil moisture are strongly affected by meteorological factors, especially
    rainfall (Wu et al., 2022b). A study on the movement of soil water vapor on the
    land surface showed that the convective (advective) transport of water vapor may
    be caused by diurnal warming leading to the expansion and contraction of soil
    air (Parlange et al., 1998). Soil water runoff characteristics at relatively high
    depths are comprehensively affected by rainfall, soil texture, crop absorption
    and shallow soil (Jalota et al., 2006, Hess et al., 2018; Tsakmakisa et al., 2019).
    Many previous studies on SWM have focused on theoretical models or laboratory
    studies on soil physics and hydrology, mainly concentrating on the effects of
    soil physical properties or meteorological conditions (Parlange et al., 1998,
    Li et al., 2015). Modeling methods are used in some studies to consider the impacts
    of cultivated crops or agricultural measures on SWM, simulating the evapotranspiration
    of SWM in small areas of vegetation (Paraskevas et al., 2013), the impact of rainfall
    on water runoff in farming systems (Myers, 1996), and SWM under root water absorption
    (Wu et al., 1999). Several studies have explored SWM characteristics in different
    soil layers at the field scale using the spatial grid method combined with the
    geological grid mathematical operation method with semivariance analysis as the
    core, revealing that the trapezoidal rule accurately quantifies the movement volume
    of soil water (Liu et al., 2020). These geostatistical methods have been used
    for monitoring soil nutrients in the field (Song et al., 2016). Semivariance analysis
    may calculate structural parameters of semivariogram, such as the nugget (C0),
    sill (C0+C) and their proportion (C0/C0+C), corresponding to the heterogeneity,
    maximum variation degree and autocorrelation of changes (Hu and Xu, 2018; Mcbratney
    and Webster, 1986). The grid calculus method is a geostatistical method that is
    usually used to calculate slope-related problems. The slope or slope change rate
    information in the specified direction are obtained through directional derivatives
    (Tuma et al., 1979). The first-order directional derivative shows the contour
    with a constant slope along a fixed directional line (Schwartz et al., 1974).
    At a specific grid node location, if the slope is uphill, the slope is positive;
    if the slope is downhill, the slope is negative. This geostatistical grid calculus
    method is used to calculate the SWM and its direction after obtaining the volume
    or spatial distribution of soil water consumption (SWC) (Pabuayon et al., 2019).
    Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is one of the most important industrial crops in
    the world. Since cotton plants exhibit good drought and temperature resistance
    (Abdelraheem et al., 2019), they are suitable for use in arid climates and regions
    (Mao et al., 2019). The Yellow River Basin is one of the three major cotton cultivation
    regions in China (Huang et al., 2023), where a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)–cotton
    double cropping system has been developed to alleviate the contradiction between
    grain and cotton competing for land (Feng et al., 2017). Previous studies have
    shown that monoculture cotton and cotton intercropped with wheat are considered
    to have higher yields and resource utilization efficiencies than cotton direct
    seeding after wheat; this method is a better choice for local people (Wang et
    al., 2020). The adoption of different cotton planting systems affects the spatiotemporal
    changes and consumption characteristics of soil water, which may be closely related
    to the development of roots and reproductive organs (Wu et al., 2022a, Wu et al.,
    2022b). In addition, the competition for soil water during wheat growth (Mahmood-ul-Hassan
    et al., 2013) in the wheat–cotton symbiosis period (generally in the period from
    cotton sowing to seedling emergence) and the influence of crop residues after
    wheat harvest on water evaporation (Lascano et al., 1994) are important factors
    that affect the use of water resources by cotton plants. If we extend the understanding
    of the relationships between SWM and SWC and crop growth and yield under cotton
    monocropping and wheat–cotton intercropping, this approach could aid in precision
    irrigation, further improve the water utilization efficiency of crop production
    in the wheat–cotton double cropping system and ensure crop yield while reducing
    water waste (Zhang et al., 2017, Tang et al., 2010). This study is based on the
    hypothesis that the distribution of spatiotemporal changes in SWM and SWC might
    be affected by different cotton planting systems; and that cotton lint yield may
    respond to the SWM and SWC characteristics at different spatial positions in the
    soil. The objectives of this study are (i) to develop a geostatistical grid calculus
    method based on a sensor network constructed by the spatial grid method for quantifying
    the SWM at different soil positions in the field at different cotton growth stages;
    (ii) to determine the spatial distributions of SWM and SWC in different cotton
    planting systems and the correlations between SWM, SWC, meteorological conditions
    and crop growth; and (iii) to explore the factors influencing the SWM and the
    driving roles of SWM in SWC and the growth and yield formation of cotton crops
    in different planting systems. In this study, a novel method that combines sensor
    network and geostatistical grid calculus for quantifying SWM was developed; this
    method may provide theoretical support for precision agriculture and climate-smart
    agriculture; additionally, it may have important reference value for clean production
    and sustainable agricultural development under global climate change conditions.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental site A 2-year (2016–2017) field experiment
    was conducted at an experimental station (N 36°07´, E 116°22´ with an elevation
    of 76 m) of the Institute of Cotton Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural
    Sciences, Anyang, Henan, China; this station has a semihumid and subtropical monsoon
    climate with a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 544 mm. The experimental site
    had medium loam soil. Weather data were acquired from a weather station near the
    experimental field (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). The weather conditions
    regarding rainfall and temperature differed substantially between the two cotton
    growing seasons (Fig. 1A). During the two-year study, a greater level of precipitation
    (549 mm) and a lower mean temperature (23.1°C) were recorded in 2016. The precipitation
    in 2017 was 351 mm, and the mean temperature was 23.5°C. The precipitation in
    these two years was mainly concentrated in July. The precipitation in July 2016
    was 310 mm and that in July 2017 was 106 mm. On July 19, 2016, there was heavy
    rainfall; the precipitation was 107.5 mm. In 2017, the maximum daily precipitation
    of 46.8 mm occurred on July 16. During the cotton growing period, the temperature
    conditions in 2016 were similar to those in 2017. Download : Download high-res

    design The field experiment included three cotton planting systems (monocultured
    cotton (MC), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/intercropped cotton (WIC), and wheat/direct-seeded
    cotton (WDC)) and use a randomized complete block design with 3 repetitions (Fig.
    1B). The trial cotton cultivar was the early-maturing cultivar Yuzaomian 9110,
    and the wheat cultivar was Zhongyu 1123. In 2016 and 2017, cotton was sown on
    May 15 for both MC and WIC; cotton was sown on June 15 for WDC. Wheat was sown
    on October 26 in 2015 and 2016 and harvested on June 10 in the following year;
    cotton had an intergrowth period of approximately 30 days in WIC. The layout of
    the cropping systems is shown in Fig. 1B. The cotton plants were sown at an intrarow
    spacing of approximately 0.14–0.15 m at a density of 80,000 plants/ha. The row
    spacing was 0.7 m between two cotton rows, 0.2 m between cotton and wheat rows,
    and 0.15 m between two wheat rows. For each of the three wheat rows, one row of
    cotton was planted. The planting system was an integrated factor (including plant,
    soil, and environment); the three cotton planting systems were considered three
    treatments (Ma, 1990). Each experimental individual plot had an area of 31.5 m2,
    a length of 9 m and a width of 3.5 m. Field management was consistent across the
    treatments. According to local practices, all fertilizers were broadcasted evenly
    across the soil and incorporated into the top 20 cm of the soil before sowing.
    During the wheat growth period, N:P:K (13:17:15) compound fertilizer was applied
    as a starter fertilizer to supply 78 kg ha−1 N, 102 kg ha−1 P2O5 and 90 kg ha−1
    K2O before wheat sowing; 260 kg ha−1 urea and 150 kg ha−1 compound fertilizer
    composed of N-P2O5-K2O [17−17−17] were applied during the cotton growing period.
    Trench irrigation (600 m3 ha−1) was applied on March 16, 2016, and 2017. According
    to the suggestions of local agronomists, a total of approximately 40 m3 irrigation
    was applied to flood trenches after the cotton plants were planted. Weeds were
    manually controlled, and pesticides were used to control insects and disease.
    2.3. Crop data collection The cotton growth stages were investigated by 20 tagged
    cotton plants in each plot every three days after cotton emergence. The times
    when the cotton population entered the squaring (50% of cotton plants exhibited
    squares approximately 3 mm in diameter), flowering and boll development (50% of
    cotton plants produced the first white flower), and boll opening (50% of cotton
    plants began to show opened bolls) stages were recorded in 2016 and 2017. The
    results of the survey are shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 shows the environmental conditions
    at different growth stages of cotton plants under the different planting systems.
    Cotton biomass was measured every 15 days beginning at 20 days after sowing (DAS)
    and continuing throughout the cotton growing season until harvest. Ten random
    cotton plants in the middle row of each plot were used to construct the plant
    map to avoid any boundary effects; for each replicate, two plants from each plot
    were randomly uprooted for biomass determination. Depending on the cotton developmental
    stage, the samples were separated into aboveground organs (stems, leaves, flowers,
    and bolls) and belowground organs (roots); afterward, the organs were oven dried
    at 80°C to a constant weight to determine their biomass. At the beginning of October,
    the number of cotton bolls within an area of 6.3 m2 (0.7 × 9 m) in the center
    two rows of the plots was investigated. Because the cotton bolls in each treatment
    did not mature at the same time, the bolls were manually harvested three times.
    The seed cotton was weighed after drying, and the seed cotton yield and boll weight
    were calculated; after ginning, the lint yield and boll cracking were determined.
    The effective temperature for cotton was equal to the average temperature minus
    the lower limit temperature for crop and root growth (15°C for cotton); the growth
    degree day (GDD) was equal to the accumulated daily effective temperature (Li
    et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (106KB) Download : Download

    water monitoring and SWC calculation In this study, the volumetric soil moisture
    contents (θ) were monitored by 5TE sensors (METER, USA). Thirty sensors were set
    as a group in the soil profile of the middle of each trial plot according to a
    spatial grid method (Liu et al., 2020); there was 20 cm of spacing in both the
    vertical and horizontal directions (Fig. 1C). The sensors were installed before
    the cotton was sown. When the sensor was set up in the soil, the excavated soil
    was placed in a fixed location, and after the sensors were installed, all the
    excavated soil was backfilled quantitatively, and the soil surface was leveled.
    In the profile grid, the horizontal position was divided into cotton rows (0–20 cm
    and 60–80 cm) and between rows (20–60 cm); the vertical positions were divided
    into shallow (10–40 cm), middle (40–70 cm), and deep (70–110 cm) layers (Fig.
    1D). The soil dielectric apparent permittivity (εb) was collected by 5TE sensors
    and uploaded to the cloud with a 1-hour time interval of data collection. θ was
    estimated based on εb using the Topp equation (Visconti et al., 2014, Topp et
    al., 1980): (1) where a = 4.3×10−6, b= −5.5×10−6, c = 2.92×10−2, and d = 5.3×10−2.
    For each planting system, a grid (i,j) file was created for the 30 sensor data;
    i and j represent the abscissa and ordinate, respectively. The total θ of each
    grid was calculated using Simpson’s 3/8 rule (Wu et al., 2023): (2) (3) (4) where
    [1, 3, 3, 2, …] is the coefficient vector, is the depth of the grid points of
    row i and row j, and are the column spacing and row spacing of the grid data file,
    respectively, is the ith cross-sectional area, is the total volume of water on
    the specific measured cross section, is the definite average value of the integral
    of the soil water content for each grid data file, and is the area of the soil
    profile. Then, the cumulative SWC in the soil profile and water productivity were
    calculated using the following formulas (Wu et al., 2022a): (5) (6) 2.5. Grid
    calculus for SWM calculation The x and y coordinates are interpolated more finely.
    After the soil profile of each time point was interpolated, a group of water data
    of 80 × 100 points formed. In this study, the kriging method was selected for
    interpolation; the value of the interpolation point was calculated by the following
    formula: (7) (8) (9) where Z∗(x0) is the kriging interpolation result of point
    x0, λi is the unknown weight coefficient, and C(xi, xj) is the covariance function
    of Z(xi) and Z(xj). After the grid data was interpolated, grid calculus is used
    to define and quantify the characteristics in the grid file that are not obvious
    from looking at a contour map or 3D wireframe of the grid. When a numerical derivative
    is needed, central difference formulas are used for the calculus computations.
    Because a central difference approach is used, values on both sides of the location
    for which the derivative is computed are needed. A compass-based grid notation
    is used to indicate the neighboring grid nodes for many of the grid calculus operations,
    as illustrated in Fig. 1E. Using this grid notation, we write the difference equation
    approximations for the necessary derivatives at location Z as follows: (10) (11)
    (12) (13) (14) where Z is a function of X and Y in a domain that includes point
    P. In the X-axis direction, the rate of change for Z is ∂z/∂x; the rate of change
    in the Y-axis direction for Z is ∂z/∂y. According to the definition of the directional
    derivative (Schwartz, 1974), the SWM, which is the slope of the SWC surface in
    a given direction, is calculated by the first derivative: (15) where α is the
    specified angle (Tuma, 1979). The α used for calculating the vertical soil water
    movement is −90°. For vertical SWM, a positive value indicates moving upward toward
    the y-axis origin, and a negative value indicates moving from the origin downward
    along the y-axis. The horizontal SWM calculation uses an α value equal to 0°.
    For the horizontal SWM, a positive value indicates moving away from the x-axis
    origin, and a negative value indicates moving toward the x-axis origin. Using
    compass-based grid notation, the equation takes the following form: (16) When
    calculating the horizontal SWM in cotton rows at a horizontal position of 60–80 cm
    and that in between rows at a horizontal position of 40–60 cm, the value of the
    horizontal SWM is multiplied by −1 because the real horizontal SWM direction at
    40–80 cm is contrary to that at 0–40 cm. That is, the movement toward the middle
    of the rows at 40–80 cm is represented by negative horizontal SWM, unlike that
    at 0–40 cm, which is represented by positive values. In a later correlation analysis,
    only the size of the horizontal SWM was considered, not the direction; thus, the
    absolute values of the horizontal SWM in cotton rows and horizontal SWM between
    rows were used. 2.6. Statistics and software The least significant difference
    (LSD) method was used for significance analysis at the 0.05 level. Pearson correlation
    analysis was used for pairwise correlation, and path analysis was conducted using
    planting system, meteorological factors, soil water movement and consumption,
    crop biomass and the lint yield of cotton. Structural equation modeling (SEM)
    or path analysis allows researchers to model complex relational networks by evaluating
    the direct and indirect effects between variables (Bollen and Pearl, 2013). With
    SEM, researchers can clearly specify causal relationships between variables and
    validate these relationships by observing data. Path analysis mainly focuses on
    the direct paths between variables in the model. This enables researchers to identify
    which variables have a direct impact on other variables, thereby revealing potential
    causal relationships (Wu et al., 2023). In agriculture, ecology, and other fields,
    these methods have helped researchers better understand and explain the interactions
    between various factors (Guo et al., 2023). A logistic growth model was used to
    model belowground biomass dynamics with days after emergence (DAE). Stata 16 and
    Microsoft Office Excel 2019 were used for data collation; statistical analyses
    were performed via SPSS 25.0, GraphPad Prism 8 and Origin 2021; and Microsoft
    Office PowerPoint 2019, Golden Software Surfer 18.0, GraphPad Prism 8, Origin
    2021 and Adobe Illustrator CC 2019 were used for graphing. 3. Results 3.1. Cotton
    growth and yield There were significant differences in cotton dry matter accumulation
    at different growth stages under the different cropping systems (Fig. 3). The
    biomasses of the different organs in the MC treatment group were the highest at
    the cotton seedling stage in both 2016 and 2017. There was no significant difference
    between WIC and WDC (except for the maximum belowground biomass in 2017). The
    dry matter variation trend of the different cropping systems at the cotton squaring
    stage was MC>WIC>WDC. During the cotton flowering and boll development stage,
    the maximum aboveground biomass and maximum belowground biomass were the greatest
    in the MC treatment and the smallest in the WIC treatment; the maximum leaf biomass
    was also the greatest in MC, but the smallest in WDC. By comparing the dynamics
    of cotton plant height under different cropping systems, it was found that the
    change trend was consistent over the past two years, with MC>WIC>WDC in each period
    (Supplementary Fig. 1). The lint yield and boll density in 2016 and 2017 and the
    boll weight, lint percentage and water productivity in 2017 were highest in MC,
    followed by WIC (Fig. 4). Compared with that of MC, the lint yields of WIC and
    WDC decreased by 18.0% and 46.7%, respectively. Download : Download high-res image

    cotton planting systems in 2016 were basically greater than those in 2017; additionally,
    MC and WIC had higher SWC values mainly at the seedling and squaring stages in
    2016 than in 2017, and WDC had higher SWC values mainly at the squaring stage
    in 2016 than in 2017 (Fig. 5A). In 2017, the deep SWC values of the three planting
    modes at depths of 70–110 cm in the flowering and boll development stage were
    greater than those in 2016. For MC, the SWC in 2016 was mainly concentrated in
    the shallow (10–40 cm) and middle (40–70 cm) layers; in 2017, the SWC was mainly
    concentrated at the shallow layer, and the SWC values at different horizontal
    positions of the same depth exhibited small variations. The SWC distributions
    of WIC and WDC at different horizontal positions at the same depth were largely
    different. The SWC distribution in WIC at the seedling stage was similar to that
    in MC, which was greater than that in WDC; however, the SWC distribution at the
    squaring stage exhibited an obvious inverted V shape, while that in WDC presented
    an irregular distribution. The SWC of the soil profile in WDC at 10–110 cm was
    obviously lower than that in MC and WIC. Fig. 5B shows that the SWCs in the cotton
    rows and between rows under the three planting systems at the cotton squaring
    stage in 2016 were obviously greater than those in 2017. However, the SWC in between
    rows at the flowering and boll development stage in 2016 was lower than that in
    2017. The use of different cotton planting systems and growth stages significantly
    affected the SWC in between rows. MC had the largest SWC values in the three stages
    of 2016 and in the seedling and flowering and boll development stages of 2017;
    however, the lowest SWC occurred in the squaring stage of 2017. There were no
    significant differences between SWCs in cotton rows in MC and WIC at the seedling
    or squaring stage in 2016. In 2017, the SWC between rows and the SWC in cotton
    rows was significantly greater in WIC at the squaring stage than in MC. In 2017,
    the SWC of the WIC at the squaring stage was the largest; in other cases, the
    WIC was significantly lower than that of the MC. The SWC in WDC was significantly
    greater than that in WIC at the flowering and boll development stage. The SWC
    in WDC was greatest between rows at the squaring stage in 2017 and lowest at other
    times. Download : Download high-res image (811KB) Download : Download full-size

    p<0.01. 3.3. Vertical SWM In Fig. 6A, positive values represent upward SWM, negative
    values represent downward SWM, and the color depth represents the value. The vertical
    SWM of the soil profile in 2017 had obvious stratification, and the different
    soil layers exhibited great variation; the upward movement of water was mainly
    concentrated in the shallow soil. Relative to 2017, there was a significantly
    greater increase in the SWM in the middle depth range of the soil profile in 2016
    at the seedling stage and squaring stage; moreover, the SWM was lower in 2016
    at the flowering and boll development stage. In 2016, the upward SWM in MC in
    the shallow soil layer exhibited few differences among the three growth stages,
    and there was a large SWM in the middle layer at the squaring stage. In 2017,
    the water movement in the MC soil profile clearly followed the order of seedling
    stage<squaring stage<flower and boll development stage. In 2016, the SWM of WIC
    at the seedling stage was similar to that of MC; however, there was a greater
    downward SWM in the middle and deep soil layers (70–110 cm) at the squaring and
    flowering and boll development stages. In 2017, WIC had a greater SWM in the shallow
    layer at the seedling stage; its middle layer SWM mainly moved downward. The SWM
    of the shallow layer in the WDC varied greatly with the horizontal position. In
    2016, the middle- and deep-layer SWMs were mainly downward. In 2017, the middle-
    and deep-layer, the SWM was upward. Fig. 6B shows that the vertical SWM under
    the three planting systems in 2016 generally increased. The SWM values at the
    seedling and squaring stages were basically greater than those in 2017; moreover,
    the difference in the vertical SWM caused by the different planting systems in
    2017 was more significant. In 2016, the vertical SWM variations in cotton rows
    and between rows of WIC at the squaring stage were obvious; in other cases, the
    vertical SWM trend between cotton rows and between rows were basically similar.
    In 2017, WIC had a significant maximum vertical SWM value at different horizontal
    positions at the seedling stage; at the squaring stage, WIC had a significant
    minimum vertical SWM value. There were no significant differences in the vertical
    SWM between MC and WDC at the seedling stage during the two years. However, in
    other cases, the vertical SWM of WDC was significantly lower than that of MC.

    negative values represent directions, negative values represent leftward movement
    along the abscissa, positive values represent rightward movement along the abscissa,
    and the color depth represents SWM size. The horizontal SWM in 2016 was more obvious
    than in 2017, and the WIC horizontal SWM values at the squaring and flower and
    boll development stages were more obvious than at seedling stage. At the squaring
    and flowering and boll development stages, the horizontal SWM of WIC mainly changed
    direction at the midpoint of the cotton row along the horizontal direction; the
    total trend was to move from the midpoint of the row to the position of the cotton
    rows. In MC and WDC, the horizontal SWM in cotton rows and horizontal SWM between
    rows exhibited greater variation with respect to the horizontal positions at different
    stages. The horizontal SWM values of the three planting systems were the largest
    in the squaring stage, followed by the flowering and boll development stage; the
    values were the smallest in the seedling stage. As shown in Fig. 7B, the absolute
    values of the horizontal SWM levels between rows of WIC in 2016 were the largest
    in the three growth stages. In 2017, the absolute values of the horizontal SWM
    in cotton rows were the greatest at the seedling stage in MC; there were no significant
    differences between WIC and WDC, and the absolute value of the horizontal SWM
    was the greatest between cotton rows of WIC. In 2017, the absolute value of horizontal
    SWM in cotton rows of MC at the squaring stage was the largest, the between-row
    value in WIC was the largest, and the between-row value in WIC at the flowering
    and boll development stage was significantly the largest. In 2017, the horizontal
    SWM between rows in MC at the seedling stage moved toward the midpoint of the
    cotton rows with a horizontal coordinate of 40 cm. In addition, the soil water
    under the three planting systems at the seedling stage moved toward the position
    of cotton rows with a horizontal coordinate of 0 cm. In the two observed years
    of the squaring stage, the soil water at the cotton rows of MC and WIC moved toward
    the cotton position. In 2016, the horizontal SWM between rows in the shallow and
    middle layers of MC at the squaring stage was basically offset, and the horizontal
    SWM between rows of MC at the squaring stage and that of WIC in the two years
    moved toward the cotton positions. At the flowering and boll development stage
    in 2016, the water between rows of MC plants moved toward the midpoint of the
    rows; at the flowering and boll development stage in 2017, the soil water in MC
    moved slightly in the horizontal direction. The soil water of WIC obviously moved
    toward the cotton positions at the squaring and flowering and boll development
    stages in the two years; the horizontal SWM direction of WDC at the squaring and
    flowering and boll development stages in 2017 moved toward the midpoint of the
    cotton rows. Download : Download high-res image (910KB) Download : Download full-size

    according to the LSD test (0.05). **: p<0.01. 3.5. Meteorological and crop influences
    on SWC and SWM At the seedling stage, the SWC between cotton rows was positively
    correlated with the number of hours of accumulated sunlight during the growth
    period and with the maximum aboveground biomass, the maximum belowground biomass,
    the maximum leaf biomass, the accumulation of aboveground biomass and the accumulation
    of belowground biomass at this growth stage (Fig. 8). The vertical SWM between
    rows was negatively correlated with the average sunshine duration and positively
    correlated with rainfall. The absolute value of the horizontal SWM in cotton rows
    was negatively correlated with the mean temperature (Tmean) and minimum temperature
    (Tmin); the absolute value of the horizontal SWM between rows was significantly
    positively correlated with the growth degree day (GDD). The SWC between rows was
    positively correlated with Tmean and maximum temperature (Tmax) and negatively
    correlated with rainfall during the squaring stage. The SWC in cotton rows was
    positively correlated with the SH, and the vertical SWM between rows was negatively
    correlated with Tmean and Tmax. At the cotton flowering and boll development stage,
    the SWC in cotton rows was significantly correlated with the cotton row vertical
    SWM, Tmean, Tmax and the accumulation of aboveground biomass at that stage; the
    SWC between rows was significantly correlated with the SWC in cotton rows. The
    vertical SWM in cotton rows at the flowering and boll development stage was more
    strongly affected by other factors and was significantly correlated with temperature,
    rainfall, the accumulation of aboveground biomass and plant height. The vertical
    SWM between rows was significantly positively correlated with aboveground biomass
    accumulation, belowground biomass accumulation, maximum aboveground biomass, maximum
    belowground biomass, and GDD during this period. There were no significant correlations
    between the absolute values of HSWM in or between cotton rows and other indicators
    in this period. Download : Download high-res image (482KB) Download : Download

    of SWC and SWM on cotton lint yield Fig. 9 shows the significant results obtained
    by linear regression between the lint yield and SWC, vertical SWM and horizontal
    SWM in and between cotton rows during three cotton growth stages. There was a
    significant positive linear relationship between SWM between rows and lint yield
    in the three periods; only at the flowering and boll development stage did the
    vertical SWM between rows and lint yield have a significant positive linear relationship.
    There was no significant correlation between lint yield and the vertical SWM at
    the seedling or squaring stages and the horizontal SWM at any of the three stages.
    Path analysis between these indicators at the flowering and boll development stage
    and lint yield is shown in Fig. 10. The model explanation rate for lint yield
    was R2 = 0.807, where p < 0.001, χ2/df = 1.903, GFI = 0.918, and RMSEA = 0.425.
    The cotton planting system significantly changed the meteorological conditions.
    Tmax, Tmin and rainfall significantly affected the vertical SWM in cotton rows.
    Among these parameters, the impact of Tmin was negative, and the impacts of Tmax
    and rainfall were positive. During this period, the accumulation of aboveground
    biomass and the accumulation of belowground biomass were significantly and positively
    affected by GDD. The accumulation of aboveground biomass positively affected the
    vertical SWM in cotton rows, while the accumulation of belowground biomass positively
    affected the vertical SWM between rows. The vertical SWM in and between cotton
    rows positively impacted each other. The vertical SWM between rows slightly positively
    affected the accumulation of aboveground biomass. The accumulation of aboveground
    biomass and belowground biomass characteristics positively impacted the maximum
    aboveground biomass and maximum belowground biomass, respectively; the maximum
    belowground biomass significantly increased the maximum aboveground biomass. The
    vertical SWM in cotton rows and the maximum aboveground biomass had significant
    positive and negative effects on the SWC in cotton rows, respectively; the SWC
    between rows was mainly affected by the direct negative effects of the different
    cotton planting systems. The maximum aboveground biomass, SWC in cotton rows and
    SWC between cotton rows had significant positive, positive and negative effects
    on cotton lint yield, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (169KB)

    Discussion 4.1. SWC and SWM under the different cotton planting systems The spatiotemporal
    distributions and characteristics of SWC and SWM for the three cotton planting
    systems at different growth stages were obviously different and strongly affected
    by interannual effects. In 2016, with sufficient rainfall, the SWC values of the
    three planting systems at the squaring stage were significantly higher; moreover,
    the depth range of vertical SWM was greater, indicating that crop planting systems
    used more of water in deep soil layers. In the drought year 2017, which had insufficient
    rainfall, the soil water consumption was mainly concentrated at shallow soil depths;
    however, the SWC and SWM values at the flowering and boll development stage were
    near or even greater than those in 2016 (Fig. 5 & 6). In the years with sufficient
    rainfall, the rainfall occurred mainly during the squaring stage; the suitable
    and sufficient soil water environment could limit the growth of cotton roots (Hulugalle
    et al., 2015), allowing the plants to reach their maximum belowground biomass
    earlier (Wu et al., 2022b). In contrast, cotton roots became more developed in
    arid environments, extending to a wider range at the cotton flowering and boll
    development stage (Tsakmakisa et al., 2019; Taylor and Klepper, 1974). The cotton
    production demand in different climates or regions was realized through the improvement
    of planting systems and soil water management during different periods. This discovery
    was extended to the results of a previous study (Han et al., 2022). The horizontal
    SWM of WIC was more obvious than that of MC and WDC at the squaring and flowering
    and boll development stages. The water movement from the row midpoints to the
    cotton row positions was greater (Fig. 7), which could have been caused by the
    strong water absorption capacities of the root systems in the cotton rows and
    the greater absolute values of horizontal SWM in cotton rows (Fig. 8). Previous
    studies have shown that the volumetric soil water content in the position between
    rows under WIC was greater than that in cotton rows, potentially leading to the
    formation of a water stress zone (Wu et al., 2022b). This phenomenon could be
    caused by the SWM modes under WIC. The vertical SWM and SWC between rows of MC
    at the seedling stage were larger than those in cotton rows; however, the water
    in this part might not be absorbed by early cotton and instead might be affected
    more by environmental factors, such as the evaporation of shallow soil layers
    (Paraskevas et al., 2013). These results showed that for the MC planting system,
    more attention should be given to water resource management at the seedling stage
    of cotton. In comparison to the local irrigation methods used in monoculture cotton
    planting systems (Chen et al., 2022a, Zhi et al., 2019), more detailed drip irrigation
    methods (Hu et al., 2020) or partial root zone irrigation methods (Tang et al.,
    2010) could be used to reduce the water input between rows; this phenomenon could
    reduce the waste of a large amount of water resources. However, it was necessary
    to consider sustainability and the costs of labor and materials (Huang et al.,
    2022). 4.2. Cotton yield formation and water management in diverse planting systems
    Previous studies have shown that environmental changes caused by adjusting sowing
    dates have a greater impact on lint yield, while the overall Q-score impact on
    various fiber qualities is relatively small, and soil moisture may be the main
    environmental influencing factor. In this study, the lint yield formation mechanism
    of cotton was explained from the atmosphere-plant-soil integrated system under
    different planting systems. Cotton yield was related mainly to SWM and SWC at
    the flowering and boll development stage (Fig. 9). Different cotton planting systems
    led to differences in the environmental climate conditions during the flowering
    and boll development stage. Climate factors affected both SWM and crop growth.
    The SWC was affected by SWM, crops and planting systems, while driving crop yield
    formation with aboveground biomass (Fig. 10). The effective accumulated temperature
    was related to cotton biomass, which has been described in many previous studies
    (Li et al., 2021). The results of this study showed that GDD affected the increase
    in the maximum aboveground and belowground biomass by directly affecting aboveground
    and belowground biomass accumulation. Temperature and rainfall significantly impacted
    the SWM in cotton rows, which was not mentioned in previous studies. The positive
    impacts of Tmax and rainfall were due to their respective promotion of crop evaporation
    and plant water absorption (Paraskevas et al., 2013, Pabuayon et al., 2019); the
    negative impact of Tmin could occur due to the lower temperature and slowed biophysical
    processes (Parlange et al., 1998). The vertical SWM in between rows was mainly
    affected by the accumulation of belowground biomass and vertical SWM in cotton
    rows, and further progress was made in the study of Sissoko et al., (2013). The
    SWC between rows was affected by the planting systems, which was potentially due
    to the influences of wheat crops and their postharvest residues in different planting
    systems (Jalota et al., 2006, Lascano et al., 1994). The increase in the aboveground
    and the belowground biomass of cotton plants could promote vertical SWM in and
    between cotton rows, respectively; this phenomenon indicated that the aboveground
    growth of cotton plants could depend on water movement and consumption at different
    spatial locations in the soil, and underground morphology could influence this
    phenomenon (Chen et al., 2022b, Chen et al., 2019). In addition, the maximum aboveground
    biomass limited the SWC in cotton rows, indicating that it was necessary to control
    the aboveground biomass at the flowering and boll development stage; this phenomenon
    could be related to the top growth and the vegetative growth of cotton (Taylor
    and Klepper, 1974, Tang et al., 2010). These results provide theoretical support
    for the inhibition of apical growth by topping and the regulation of biomass allocation
    via chemical control (Zhang et al., 2021c, Mao et al., 2014). According to the
    results of this study, methods for effectively and reasonably distributing the
    SWC in and between cotton rows and promoting the consumption and utilization of
    water in cotton rows are new possible techniques for further improving the lint
    yield of cotton in the diversified planting systems. 4.3. Perspectives and potential
    limitations With respect to agriculture in the 4.0 era, sensor technology has
    been widely used in farmlands, providing better opportunities to mine and interpret
    data. In this article, we mainly wanted to discuss the relationship between soil
    moisture movement and crops. Through this relationship, we can better understand
    the water use characteristics of field crops, which will benefit precision irrigation.
    Based on the combination of soil water sensor networks and the geostatistical
    grid calculus method, we developed a novel method for quantifying soil water movement
    at different spatial positions in soil profiles under various cotton planting
    systems; we further analyzed the mechanism of cotton yield formation at the flowering
    and boll development stage in combination with climate and crop effects. In this
    study, the cotton biomass was divided into two parts: aboveground and belowground.
    The results of the analysis suggested that the distributions of reproductive and
    vegetative organ biomass at the flowering and boll development stage could be
    a possible reason for the difference in SWC in cotton rows; this phenomenon should
    to be further analyzed. In addition, the results of this paper showed that different
    planting systems affected the SWC between rows; however, specific explanations
    for this impact were not found, which requires further study. Nonetheless, we
    found many phenomena that were not mentioned in previous studies and explained
    many of the results of previous studies from the spatial distributions of SWM
    and SWC. The methods and results of this study have important reference value
    for exploring the laws of soil water utilization under diversified crop planting
    systems; these findings are conducive to improving water use efficiency and crop
    yield (Mueller et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2017) and promoting the development
    of precision irrigation technology (Mertzanides et al., 2020). This study provides
    theoretical support for improvements in cotton planting systems in different climates
    or regions, which is conducive to improving the climate adaptation of agricultural
    production and promoting the sustainable development of agriculture (Howden et
    al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2021b). Additionally, the soil database has great value
    in its own right. In the future, we will dig deeper into the soil database and
    may use digital soil mapping and machine learning methods combined with physical
    characteristics of the soil to study the patterns of movement independent of plant
    control (Wang et al., 2022). These methods may be able to predict variations in
    soil properties, and simultaneously be able to better correlate crops and soil
    to implement management options. 5. Conclusion In this study, sensor networks
    based on the spatial grid method were used to monitor soil moisture at high spatiotemporal
    resolutions under three cotton planting systems. The vertical soil water movement,
    horizontal soil water movement and soil water consumption at different spatial
    locations in the soil profile were calculated using geostatistical grid calculus;
    the mechanism underlying the formation of cotton lint yield was comprehensively
    analyzed within the atmosphereplant–soil system. The results showed that in 2016,
    when there was a large amount of rainfall, the SWC values of the three systems
    at the cotton squaring stage were obviously greater; the depth range of the vertical
    SWM was generally wider. The depth range of SWC was wider at the flowering and
    boll development stage in the relatively dry year 2017. The results showed that
    cotton made full use of deep water under these conditions. The SWC and vertical
    SWM values between rows in MC at the seedling stage were greater than those in
    cotton rows. WIC had a large horizontal SWM at the squaring and flowering and
    boll development stages, and the soil water mainly moved from the cotton row midpoints
    to the cotton locations. The SWM at the seedling stage was mainly related to rainfall
    and accumulated sunshine hours; the SWC was mainly affected by accumulated sunshine
    hours and crop biomass. SWM and SWC at the squaring stage were mainly affected
    by the light, temperature and water conditions of the growing environment. The
    SWC and vertical SWM at the flowering and boll development stage were mainly affected
    by both the environment and crops. The SWC and vertical SWM at the flowering and
    boll development stage had significant positive correlations with lint yield.
    The highest temperature and rainfall at the flowering and boll development stage
    promoted vertical SWM in cotton rows; GDD promoted the accumulation of crop biomass,
    and the accumulation of aboveground and underground biomass promoted vertical
    SWM in and between cotton rows, respectively. The SWC in cotton rows was mainly
    positively affected by the vertical SWM in cotton rows; the SWC between rows was
    mainly directly affected by planting systems. The SWC in cotton rows and the maximum
    aboveground biomass positively impacted lint yield formation, and the SWC between
    cotton rows negatively impacted lint yield formation. For MC, more accurate irrigation
    at the seedling stage was an efficient method for reducing water resource waste.
    With respect to the WIC, a better distribution of SWC in and between cotton rows
    promoted the consumption and utilization of soil water in cotton rows, which was
    a possible method for improving the lint yield of cotton in the diversified planting
    system. The methods and results of this study are conducive to optimizing precision
    irrigation management at different crop growth stages and providing theoretical
    support for improving cotton planting systems under different climatic conditions
    or in different regions; additionally, these methods are highly important for
    improving climate adaptation and agricultural production sustainability. CRediT

  description: Irrigation is the most significant consumer of freshwater worldwide.
    Deciding on the right amount of irrigation is crucial for sustainable water management
    and food production. The Penman-Monteith (P-M) reference crop evapotranspiration
    (ETO) is the gold standard in irrigation management and scheduling; however, its
    calculation requires measurements from multiple sensors over an extended reference
    grass surface. The cost of land, sensors, maintenance, and water to keep the grass
    surface green impedes having a dense network of ETO stations. To solve this challenge,
    this research aims to develop an input-limited ETO estimation approach based on
    historical weather data and machine learning (ML) algorithms to relax the need
    for a reference grass surface. This approach, called “SolarET,” takes solar radiation
    (RS) data as its sole input. RS is the only meteorological driving factor of ETO
    that does not rely on the measuring surface. To test the generalizability of SolarET,
    we test its performance over unseen arbitrary locations across California. California
    is chosen as the case study since it is one of the world's most hydrologically
    altered and agriculturally productive regions. In total, 19,088,736 hourly data
    samples from 131 automated weather stations have been used in this study. The
    ML models have been trained over 114 stations and tested over 17 unseen stations,
    each representing a California climatic zone. Our findings point to the superiority
    of decision tree-based algorithms versus neural networks. SolarET works best in
    irrigation-oriented regions of California (e.g., Central Valley) and is less accurate
    in coastal and desert zones. Our results demonstrate the higher accuracy of SolarET
    using hourly (RMSE = 0.93 mm/day) and daily (RMSE = 0.97 mm/day) RS data in comparison
    to well-known empirical alternatives like Priestley-Taylor (PT) (RMSE = 1.35 mm/day)
    and Hargreaves-Samani (HS) (RMSE = 2.69 mm/day).

    the most significant anthropogenic alternation to the natural hydrological cycle,
    accounting for about 70% of the global freshwater withdrawal (Siebert et al.,
    2010, Foley et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2022). Population growth and economic
    development require increasing food production in the future, and expanding sustainable
    irrigation is essential to satisfy this burgeoning demand (Schmitt et al., 2022,
    Karimzadeh et al., 2024). Reference evapotranspiration (ETO) is a decisive factor
    for water resources management in weekly and monthly resolutions and for irrigation
    scheduling in daily intervals. A common approach for irrigation management is
    to adjust the daily ETO with crop- and growth stage-specific coefficients to determine
    the potential crop evapotranspiration (ETC) (Ji et al., 2017, Fernández, 2023).
    Under the hypothesis that the crop is fully irrigated and without any growth-limiting
    factors (biotic and abiotic factors), the volume of water lost by the crop should
    be topped up with irrigation water (Haghverdi et al., 2021). Anything more than
    this \"correct amount\" (non-consumptive water use) is considered unproductive
    as it will be lost by evaporation, runoff, or deep percolation, while anything
    less than this amount will develop water stress and potentially yield loss. Therefore,
    a realistic estimate of daily ETO is essential for sustainable water management
    and food production. The FAO 56 Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation is the gold standard
    of ETO calculation (Penman, 1948, Monteith, 1965, Allen et al., 1998). Compared
    to other empirical or semi-empirical equations, P-M is a physical-based equation
    that combines energy balance and mass transfer method and considers aerodynamic
    and surface resistance factors to calculate the evapotranspiration rate over a
    standardized cropped surface (Allen et al., 1998). Therefore, P-M requires a complete
    weather station (several sensors for measuring multiple parameters) to be installed
    over an extended reference grass surface to achieve reliable results. This surface
    should be homogeneously extended towards different directions (enough fetch) to
    satisfy the heat and vapor advection assumptions. Moreover, the grass should be
    well-watered to avoid any water stress. Meeting these conditions is troubling,
    especially where labor for maintenance is scarce or expensive, and land and water
    resources are limited, which is very common in agriculturally productive regions.
    Utilizing fertile land and scarce water and labor resources for weather stations
    is not appealing to growers and stakeholders. The other problem is the number
    of stations required for irrigation management. Due to the diversity of micro-climates
    in croplands, only a dense network of stations is practically helpful for irrigation
    management. To address the abovementioned challenges, this research aims to develop
    an ETO estimation approach that relaxes the need for a reference surface. ETO
    has four meteorological driving factors: solar radiation, air temperature, air
    humidity, and wind speed (Ahmadi et al., 2022). From these factors, solar radiation
    (Rs) is the only one that does not rely on surface characteristics, as it is a
    function of incoming solar energy only. Therefore, our approach called \"SolarET\"
    uses RS, which is measured with only one sensor (i.e., pyranometer) placed on
    any arbitrary surface as the sole input parameter. There are numerous input-limited
    alternatives for ETO estimation in the literature, ranging from empirical models
    (e.g., Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) to machine learning (ML) applications (e.g.,
    Chen et al., 2020). Almost all well-known empirical models were developed decades
    ago over restricted training data samples, sampling locations, and computational
    resources (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). These methods
    tend to aggregate all un-measured inputs and uncertainties deterministically into
    one empirical coefficient, which might result in inaccurate results. Also, none
    of these methods rely only on solar radiation data. On the contrary, these methods
    need information on air temperature and humidity. Since this information is a
    function of the surface, the empirical equations cannot relax the need for the
    reference grass surface. Similarly, ML alternatives available in the literature
    take air temperature and humidity as their inputs and are not primarily focused
    on bypassing the reference surface (Chen et al., 2020, Dong et al., 2022, Kushwaha
    et al., 2022). Our proposed approach uses decision tree- and neural network-based
    ML regression models to estimate daily ETO with hourly and daily RS data. The
    ML models employed in this study have shown superior performance for similar regression
    problems based on the available literature and ML competitions (Rodriguez-Galiano
    et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2020, Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020, Zhangzhong et
    al., 2023). Contrary to the available ML methods for daily ETO forecasting, which
    use only daily meteorological inputs, this research leverages hourly RS inputs
    to take advantage of the information gained from this finer temporal resolution
    data. Another essential difference between SolarET and available ML-based alternatives
    for ETO estimation lies in its generalizability. Our test set consists of unseen
    weather stations to ensure SolarET''s generalizability and applicability to new
    arbitrary locations in California. In other words, we train our models on data
    collected from some stations/locations and then test them using a previously unseen
    dataset from new stations. We use California as the case study to evaluate the
    applicability of SolarET. California is one of the most hydrologically altered
    regions in the world (Zimmerman et al., 2018). California is also one of the most
    agriculturally productive regions on the planet, with heavy reliance on irrigation
    (Lobell and Bonfils, 2008, Tindula et al., 2013). Another reason California is
    a suitable case study for this research is the reliable, long-term data available
    from several weather stations in California (Ahmadi et al., 2023). To examine
    the performance of SolarET, we test it against Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestley-Taylor
    (PT), and Romanenko empirical models. HS and PT models are developed using California
    data and are widely used and highly trusted for ETO estimation (Tabari et al.,
    2013). Leveraging high temporal resolution data, cutting-edge regression algorithms,
    and big training data availability, we hypothesize that SolarET can outperform
    empirical alternatives without requiring surface-dependent inputs. In other words,
    we hypothesize that SolarET can surpass comparable methods in terms of prediction
    accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability. 2. Study area and dataset
    California was chosen as the case study of this research. It is one of the world''s
    most prominent agriculturally productive regions, heavily dependent on irrigation.
    According to the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), in an average
    year, approximately 9.6 million acres are irrigated with roughly 42 billion cubic
    meters of water. To assist irrigators in managing this immense water demand, DWR
    and the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) developed a program called
    the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) in 1982. CIMIS
    consists of over 145 automated weather stations that measure meteorological inputs
    of the Penman-Monteith equation in a standardized condition. Daily and hourly
    reports of ETO and its meteorological driving factors are publicly available on
    the CIMIS website (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). More information about the CIMIS
    program can be found on the CIMIS website. For this study, daily and hourly data
    on required variables from 131 active CIMIS stations are acquired. While some
    of those stations are located in research facilities, most are installed on private
    lands (often growers) where proper maintenance (mainly grass and fetch requirements)
    is a limiting factor. For this work, stations are chosen according to their condition
    and maintenance records, and problematic stations (e.g., stations with poor maintenance,
    inadequate or infrequent irrigation, and non-grass reference surface) are eliminated
    to ensure the quality of the input data. The train set consists of 114 stations.
    The train set data is acquired from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2022 (i.e.,
    28 years of data). Although all the stations in the train set have data until
    the end of 2022 (i.e., they are active stations), their installation date varies,
    and some of them have been installed after 1995 and, therefore, have less than
    28 years of data. CIMIS divides California into 18 homogeneous climatic zones
    with similar meteorological and evapotranspiration characteristics. To test the
    applicability of the proposed methodology in estimating ETO at climatically diverse
    and unseen arbitrary locations, 17 stations, each representing a climatic zone,
    were chosen as the test set. Zone 11 is eliminated, as it does not have any reliable
    station. Names and characteristics of these climatic zones can be found in Table
    A1 in the appendix. Readers are referred to Ahmadi et al. (2022) for more information
    about these zones. To evaluate the generalizability of the proposed ML models,
    they have never been exposed to the test set, even for validation purposes. All
    the results reported in this paper represent the models'' performance on this
    unseen test set. To eliminate biases due to data length and climatic variability
    in longer time spans (e.g., wet or dry periods), the test set consists of data
    from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022 (five years) for all stations. In total,
    19,088,736 hourly data records have been used in this study, with 18,447,984 records
    used as the training set and the remaining 640,752 records employed as the test
    set. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of training and testing stations across California.

    3.1. Reference evapotranspiration The Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation is the gold
    standard for calculating ETO (Penman, 1948, Monteith, 1965). CIMIS calculates
    ETO using the P-M equation version described in the American Society of Civil
    Engineering-Environmental Water Resources Institute paper (Allen et al., 2005).
    CIMIS does not use the daily meteorological variables and daily P-M equation to
    calculate daily ETO. It reports the summation of 24 hourly ETO values from midnight
    to midnight as the daily ETO. Ahmadi et al. (2022) showed that the summation of
    hourly ETO values results in similar outputs as using the daily P-M equation.
    CIMIS uses Eq. 1 to calculate hourly ETO (Allen et al., 1998, Allen et al., 2005,
    Walter et al., 2000, Pereira et al., 2015). (1) Where Cd (the ratio of bulk surface
    to aerodynamic resistance) is equal to 0.24 and 0.96 during daytime and nighttime,
    respectively. : standardized reference evapotranspiration (mm h−1), which approximates
    grass ET : the slope of saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1) at mean air
    temperature (T) : net radiation (MJ m−2 h−1) estimated from solar radiation and
    other input variables : soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 h−1): G=0.1·Rn daytime
    and G=0.5·Rn nighttime : psychrometric constant (kPa°C−1) : mean hourly air temperature
    (°C) : mean hourly wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1) : saturation vapor pressure
    (kPa) at Ta : mean actual vapor pressure (kPa) from dew point temperature (°C),
    or relative humidity (%) and temperature (°C) : latent heat of vaporization (2.45
    MJ kg−1 for water temperature of 20 °C) This equation''s first and second fractions
    are the radiation and aerodynamic terms of the P-M equation. This research uses
    the daily ETO value reported by CIMIS (i.e., the summation of hourly values) as
    the target value or predictand of ML models. 3.2. Data preprocessing and feature
    selection To relax the need of reference surface to estimate ETO, this research
    uses only solar radiation data measured by a pyranometer as the input of ML models.
    This study uses hourly RS as input to leverage more detailed measurements and
    capture the variations in solar radiation during the day. Therefore, each sample
    consists of an input vector of size 24 and a target value, which is the daily
    ETO. To ensure the reliability of input data, all samples with zero RS values
    for daytime (i.e., from 8 AM to 5 PM) have been removed from the dataset. Therefore,
    of the 795,364 daily samples used in this study, 1224 samples were eliminated.
    As only 69 of these eliminated samples are from the test set, we hypothesized
    that this process would not bias the distribution of samples in the test set and
    the study results. To ensure the robustness of ML models and improve their accuracy,
    three data preprocessing steps were taken: 1) eliminating records with null values:
    Null values are removed from the dataset to ensure accuracy, eliminate inconsistencies,
    and transform the data into a suitable format for inputting into the models. This
    filtering removed 6752 records from the training set of ML models and 4830 records
    from the test set. 2) Eliminating records with ETO values higher than 15 mm/day:
    we hypothesize these values are due to sensor errors or poor maintenance conditions.
    This filtering resulted in the elimination of 10 records from the training set.
    3) Using robust scaler: While traditional scaling techniques such as min-max scaling
    or standard scaling rely on the mean and standard deviation of the data, robust
    scaling uses different statistics that are less sensitive to outliers. Specifically,
    it leverages the median and interquartile range (IQR) to scale the input data.
    By reducing the potential impact of extreme values on the performance of ML models,
    robust scaling helps to mitigate the influence of outliers in the input variables.
    Eq. 2 shows how scaled data records are calculated using the robust scaling method:
    (2) Where, as the names suggest, is the value before scaling, and is the median
    of the data distribution; is the value after scaling. and are the 75th quantile
    and 25th quantile of the data distribution, respectively. Two strategies are employed
    for selecting the inputs of ML models. In the first strategy, all zero RS values
    (i.e., nighttime) have been substituted with the daily mean RS value. In this
    strategy, which is called \"mean substitution,\" each input record for the ML
    models has 24 features. To implicitly capture the daylight period, the mean daily
    RS is calculated as the sum of all hourly RS values divided by the number of non-zero
    RS values. This procedure differs from calculating daily RS, where 24 is the denominator.
    As the second strategy, we used feature selection methods to assign quantitative
    feature importance measures to each hour (i.e., each feature). In this strategy,
    only the most essential features are used as the input to train the models. To
    analyze the model performance under different feature selection strategies, we
    used correlation-based (Pearson and Spearman), information-based (Mutual Information),
    and intrinsic (CatBoost) feature selection strategies. To compare the use of hourly
    RS values against coarser temporal resolution inputs, we also tested using daily
    RS as input. In the case of daily Rs, we used a sine function of Julian date as
    the second feature to capture the seasonality. Using a sine function of the Julian
    date has merits over using the raw Julian date, as it can simulate the cyclic
    nature of input records (Eq. 3). (3) Where is the Julian date and is the cyclic
    Julian date value used as the second feature along with daily RS for the daily
    ML models. 3.2.1. Pearson correlation The Pearson correlation coefficient or Pearson''s
    \"r\" measures the linear correlation between two data sets or two random variables.
    It is a normalized measure of covariance, and therefore, its value is always between
    −1 and 1, while 1 shows the perfect positive linear correlation and −1 indicates
    the perfect negative linear correlation. When there is no linear correlation between
    the two variables r equals zero. The Pearson correlation of two random variables
    X and Y ( is defined as: (4) Where is the covariance of two variables, and and
    are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively. We used the Pandas library
    in Python to calculate the Pearson correlation. 3.2.2. Spearman correlation Spearman''s
    rank correlation (rs) coefficient is a nonparametric (distribution-free) rank
    statistic that measures the strength of correlation between the ranking of two
    variables (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011). Although the Spearman correlation between
    two variables X and Y is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values
    of those two variables, i.e., R(X) and R(Y), the Spearman correlation is not a
    measure of the linear relationship. Spearman''s coefficient assesses how well
    an arbitrary monotonic function (linear or not) can describe the relationship
    between two variables. Eq. 5 shows how rs is calculated. Like the Pearson correlation,
    rs values are between −1 and 1. We used the Pandas library in Python to calculate
    the Spearman correlation. (5) 3.2.3. Mutual information Mutual information (MI)
    measures how much information about a random variable we can acquire by knowing
    another random variable. MI is a non-negative dimensionless quantity with units
    of information (bits) that quantifies the dependency between two variables. MI
    measures the amount of information gain or uncertainty reduction about one variable
    given knowledge of another. MI is a non-negative measure between 0 and 1. It is
    equal to zero if and only if two random variables are strictly independent, and
    higher values mean higher dependency (Kraskov et al., 2004). In contrast to the
    Pearson correlation coefficient or other linear correlation measures, MI is also
    sensitive to dependencies that do not demonstrate themselves in covariance; therefore,
    it is more generalizable and reliable for feature importance evaluation, especially
    in non-linear contexts like evapotranspiration equations. Detailed information
    about MI can be found in the references (Kozachenko et al., 1987; Kraskov et al.,
    2004; Ross, 2014). We used the Scikit-learn software library in Python to calculate
    MI. 3.2.4. CatBoost feature importance The CatBoost regression model performs
    automatic feature importance analysis on the input data during training. After
    training the model, the relative importance of each input feature can be acquired.
    This measure shows how much, on average, the model prediction changes if the feature
    value changes. Higher feature importance values indicate more significant changes
    to the prediction if the feature value changes. CatBoost feature importance is
    a non-negative value. Feature importance values are normalized so that the sum
    of the importance values of all features is equal to 100. This normalization enables
    a relative assessment of the importance values across various features. For feature
    importance analysis, we chose the hyperparameters of the CatBoost model according
    to outperforming CatBoost models trained on similar datasets on Kaggle, with no
    further hyperparameter tuning. 70% of the data was used to train the model, and
    30% as the test set for model evaluation. More information about the CatBoost
    model is provided in the following sections. We used the catboost library in Python
    to calculate the CatBoost feature importance. 3.3. Machine learning Five ML algorithms
    were chosen to test if only RS data can predict ETO over California. We selected
    highly used and well-known regression algorithms. These algorithms have demonstrated
    superior performance in literature and ML competitions with datasets similar to
    the one used in our study (Zhang et al., 2020). We also used an automatic hyperparameter
    tuning framework to optimize the hyperparameters of the CatBoost algorithm. We
    used this automatic hyperparameter optimization only for CatBoost since CatBoost
    was the best model in our pilot model training, utilizing only a portion of input
    data. Also, according to the literature and ML competition results, CatBoost has
    demonstrated superiority in similar regression problems. Specifically, Zhang et
    al. (2020) showed that the CatBoost model is the most accurate compared to similar
    ML models for daily ETO estimation. 3.3.1. CatBoost CatBoost is an open-source
    gradient-boosted decision tree with widespread applications for classification
    and regression tasks to many data types (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018, Dorogush
    et al., 2018). CatBoost aims to mitigate the challenges of overfitting and target
    leakage through its innovative techniques (Asghari et al., 2023). The algorithm
    introduces two main innovations compared to other gradient-boosted decision trees:
    ordered target statistics and ordered boosting (Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020).
    The term \"ordered target statistics\" refers to the technique CatBoost uses to
    encode categorical variables. \"Ordered boosting\" is a refinement of gradient
    boosting (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018). Through this technique, a decision tree
    model is recursively trained on the prediction residuals of data points. This
    approach allows the model to obtain unshifted residuals by applying the current
    model to new training examples at each step, leading to reduced overfitting. The
    main difference between CatBoost and other gradient boosting algorithms like LightGBM
    and XGBoost is that CatBoost uses symmetric or balanced trees. In other words,
    in CatBoost, the splitting condition is consistent across all nodes at the same
    tree depth. Symmetric trees are faster to train and less prone to overfitting.
    Nevertheless, symmetric trees are weaker learners than asymmetric trees, and therefore,
    they generally make worse predictions. However, as the main idea of gradient boosting
    is to combine numerous weak learners to make predictions, the CatBoost algorithm
    tends to make more accurate predictions than LightGBM and XGBoost in several cases.
    Detailed information about the CatBoost algorithm can be found in Prokhorenkova
    et al. (2018). We used the CatBoost package in Python to develop the CatBoost
    model. We employed Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework for automatic
    hyperparameter tuning of the CatBoost model (Akiba et al., 2019). Optuna allows
    users to dynamically construct the hyperparameter search space by offering a define-by-run
    API. Optuna has a user-friendly setup, and it provides efficient sampling and
    pruning algorithms for customization. Detailed information about Optuna and its
    algorithm can be found in Akiba et al. (2019). We did not use the test set in
    automatic hyperparameter tuning to ensure our ML models'' generalizability and
    avoid data leakage in our study. Instead, we utilized a cross-validation set consisting
    of 16 stations from the training data, where each represents a distinct climatic
    zone. This cross-validation set mimics the unseen test set. With Optuna, we conducted
    100 trials to optimize the CatBoost model hyperparameters. 3.3.2. Deep neural
    network The feed-forward neural network is the ancestor of all deep learning architectures.
    Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well-known and well-studied architectures with
    innumerable applications as predictive regression models and are commonplace in
    ET prediction and forecasting (Kumar et al., 2002, Kim and Kim, 2008). Although
    gradient-boosted algorithms, such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, are generally
    considered more suitable for tabular datasets (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022), such
    as the dataset used in our study, we also included a deep neural network (DNN)
    algorithm in our models to assess its performance relative to other methods. We
    used the TensorFlow library in Python to build our DNN model. Our model has three
    hidden layers with 16, 32, and 16 units, respectively. The activation function
    of input and hidden layers is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Mean Squared Error
    (MSE) is the loss function of the network. Ridge Regression (L2) and Lasso Regression
    (L1) are used as kernel and activity regularizers, respectively, with a regularization
    parameter of 0.01. The model uses Adam optimizer and is trained over 30 epochs
    with a batch size of 64. 3.3.3. LightGBM LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine),
    originally proposed by Ke et al. (2017) and developed by Microsoft as a free and
    open-source framework, efficiently implements the gradient boosting algorithm
    and reduces memory usage. Gradient boosting is an ensemble method where ensembles
    are constructed from decision trees. Models are fit through a gradient descent
    optimization algorithm, where the loss gradient is minimized as the model is tuned
    (Brownlee, 2020). We used the LightGBM package in Python to develop the LightGBM
    model. We used a maximum of 30 tree leaves and a maximum of 7 tree depths for
    base learners. We used 2000 boosted trees to fit. More information about the LightGBM
    method can be found in Ke et al. (2017) and Al Daoud (2019). 3.3.4. Random forest
    Random forest (RF) is a supervised learning algorithm used to solve classification
    and regression problems. RF is a bagging technique that trains many decision trees
    in parallel, and its results are based on an ensemble of the trained trees. When
    used as a regression model, RF returns the mean or average prediction of the individual
    trees as the model''s output. Detailed information about the RF algorithm can
    be found in the references (Ho, 1995, Breiman, 2001). We used the Scikit-learn
    software library in Python to build the RF model. We used 1000 trees in the forest,
    with a maximum depth of 9. 3.3.5. XGBoost XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
    is an open-source gradient-boosting software library. XGBoost provides a parallel
    tree boosting (also known as gradient-boosted decision trees) that efficiently
    solves classification and regression problems. More information about the XGBoost
    model can be found in the references (Chen et al., 2015, Chen and Guestrin, 2016).
    We used the XGBoost library in Python to build the XGBoost model. We used 1000
    trees in the ensemble, with minimum depth and maximum leaves of 7 and 9, respectively.
    The learning rate was set to 0.3. 3.4. Empirical models We evaluated the performance
    of our input-limited data-driven approach against available input-limited alternatives
    for ETO estimation. Three well-known and reliable methods were chosen for this
    aim: a radiation-based method (i.e., Priestley-Taylor), a temperature-based method
    (i.e., Hargreaves-Samani), and a mass transfer-based method (i.e., Romanenko).
    Although none of these methods eliminate the need for a standard reference surface
    and their meteorological inputs rely on the measurement conditions, the comparison
    between SolarET and the methods is beneficial as they are well-established, widely-used
    procedures for ETO estimation. 3.4.1. Priestley-Taylor As shown in Eq. 1, the
    P-M equation consists of a radiation term and an aerodynamic term, where the latter
    groups the elements that represent the surface-atmosphere interactions (Pereira,
    2004). By analyzing data collected over various surfaces, Priestley and Taylor
    (1972) proposed an empirical adjustment to the P-M equation (Mallick et al., 2014).
    The Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation neglects the aerodynamic term and corrects
    the estimated ET by a dimensionless coefficient α (the Priestley-Taylor parameter).
    This coefficient accounts for the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and air and
    surface resistances to estimate the ET from a short, well-watered grass surface.
    Experimental results from several sites worldwide resulted in an average value
    of α=1.26. We use this value in this research. Pereira (2004) states that 1.26
    is a good estimate for α in Davis, California. Eq. 6 depicts how the PT method
    calculates ETO: (6) Where is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve
    ( ℃ ), is the psychrometric constant ( ℃ ), is the latent heat of vaporization
    (2.45 ), is the net radiation ( ), and is the soil heat flux ( ). The Δ over Δ+γ
    represents the fraction of diabatic energy (Rn - G) contributing to ET from the
    grass surface, and the adiabatic contribution to ET is approximately 26% of the
    diabatic contribution. The daily ground heat flux is assumed to be G=0. 3.4.2.
    Hargreaves-Samani Hargreaves-Samani (HS) is an input-limited empirical equation
    to estimate ETO using air temperature and extraterrestrial radiation (Hargreaves
    and Samani, 1985). This equation is based on the Hargreaves original equation,
    approximating solar radiation with extraterrestrial radiation and maximum minus
    minimum air temperature. Since the HS equation is developed with daily lysimeter
    data from Davis, California, it is well-suited for and highly used in California,
    which makes it a good benchmark for validating our approach. The HS equation is
    as follows: (7) Where is reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), is the extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm/day, for equivalent evaporated water depth), , , and are the mean,
    maximum, and minimum daily air temperature (ºC), respectively. Since data from
    Davis, California, is used to calibrate the constant value of 0.0023, we use the
    same value in this research. 3.4.3. Romanenko Romanenko equation is a mass transfer-based
    empirical equation that uses air temperature and relative humidity to estimate
    ETO. The mass transfer-based methods are essentially based on Dalton''s gas law
    and employ the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface
    to the atmosphere (Mehdizadeh et al., 2017). Romanenko equation estimates daily
    ETO as follows: (8) Where RH is the relative humidity (%). 3.5. Performance measures
    In this study, two deterministic performance measures are employed to investigate
    the accuracy of ETO estimation models: root mean square error (RMSE) and mean
    absolute error (MAE) (Moriasi et al., 2015): (9) (10) Where N is the number of
    samples, and and are observed and predicted ETO values at ith sample, respectively.
    Lower RMSE and MAE values indicate higher accuracies and better performance. Although
    both RMSE and MAE indicate average model prediction error in units of the variable
    of interest, they have fundamental differences. Since RMSE squares the errors
    before averaging them, it gives higher weights to large errors. Consequently,
    RMSE tends to penalize large errors more severely than MAE. According to Chai
    and Draxler (2014), each of these metrics has its own merits in explaining the
    model performance; therefore, in this research, we use them in tandem. 4. Results
    and discussion 4.1. Data investigation Fig. 2 shows the number of data samples
    and the training data distribution for each climatic zone. This figure shows that
    zones 14, 6, and 12 have the highest number of stations and input data samples
    in the training set. On the other hand, there is no data from zone 4 in the training
    set, as all the samples from this zone have been eliminated in the data preprocessing.
    However, zone 4 is present in the test set. This can further evaluate the generalizability
    of the presented methodology for ETO estimation in unseen locations in California.
    Zones 12 and 14 cover a vast area of the Central Valley. The Central Valley is
    one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world, with ideal soil
    and climate for a variety of crops but limited water resources. With limited to
    no rainfall in the summer, the Central Valley''s agriculture relies on irrigation.
    About one-sixth of the US irrigated land lies in the Central Valley (Reilly et
    al., 2008). This heavy irrigation dependence explains this region''s high density
    of CIMIS stations. Download : Download high-res image (192KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Number of samples, stations, and distribution of the training
    data for each climatic zone. Fig. 2 suggests a relatively uniform distribution
    of solar radiation across California, with lower values in coastal zones (e.g.,
    zones 1 and 2) and higher values in deserts (e.g., zones 17 and 18). The lower
    RS values on the coast can be attributed to dense fog. The ETO distribution in
    California reveals more variability across different zones. The most anomalous
    zones in terms of ETO distribution are coastal zones with very low ETO and desert
    zones with very high ETO. Also, the box plots of Fig. 2 illustrate a broader ETO
    distribution for desert zones. Being abnormal regarding RS and ETO distribution
    and having fewer input data, we hypothesize that our data-driven models struggle
    with accurate ETO prediction in coastal and desert zones. 4.2. Feature selection
    The results of the feature selection methods are presented in Fig. 3, which suggests
    no sharp difference between the features'' importance, especially from Pearson
    and Spearman correlations. As expected, all feature selection methods find the
    hourly RS values from morning and around noon to be the most important features.
    Based on these results, we decided to use the six most essential features/hours
    as the input of the ML models. For example, the six most important hourly Rs values
    selected by the CatBoost feature importance method are 7, 8, 6, 9, 10, and 12,
    respectively (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download

    different hours of the day) selected by each feature selection method and their
    corresponding score. It should be noted that both Pearson and MI methods result
    in hours 8–13 of Rs as the six most important features, only with various orders.
    Therefore, the results for Pearson and MI methods are the same and combined hereafter.
    Because different methods suggest a uniform feature importance, we hypothesize
    that the mean substitution procedure (i.e., using all hourly RS values) might
    be superior to using only selected features as input. 4.3. Machine learning models
    The overall performance of the ML models and feature selection methods is depicted
    in Fig. 4 and Figure A1 in the appendix. As these figures show, CatBoost and RF
    have very similar performances in terms of prediction accuracy. It should be noted
    that while Optuna has automatically optimized the CatBoost model''s hyperparameters,
    RF hyperparameters are set manually. This would suggest that automatic hyperparameter
    tuning for this type of regression problem does not guarantee higher accuracy,
    and a manual hyperparameter tuning strategy can result in equally accurate models.
    Also, most of the available automatic hyperparameter tuning frameworks, including
    Optuna, are specifically designed to optimize the hyperparameters of deep learning
    architectures, where the high dimensionality of the hyperparameter space interferes
    with manual hyperparameter tuning strategies like grid or random search and might
    result in sub-efficient models (Akiba et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res

    (RMSE) values (mm/day) for machine learning models and feature selection methods
    over the whole testing set. Fig. 4 and A1 illustrate the overall superiority of
    using all the hourly RS values with the mean substitution method over selecting
    the most important hours. Among feature selection methods, ML models using CatBoost
    intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation perform better than MI and
    Pearson correlation. The quality and relevance of the selected features can influence
    the performance of ML models. In our case, the difference in performance between
    the feature selection methods can be attributed to 1) the ability to handle non-linear
    relationships: ML models can effectively capture non-linear relationships between
    features and the target variable. In this case, CatBoost''s intrinsic feature
    importance considers the inherent non-linear relationship between the input and
    output of the model and selects features that have the highest impact on the model''s
    performance. 2) Robustness to outliers and noise: These observations can also
    be attributed to CatBoost intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation''s
    more effective robustness to outliers than Pearson correlation and Mutual Information
    correlation. Considering the rank-based correlation in Spearman''s correlation
    or the model-specific feature importance in CatBoost, these methods may have selected
    more robust features that lead to better model performance. Using feature selection
    or mean substitution, the CatBoost model with the mean substitution method stands
    out as the most accurate hourly model. Additionally, the RF excels as the preferred
    choice between daily models. We compare these models as the best-performing frameworks
    with empirical ETO estimation models. Fig. 4 and A1 clearly show that the DNN
    model falls behind all ensemble decision tree-based algorithms (i.e., RF and gradient
    boosting-based frameworks). This finding agrees with previous studies where tree-based
    algorithms outperformed vanilla neural networks in predictive regression problems
    (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015, Pham et al., 2020; Jun, 2021). To better understand
    how SolarET performs in different climatic zones of California, we included one
    CIMIS station with around five years of data from each zone. These stations have
    not been used to train the model; therefore, SolarET''s performance in these locations
    can be claimed as its performance in any arbitrary location in those climatic
    zones. Fig. 5 and A2 depict the models'' accuracy for each zone in the test set.
    These results clearly show that the performance of various ML models and feature
    selection methods is similar in each climatic zone. In other words, we cannot
    claim that a specific combination of the ML model and feature selection technique
    is more suitable for a geographical location or particular climatic characteristics.
    All successful prediction frameworks (i.e., ensemble decision tree-based algorithms)
    have lower accuracies in estimating ETO in coastal (zones 1 and 2) and desert
    (zones 17 and 18) areas (Fig. 5 and A2). Download : Download high-res image (444KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values
    (mm/day) for machine learning models and feature selection methods over climatic
    zones of California. From an ML perspective, three reasons might contribute to
    the lower accuracy of SolarET in the coastal and desert regions: 1) the low number
    of training data from these zones: Fig. 2 shows limited training data in these
    zones- leading to their insufficient representation of data patterns. Other zones
    also have low numbers of training samples but high predictive accuracy (e.g.,
    zones 16, 13, and 10). Although, these zones are more similar to the majority
    of the training set in terms of ETO distribution (Fig. 2). Therefore, we hypothesize
    that the first reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in the coast and
    desert data is the low number of training samples resembling the statistical characteristics
    of the data from these zones. 2) Higher level of outlier values in both training
    and test sets: As depicted in Fig. 6, there is a higher percentage of outlier
    values in stations 17 and 18 compared to other stations, which could impact the
    performance of the ML models in these specific zones. These outliers introduce
    noise and may not follow the patterns that the ML models have learned from the
    training data, leading to less accurate predictions. 3) Lack of relevant features:
    According to Fig. 7, we hypothesize that one of the other reasons for less accurate
    predictions in zones 17 and 18 is the lower correlation between the daily RS and
    ETO in these regions. Various climatic variables, such as temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, and solar radiation influence ETO. In zones 17 and 18, hourly or daily
    solar radiation may not accurately capture all the required information to estimate
    ETO. All in all, it is worth mentioning that the combination of these reasons,
    rather than a single factor, may have led to inferior performance of the ML models
    in these zones. It is also expected that advection is a more considerable contribution
    to ETO in desert regions than in the Central Valley or along the coast, and the
    lack of information on temperature, humidity, and wind speed in the ML models
    should lead to more considerable errors in regions having large fluctuations in
    aerodynamic contributions to ETO (Berengena and Gavilán, 2005). Download : Download

    evapotranspiration prediction To evaluate our approach of using ML models with
    only pyranometer data for ETO estimation, we compared its performance against
    three empirical limited-input ETO estimation models. It should be noted that both
    approaches, ML and empirical models, were evaluated using the same test set but
    with different features. Fig. 8 and A3 depict the findings of this comparison
    over 17 climatic zones of the test set. In these figures, we displayed the results
    of only the best-performing data-driven models. In the case of hourly inputs,
    the CatBoost ML model with mean substitution is the best, and in the case of daily
    inputs, the random forest model gives the highest accuracy (Fig. 4 and A1). Download

    Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for empirical models and SolarET over climatic
    zones of California. As seen in Fig. 8 and A3, our hourly model generally works
    as well or even better than the most accurate empirical model (i.e., Priestley-Taylor).
    This is especially important as our model takes only solar radiation data as input,
    while PT takes information from minimum and maximum air temperature and elevation
    in addition to net radiation. Also, our hourly and daily models clearly beat Hargreaves-Samani
    and Romanenko in terms of prediction accuracy. Our findings suggest that SolarET
    works very well unless there are extremely high or low contributions of aerodynamics
    to the ETO (e.g., desert and coastal climates). This is not surprising, as SolarET
    can only mimic the radiation term of the P-M equation, as it takes no information
    about the aerodynamics term (Eq. 1). Still, Fig. 8 and A3 illustrate that SolarET
    works better than PT as a radiation-based ET estimation model in desert climates.
    The inferior performance of SolarET in comparison to PT in coastal regions might
    be due to the high humidity fluctuation in these regions due to variations in
    wind direction, e.g., from the land or from the ocean, which lead to significant
    variations in temperature and humidity. Moreover, the presence of intermittent
    clouds and fog in these regions might be another reason for the lower accuracy
    of our model as opposed to PT. The low accuracy of empirical models in desert
    climate might be due to two reasons: 1) these models are not calibrated for desert
    climate (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985, Tabari et al.,
    2013); and 2) these models do not adequately account for heat advection in hot
    desert climates (Tolk et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2023). We hypothesize that another
    reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in deserts and coast is not accounting
    for aridity. This pattern is the same for PT and HS in desert regions. This goes
    along with not considering the aerodynamics contribution to the daily ETO. We
    hypothesize that adding information about vapor pressure can solve this problem.
    Fig. 9 analyzes the performance of SolarET against available empirical alternatives
    over the entire test set in terms of prediction accuracy. RMSE and MAE measure
    the dissimilarity between input-limited alternatives and P-M equation prediction.
    We use these performance measures to assess which input-limited ETO estimation
    alternative can simulate the daily P-M equation more realistically. As Fig. 9
    demonstrates, our hourly and daily models beat all empirical alternatives in terms
    of similarity to the P-M daily ETO. Our hourly model is the winner of this comparison.
    Although the overall performance of the hourly model is close to the daily model
    according to Fig. 9, as Fig. 8 depicts, the hourly model results in identical
    or more accurate predictions for all climatic zones. Interestingly, the hourly
    model works much better than the daily model in coastal regions (zones 1, 2, and
    3 in Fig. 8). This finding suggests that the information gained from the higher
    temporal resolution input (i.e., hourly Rs) is beneficial in simulating climatically
    diverse samples and can boost generalizability. Download : Download high-res image

    and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values for empirical models and SolarET over the
    entire test set. Fig. 9 shows that the PT equation, which is a radiation-based
    model, is the most accurate empirical ETO estimation model. The superiority of
    SolarET and the high accuracy of the PT model signifies the suitability of radiation
    data for input-limited ETO estimation in California. This finding agrees with
    Ahmadi et al. (2022) findings on the high correlation between radiation and ETO
    over California. Fig. 9 illustrates that HS and Romanenko models are the least
    realistic representations of P-M ETO over California. However, it should be noted
    that since we aim to compare not only the accuracy but also the generalizability
    of models, the HS model was not calibrated in this study. We hypothesize that
    calibrating HS will improve its accuracy in ETO estimation. Analyzing the errors
    of the ML and empirical models can provide valuable insights into their performance
    and help identify areas for improvement. In this vein, we divided the ETO distribution
    into distinct ranges and compared the best-performing ML model, CatBoost, using
    hourly Rs, with the PT empirical model. Fig. 10 illustrates the percentage of
    values within each specific ETO range where the value of exceeds 0.5. In this
    equation, Refers to P-M value and is what the model predicts. This figure indicates
    the more accurate predictions of CatBoost compared to PT across various ranges
    of ETO values. Overall, CatBoost maintains its superiority not only in the whole
    distribution of ETO over the entire test set but also in cases of low or high
    values of ETO. Moreover, as Figure A4 in the appendix shows, the distribution
    of SolarET error is similar to a Gaussian distribution with a mean value close
    to zero. This distribution suggests the error is random, not a systematic over-
    or under-estimation of ETO. It is also worth mentioning that SolarET accuracy
    is comparable to the best-performing ML-based ETO estimation models available
    in the literature, while it does not use surface-related inputs such as air temperature
    (Chen et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download : Download

    5. Summary and conclusion This paper develops a generalizable data-driven approach
    to estimate ETO using only solar radiation data. Since solar radiation is the
    only driving force of ETO, whose measurement does not require a reference crop
    surface, the developed approach (i.e., SolarET) can cut the cost of land, irrigation,
    maintenance, and extra sensors while assisting irrigators and water managers with
    their farm-level and regional decisions. As incoming solar radiation is not a
    function of the surface, a simple pyranometer placed on any location can measure
    the inputs of SolarET. Using a test set from unseen arbitrary locations, we showed
    the generalizability of SolarET over California. Our findings reveal that SolarET
    beats the Hargraves-Samani and Romanenko models in terms of accuracy. SolarET
    works better than Priestley-Taylor, a well-known radiation-based ETO estimation
    method, without using any information about air temperature. Although SolarET
    works accurately in heavily irrigated regions of California and beats all empirical
    models in desert climates, it is less accurate in coastal regions. Future studies
    can include publicly available air temperature data as another input, along with
    measured solar radiation. Adding publicly available air temperature data can result
    in better performance in coastal and desert regions, where the contribution of
    the aerodynamics term of the Penman-Monteith equation is different from other
    inland regions of California. Moreover, developing models tailored to a specific
    region or climate might result in higher accuracies but at the cost of lower generalizability.
    The accuracy-generalizability trade-off of this data-driven approach is another
    area for future research. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mohammad Hossein

  description: Most Orchards throughout the Mediterranean basin rely heavily on irrigation,
    a dependency increasing due to climate changes. Assessing the water requirement
    (WR) is crucial and depends on different factors, including orchard age, tree
    density per field, inter-row management. This study proposes new methods to evaluate
    these characteristics with remote sensing (RS). Various remote sensors providing
    high and very high spatial resolution images are investigated and their accuracy
    is assessed. The final objective is to assess WR using variables derived from
    remote sensing compared to data provided by water managers and from the FAO method.
    A typical Mediterranean watershed was selected in South-Eastern France, with orchards
    having various agricultural practices. Original methods were developed with Sentinel
    2 (S2) data (2016–2023), 1 Pleiades image (2022) and the extraction of Google-satellite-hybrid
    images (GSH, 2017), and assessed using a large ground observation dataset (information
    on water use collected on 366 fields). Five orchards were monitored by capacitive
    sensors to assess the water balance. Irrigation durations ranged from 3–300 hours/year,
    with decision influenced by tree density and plot age. To identify young orchards,
    a thresholding approach on S2 derived NDVI effectively identified young orchards
    achieving a 98% accuracy rate. Grassed and non-grassed orchards were mapped using
    two methods, with a random forest classification using three spectral bands with
    72% accuracy and a supervised approach yielding 81% accuracy for GSH and 57% for
    Pleiades. The performance depends on the acquisition date of images. A pattern
    detection algorithm applied to GSH and Pleaides determined tree density, showing
    a high correlation (r²=0.9) with observed data. These RS derived variables allowed
    to compute orchard water requirements at the watershed scale, ranging from 70
    to 550 mm annually depending on management practices. The proposed methods can
    be extrapolated to other territories and are implemented using open access softwares.

    densityWater requirementPleiadesSentinel 2 1. Introduction Within the Mediterranean
    region, there is an increasing reliance on the use of irrigation in agriculture
    (Molle and Sanchis-Ibor, 2019). With climate change and more frequent (and extended)
    drought periods, crop water requirements are proving more difficult to meet, leading
    to the potential for increased water resource conflicts (Cramer et al., 2020).
    The year 2022 represented an extreme in this sense, as the drought period lasted
    from spring to early September in France. Temperatures have exceeded 30°C, much
    longer than the seasonal norms, with 25% rain deficit in the year (60% in May)
    and leading to irrigation restrictions being imposed across many regions (Meteo-France,
    2022). Indeed, the water stocks are not subsequently yet completely renewed even
    in the winter period (Labbe et al., 2023). To maintain a sustainable and diversified
    agricultural sector and ensure more secure food and livestock production, an effective
    and adaptable water resource management is required (Grujard, 2003). Possible
    adaptation actions include changes in conventional agricultural practices to move
    towards an agroecological transition. Among these actions, a better irrigation
    management, new crop types (better suitable for high temperatures), or different
    practices for the sowing dates can be proposed (Basche and Edelson, 2017, Ruiz-Martinez
    et al., 2015, Thomas and Kevan, 1993). In the Mediterranean zone, integrated water
    resource management has become a major issue, both in terms of quantities needed
    and quality of water to be preserved. The degradation of the quality of a large
    number of rivers, groundwater and recent droughts have been reported by Guyomard
    et al., (2017). 1.1. Orchard water consumption Orchards are one of the emblematic
    crops of the Mediterranean region, but have high water requirements that are rising
    due to increasingly hot summers. Although using a relatively enhanced form of
    irrigation delivery via drippers in the south-east of France, orchards can still
    consume large amounts of water, e.g. 526 mm/year for apricot trees, 738 mm for
    olive trees or 540 mm for cherry trees (CABRL, 2019). These water requirements
    are usually assessed using the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) method
    (Allen et al., 1998) because of its low data and calculation requirements. That
    approach is based on an estimate of a reference evapotranspiration. The computation
    uses data from a standard weather station (Penman, 1948), along with a correction
    coefficient (Kc) that can be defined for each crop type (Allen et al., 1998).
    Kc calibrations have been carried out for a large number of regions, crop types,
    and soil and climatic conditions, with a large body of results assessed against
    in situ measurements using lysimeters or the Bowen ratio measurements or eddy
    correlation flows (Pereira et al., 2015). Improvements have been proposed to consider
    the soil properties, which impact the evapotranspiration (ET) processes (Guerra
    et al., 2016). Numerous papers have shown that it is also important to account
    for physical and socio-economic factors (such as the irrigation material and the
    cost, the farm size, the man-power and market demand…), which may add some constraints
    in irrigation practices (Harmanny and Malek, 2019; Fernandez-Cirelli et al., 2009;
    Poussin et al., 2008). Importantly, the FAO method does not account for variations
    related to “on-farm” practices that might be implemented for dry and wet years,
    impacting the amount of water available to the plant (Allen et al., 2005, Djaman
    et al., 2016). Orchard irrigation techniques can be quite variable, including
    drip irrigation in the north-western Mediterranean, flooding mainly in North Africa
    regions, and microsprinklers as reported by (Monney, 2011). Depending on the techniques
    used, the delivered quantities significantly differ in time and space. One issue
    remains to assess this spatial and temporal variability at watershed scale. In
    order to optimize the water quantities delivered on-farm, it is necessary to know
    the actual crop needs, which depend on phenology and the leaf development during
    the season, the soil water stock, and the farming practices (Stanhill, 1957),
    varying also in space and time. Farming practices, such as the choices of the
    variety (early, late, or seasonal), the plant density per hectare, tree age, pruning
    during the season, inter-row management (grassed or bare soil), are all relevant
    factors to be considered when estimating the water consumption of orchards (Allen
    and Pereira, 2009). If orchards present grass in their inter-rows, grass requires
    also water for its development. Competition can then appear with the trees (Ruiz-Colmenero
    et al. (2011). Not surprisingly, water deficits can lead to significant yield
    losses in crops. Up to now, there is no method delivering maps on the grassing
    of orchards. 1.2. Methods to assess the water needs Related to this, one of the
    major problems for water managers at the catchment scale (ASA1 for example), is
    to estimate sufficiently early in the year the water needs for agriculture across
    the whole territory, in order to be able to equitably distribute the water supplies
    for irrigation, particularly during shortage periods (Hajkowicz and Collins, 2007,
    Iglesias et al., 2007) Various types of decision support systems (DSS) have been
    developed, although mainly applied at the field scale and for cereals (Zwart and
    Bastiaanssen, 2004). Most of these are based on the use of crop models such as
    STICS (Brisson et al., 2003), DSSAT (Jones et al., 2003), Optirrig (Richard et
    al., 2022) or Aquacrop (Rallo et al., 2012), which are used to simulate the water
    consumption of plants. Once calibrated, the models can then be employed to analyse
    different irrigation scenarios and assess the impact of climatic changes on production
    (Bregaglio et al., 2017). However, the spatialization of these models over an
    entire territory can be problematic due to the many parameters that required,
    and which are rarely well known (Faivre et al., 2004). Other approaches for crop
    and resource management have relied on the use of remote sensing to characterize
    the surface variability (Courault et al., 2021, Courault et al., 2019) or to manage
    natural resources (Kasischke et al., 2014, Kennedy et al., 2009, Wang and Weng,
    2013). With the launch of the Sentinel mission in 2015, the availability of high
    spatial (10 m pixel) and temporal (every 3 to 5 days, depending on satellites
    A/B) resolution images has advanced the options for monitoring cultivated areas
    (Bazzi et al., 2022, Behera et al., 2018, Veloso et al., 2017). In a similar vein,
    land use maps based on deep learning methods are increasingly available for the
    identification of crop types (Abubakar et al., 2022, Jafarzadeh and Attarchi,
    2023). Likewise, operational products such as surface moisture maps derived from
    the Sentinel 1 and 2 combination are provided by the THEIA platform2 over various
    regions at fine resolution (10 m every 6 days) (Bazzi et al., 2019, El Hajj et
    al., 2019). 1.3. Research issues However, despite this abundance of satellite
    images and derived products, crops such as vineyards and orchards remain poorly
    characterized due to their structural heterogeneity (including inter-rows and
    trees). Recently, El Hajj et al., (2023) evaluated the potentialities of radar
    Sentinel 1 data to map the water uptake rate across a very high-density olive
    orchard in the hot and arid desert climate of Saudi Arabia. The proposed method
    gives satisfactory results but is restricted to evergreen orchards whose canopy
    volume does not change significantly. Orchard characterization is often addressed
    using very high resolution images such as drones (Dong et al., 2020, Özdarici-OK
    and Ok, 2023, Park et al., 2015) or sensors such as RapidEye, Quickbird, or Skysat
    (Houborg and McCabe, 2015). In recent work, Johansen et al., (2018) showed that
    routine collection of UAV images can provide useful information on agricultural
    practices, such as pruning effects on tree structure. Dian et al., (2023) combined
    UAV and Lidar to assess vertical structure of three citrus cultivars, while Teina
    (2009), used Ikonos images (pixel 1–4 m) to classify the different plant types
    of coconuts with high performances. Summarizing much of the recent progress in
    this area, Zhang et al. (2021) focused their review on studies using UAVs for
    orchard management. While very fine information can be extracted from UAV data,
    these sensors remain applicable to limited areas and periods and can often be
    costly. From a satellite-based perspective, remote sensing applications in orchards
    are very diversified on resource efficiency, production, geometric traits and
    diseases (Panda et al., 2010). In terms of orchard species, relatively few studies
    have been carried out on cherry trees and apricots, with most tending to focus
    on olive (Cammalleri et al., 2013, Elfarkh et al., 2023, Sepulcre-Cantó et al.,
    2006) and citrus orchards (Dian et al., 2023, Er-Raki et al., 2009, Glenn and
    Tabb, 2018, Xu et al., 2023). In general, there are no operational methods easily
    applied at the watershed scale to derive key variables involved in the water consumption
    and in the monitoring of agricultural practices impacting water resources. 1.4.
    Objectives In this sense, the main objective of this study is to develop methods
    to estimate orchard characteristics at plot scale impacting water consumption,
    and then to estimate the water requirements of orchards at watershed scale. In
    terms of orchards characteristics, we particularly focused on examining: I) inter-row
    management, in order to detect grassed and non-grassed plots; II) discrimination
    between young (planted less than 5 years ago) and old orchards, since the water
    requirements are quite different for these two categories; and III) the tree density
    per plot. As the study scope is conducted at both plot and watershed scales (water
    management scale by ASA), various image sources were analysed having different
    spatial resolutions. Particular attention was paid for developing generalizable
    methods, easy to implement. One of the objectives was to assess the accuracy of
    the three variables (mentioned above) according to the used sensors. The final
    objective was to evaluate the water requirements computed from these variables
    derived from remote sensing to data provided by water managers (ASA) and from
    the FAO method. A large dataset of ground observations was used to evaluate the
    proposed methods. 2. Data and methodology 2.1. Study site and grounds observations
    A typical Mediterranean area, the Ouvèze-Ventoux watershed (located in the South-Eastern
    France, centred 44°13.050'' N, 5°8.579''E) was selected for this study (see Fig.
    1). The catchment covers 100 km² and has an average annual temperature of around
    15.5°C (1993–2023 average Carpentras weather station), with an annual rainfall
    amounts of around 650 mm (mainly concentrated in autumn-winter). The altitudes
    range from 209 m above sea level (a.s.l) on the plateau area to 1558 m a.s.l at
    Mont Ventoux, the higher peak of the region. Most agricultural areas are located
    on the plateau, between 250 and 400 m a.s.l on a silt-loam soil (∼22% silt, 43%
    sand 35% loam) covered by vineyards (35% of the total cultivated areas), and orchards
    (28% with 631 ha). Most orchards and table grapes are irrigated. The water for
    irrigation is primarily sourced from the Ouvèze river and distributed through
    a network of pressurized pipelines managed by the Ouvèze-Ventoux ASA. The water
    for irrigation is available only from April to October. Download : Download high-res

    of the Ouvèze-Ventoux watershed in the Vaucluse department in Southeastern France,
    and photos illustrating the diversity of orchards. Among orchards (1425 fields,
    631 ha), cherry trees are the most numerous in the region. The field size is small,
    on average 0.4 ha). The development period starts in spring from March up to June.
    Around 80% of cherry orchards are irrigated by drip, with one or two pipes per
    row, while 10% have micro-sprinklers located 1 m above the ground between two
    trees, with the remainder by sprinkler and very few (< 2%) by flooding (see Fig.
    1). According to the ASA information, the average of water quantity consumed per
    year per plot is around 350 mm (It is important to mention that there is large
    variability between farms and the trend is an increase of irrigation due to more
    frequent droughts and heat waves). For several years (since 2017 up to 2023),
    observations and surveys were conducted by the French Institute of National Research
    in Agronomy and Environment (INRAE) across this area to collect information on
    the main agricultural practices. These surveys compiled ground references from
    648 plots, with 359 plots occupied by orchards, whose main characteristics are
    summarized in Table 1. The average plot size on the whole basin is 0.4 ha with
    265 tree/ha. Table 1. Main characteristics of observed orchards (data obtained

    3 – 3.1 – 3.5 These agricultural surveys have demonstrated a wide variability
    of irrigation practices across the region. Most of the farmers start irrigation
    of cherry orchards after flowering, at the fruit set phenological stage. The leaves
    appear after flowering. The available water reserve is most of the time enough
    at the beginning of the year. Generally this water stock depends on winter rainfall.
    This stock can vary according to climatic years. ASA delivers water for irrigation
    from April. In this region, the day of the start of irrigation corresponds to
    the phenological stage of fruit-set. This day can vary according to the selected
    cultivars, covering the period from the end of March to the end of April. Generally,
    different varieties are found on a same plot in order to stagger the harvest dates,
    and better respond to the diversification of commercial demand. For instance,
    in cherry trees, the most common varieties are “Prime-giant” (earlier), “Belge”,
    “Burlat” (late), and “Folfer” (season) and the rootstock “Sainte-Lucie”. Apart
    phenological stage, a wide variability in irrigation practices was observed: for
    instance, in 2021, the applied dose for cherry trees can vary from to 57 mm to
    525 mm/year. With drip irrigation, some farmers choose to bring water for 1 hour
    per day in April, then increase up to 2 or 3 hours every two days from May to
    August, and then decrease application after the harvest, again to 1 hour in September.
    Others prefer to bring water every week, but for longer periods (4 or 6 hours).
    This variability could be explained by their irrigation equipment (dripper type,
    spacing between drippers…), the inter-row management, the cultivar, tree age,
    the soil type and the available manpower. A soil map for the whole Vaucluse department
    was made by the SCP3 (Société du canal de Provence) at 1/50000 and the soil water
    reserve map at France scale (at 90 m spatial resolution, downloaded at Agroenvgeo4)
    was used to have the main soil characteristics of the studied areas. It appeared
    as expected that farmers bring more water on sandy soils than on silty loamy soils.
    Apart from olives, the majority of orchards have grass with variable inter-row
    distances according to the orchards type and age (Table 1). The largest distances
    for the inter-rows are 9 m for young plum trees, and the lowest around 3.5 m for
    old apricot orchards. For grass inter-row orchards in the spring/summer, the soil
    vegetation can be in competition with the tree for the water requirements. Some
    farmers cut the grass anywhere between one to three times per year in order to
    minimise this competition, while other let it cover the soil, turning yellow in
    summer after the harvest (for cherry, apricots, plums) when irrigation decreases
    (Vilà and Sardans, 1999). A spatial cadastral database of the region fields is
    used from the following web link: https://cadastre.data.gouv.fr/map?style=ortho.
    The LPIS (European Land Parcel Identification System5) provides additional spatial
    information (in a shapefile) to identify each field of the study area at a finer
    spatial resolution. This LPIS file informs only on the fields declared by farms
    to receive subsidies (on our study area, only 40% of fields were declared). Additional
    ground observations were consequently done to complete these data by the notation
    of each crop type (orchard, vineyard or other crops) in each unknown plots and
    defined the boundaries of each new plot (finally there are 3548 agricultural fields,
    including 1415 orchards). 2.2. Remote sensing data Given the different spatial
    resolutions that were explored, various remote sensing sources were used to extract
    key variables related to the orchard structure and to monitor their seasonal evolution
    (see Table 2). These included: • Sentinel 2: images acquired over the study site
    (tile T31TFJ) were corrected for atmospheric effects corresponding to level 2 A
    according to methods described by Hagolle et al. (2008). The main characteristics
    of images are presented in supplementary material part 1. Data were downloaded
    each week automatically by Python programs from the THEIA platform6 for the period
    between 2016 and 2022. The time frequency varies between 3 and 6 days, but some
    dates can present clouds and must be removed. The different spectral bands (green,
    red and near-infrared) are combined to compute the most common vegetation index
    (NDVI) for each acquisition date (Cantini et al., 2023). As some periods present
    no data due to cloudy dates, temporal interpolation is done using the “WhittakerFilt”
    function in R (Vuolo et al., 2011) to get daily values for each spectral bands
    and NDVI. There is no spatial interpolation, all pixels are considered and averaged
    at field scale. • Pleiades: data were acquired through the Dinamis platform7 operated
    by CNES and Airbus. A specific request has been made on the Ouvèze area for the
    summer. On the web site of dinamis, only a period can be defined, and not an accurate
    date can be chosen. Pleiades serves various services of territory monitoring (eg
    if floodings or landslides appear, priorities are managed by Airbus).The acquired
    date depends therefore on different factors among them the cloud occurrence, and
    emergency priorities for monitoring some other sites (see https://www.theia-land.fr/en/product/pleiades/
    to have more details). The main characteristics (spectral bands and spatial resolution
    for the different modes, added in supplementary material table S1 and S2) of this
    space Earth Observation system is described in Lebègue et al. (2012). One image
    was available over our study area for the summer 2022. The covered area included
    the entire Ouvèze basin (see Fig. 1). The images have a pixel resolution of 50 cm
    at nadir for the panchromatic spectral mode and 2.8 m for the multispectral mode
    (4 spectral bands: blue, green, red near-infrared). These last multispectral images
    were resampled using the fusion algorithm of Liu (2023) to derive a spatial resolution
    of 50 cm. • Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Images were acquired using an RGB camera
    for two areas of the basin at a height of 50 m above the surface. 1415 images
    were taken with an overlap of 80%. The georeferencing is done using reference
    disks located on the ground at different places marked with a precision GPS. Automatic
    algorithms (developed by the INRAE team) are then used to make the image fusion.
    The images were processed by the commercial enterprise Hiphen,8 which provided
    an orthorectified mosaic with a spatial resolution of 10 mm (calibration coefficients
    were given in supplementary material table S3). Pixel aggregation to 20 cm was
    performed to optimize the computational time and reduce the data storage. In this
    study, the UAV imagery were used as reference data to validate our method to compute
    tree number per orchard. • Google satellite hybrid images (GSH) have been used
    combining both QGIS software to extract the full image from the google source
    and R functions to characterise the plot scale image with the different RGB bands
    (Crop functions and zonalstat functions were used in R). This data was downloaded
    from Tile+ pluggin used with qgis (http://bit.ly/3inbiMt). This tool offers the
    possibilities to add various open access layers, provided by different operators,
    among them the google satellite hydrid image9. This image was the result of merging
    different images taken in April 2017 over our area, from various sensors operating
    at fine resolution (SPOT 7-Pleiades). The final spatial resolution was 50 cm using
    a resampling function based on a bilinear method. All the images cover various
    years with different resolutions. Ground observations were done from 2017 to 2023
    on the agricultural practices and landuse. It can happen that some landuse modifications
    appear between years. We have taken into account the changes for some fields in
    this case. The images from the different sensors were overlaid on the vector spatial
    database containing all the plot boundaries using R functions to generate as many
    thumbnails in raster format as parcels (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res

    Fig. 2 presents the general approach that was applied to the different remote
    sensing data sources, including the UAV, GSH, Pleiades, and Sentinel 2 platforms,
    and covering resolutions from 8 mm to 10 m. More detail is given for each method
    in the following sections. Of course, each of these sources has its own constraints.
    For instance, Sentinel 2 is open access but comes with a relatively large pixel
    size, while Pleiades has improved resolution but is far less frequent in time
    (i.e. imagery must be tasked). Similarly, GSH offers fine resolution, but with
    no choice of acquisition date, while the UAV data provides enhanced resolution,
    but can be expensive and has a comparatively small sampling footprint. In this
    figure, the main inputs (at left) and outputs (at right) are outlined. For determining
    the orchard age, a thresholding is applied on Sentinel-2 NDVI during the summer
    season to distinguish young and old plantations. Regarding inter-row grassiness,
    two methods were experimented: one involved a random forest statistical classification
    applied to Sentinel 2 images to map grassy and non-grassy plots, while the second
    method applied on GSH and Pleaides data relied on classifications based on thresholding
    the blue band to isolate three components within a plot: tree, grass, and bare
    soil. Lastly, tree density was estimated using a pattern detection algorithm applied
    to GSH, Pleiades, and UAV images. The results were compared and validated from
    ground observations. By incorporating these three orchard characteristics, the
    water requirements are estimated to better characterize water needs at the watershed
    scale. 2.3.1. Sentinel 2 Data for classify the orchards (young/old and grassed
    or non-grassed) Two different methods were developped to extract the aimed orchard
    characteristics from Sentinel 2 data First, to separate old and young orchards
    (the right part of Fig. 3), mean values of NDVI, reflecting the ratio between
    the difference between near infra-red (Band 8) and the red (Band 4) reflectance
    bands and the sum of these bands (Rouse et al., 1974), were computed for all available
    Sentinel 2 dates across each orchard. Then, temporal profiles of average values
    obtained at plot scale were analysed for all orchards where ground observations
    were available (i.e. old or young orchards (orchard age information was given
    from farmer survey). From the analysis of the temporal profiles of NDVI for all
    cherry trees, it can be observed that young orchards (<5 years) always presented
    low NDVI values in summer (see light grey line in Fig. 7a). Therefore, a NDVI
    threshold of 0.4, based on field data was proposed in the period between DOY 220
    (8/8) and 250 (7/9) for the studied years (2016–2022) to classify the whole watershed
    and map young orchards at watershed scale. Download : Download high-res image

    to detect grassed or non-grassed orchards; young orchard plants from Sentinel
    2 images. Then in order to identify the plots with grass and non-grass on the
    inter-rows, a supervised classification was applied to a Sentinel 2 image with
    the green (G), red (R), and near-infrared (NIR) spectral bands as predictive variables
    (left part of Fig. 3). The database of ground observations (with information of
    grassed and non- grassed fields: 307 plots) was divided into two parts: one for
    the training (50 plots) and the other for the validation (257). The target variables
    are the fields classified into two classes: inter-row with grass or without grass.
    A cloudless date acquired in the beginning of spring (early March, when trees
    have no leaves) was chosen to ensure clear separation between orchards with green
    grass in the inter-rows from orchards with bare soils. The random forest (RF)
    algorithm was applied, considering the learning dataset extracted from ground
    observation that included 50 randomly selected orchards, and with the hyper-tuning
    parameters fixed at follows: 10 for the number of trees, min power set size: 2
    and max power set size:7, and 5000 for the number of training samples (values
    very commonly used for similar supervised classifications). The remaining 257
    plots not used in the training stage were used for validation. Validation consists
    in comparing if each plot is well classified, either grassed or not. Accuracy
    is computed by counting the well classified fields compared to the total number
    of plots of the validation database. 2.3.2. Assessment of grassed and non-grassed
    orchards from Pleiades and GSH images Fig. 4 summarizes the different steps to
    classify grassed or non-grassed orchards using GSH and Pleaides data. We chose
    to develop a method easier to implement on images having less spectral bands and
    with less acquisition dates than Sentinel 2, and easier to understand compared
    to more complex statistical approaches. A hierarchical approach is proposed in
    two main stages. Among the different spectral bands, first the blue band is selected
    because it presents more contrasts to separate trees from the background. Walter,
    (2004) has mentioned that the best discrimination between landuse classes using
    the variance can be seen in blue band. Then a classification is done using a threshold
    (T1) based on the averaged value in blue band of the trees extracted from the
    calibration dataset (for GSH T1=0.6, for Pleiades T1=0.85). Then, a second classification
    was performed on the last classified images defining a second threshold (T2) to
    separate grassed from bare soil pixels of inter-rows (for GSH, T2=0.10, Pleiades=0.95.
    T2 correspond to the mean values of interrow grass computed from the calibration
    dataset). The next step consisted of computing at the plot scale the number of
    non-grassed pixels. If 65% of pixels were classified in bare soils then the field
    was classified as non-grassed field. The last stage is the validation of the obtained
    maps comparing ground observations to the classified plots. Similarely, to classical
    supervised classification, a database for the calibration is necessary and also
    an independent validation dataset. The advantage of the method here is that it
    requires a small database for the calibration (here only 10 plots were selected).
    All the processings were developed using R functions, easily accessible and operational
    to be applied on other sites with PLEIADES or GHS images. The problem of using
    thresholds is that they are data dependent. Different factors can influence the
    reflectance at a given date. An expert knowledge is often required for most methods
    to choose the most representative dataset for training. This point will be more
    argued in the discussion part. Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download

    orchards from GSH and Pleaides images. . An accuracy assessment was done comparing
    results obtained with ground observations of 195 plots not used for calibration.
    The results will be discussed in the part 3. 2.3.3. Assessment of the number of
    trees We applied an algorithm based on Marked Point Process (Obj.MPP, open access
    at https://gitlab.inria.fr/edebreuv/Obj.MPP and written in python) for the detection
    of parametric objects (or patterns) in a signal (De Graeve et al., 2019). The
    objects are defined by a finite set of parameters (see supplementary material
    table S5 and S6 part6) according to their shape (circle, rectangle, triangle…).
    In this case, for detecting trees, we selected a disk described by the radius
    (min and max lengths in the studied samples), and the overlap tolerance (expressed
    in pixel number). The number of iterations must be fixed with a quality indicator
    to stop the process. An accurate description of this algorithm applied to various
    studies can be found in De Graeve et al., (2019) and Eldin et al., (2012). Each
    geometrical parameter needs to be calibrated according to the spatial resolution
    of the analysed images and the studied object dimension. These parameters can
    be affected by the contrast in images and consequently are dependent on whether
    or not there is grass between the rows. This first step to define the main parameters
    was done from a reference dataset of known representative orchards. The reference
    dataset is composed of 5 selected plots with different tree densities, for which
    it was easy to identify the actual tree number from GSH images. Table S6-S7 given
    in supplementary material provide these different input parameters according to
    the sensors, and to the state of the grass between the tree rows. Among the outputs,
    a tabular file gives (for each plot) the tree number and for each tree, its size
    (radius) and the centroid location. 2.4. Assessment of water consumption A micrometeorological
    station was installed in May 2022 in the center of a large cherry orchard to measure
    relative humidity and air temperature, net radiation, rainfall, surface temperature,
    soil and heat fluxes at a 15 minutes time step (see in supplementary material
    part 2 the description of the sensors). For previous years, data were taken from
    the weather station of Carpentras10 (located 15 km SE of the study area). An example
    of micrometeorological measurements obtained for the year 2022 is presented in
    Fig S1a in supplementary material. Comparisons between stations for common periods
    have been done to evaluate the differences for the main variables (see Fig S1b
    in the supplementary materials). The results showed significant correlations for
    the main climatic variables (rain and temperature) between the two stations (see
    supplementary material Fig S1 a-b). A systematic bias for the air temperature
    was observed, in the order of 1°C (temperatures are higher at Carpentras than
    on the Ouvèze area), which is easily explained by both the altitude impact (Carpentras
    altitude is 95 m a.s.l, Ouvèze station is at 200 m a.s.l), and the fact that the
    weather station in the Ouvèze watershed is located in the middle of an irrigated
    cherry orchard (with higher evapotranspiration cooling the environment air), and
    the Carpentras station is on open grassland. On five orchards showing different
    irrigation managements, soil moisture content was monitored with capacitive probes
    (Teros 10, Meter) down to 30–50 cm, both in the row and the inter-row. Data are
    recorded since 2021 each 30 minute with a data logger (CR1000X, Campbell Sci.).
    Soil samples were also collected on the same fields to estimate the available
    water content (AWC) for the 0–50 cm layer (AWC given in the supplementary material
    Fig S3a, Table S4). On the largest field monitored, sap flow meters were also
    set up and monitored by Kaust team. All these last measurements are currently
    analysed according to methods described in El Hajj et al., (2023). In parallel,
    tree phenological stages were noted and hemispherical photos were taken once a
    month on 13 various orchards to characterize the leaf development all along the
    year according to protocols described in (Courault et al., 2022, Lopez-Lozano
    et al., 2022). Biophysical variables characterizing the orchard structure such
    as LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR are evaluated from these photos following methods detailed
    in (Demarez et al., 2008). All these measurements allowed to have reference observations
    on the water uptake rate from the trees for the monitored fields (details are
    given in the supplementary material part 3 for the formulations used to compute
    water budget at plot scale). Seven years of data were analysed from 2016 to 2022,
    which were characterised by the annual Martonne Aridity Index (Botzan et al.,
    1998, De Martonne, 1920) described in the supplementary material (Fig S2) to classify
    wet and dry years. The results of this index show that 2018 appears as the wettest
    years and 2017 the driest. Three methods were examined to analyse the annual water
    amounts used for irrigation at regional scale: 1) The maximal water consumption
    for each crop (ETm) was computed from the FAO 56 method (Allen et al., 1998) using
    the potential evapotranspiration (ETp) derived from the weather station measurements
    and crop coefficients (Kc) for each crop found in tables adapted for the region
    (CABRL, 2019)11. These ETm values were then combined with cumulative rainfall
    to estimate water requirements (WR) for each crop class following Eq. 1 (see Fig
    S1a in supplementary material). The values were then aggregated at farm scale
    for each year. (1) WR= (kc x ETp)-Rainfall [mm] 2) Using data provided by the
    ASA (Association Syndicale Autorisée)12 at the farm scale for each year which
    are recorded from the irrigation terminal. These values (here named WASA), can
    be affected by water losses in the network. The various equipments are also old
    and not checked regularly by farmers, and ASA does not have the resources or staff
    to improve this point. The accuracy of the DATA provided by ASA is thus estimated
    to be around 30%. 3) Determining the water amount brought to each field from the
    information given by the surveyed farms ((2), (3)). In Eq. 3, we see that orchard
    characteristics such as the number of trees, inter-row distances, field size are
    required, as too is information regarding the irrigation equipment (i.e. number
    of pipes per row, number of drips/m and flow in L/h). The row number is computed
    for 1 Ha from the inter-row distance, then the pipe length is derived per field
    according to the field size and the row number. (2) WFdrip=(Ltot/Ld) x Qd x t
    / Surf [mm] (3) WFmicrosprinkler=Td x Ns x Surf x Flow x t / Surf [mm] Where,
    Ltot: total pipe length, Ld: space between 2 drippers, t: irrigation duration
    per year, Surf: field surface, Qd: dripper flow, Td: tree density, Ns: number
    of micro-sprinkler per tree, Flow: sprinkler flow. Fig. 5 shows the distributions
    of the different variables used to compute (2), (3). The row number per field
    varied from 3 to 34 with a median around 10, showing a majority of small fields.
    We observed a large variability in dripper flow rate from 2 L/h for the majority
    to 8 L/ha (Fig. 5a 5b). The duration of drip irrigation varied from 0 to 300 hours
    per year with two groups around 50 and 250 hours (Fig. 5e). The space between
    two drippers also varied a lot from 0.33 to 2.5 m. There was no observed correlation
    between the flow and the irrigation duration. On the irrigation amount brought
    per field per year, the distribution is bimodal with a median at 154 mm and maximum
    up to 919 mm. Different factors can explain these variabilities such as the soil
    type, the orchard age and the slope. Additional parameters, including the number
    of trees par field, row number can be found in supplementary materials (part 3

    of orchard development and identification of young orchards from Sentinel 2 The
    analysis of the temporal NDVI profiles was mainly focused on cherry trees, which
    were more numerous in the Ouvèze area and for which we have more observations
    for validation. Fig. 6 shows the typical temporal profiles obtained in various
    orchards with different agricultural management (i.e. grassed (Fig. 6b/not-grassed
    Fig. 6a). The profiles show an increase from spring (end of March) when the first
    leaves appear, then from day of year (DOY) 150 (mid-June) the NDVI was maximum
    corresponding to the peak leaf development. In July (around DOY 200) a slight
    decrease was observed. This decrease was due both to the decrease of irrigation
    after the harvest, the leaves are rolled up in the middle of the day, and leaf
    inclination varied. At the pixel scale, there is also an impact of the inter-row
    on NDVI. In summer, the grass in the inter-row of orchards becomes yellow. An
    increase in NDVI was observed following the arrival of autumn rainfall, allowing
    the inter-rows to again become green. This inter-row impact is more pronounced
    during the 2022 year (which was exceptionally dry and hot) compared to other years
    (2018 was at the opposite: a remarkably wet year, see statistics in table S4 in
    supplementary material). Fig. 6c shows the distinction between the NDVI development
    during the year 2018 for four grassed orchards having different water management.
    Here, two fields (50 and 3099) were irrigated by drip irrigation, one (3347) was
    irrigated by micro-sprinkler and the last (1401) was non-irrigated. The micro-sprinkler
    irrigation gives the highest values of NDVI. This field received also more water
    than the others. As expected, the non- irrigated field presented the lowest NDVI
    values, especially during summer. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download

    of young orchards, varying from 11 to 30% between years. It is worth noting that
    young orchards can range from being recently planted (first year) or have 5 years
    and be almost ready to produce. As such, an orchard that is 5 years old in one
    year, will not be counted in the following year, which may explain some of the
    observed variability in Table 3. Ground surveys have confirmed around 20–25% of
    land use changes over the watershed, which also appears in the interval obtained.
    Some farmers test new orchard varieties (more profitable), other decide to replace
    old orchards becoming less productive. As can be seen, the highest proportion
    of young orchards was observed for 2017, while the lowest was seen in 2018. However,
    the 2018 value is too low compared to the other years and when compared against
    ground references. In this case, the inaccurate identification for 2018 appear
    to be related to the fact that 2018 was a very rainy year (according to the aridity
    index of de Martonne). The NDVI in summer was considerably higher than in other
    years, with green grass still visible in the inter-rows for some orchards (see
    Fig. 7b). Consequently, the threshold for wet years (when the Martonne index is
    higher than 30) was modified and set at 0.5 during the same period between DOY
    220 and 250 to separate young and old orchards (Fig. 7b). The corrected values
    for 2018 are also shown in Table 3, which is more in accordance with ground observations.
    Indeed, the performance of this classifications (based on simple thresholding)
    achieved 98% for the classification of young cherry orchards in the studied area.
    Globally we can consider that the method gave quite satisfactory results. Download

    plots Fig. 8 presents the map of grassed (in red) and non-grassed (in green) orchards
    at the watershed scale obtained from Sentinel 2. The overall accuracy (computed
    from confusion matrix) was 79% of well classified fields meaning that fields classified
    in grassed orchard was always a grassed orchard according to our ground observations.
    21% were misclassified. The analysis of these misclassified plots has shown that
    they corresponded to very heterogeneous plots in grass state and are often covered
    with a lot of stones at the surface, shifting their classification to non-grassed
    fields rather than their correct classification as grassed fields. Despite this,
    we can consider this first results as satisfactory and difficult to improve given
    the fact that the Sentinel 2 pixel integrates a mix of row and tree and that the
    field size is relatively small (compared to the pixel size) in the study area.
    It is for this reason that we have explored data acquired at a finer spatial resolution,
    which is detailed in the following section. Download : Download high-res image

    method described in Section 2.4.2 for the whole watershed, compared to the ground
    observations. The performance was improved for GSH images relative to the Pleiades
    images acquired in summer, which is expected since GSH has a highest spatial resolution.
    Overall accuracy was 88% of correct identification with GSH for the detection
    of grassed orchards, A slightly lower performance was obtained for non-grassed
    fields (61%). An explanation is due the acquisition period for GSH images: in
    April, inter-rows can show grass regrowth or are not yet moved. For Pleiades,
    the lower score can be explained by the acquisition period in July. At this period,
    the grass in the inter-row is often very dry and yellow and then the fields can
    be classified as non-grassed orchards. The crown development of the tree is also
    larger in Pleiades classifications as shown in Fig. 9 and consequently the inter-row
    is less visible. Table 4. Results of the identification of the grass cover of

    Application of the algorithm to delineate trees at the plot scale using a UAV
    image (western part of the largest cherry tree of the study area). The algorithm
    was applied to all orchards within the watershed. Validation was done from a random
    sample of 50 fields. Fig. 11 shows the correlations obtained with the GHS images
    (Fig. 11 a) and the Pleiades images (Fig. 11b). The correlation coefficients are
    high for both cases. The largest field with more than 1000 trees impacts the statistics.
    If this last field is removed, the performances are lower with (r²=0.75 with GSH
    images, r²=0.72 with Pleaides, see graphs in supplementary material Fig S5-S6).
    Some underestimation in the number of trees is observed for several fields when
    using the GSH images. Analysis of those fields revealed that the orchards were
    very heterogeneous. The detection worked poorly for a particular apricot orchard,
    where it estimated only 75 trees, compared to 331 observed trees. This parcel
    was very heterogeneous, with young and old trees and with a large soil moisture
    variability visible at the surface (with dark and light areas). Projected shadows
    and various contrasts in the background likely distorted the analysis and the
    number of trees counted, explaining the deficient results obtained for this field.
    The acquisition date of images used for delineation of trees is important to consider.
    If the canopy is well developed, a problem can also appear with the tree overlap
    for some fields leading to an underestimation of the number of trees. Download

    from remote sensing (i.e., number of trees per field) was used to estimate water
    consumption of orchards according to (2), (3) (described in Section 2.4). Accurate
    information on the irrigation equipment, flow and irrigation duration from farmers
    were also needed. This technical information was available from farmer surveys
    representative of the variability of agricultural practices encountered in the
    watershed. Values obtained for water consumption varied from 8 to 910 mm with
    an average in the order of magnitude of 244 mm. For example, at field scale, from
    field survey with water sensors (see Fig. S3a, Table S2), a water balance neglecting
    drainage, indicates 200 to 300 mm of water added as irrigation from May to September
    depending on the year. At the farm scale, comparisons have been performed between
    three farms (representative of the diversity of the agricultural practices, two
    used drip irrigation with different schedules, the third use micro-sprinkler).
    Fig. 13 shows the results obtained for the different irrigation water volumes
    estimated by the three methods (described in Eq. 1 (WR considered as the reference
    according to regional guidelines (Kc method), Eq. 2 (WF from surveys and remote
    sensing data) and WASA) for three farmers and three contrasted years (2016: normal,
    2017: dry and 2018 classified as wet, see table S4 in supplementary material).
    There are uncertainties at different levels. The ASA data are associated with
    approximately 30% uncertainty due to network losses and misrepresentations, which
    is accounted for by including an error bar (blue box). Furthermore, for the calculation
    of WF, some farmers have given us very accurate information on their irrigation
    practices and strategies according to the wet or dry years (they generally bring
    less water for wet year), while others were more inaccurate indicating only a
    standard practice, without changes according to the year climate. When information
    was available, error bars were added to irrigation water volumes computed from
    surveys (WF, green boxes). Download : Download high-res image (213KB) Download

    surveys and variables derived from remote sensing. In addition to uncertainties
    according to the climatic years, other uncertainties can be due to the other factors
    occurring in Eq. 3, among them the number of trees par plot. In order to quantify
    the impact of this uncertainty on the assessment of water brought by the farmer,
    we have computed the water dose for one field considering in the first case 75
    trees (estimated from GSH images) and 69 trees from Pleiades. The hourly intake
    when deploying micro-sprinklers (flow at 70 L/h and with 1 micro sprinkler per
    tree) 5250 litres per hour for GSH and 4830 litres per hour with Pleiades. This
    difference can be significant at the farm scale having an average of more than
    twenty irrigated plots. The analysis of the results shows that for the A1 farmer,
    the three methods do not vary between normal and dry years. For the A2 farmer,
    values from surveys (WF) are always lower than the two other methods except for
    the wet year. On the other hand, the B1 farmer consumes more than the two other
    farms and above the crop needs (expressed in red). Overall, we can identify three
    clear behaviours: one that is more water-efficient (A2), one that is more water
    intensive (B1), and the last (A1) which seems to follow recommendations. 4. Discussion
    • Monitoring orchard development and mapping young orchards from Sentinel 2 Although
    the spatial resolution of Sentinel 2 is 10 m, it allowed to identify the young
    plantations of fruit trees at regional scale. A simplified approach based on a
    thresholding of NDVI gave accurate maps (98% global accuracy) of young orchards
    for the 7 studied years. Nageswara Rao et al., (2004) have shown spectral NDVI
    profiles of different crops and also observed that young mango (planted less than
    5 years) has relatively low profile throughout indicating that the amount of green
    cover is low. The leaf development and the senescence can be easily detected from
    Sentinel 2 times series. A typical pattern was observed for orchards, with a first
    increase from March to June then a plateau more and less deepened in summer according
    to the stress and then at the end from October a slight decrease of NDVI. Similar
    profiles were observed by Zhu et al., (2020) on apple and cherry trees in China.
    The effect of water stress is less marked in this study case due to the climate.
    • Water needs and contribution of remote sensing data The simplified FAO method
    based only on crop coefficient and evapotranspiration presents many computational
    limits. Among them, the limited attention given to soil characteristics that can
    have a strong influence on the available water for the crop. Many papers have
    proposed various approaches using remote sensing to derive Kc, with several including
    the addition of a stress coefficient to improve this simplified approach (Pereira
    et al., 2020, Pôças et al., 2020, Simonneaux et al., 2008). However, Pôças et
    al. (2020), consider that for an improved estimation of crop water requirements,
    these methods should be used in combination with soil water balance models. The
    surface characteristics such as grassed or not, together with inter-row management,
    are then useful parameters that can improve the information about water competition.
    In this study, we have compared different methods to identify grassed orchards
    from non-grassed, comparing range of remote sensing platforms. An accuracy of
    79% of orchards with a correct identification of the inter-row (grassed or non-grassed)
    was obtained from Sentinel 2. This accuracy increases with the use of finer resolution
    images (freely accessible, GSH 81%) but the performances are also highly dependent
    on the date of image acquisition. The choice for the method to apply depends on
    the image availability. The main advantage of using Sentinel 2 data is that there
    are often numerous acquisitions all along the year, so it is easier to choose
    the best period to identify inter-row, but the final accuracy is limited because
    of the spatial resolution. With finer images such as PLEIADES or GSH data, the
    acquisition date is difficult to choose. It is the reason why we have proposed
    another method easier to implement and requiring a limited calibration dataset
    (fairly intuitive method which does not require knowledge on random forest methods).
    One drawback of this last method is the determination of threshods which is data
    dependent. Using a simple thresholding approach for separating herbaceous and
    tree layers on a satellite image rather than a statistical approach can be preferable
    in certain situations for several reasons: −1) Simplicity and ease of implementation:
    Simple thresholding is often easier to implement and understand compared to more
    complex statistical approaches. This can be advantageous, especially if the time
    or resource are constraints; 2) Robustness to local variations: In some regions,
    a statistical approach may be sensitive to local variations or changing environmental
    conditions. Simple thresholding can be more robust in such situations as it does
    not rely as much on statistical assumptions about the data; 3) Less data requirements:
    Statistical approaches may require a significant amount of data to properly calibrate
    models. In contrast, simple thresholding can often be done with less data, which
    can be useful in regions where data are limited; and at finally, 4) Interpretability:
    Simple thresholding can be easier to interpret as it often produces more intuitive
    results. This can be important when communicating results to a non-specialized
    audience. However, it is essential to note that the choice between simple thresholding
    and a statistical approach will depend on the specific objectives of the study,
    the complexity of the data, and the requirements for accuracy. Generally for each
    classification, an expert knowledge is required either to choose a representative
    dataset for calibration or to evaluate the accuracy of the classification. Other
    approaches based on the analysis of times series of Sentinel 2 data have been
    applied to detect inter-row of vineyards by (Abubakar et al., 2023, Palazzi et
    al., 2023). Abubakar et al., (2023) have identified a background signal which
    they subtracted to the Sentinel 2 LAI time series to classify the grassed and
    non-grassed plots. This method seems difficult to implement to orchards because
    the background signal presents different spectral signatures (fruit trees are
    bigger than vineyard plants and the signal can be confused for young plantations).
    Ronchetti et al., (2020) have compared five classification algorithms to monitor
    crop variability from UAV data. If the performances are high for their various
    studied crops, they showed that for pear orchards, the detection methods were
    the noisiest, because of the presence of weeds, the effect of shadows depending
    of the acquisition date and time. Moreover, the use of UAV is limited and often
    expensive to be applied at larger regional scale. The soil characteristics of
    orchards are also important to consider. For the moment, only soil maps that have
    variable accuracy at small scales are available to be used. Some approaches have
    proposed digital soil map combining remote sensing (Gomez et al., 2019, Lagacherie,
    2008), but these methods are difficult to implement for orchards and require large
    areas of bare soils. • Assessment of irrigation volumes The assessment of irrigation
    water volumes from surveys (WF) requires accurate data on irrigation material
    and on the irrigation time. It is still difficult to get this information for
    all the farms of the watershed. The assumption is to consider a statistical representative
    sample of farm surveys including various practices. More ground surveys must be
    done to acquire more data to build relationships on the water volume brought to
    young orchards compared to old plots. While the number of trees can be estimated
    with satisfactory performance from high resolution data (GSH, Pleaides), the accuracy
    depends on the sensor type and on the acquisition image date. Some over- and under-estimation
    has been observed for young orchards or very heterogenous fields, with misclassification
    and poor delineation occasionally resulting. Higher accuracy (>90% of correct
    estimations) are obtained on the number of trees using UAV images at finer spatial
    resolution on various orchard types by Dong et al. (2020) or Johansen et al. (2018),
    but UAV can be expensive (time and for data processing) and has a small sampling
    footprint compared to Pleiades or GSH. The proposed simplified method applied
    to Pleaides or GSH images makes it possible to estimate the number of trees for
    all the orchards in a catchment area. (Ozdarici-ok and Ok, (2023) have reviewed
    various techniques and sensors types to identify orchard trees. No cherry trees
    studies are reported. Most of the references cited used methods based on deep
    learning algorithms requiring a large dataset for training the networks, or classifications.
    The acquisition dates of images at high resolution also have an impact on the
    results, particularly for tree discrimination. According to the homogeneity of
    the surface (inter-row and tree), the detection method can miss some trees, especially
    if there is a mixture of young and old trees within the field. The date of acquisition
    is an important consideration for the retrieval of certain parameters and can
    influence the quality of detection of trees (i.e. the development of the tree
    canopy or grass cover is dependent on timing). To improve the robustness of the
    results, it is recommended to collect some imagery in winter or earlier spring
    to better identify if there is grass in the inter-rows from Sentinel 2 and other
    finer resolution platforms. Antecedent conditions can also affect retrieval results.
    For example, the choice of Pleiades acquisition tasking should avoid periods after
    heavy rain, since large surface soil heterogeneities can confound the classification
    of orchard plots. While the use of GSH offers advantages in terms of resolution,
    there is little control regarding the timing of collection. Despite these constraints,
    the use of free data that can be easily accessed from various online resources
    makes the proposed methods more operational and less costly than using UAV or
    commercial satellite data, or making collecting laborious ground- based observations.
    Alternative remote sensing methods are also available to be explored to improve
    the assessment of the number of trees e.g. LIDAR sensors (Dian et al., 2023, Tsoulias
    et al., 2020). An ambitious program13 coordinated by IGN (Institut national de
    l’Information Géographique) aims to map all the France territory by LIDAR at very
    fine resolution. With these new data, we can expect to have tree level information
    that is more accurate which can complement existing methods. Likewise, while the
    use of radar and thermal sensors was not addressed in this study, they also offer
    directions to be explored to have complementary information of the soil moisture
    and irrigation practices (Courault et al., 2022, McCabe et al., 2019). For the
    moment operational satellites which have thermal bands do not have a sufficient
    spatial or temporal resolution for tracking agricultural practices on small fields
    (such as those within the Ouvèze watershed). The future TRISHNA missions14 which
    should be launched in 2025 (Lagouarde et al., 2019, Rama et al., 2023) should
    improve these last points. 5. Conclusion Here we evaluated a range of approaches
    to characterize agroinformatic variables typical of Mediterranean orchards using
    a variety of remote-sensing based platforms. With increasing drought periods due
    to climate changes and water restrictions occurring in many regions, it is crucial
    to have an accurate assessment of the real water requirements at the landscape
    and river basin scale to improve water resource management. Sentinel 2 images
    with high spatial and temporal resolution allow for the monitoring of leaf development
    and inter-row management with satisfactory results. A simple thresholding applied
    on the NDVI temporal profiles computed for each orchard allowed for the classification
    of young from old plantations, which require different irrigation strategies,
    reasonably well. The use of images with finer spatial resolutions such as Pleaides
    data or GSH improved the assessment of grassed from non-grassed orchards and allowed
    the quantification of the number of trees per field using a pattern detection
    approach. The performances of the resulting maps of inter-row cover depends on
    the date of acquisition images. One way of improving this point may be to use
    a combination of different sensors to maximise the image number acquired in the
    optimal period at the end of winter or at the beginning of spring. The number
    of trees can be quantified using a simple algorithm based on circle detection.
    Recent advances in Lidar technology will certainly provide new insights to improve
    the performances on this point. All of these remote sensing derived variables
    are useful to consider the spatial variability encountered at the watershed scale
    and can be integrate to better model the functioning of orchards and their management
    in future investigations. Despite this, ground observations will still be needed
    to validate the estimations and to obtain information on irrigation techniques
    at large scales. CRediT authorship contribution statement Guillaume Pouget: Software,

  description: Soil moisture is a significant variable in agricultural study and precision
    irrigation decision-making. It determines the soil water availability for plants,
    directly influencing plant growth, yield and quality. Owing to the variations
    in regional microclimate, landform difference, soil type and vegetation coverage,
    the soil moisture has strong spatial-temporal heterogeneity on a large regional
    scale. Micro-wave remote sensing can be used to invert soil moisture based on
    the dielectric constant under different weather conditions, while optical remote
    sensing utilizes spectral characteristics to estimate the physiological and ecological
    information of vegetation. In this study, two new hybrid models (ACO-RF and SSA-RF)
    were structured by optimizing the standalone random forest (RF) based on the ant
    colony optimization algorithm (ACO) and sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and six
    input combinations based on the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 remote
    sensing data from different sensors (optical, thermal and radar sensors) were
    used. The standalone RF, ACO-RF, and SSA-RF models with different combinations
    of inputs were employed to predict the soil moisture at different depths (5 cm,
    10 cm, 20 cm, 40 cm) in a large-scale drip-irrigated citrus orchard. The results
    showed that the ACO-RF and SSA-RF outperformed the standalone RF model in terms
    of prediction accuracy at a depth of 0–40 cm, with R2 of 0.800–0.921 and 0.504–0.798,
    RRMSE of 7.214–16.284% and 11.124–22.214%, respectively. In the hybrid model,
    the ACO-RF model had better prediction accuracy than the SSA-RF model, with R2
    of 0.805–0.921 and 0.800–0.911, RRMSE of 7.214–13.244% and 8.274–16.284%, respectively.
    At depths of 5 cm, 10 cm and 20 cm, the inversion accuracy of the model with microwave
    inputs was higher than that with multispectral inputs, with R2 of 0.556–0.888
    and 0.541–0.886, RRMSE of 9.015–19.544% and 9.124–22.214%, respectively. However,
    at a depth of 40 cm, the inversion accuracy of the model with multispectral inputs
    was higher than that with microwave inputs, with R2 of 0.532–0.841 and 0.508–0.831,
    RRMSE of 9.124–21.021% and 9.142–21.214%, respectively. The model with multispectral,
    thermal, and microwave inputs exhibited the highest accuracy in predicting soil
    moisture, with R2 of 0.635–0.921, RRMSE of 7.214−18.564%, respectively. Therefore,
    the ACO-RF with multisource remote sensing data is recommended to predict the
    soil moisture in the drip-irrigated citrus orchard. This approach can provide
    data support for making intelligent irrigation decisions on a large-scale grid
    land lots.

    Search Algorithm (SSA)Random Forest (RF) 1. Introduction Soil moisture is a crucial
    parameter in the study of agriculture, hydrology, soil science and climate, which
    is recognized by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as a fundamental climate
    variable because it directly influences the latent and sensible heat of the land
    surface, separates runoff and infiltration, determines vegetation transpiration
    and soil evaporation (Hollmann et al., 2013, Bojinski et al., 2014, Seneviratne
    et al., 2010, Dorigo et al., 2017). In the agricultural system, soil moisture
    directly determines the soil water availability for plants (María et al., 2023,
    Raphael et al., 2023). Therefore, accurate prediction of soil moisture is significant
    for optimal irrigation decisions, monitoring droughts, and predicting crop yields.
    There are three methods for monitoring soil moisture: fixed-point observation
    on the ground, model simulation, and remote sensing technology. The first method
    offers an insight into the temporal dynamics of soil moisture, but it is difficult
    to depict spatial-scale soil moisture and may disrupt the soil structure, accompanied
    by high cost. The second method requires numerous parameters difficult to acquire
    and fraught with uncertainties. In contrast, remote sensing technology provides
    a means to swiftly and efficiently capture spatiotemporal soil moisture on a large
    regional scale (Brocca et al., 2017, Katuwal et al., 2018). Leveraging remote
    sensing technology allows for a precise understanding of the major factors driving
    large-scale soil moisture, determining the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture
    (Khellouk et al., 2020, Jiang et al., 2020, Azadeh et al., 2022). Among remote
    sensing data, satellites with high temporal frequency provide only coarse-resolution
    data (10–50 km) that can not show the change in local soil moisture (Kerr et al.,
    2001, Entekhabi et al., 2010, Wagner et al., 2013). Nevertheless, high-spatiotemporal-resolution
    remote sensing data, unaffected by atmospheric interference, is essential for
    soil moisture monitoring (Peng et al., 2021, Balenzano et al., 2021). This high-spatiotemporal-resolution
    remote sensing data is attainable from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), such as
    the C-band SAR onboard the European Space Agency''s Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites
    (S1A and S1B, as well as S1C and S1D). Among the SAR data, Sentinel-1 has extensive
    spatiotemporal coverage, certain penetration capabilities through cloud layers,
    and is resilient against adverse weather conditions (Foucras et al., 2020, Nguyen
    et al., 2021, Benninga et al., 2019, Zhu et al., 2022, Mengen et al., 2023, Kim
    et al., 2013). Medium-resolution satellites like the Landsat-8 land satellite
    offer observational data with a spatial resolution of 30 m, enabling the direct
    inversion of vegetation physiological and ecological parameters (Xin et al., 2013,
    Zhu et al., 2019). Therefore, both optical (Landsat-8) and radar (Sentinel-1)
    data were used for the collaborative inversion of soil moisture in a large-scale
    drip-irrigated citrus orchard. Optical remote sensing technology mainly uses spectral
    differences in the visible light (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared
    (SWIR) bands, while thermal infrared remote sensing mainly uses the near infrared
    (NIR) band to obtain surface and canopy surface temperatures, monitor vegetation
    physiological and ecological parameters, and soil moisture (Carrerahernandez,
    2014, Cunha et al., 2015). There are mainly two types of methods: exponential
    method and thermal inertia method (Amani et al., 2016, Yu et al., 2013). The index
    method uses various bands to establish indices and soil moisture models that can
    reflect vegetation growth information or surface temperature. The thermal inertia
    method detects soil moisture by describing changes in surface temperature. The
    calculation process requires a large amount of statistical data and cannot invert
    soil moisture information in densely vegetated areas. Scholars at home and abroad
    have successively proposed crop water stress index, vegetation water supply index,
    and indicator condition index (Moran et al., 1994, Kogan, 1990, Caparrini et al.,
    2003, Sandholt et al., 2002). The Notable indices like the Normalized Differential
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Ratio Vegetation
    Index (RVI) accurately distinguished vegetation and water bodies. Plant leaves
    exhibit strong absorption characteristics in visible and red light bands and strong
    reflection characteristics in the near-infrared band (Ghulam et al., 2008, Zhang
    et al., 2015, Schnur et al., 2010). Wang et al., 2023a, Wang et al., 2023b integrated
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Infrared Position Vegetation Index
    (IPVI), Visible and Shortwave Infrared Drought Index (VSDI), and Vegetation Water
    Supply Index (VSWI) to construct a novel artificial neural model for predicting
    surface soil moisture. Gao et al. (2013) used Normalized Difference Spectral Index
    (ND) and Ratio Index (SR) to estimate soil moisture, demonstrating the reasonability
    and applicability across different spatiotemporal scales of this estimation method.
    Khaled and Khaled. (2023) conducted a regional analysis of the spatiotemporal
    variability of soil moisture using Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Vegetation
    Temperature Drought Index (VTDI), offering another perspective for soil moisture
    monitoring. However, due to the limitation of satellite orbit, observation mode
    and sensor performance, spatial, temporal and spectral resolution, it is difficult
    to describe the spatial pattern and evolution process of complex geological phenomena.
    Optical remote sensing mainly relies on optical to complete image acquisition.
    Radar data has a certain penetration, can break through clouds and fog, overcome
    the influence of the canopy, and directly reach the ground, but the spatial resolution
    is large (Zhan et al., 2006, Finn et al., 2011, Raphael et al., 2023, María et
    al., 2023). The fusion of optical and radar data will break through the limitation
    of single sensor observation, realize the comprehensive processing and application
    of complementary information of multi-platform and multi-mode observation data,
    and generate large regional-scale \"time-space-spectrum\" observation data. In
    improving data amplitude, space, spectrum and time dimension observation ability,
    in view of the type of remote sensing image diversity and imaging complexity,
    model driven method has strong inclusive, can depict the time, space and spectral
    degradation between multiple data, but the model driven method mostly assume multisource
    observation data only linear degradation, it is difficult to accurately handle
    amplitude, empty spectrum, space-time and heterogeneous relationship of nonlinear
    characteristics (Huang and Zhao., 2017). The machine learning method has robust
    learning efficiency, offering effective solutions for addressing nonlinear problems.
    This model has become an alternative to traditional and physical models, overcoming
    many limitations in other models, such as numerous parameters, complex model structures,
    and instability (Ali et al., 2015). Among machine learning models, Random Forest
    (RF) can predict soil moisture with limited samples, showcasing notable computational
    speed and strong generalization performance (Shiri et al., 2017, Prasad et al.,
    2018, Matei et al., 2017, Boudibi et al., 2021). Shiri et al. (2020) highlighted
    that machine learning models had been used in predicting soil hydraulic parameters,
    such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture, and soil texture. The
    outcomes underscore Random Forest (RF) within machine learning models as a precise
    simulator of soil moisture in agricultural regions. Coleen et al. (2021) verified
    the ability and advantages of Random Forest in predicting the soil moisture in
    plant root zones and used the Random Forest to predict root-zone soil moisture
    in small agricultural watersheds. Although the Random Forest (RF) can simulate
    complex nonlinear relationships between multiple feature variables and soil moisture
    and performs well in terms of inversion accuracy, computational efficiency, and
    stability, the parameters of nodes in the model are empirically obtained and cannot
    explain the connections between input/output variables and individual neurons.
    The intelligence algorithms can quantitatively analyze the interaction between
    multiple factors and simultaneously analyze the impact of different parameters
    of intermediate variables on soil moisture (Wang et al., 2019, Zheng et al., 2021a,
    Zheng et al., 2021b). The combination of intelligent optimization algorithms with
    Random Forest (RF) models can improve the performance of the model because it
    can subtract the optimal solution of the optimization problem and improve the
    computational speed. In the intelligent algorithm, ant colony optimization (ACO)
    and sparrow search algorithm (SSA) has high computational efficiency and convergence
    speed. Saeid et al. (2020) used ant colony algorithm (ACO) optimized elman neural
    network (ENN) model to predict soil temperature at different depths, and found
    that the accuracy of ACO-ENN model in predicting daily soil temperature was higher
    than that of the original ENN model. Zhao et al., (2023) used the sparrow algorithm
    to optimize the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) to predict the daily
    evapotranspiration of rice, and the results show that the SSA-LSSVM model has
    a high prediction accuracy, which provides a reference for the prediction of evapotranspiration
    in the early agricultural hydrological environment of late rice. Xu et al., (2022)
    based on genetic, particle swarm and sparrow search algorithm optimization projection
    tracking (PP) model measure elasticity key drivers, and combined with the log
    average partition index (LMDI) analyzed the drive mechanism of elasticity, the
    results show that the SSA-PP model in terms of solving speed and optimization
    ability based on genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization algorithm
    (PSO). Soil moisture is influenced by many factors, such as soil characteristics,
    vegetation coverage, climatic conditions, human activities, and terrain relief
    that it is hard to acquire precise spatial distribution of soil moisture across
    a large region (Nawar et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2023a, Wang et al., 2023b). At
    present, accurate inversion of soil moisture content in large-scale drip irrigated
    citrus orchards has not been reported based on ant colony optimization (ACO),
    sparrow search algorithm (SSA), random forest (RF) model and multi-source remote
    sensing data. The primary focuses of this study were to: (1) Computing the indices
    that can quantitatively characterize the physiological and ecological information
    of vegetation based on multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 remote sensing

    Citrus Orchard. 2.2. Data source 2.2.1. Multi-temporal landsat-8 and sentinel-1
    data In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 remote sensors were
    employed to capture the physiological and ecological parameters in along with
    soil moisture data, of the large-scale drip-irrigated late-maturing citrus orchard
    in multiple periods along wirh soil moisture data. The Landsat-8 data encompasses
    11 bands, while the Sentinel-1 data includes both vertically polarized (VV) data
    and horizontally polarized (VH) data. The obtained multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and
    Landsat-8 data were preprocessed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Landsat-8
    data preprocessing involved radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and
    image cropping. The Sentinel-1 data preprocessing included data reading, multi-looking,
    filtering, radiometric calibration, geocoding, normalization, and image cropping.
    The final outputs contained the atmospherically calibrated spectral data as well
    as the VV and VH backscattering coefficients. The remote sensing data were acquired
    on April 18th, May 17th, June 29th, August 9th, October 20th, and November 13th.
    Detailed band information of the Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 remote sensing is provided

    moisture When satellites passed the study region, the soil moisture data at 155
    sampling points were collected. During the sampling, the geographical coordinates
    of each sampling point were recorded. Soil moisture data at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm,
    20 cm, and 40 cm were acquired using soil auger and PR2 soil profile moisture
    meter. Provide data support for large-scale distributed precision irrigation decision-making.
    The soil moisture was calculated as per the following formula: (1) where θ represents
    soil moisture (%), w₁ is the mass of the empty aluminum box (g), w₂ is the mass
    of the empty aluminum box and wet soil (g), and w₃ is the mass of the empty aluminum
    box and dry soil (g). 2.2.3. Vegetation indices Owing to the complex surface structure
    in the drip-irrigated citrus orchard, relying solely on a single sensor for soil
    moisture inversion has certain limitations in terms of the spatiotemporal characteristics.
    In this study, the physiological and ecological parameters and canopy temperatures
    of late-maturing citrus trees were monitored in different growth periods based
    on the optical, temperature, and microwave-polarized indices. The indices created
    based on optical sensors included Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI),
    Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation
    Index (SAVI), Infrared Position Vegetation Index (IPVI), Visible and Shortwave
    Infrared Drought Index (VSDI), and Vegetation Water Supply Index (VSWI), while
    the indices created based on temperature sensors involved Land Surface Temperature
    (LST) and Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI), that based on radar sensors
    contained Vertical Transmit and Vertical Receive (VV) and Vertical Transmit and
    Horizontal Receive (VH). Detailed vegetation indices are listed in Table 2. Additionally,
    all vegetation index variables were resampled to 30.0 m. Based on the differences
    in optical, temperature, and radar sensors, six combinations of inputs were created.
    The elements in the combination are detailed in Table 3. Table 2. Vegetation Indicators

    RF, ACO-RF, SSA-RF Note: ACO-RF, SSA-RF respectively the two novel hybrid model
    proposed based on ant colony and sparrow search algorithm optimization of random
    forest model. 2.3. Random forest model Random Forest is a classical machine learning
    model that outperforms other algorithms in prediction (Nayak et al., 2022, Breiman,
    2001). The model consists of a large number of individual decision trees, integrating
    multiple weak decision tree classifiers to arrive at the final decision through
    majority voting. In this study, the Random Forest model was constructed using
    both classification and regression methods and considering decision coefficients
    to evaluate the segmentation results of the nodes (Breiman et al., 1984, Khaidem
    et al., 2016). The decision coefficient of each node is as follows: (2) In the
    formula, represents the coefficient at node N, P(ω) is the proportion of all data,
    and i and j are class labels. 2.4. Intelligent algorithm The Random Forest (RF)
    model exhibits strong robustness against noise and outliers (Khaidem et al., 2016).
    However, it''s worth noting that the coefficients of the model''s nodes are obtained
    empirically, posing certain limitations. In this study, bio-inspired optimization
    algorithms, specifically ACO and SSA, were employed to iteratively determine the
    optimal parameters. Compared to other regression algorithms, such algorithms eliminate
    the need to check the normality and independence of the variables. In the training
    process of each decision tree, random subsets of input data are utilized, allowing
    each tree to learn from different data partitions. This method not only reduces
    computational cost but also enhances the overall efficiency (Marins et al., 2021,
    Li et al., 2022, Song et al., 2023, Yang and Shami, 2020, Sun et al., 2023a, Sun
    et al., 2023b). The workflow of optimizing the Random Forest model based on ACO
    and SSA is displayed in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (930KB) Download

    Model Based on Ant Colony Optimization and Sparrow Search Algorithm to Predict
    Soil Moisture in the Drip-Irrigated Citrus Orchard. 2.4.1. Ant colony optimization
    algorithm (ACO) In nature, ant colonies employ pheromones to facilitate indirect
    communication among individuals while searching for food. This communication mechanism
    allows them to identify the shortest path from the anthill to a food source. Through
    abstract modeling of the collective intelligent behavior, the Ant Colony Optimization
    algorithm (ACO) was introduced, offering a robust approach to optimization and
    optimizing combined parameters (Yang et al., 2021a, Yang et al., 2021b, Hou et
    al., 2023). This positive feedback mechanism leads to an increasing number of
    ants choosing the shortest path between the anthill and the food source, eventually
    uncovering the optimal path (Dorigoa and Blumb, 2005, Otman and Alper, 2023).
    The construction of paths and the updating of pheromones adhere to the following
    formulas: (3) (4) (5) where is the visit probability of the position where ant
    k is at, is denotes a set of paths that ants visit from position i to the destination
    directly, is signifies a heuristic information, is the number of pheromones at
    position (i, j), m is the number of ants, r is the evaporation rate of pheromones,
    where 0<r≤1, is the number of pheromones released by ant k on the path, is the
    path length, is all paths taken by the ant. 2.4.2. Sparrow search algorithm (SSA)
    The SSA is an optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging and anti-predation
    behaviors of sparrows. Renowned for its high robustness and global search capabilities,
    this algorithm finds widespread application in optimization across diverse fields.
    In this algorithm, sparrows are classified into producers, seekers, and scouts
    (Xue and Shen, 2020, Li et al., 2023, Shao et al., 2023). The optimization of
    producers, seekers, and scouts in the sparrow flock follows the following formulas:
    (6) (7) (8) where is the position information of a sparrow. when R<ST, it indicates
    that the position is safe, making this sparrow’s search range large. when R>ST,
    it implies that there are a certain number of predators and sparrows need to move
    to safe areas 2.5 evaluation indices. In this study, the accuracies of the standalone
    RF, ACO-RF and SSA-RF models with different input combinations in predicting soil
    moisture at different depths in the drip-irrigated citrus orchard were evaluated
    using the coefficient of determination (R²), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
    square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and global performance
    indicator (GPI). (9) ̅ ̅ ̅ ̅ (10) ̅ (11) (12) ̅ (13) ̅ where , , ̅ and n are the
    measured soil moisture content values, the models predicted values, and the number
    of observation data, respectively. The GPI is global performance indicator, equals
    to −1 for R2, and equals to 1 for all other indicators. The ̅ is the median of
    scaled values of indicator j and ykj is the scaled value of indicator j for model
    k. 3. Results 3.1. Inversion of the vegetation indices based on landsat-8 and
    sentinel-1 data Fig. 3 illustrates the surface vegetation indices and surface
    temperatures (on April 18th for example) inverted based on multi-temporal Landsat-8
    data. Figures a-g depict the vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SAVI, RVI, IPVI, VSDI,
    and VSWI) inverted using multispectral sensors based on Landsat-8 data, while
    figures h-i represent the land surface temperature and drought stress index (LST
    and TVDI) inverted using thermal infrared sensors. Distinctive spatial differences
    were observed in the vegetation indices inverted using multispectral sensors.
    The NDVI, EVI, SAVI, RVI, and IPVI calculated using the red, near-infrared, and
    blue bands enhanced the ability to detect sparse vegetation. The correction in
    the blue band considered the scattering of airborne particle and soil background,
    reducing the influence of atmospheric and soil noise so that the indices can be
    used to precisely invert the vegetation density (Zhou et al., 2023, Sun et al.,
    2023a, Sun et al., 2023b, Aboelghar et al., 2014). Regarding VSDI and VSWI, visible
    and shortwave infrared sensors were used to detect the drought degree of vegetation
    and soil moisture in the orchard. The LST and TVDI were inverted based on infrared
    sensing data, where LST was used to precisely invert the temperatures of soil
    and citrus tree canopy in the orchard and TVDI was used to invert the soil moisture
    stress in vegetated areas based on optical and thermal infrared sensing data.
    Above all, the vegetation growth and soil moisture in the orchard were inverted
    precisely based on the data feedback from multi-source sensors. Download : Download

    spatial distribution of VV and VH backscattering coefficients obtained using multi-temporal
    Sentinel-1 data is illustrated in Fig. 4. Figures (a)-(f) and (g)-(l) depict the
    VV and VH backscattering coefficients, respectively. There were spatial variations
    in the VV and VH backscattering coefficients obtained in different periods. On
    April 18th, May 7th, June 29th, and August 7th, the VV and VH backscattering coefficients
    were small, ranging from 0.0005 to 0.654 dB and from 0.002 to 0.672 Db, respectively.
    On October 20th and November 13th, the VV and VH backscattering coefficients were
    large, ranging from 0.0049 to 0.875 dB and from 0.0005 to 0.844 dB respectively.
    By analysis, it is revealed that the heavy rainfall in October and November resulted
    in high aerosol concentrations and more suspended particles in the air, leading
    to increased moisture in the soil and citrus tree canopy and lush weeds in the
    inter-row spaces of citrus trees and thus the change in the backscattering coefficients.

    Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 data extracted from ground measurement stations. The
    NDVI, EVI, SAVI, RVI, and IPVI were mainly used to invert the information about
    vegetation growth, while VSDI, VSWI, TVDI, VV, and VH indices were used for monitoring
    the soil moisture stress, and LST was used for monitoring the land surface and
    canopy temperatures. NDVI, EVI, SAVI, RVI, IPVI, VSDI, VSWI, LST, TVDI, VV, and
    VH indices varied in different periods, with median ranges of 0.555–0.793, 1.395–2.457,
    0.832–1.189, 3.498–8.681, 0.777–0.897, −60.00-40.604, 0.013–0.0678, 11.624–44.735,
    0.794–0.879, 0.097–0.151 dB, and 0.024–0.0319 dB, respectively. In August, the
    said indices varied significantly, with median values of 0.793, 2.090, 1.189,
    8.681, 0.896, −10.639, 0.068, 11.624, 0.879, 0.109 dB, and 0.027 dB, respectively.
    Among them, the BDVI, EVI, RVI, VSDI and VSWI indices show significant changes,
    which are mainly calculated using the red edge and near-infrared bands. Due to
    changes in the physiological and ecological parameters of citrus canopy (chlorophyll
    a/b, carotenoids, leaf moisture content, canopy porosity, etc.), there are significant
    differences in the reflectance spectra of the red edge and near-infrared compared
    to other time periods, resulting in higher and lower indices. Therefore, the use
    of spectral reflectance can accurately monitor citrus growth information. Download

    moisture at different depths based on standalone RF, ACO-RF and SSA-RF models
    Table 4, Table 5, Table 6 shows the accuracies of the standalone RF and the hybrid
    models (i.e., ACO-RF and SSA-RF) with six input combinations in predicting soil
    moisture at depth of 5 cm, 10 cm and 20 cm in both training and testing stages.
    All the models effectively captured the soil moisture at a depth of 5 cm, 10 cm
    and 20 cm in both training and testing stages, with R2 of 0.586–0.921, 0.521–0.895,
    0.522–0.895, NRMSE of 8.211–20.211%, 7.214–22.214%, 7.547–21.124%, and MAE of
    0.011–0.111 m3·m−3, 0.010–0.101 m3·m−3, 0.025–0.115 m3·m−3, respectively. Among
    the models, the proposed hybrid models outperformed the standalone RF in terms
    of prediction accuracy, with R2 of 0.812–0.921 and 0.521–0.798, NRMSE of 7.214–16.284%
    and 11.124–22.214%, and MAE of 0.010–0.074 m3·m−3 and 0.022–0.115 m3·m−3, respectively.
    In hybrid model, the ACO-RF showed higher prediction accuracy than SSA-RF, with
    R2 of 0.821–0.911 and 0.825–0.921, NRMSE of 8.274–16.284% and 7.214–13.244%, and
    MAE of 0.012–0.074 m3·m−3 and 0.010–0.065 m3·m−3, respectively. These data demonstrate
    that the results predicted by ACO-RF were closer to the measured values. Table

    0.016–0.091 m3·m−3, 0.012–0.095 m3·m−3, respectively. These data indicate that
    radar sensors had higher prediction accuracy than multispectral sensors. Among
    the single-sensor input combinations, the model with SC3 (microwave) exhibited
    the highest prediction accuracy, followed by SC2 (multispectral) and SC1 (thermal),
    with R2 of 0.556–0.865, 0.543–0.864, 0.521–0.864, NRMSE of 9.124–19.214%, 11.245–22.214%,

    respectively. These data also denote that radar sensors had the highest prediction
    accuracy, followed by multispectral and thermal infrared sensors. Therefore, it
    is recommended to use the ACO-RF model with multi-source data (multispectral+thermal+microwave)
    input to predict soil moisture at a depth of 5 cm, 10 cm and 20 cm. In areas difficult

    at a depth of 40 cm in both training and testing stages. All the models effectively
    reflected the soil moisture at a depth of 40 cm in both training and testing stages,
    with R2, NRMSE, MAE, and GPI of 0.504–0.852, 8.542–22.114%, 0.011–0.042 m3·m−3,

    at a depth of 40 cm. In areas difficult to acquire data, multispectral sensors
    can be utilized to invert the soil moisture at a depth of 40 cm. Fig. 6 displays
    the accuracies of the standalone RF and the hybrid models with six input combinations
    in predicting soil moisture at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm. As illustrated,
    all the models had the highest prediction accuracies at the depth of 5 cm, followed
    by the 10 cm and 20 cm, and had poor prediction accuracies at the depth of 40 cm,
    with R2 of 0.586–0.892, 0.521–0.878, 0.522–0.875, and 0.504–0.841, respectively.
    Among the input combinations, the ACO-RF model had the highest prediction accuracy,
    followed by SSA-RF and the standalone RF model, with R2 of 0.805–0.892, 0.800–0.889,
    and 0.504–0.785, respectively. At the soil depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm,
    the three models with the input combination of SC6 obtained the highest prediction
    accuracies, with R2 of 0.762–0.892, 0.785–0.878, 0.647–0.875, and 0.635–0.841,
    respectively. Among single-sensor inputs, the models with the input combination
    of SC3 exhibited the highest prediction accuracies at soil depths of 5 cm, 10 cm,
    and 20 cm, with R2 of 0.621–0.855, 0.561–0.875, and 0.556–0.865, respectively.
    At the soil depth of 40 cm, the model with the input combination of SC2 achieved
    the highest accuracy, with R2 of 0.532–0.810, respectively. It is recommended
    to use the ACO-RF model with the input combination of SC3 for predicting soil
    moisture at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm, and use that with the input combination
    of SC2 for predicting soil moisture at a depth of 40 cm. Download : Download high-res

    the red dots represented actual values, and the proximity to the dots was directly
    proportional to the prediction accuracy. The three models with different input
    combinations had different accuracies in predicting the soil moisture at depths

    models at different soil depths outperformed the standalone RF model in prediction
    accuracy, and the models with multi-sensor input (SC4- SC6) had higher prediction
    accuracy than those with single-sensor input (SC1- SC3). Among them, the three
    models with the input of SC6 achieved the highest prediction accuracy. Download

    of the Multispectral, Thermal and Microwave sensors data The study found that
    at 5 cm, 10 cm and 20 cm depths, with microwave surpassed that with multispectral
    in terms of inversion accuracy, while at 40 cm depth, the inversion accuracy with
    multispectral exceeded that with microwave. These data indicate that a radar sensor
    can penetrate to a soil depth of 20 cm and cannot perceive the soil moisture at
    the depth of 40 cm. In contrast, an optical remote sensor can use the phenotypic
    information of crops to establish an intrinsic connection with soil moisture indirectly
    so that its prediction accuracy is higher than a radar sensor. This conclusion
    was also proved by the models with single-sensor inputs. María et al. (2023) adopted
    Short Term Change Detection (STCD), TU Wien Change Detection (TUWCD) and Multitemporal
    Bayesian Change Detection (MTBCD) methods to assess the accuracy in estimating
    the soil moisture of wheat fields based on Sentinel-1 data and verified the result
    on eight trial wheat fields. Finally, they found that Sentinel-1 could be used
    to estimate the soil moisture of wheat fields accurately. The findings of this
    study consist with the conclusion reported by Wang et al., 2023a, Wang et al.,
    2023b and Zheng et al., 2021a, Zheng et al., 2021b. The application of optical
    remote sensing has limitations, limited by weather conditions and cloud cover.
    It mainly utilizes the spectral reflectance, band index, citrus physiological
    parameters, and image transformation to obtain high spatial resolution texture
    feature images. However, radar remote sensing of clouds and cloud shadow interference
    does not have the problem of pixel saturation, and can penetrate the canopy directly
    to the ground to reflect the surface soil moisture status, with the characteristic
    of all-weather operation (Zhang et al., 2013, Xin et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2019,
    Wang et al., 2023a, Wang et al., 2023b). 4.2. Ant colony optimization (ACO) and
    sparrow search algorithms (SSA) significantly improve the prediction accuracy
    of standalone RF model The study revealed that the hybrid models (ACO-RF and SSA-RF)
    exhibited higher predictive accuracies than the standalone RF model at different
    depths, and the ACO-RF model demonstrated a prediction accuracy superior to the
    SSA-RF model. The standalone RF is an ensemble learning algorithm, primarily utilizing
    decision trees as basic units. In the construction process, weights are assigned
    between the decision trees, but the parameters are obtained empirically. In contrast,
    the proposed hybrid models employ sparrow search algorithms (SSA) and ant colony
    optimization (ACO) to optimize parameters in the training process based on sample
    data and ultimately converge to obtain the optimal values. The ACO algorithm defines
    optimized paths through a mechanism of positive and negative feedback based on
    the pheromones released by ants so that the search converges continually till
    approaching the optimal solution. This algorithm has strong computational capabilities
    and operational efficiency, making it resistant to getting trapped in local optima
    and facilitating the discovery of global optimal solutions (Duc et al., 2017,
    Zhang et al., 2019, Saeid et al., 2020, Pan et al., 2023). Meanwhile, such algorithms
    demonstrate distributed computing capabilities and strong adaptability, performing
    exceptionally well in global searches and handling discrete problems (Wu et al.,
    2021, Neda et al., 2022, He et al., 2022, Zhao et al., 2023). The SSA, inspired
    by the foraging and anti-predation behaviors of sparrows, involves the division
    of roles within the sparrow flock during foraging: some sparrows search for food
    sources, while others scout for potential predators around the food source. When
    they perceive danger, sparrows at the edges of the flock quickly move to a safe
    location to secure better positions, while sparrows in the middle of the flock
    move randomly to get closer to other sparrows. Through this iterative process,
    parameters are optimized, reaching the optimal values. However, this algorithm
    tends to hover between the origin and the optimal solution, eventually converging
    near the optimal solution (Jia et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2022). For this reason,
    the SSA algorithm shows instability, longer computation time, and slightly lower
    robustness compared to the ACO algorithm. 4.3. Suggestions and outlook for future
    research on prediction of soil moisture in large-scale orchards This method not
    only enhanced the computational accuracy and efficiency of the model but also
    accurately identified the response relationships between different variables and
    soil moisture. It effectively integrated optical and radar data, leveraging the
    advantages of both types of remote sensing data, thereby improving the inversion
    accuracy of soil moisture. Because soil moisture is subjected to many factors
    such as vegetation coverage, water infiltration, runoff, evaporation, and soil
    surface characteristics, it is significant to precisely simulate the spatial variability
    of soil moisture. In specific regions, the impact of topographical and physical
    parameters on soil moisture can be mitigated as per the land use rate. In the
    southwest of China, soil evaporation is low, rainfall is abundant, and vegetation
    is lush, leading to high canopy interception. On the contrary, in the northwest
    of China, most soil is sand, allowing for rapid water filtration and low soil
    moisture (Fan et al., 2016, Fu et al., 2018). The hybrid models proposed in this
    study considered the advantages of different sensors and reflected the physiological
    information of surface vegetation but failed to consider the physical properties
    of soil such as soil porosity, bulk density, and soil organic matter. In subsequent
    studies, soil physical parameters will be incorporated. Furthermore, due to the
    differences in the characteristics of satellite-borne sensors and the unicity
    of inverting parameters based on a specific sensor (e.g., inverting the ground
    temperature based on infrared remote sensor is applicable only under clear-sky
    conditions), inverting large-scale soil moisture relying solely on a single satellite
    platform proves challenging to meet the high spatiotemporal resolution and continuity
    data requirements for agricultural and water resources management (Luo et al.,
    2023, Bappa et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2021a, Yang et al., 2021b). In future studies,
    we will couple the proposed models with crop models, improving the spatiotemporal
    resolution and continuity of satellite remote sensing data and incorporate assimilation
    algorithms to achieve temporal continuity of soil moisture in large-scale grid
    land lots, and making full use of the potential value of satellite remote sensing
    data, finally providing effective data support for (agricultural) intelligent
    irrigation in orchards in the southwestern region. 5. Conclusions In this study,
    the random forest model (RF) was optimized using the ant colony optimization algorithm
    (ACO) and sparrow search algorithm (SSA), forming two new hybrid models (i.e.,
    ACO-RF and SSA-RF). Then, the hybrid models were used to predict the soil moisture
    at different depths of the drip-irrigated citrus orchard based on multi-temporal
    Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 data, providing data support for making intelligent irrigation
    decisions on large-scale land lots. (1) At depths of 0–40 cm, the soil moisture
    prediction accuracy of hybrid models (ACO-RF, SSA-RF) outperformed standalone
    RF, with R2 of 0.800–0.921 and 0.504–0.798, GPI of −0.746-1.214 and −3.258-0.131,
    respectively. In the hybrid model, the ACO-RF achieved higher prediction accuracy
    than SSA-RF, with R2 of 0.805–0.921 and 0.800–0.911, GPI of −0.171-1.214 and −0.746-0.803,
    respectively. (2) When combined with Multispectral, Thermal, and Microwave inputs,
    the models exhibited the highest accuracy in predicting soil moisture, with R2
    of 0.635–0.921, GPI of −1.646-1.24, respectively. (3) At depths of 5 cm, 10 cm,
    and 20 cm, the model with Microwave input surpassed that with Multispectral input
    in terms of the inversion accuracy. Howere, at a depth of 40 cm, the model with
    Multispectral input achieved higher inversion accuracy than that with Microwave
    input. (4) In future studies, the physical properties, assimilation algorithms
    and crop models of the soil will be incorporated in the hybrid models (ACO-RF
    and SSA-RF) generate soil moisture data products at different spatiotemporal scales.

    Introduction Soil moisture content (SMC) serves as a critical metric for evaluating
    kiwifruit growth status, with respect to root development, nutrient and water
    uptake, particularly for managing field irrigation and forecasting fruit yield
    (Chen et al., 2022, Cheng et al., 2023). Given that approximately 90% of kiwifruit
    root systems are concentrated within the 0–60 cm soil layer (Zhu et al., 2023),
    accurate mapping of root zone SMC is essential for efficient irrigation water
    resource management and optimizing crop water productivity within a kiwifruit
    orchard (Cheng et al., 2023, Deng et al., 2023). The utilization of remote sensing
    (RS) technology has gained widespread acceptance for both qualitative and quantitative
    analysis of large-scale plant water and nutrient status in a non-destructive manner
    (Cheng et al., 2022, Jin et al., 2020, Muro et al., 2022). However, the current
    availability of free RS data, including MODIS series (Zhang et al., 2017), Landsat
    series, Sentinel-2 (Wang et al., 2020), etc., is limited by their coarse spatial
    resolution, which poses challenges for conducting precise field-scale research
    in agriculture. In response to these limitations, the use of unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) platform, equipped with multiple sensors, including RGB, thermal infared
    (TIR), and multispectral (MS), has attracted significant attention from agronomists
    due to their high temporal and spatial resolution, as well as their ability to
    capture multi-source images (Lu et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2023).
    Several research have successfully utilized UAV multi-sensor platforms for tasks
    such as crop leaf area index (LAI) (Zhang et al., 2022), biomass (Li et al., 2022),
    and chlorophyll content inversion (Wang et al., 2021),to nitrogen status (Fan
    et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2021), water status (Cheng et al., 2023), and yield
    estimation (Peng et al., 2019) under different field conditions (Maes and Steppe,
    2019). A variety of RS-based indices are calculated using data collected from
    satellites, UAVs, and in-site platforms equipped with multi-sensors, encompassing
    Vegetation Index (VI), Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) (Gerhards et al., 2019),
    Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) (Bian et al., 2023, Nie et al., 2020,
    Xu et al., 2022), and Three-Dimensional Drought Index (TDDI) (Cheng et al., 2023).
    Several VIs, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the Enhance
    Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), for SMC
    estimation are the mathematical combination of the reflectance of visible and
    NIR (Babaeian et al., 2021, Knadel et al., 2022). Additionally, CWSI and TVDI,
    which are derived from temperature information obtained from TIR sensors and the
    simple temperature-vegetation index space constructed from TIR and MS sensors,
    respectively, have been extensively employed as classical drought indicators (DI)
    for characterizing plant water status (Bian et al., 2023, Nie et al., 2020, Tao
    et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2022). Another index, TDDI, is proposed based on MS and
    TIR sensors integrated into UAVs with in-situ temperature to assess the crop water
    conditions of maize, yielding a certain level of accuracy (Cheng et al., 2023).
    These indices, derived from various sensor data, offer valuable insights into
    plant water status and serve as classical drought indicators for characterizing
    plant water status (Jiao et al., 2021, Song et al., 2019). Despite the extensive
    of research in this domain, there has been a predominant focus on the application
    of specific band combinations and temperature data in conventional field crops,
    neglecting research on the unique band combination of kiwifruit SMC (Deng et al.,
    2023, Krishnan and Indu, 2023, Yu et al., 2022). Consequently, conventional VI
    band combinations may not be suitable for accurately estimating SMC under variable
    conditions, especially at high vegetation coverage orchard (Soltanikazemi et al.,
    2022). Therefore, a more nuanced approach that incorporates relevant features
    from UAV-Ground multi-sensor data is likely to yield more precise predictions,
    better reflecting changes in root zone SMC (Zhang et al., 2022). By leveraging
    the optimal band combination method, the accuracy of monitoring kiwifruit SMC
    estimation in dynamic field environments can be significantly improved, providing
    crucial data support for real-time irrigation treatments in orchard fields. Recently,
    RS image analysis has been integrated with machine learning (ML) models, such
    as partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine regression
    (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). These features include, but are not
    limited to, chlorophyll content (Wang et al., 2023), nitrogen content (Chlingaryan
    et al., 2018), and canopy water stress (Katimbo et al., 2023). Ensemble learning
    (EL) algorithms, as a subset of ML techniques, have garnered attention for their
    ability to amalgamate multiple individual models to achieve superior predictive
    performance (Bentéjac et al., 2021). Compared to single models, EL models are
    capable of mitigating over-fitting, enhancing prediction accuracy, and bolstering
    robustness. Bagging models, such as RFR (Breiman, 2001), have gained prominence
    in RS inversion owing to their capacity to handle high-dimensional data and nonlinear
    relationships. Another widely utilized EL model is Boosting, which aims to sequentially
    train individual models to rectify the errors made by preceding models (Pappalardo
    et al., 2023, Soltanikazemi et al., 2022). In boosting, each model concentrates
    on the instances that were misclassified by previous models, thereby ameliorating
    the overall predictive performance. Boosting models, including gradient boosting
    (GBDT) (Friedman, 2001), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) (Chen and Guestrin,
    2016), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) (Ke et al., 2017), and Categorical
    Boosting (Catboost) (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018), have exhibited considerable
    success in the inversion of crop growth parameters (Tao et al., 2023, Yu et al.,
    2022). These models possess the capability to handle small training sets and capture
    intricate nonlinear relationships between input variables and the target variable
    (Chlingaryan et al., 2018). In summary, RFR, XGBoost, GBDT, LGBM, and Catboost
    have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the accuracy and robustness
    of SMC prediction. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance
    of multi-dimensional (n-D) index set, which calculated by UAV-based TIR and MS
    information with six in-situ temperature data (kiwifruit canopy temperature [Tc],
    soil temperature [Ts], air temperature [Ta], Ta-Tc, Ta-Ts, Tc-Ts), used to simulate
    the kiwifruit SMC at six different soil depths (0–10 cm [SMC10], 0–20 cm [SMC20],
    0–30 cm [SMC30], 0–40 cm [SMC40], 0–50 cm [SMC50], 0–60 cm [SMC60]) during fruit
    growth periods (May to Sep, 2022). This research aims to achieve the following
    main objectives: (1) to conduct correlation analysis of the n-D indicators (NDVI,
    EVI, CWSI, TVDI and TDDI) and SMC under the multi-sensor feature combination;
    (2) to compare the performance of the EL models (RFR, GBDT, XGBoost, LGBM, and
    Catboost) in estimating root zones SMC based on the optimal n-D indices; (3) to
    explore the accuracy of the planted-by-planted-grid mapping approach for estimating
    root zone SMC under different growth periods and various irrigation treatments
    in a high vegetation coverage orchard. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study site
    and setup Field experiments were carried out in a 9-year-old ''Xuxiang'' kiwifruit
    orchard situated in Xianyang, Shaanxi, China (34.241°N 108.164°E, Fig. 1). The
    orchard is located at an average elevation of 400 m within a warm temperate zone
    featuring a sub-humid climate. Considering the growth characteristics of the kiwifruit
    canopy in the experimental orchard, the growth periods were categorized into five
    distinct phases: the budding and leaf-developing period (Period I, from 1st April
    to 2nd May, 2022), the flowering and fruit setting period (Period II, from 3rd
    May to 22nd May, 2022), the rapid expansion period of the fruit (Period III, from
    23rd May to 6th Jul, 2022), the slow expansive period of the fruit (Period IV,
    from 7th Jul to 21st Aug, 2022), and the fruit maturity period (Period V, from
    22nd Aug to 25th Sep, 2022). Fig. 2 depicts the meteorological data and sampling
    dates across the kiwifruit growth periods. The average temperature (T_ave) recorded
    during Period I-V in 2022 was 15.63 ± 3.11 °C, 18.01 ± 2.73 °C, 26.68 ± 3.12 °C,
    28.43 ± 2.98 °C, and 21.30 ± 3.21 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the precipitation

    the analysis of soil texture, it has been ascertained that the soil in the study
    area exhibits medium loam characteristics within the 0–40 cm depth, transitioning
    to heavy loam below 40 cm. This soil type is characterized by high water retention
    and limited permeability. Within the 0–60 cm soil layer, the kiwifruit trees exhibited
    a soil bulk density of 1.65 ± 0.05 g/cm3 and a field water capacity (θfc) of 34.70 ± 0.15%
    (Zhu et al., 2023). The copious irrigation (CK) treatment was defined with an
    upper limit of 90–95% × θfc and a lower limit of 72–75% × θfc across Period I
    to IV (refer to Table 1 for specific details). The experiment implemented four
    distinct gradient irrigation treatments, corresponding to the CK treatment: 100%
    (full irrigation [100 S]: T1, T6, and T11), 85% (mild deficit [85 S]: T4, T7,
    and T9), 70% (moderate deficit [70 S]: T2, T5, and T12) and 55% (severe deficit
    [55 S]: T3, T8, and T10) across Period II to IV. Each treatment consisted of 18
    kiwifruit trees, and there were three replicate treatment plots for each treatment,
    resulting in a total of 12 treatment plots. Overall,the experiment involved a
    total of 234 trees with the same planting unit (2.0 ×4.0 m2), but with varying
    treatment plots (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, the CK irrigation amount applied during
    Period I-IV was 26.72 mm/hm2 (1 time), 32.61 mm/hm2 (1 time), 125.96 mm/hm2 (4
    times), and 100.73 mm/hm2 (4 times), respectively. No irrigation was conducted
    in Period V due to adequate precipitation in 2022 (see Fig. 2). Table 1. Scheme

    vehicle A DJI M600 pro UAV (DJI Technology Co., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) platform
    was used in this study, which equipped with a ten-channel Red-Edge MX dual camera
    (Mica Sense, Seattle, WA, USA) and a TIR-RGB integrated Zenmuse XT2 camera (DJI
    Technology Co., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) for UAV-based MS and TIR image acquisition
    (Fig. 3). As shown in Table 2, nine UAV campaigns were conducted in clear skies
    (between 11:30 and 14:00) during the kiwifruit growth period, with the flight
    height, speed and overlap were 25–30 m, 1.7–2.1 m/s, and 85–90%, respectively.
    As well as that, ground control points on the test site were measured using real-time
    kinematics (RTK) systems (Fig. 3). During the calibration of the UAV MS and TIR
    images, 10 targets were evaluated for their reflectance values (calibrated reflectance
    panel, Mica Sense, Seattle, WA, USA) and the temperature of white calibration
    cloth were measured during each flight (Fig. 3). Generally, we conducted follow-up
    studies based on UAV MS and TIR images after mosaic procedures, georeferencing,
    calibration, clip and resampling (all images are resampled to 4 cm resolution)
    by softwares ENVI5.3 (Esri Inc., Redlands, USA) and ArcGIS10.8 (ESRI, Redlands,

    a total of 575 SMC data points were collected from 64 fixed-point monitoring locations,
    as indicated by the red boxes in Fig. 1. Similarly, Tc and Ts were derived from
    temperature sensors operating at half-hour intervals and positioned 10 cm below
    the canopy and at the surface soil within the center of the 12 treatment plots.
    These temperature data, including Ta, Tc, Ts, Ta-Tc, Ta-Ts and Tc-Ts, were utilized
    to calculate the TDDI, as outlined in Table 3. Given the distribution and water
    absorption patterns of kiwifruit roots within the 0–60 cm range, it is advisable
    to conduct root sampling at depths within this range. To facilitate this, three
    pre-buried tubes were strategically placed within a horizontal range of 60–90 cm
    around the sample tree. SMC data were then measured at each layer using a FDR-TRIME
    (IMKO micromodtechnik GmbH, Leeds, Germany) and the average of three samples was
    recorded (refer to Fig. 3). In order to optimize irrigation practices, six sets
    of SMC data were obtained at various root depths (from SMC10 to SMC60). This was
    achieved by calculating the mean value of the measured SMC within each layer corresponding
    to the depth intervals of the respective root zones. Table 3. Temperature dataset

    to mitigate the impact of intricate background factors, we conducted the extraction
    of kiwifruit canopy information and subsequently generated matrices of representative
    mean values. This process entailed using TIR and MS data collected from an UAV
    on 20th May, 2022, as illustrated in Fig. 4 for reference (Savian et al., 2020).
    The extraction of TIR and MS data from the pure kiwifruit canopy was achieved
    through the application of threshold segmentation and support vector machine (SVM)
    classification algorithms by ENVI 5.3 (Esri Inc., Redlands, USA). Additionally,
    the delineation of the the grid plot of the study region''s grid plot, planted
    on a per-plant basis, was performed using the ''Create Fishnet'' tool in ArcGIS
    10.8 (ESRI, Redlands, USA), with careful consideration given to a planting unit
    size of 2 × 4 m. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    Schematic of the overall workflow in this study. In (a) Step I, details of the
    sensitive 2-D (3-D) VIs calculation (the MS information extraction of kiwifruit
    canopy); in (b) Step II, details of TVDI and TDDI calculation; and then in (c)
    Step III, the EL inversion model building and the root zones SMC mapping of planting
    unit grid. Step 1. Collecting the 2-D and 3-D VIs calculation datasets: in order
    to improve the accuracy of SMC estimation, we have developed two new indices,
    namely NDVIi,j and EVIi,j,w, by leveraging the formulas of the widely-used NDVI
    and EVI. These indices were calculated using a UAV-based 10-band combination (for
    NDVIi,j: X (i) from B7 to B10 and Y (j) from B1 to B6; for EVIi,j,w: X (i) from
    B7 to B10, Y (j) from B3 to B6, and Z (w) from B1 to B4), incorporating in-sites
    SMC data and Pearson''s correlation analysis. Our objective in employing this
    approach is to enhance the precision and reliability of vegetation assessment.
    Through the 2-D (3-D) optimal band combination method, we selected optimal NDVI7,3
    and EVI10,3,1 and the original NDVI10,6 and EVI10,6,2 as the VIi dataset for subsequent
    drought index (DI) calculation. Step 2. Collecting the TVDI and TDDI calculation
    datasets: Using the VIi - CWSI feature space method, we conducted calculations
    to generate four TVDI input n-D index datasets as feature variables. Subsequently,
    employing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm in conjunction with Ti (Ta, Ts, Tc,
    Ta-Ts, Ta-Tc, Tc-Ts)-VIi-CWSI feature space, we calculated 24 TDDIs input n-D
    index datasets as feature variables. Step 3. Model construction & validation and
    SMC estimation mapping datasets: To validate the accuracy of the model, 70% of
    samples were used to train the model, and 30% of samples were used to validate
    the model. 1) Analyzing the inversion accuracy of five EL models (RFR, GBDT, XGBoost,
    LGBM, and CatBoost) after parameter optimization through ''GridSearch'' method
    with 10-fold cross-validation; 2) collecting the planted-by-planted-grid SMC inversion
    mapping datasets based on the optimal TDDI and EL model. 2.5. The n-D index datasets
    2.5.1. Vegetation index (VI) We analyzed the sensitive VIs of SMC, calculated
    by 10 bands from UAV MS data, including NDVIi,j and EVIi,j,w. Among all the SMC
    sensitive VIs at different depths (Fig. S1), we screened out NDVI7,3 and EVI10,3,1,
    as contrast with the original NDVI10,6 and EVI10,6,2 for subsequent studies. The
    formula of VIs band combination was calculated as following: (1) (2) where Ri
    , Rj and Rw are the reflectance of MS data (the detail of bands refer to Table
    2), respectively. 2.5.2. Crop water stress index (CWSI) The calculation of the
    CWSI involved the utilization of three key parameters, namely the actual surface
    temperature (Tsi) of each pixel, the highest surface temperature (Tsmax), and
    the lowest surface temperature (Tsmin) across all pixels within the field trial.These
    parameters were derived from the TIR image (refer to Fig. 4 C-D, using the image
    of 20th May as an illustrative example). To minimize the impact of outliers, the
    top 5% and bottom 5% of surface temperature values were excluded from the analysis.
    Consequently, Tsmax and Tsmin were determined based on the remaining 90% of pixels.
    Subsequently, the CWSI for the kiwifruit canopy was computed using the following
    formula: (3) where Tsi is the surface temperature of pixel i, and all temperature
    values are expressed in degrees Celsius ℃. 2.5.3. Temperature vegetation drought
    index (TVDI) The calculation of the TVDI in our study based on the simplified
    VIi-CWSI space (Fig. S2, using the image of 20th May as an example). There are
    two upper and lower boundaries on the VIi-CWSI parameter space, called the \"dry
    edge\" and \"wet edge\", and they are derived from a linear function that relates
    the maximum and minimum CWSI to the four VIs (optimal NDVI7,3 and EVI10,3,1 and
    the original NDVI10,6 and EVI10,6,2), respectively (in Section 2.5.1): (4) (5)
    where a1, a2 and b1, b2 are the fitting parameters. TVDI is calculated based on
    CWSIi_max and CWSIi_min, which are the maximum and minimum CWSI for a given VI
    respectively. Following is the formula for calculating TVDI: (6) Table S1 shows
    the results for fitting to dry edges and wet edges for the NDVI10,6-CWSI space
    of the TVDI in Fig. S2a. Then, a total four TVDIs have been calculated into n-D
    indexes, including NDVI10,6-CWSI, NDVI7,3-CWSI, EVI10,6,2-CWSI and EVI10,3,1-CWSI.
    As shown in Fig. S2b, TVDI for different treatment plots is plotted versus the
    NDVI10,6-CWSI space. 2.5.4. Three-dimension drought index (TDDI) TDDI was proposed
    by Cheng et al. (2023), as a new index established by Ta-NDVI-CWSI 3-D parameter
    space, with a good potential to assess crop water conditions of maize. For more
    details on the principles of TDDI construction, please refer to the study of Cheng
    et al. (2023). Kiwifruit canopy structure is complex and susceptible to the surrounding
    environment. In order to better explore the SMC estimation ability under different
    environment condition, our team tried to establish various TDDI based on Ti-VIi-CWSI
    space (Fig. S3a), by using six temperature factors (Ta, Tc, Ts, Ta-Tc, Ta-Ts and
    Tc-Ts, standardized), four VIs (optimal NDVI7,3 and EVI10,3,1 and original NDVI10,6
    and EVI10,6,2) and standardized CWSI. The detailed calculation procedure is performed
    as follows: 1) The temperature (Ti) data were calculated by: (7) (8) (9) (10)
    (11) where i_max, i, i_min are the maximum, average, minimum of each temperature
    factor during UAV flight time (11:30–14:00), respectively, and all temperatures
    are in ℃. 2) Using Ti-VIi-CWSI space, we can use the relation between Ti, VIi,
    and CWSI to fit the upper and lower limits of the SMC, respectively. All samples
    were used in this study for model training in 3-D parameter space, and TDDI was
    calculated using the RF, which has excellent nonlinear fitting capabilities. The
    TDDI were calculated by： (12) (13) (14) where fi_max and fi_min are the functions
    between CWSImax and CWSImin with VIi and Ti, i.e., fitting dry and wet curved
    surface in the Fig. S3b, respectively. Table S2 shows the performances of the
    fitting dry and wet surfaces for 24 sensitive TDDIs. In order to investigate the
    common impact the UAV-Ground multi-model sensors on kiwifruit SMC estimation,
    n-D indices datasets (detailed in Section 2.5), including 10 MS bands, CWSI, 6
    Ti (Ta,Tc,Ts,Ta-Tc,Ta-Ts,Tc-Ts), 4 VIs (NDVI10,6, EVI10,6,2, NDVI7,3, EVI10,3,1),
    4 TVDIs based on VIi-CWSI space, and 24 TDDIs based on Ti-VIi-CWSIspace, were
    constructed. Moreover, we evaluated the performance of the indexes by calculating
    the correlation coefficient (R) between the n-D index and the in-situ SMC measurements.
    According to the correlation coefficient, the following formula is used: (15)
    where Cov (Index, SMC) represents the n-D index and SMC covariance, and Var (Index)
    and Var (SMC) represent the n-D indices'' variances and SMCs'' in situ variance.
    2.6. Model construction The RFR, XGBoost, GBDT, LGBM, and Catboost algorithms
    were selected as suitable models for the inversion of SMC at different root depths,
    as well as their high performance in previous studies or applications (Bentéjac
    et al., 2021, Yu et al., 2022, Zhai et al., 2023). Understanding the strengths
    and limitations of each algorithm will help us to achieve accurate and reliable
    prediction of orchard water status in combination with different production requirements
    Fig. 6). To investigate the most resilient EL model for monitoring SMC, specifically
    for the entire kiwifruit growth period, we conducted a screening process to identify
    the optimal TDDI22 ((Tc-Ts)-EVI10,6,2-CWSI) and TDDI7 (Tc-NDVI7,3-CWSI), which
    was constructed using the Ti-VIi-CWSI 3-D space. Subsequently, we compared the
    accuracy of five EL estimation models (RFR, GBDT, XGBoost, LGBM, and Catboost)
    using all SMC data. Of the 575 SMC samples, 70% were randomly selected for training
    and construction of the models, while 30% were used to assess the generalization
    ability of the models. The model construction was implemented using the Python
    ''scikit-learn'' library (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html#citing-scikit-learn),
    and the optimal parameters of the five EL models were determined through ''GridSearchCV''
    method with 10-fold cross-validation. Download : Download high-res image (873KB)

    model for monitoring SMC. 2.7. Model performance evaluation To evaluate the performance
    of the EL model predictions, four statistical measures were used, namely the determination
    coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and
    global performance indicator (GPI). The evaluation index is calculated as follows:
    (16) (17) (18) (19) where , and are the measured values and predicted values of
    SMC, respectively; ̅ represents the average value of the measured values, n indicates
    the number of samples. CImedian represents the median of the corresponding parameter,
    while m denotes the number of statistical indicators; αj it is equal to − 1 for
    RMSE and MAE, and equal to 1 for R2. 3. Results 3.1. The analysis of the relationship
    between n-D indices and SMC As depicted in Fig. 7, a correlation heat map was
    employed to investigate the relationship between various n-D indices and SMC at
    six different depths of the kiwifruit root zone. This analysis encompassed the
    entire fruit growth period as well as four specific single fruit growth periods
    (Period II to V). During Period II, it was observed that, except for B1 (Blue),
    B7 (Red-edge705), Ts, Ta-Tc, Ta-Ts, and Tc-Ts, the remaining n-D indicators exhibited
    significant correlations with SMC. Notably, these correlations demonstrated a
    notable decrease with increasing soil depth. Moving on to Period III, it was found
    that only certain n-D indices, including B3-B10 (Green531 to NIR), Ta and Tc,
    VI2 (EVI10,6,2), VI4 (EVI10,3,1), were significantly correlated with SMC at each
    depth. Other indices such as CWSI, TVDI, and TDDI exhibited significant correlations
    with SMC10 and SMC20. Additionally, during Period IV, CWSI, Ta, Ts, TVDI, and
    TDDI displayed significant correlations with SMC, with the correlations showing
    a slight increase with soil depth, and SMC10 exhibiting the lowest correlation.
    During Period V, only CWSI, TVDI, and TDDI were significantly correlated with
    SMC, with the correlations decreasing notably with increasing soil depth, particularly
    with SMC40-SMC60. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    *** represents p < 0.001, respectively. From left to right, the blue solid boxes
    are the full fruit growing period data, and the blue virtual boxes are from Period
    II to Period V. Overall, it was observed that single MS-bands, Ta, Tc, EVI10,6,2,
    and EVI10,3,1 are more suitable for monitoring SMC in each soil layer during Period
    II and III, while CWSI, TVDI and TDDI are specifically suitable for SMC10-SMC30
    during Period IV and V. Furthermore, the optimal indices (p < 0.001) for the entire
    growth period, were identified using the RF method, including TDDI22 ((Tc-Ts)-EVI10,6,2-CWSI)
    and TDDI7 (Tc-NDVI7,3-CWSI), respectively. It is important to note that the correlation
    between the n-D indices and the SMC, as measured in the field, varies significantly
    based on the growth period of the kiwifruit and the depth of the soil layer. Therefore,
    the development of n-D indices datasets is essential for enhancing the accuracy
    of SMC inversion in kiwifruit orchards under varying field environmental conditions.
    3.2. The performance of EL models in estimating SMC In this section, we present
    the results of our study on the performance of EL models in estimating SMC in
    kiwifruit orchards. We first optimized the EL model parameters based on the optimal
    TDDI in Section 2.6. Our results indicate that the accuracy of each EL model varies
    significantly between soil layers, with the best score ranging between 0.937–0.979

    for estimating kiwifruit SMC10 to SMC60. We used the GPI as a comprehensive model
    evaluation index, where a higher value indicates better performance. Our results
    show that the Catboost models exhibit respectable accuracy levels in all SMC estimation
    of each soil layer, followed by RFR, LGBM, GBDT and XGBoost, with the average
    GPI values of 1.24, 1.00, 0.99, 0.96, and 0.81, respectively. Among all the Catboost
    models, the performance of the SMC model under different soil layer ranked as
    SMC40 to SMC60 > SMC10 > SMC30 > SWC20, with GPI value of 1.27, 1.23, 1.22, and
    1.17, respectively. Each EL model has a significant performance in SMC inversion
    of each layer (R2 > 0.70, MAE < 0.20%, RMSE < 0.15%), demonstrating its effectiveness
    in improving kiwifruit SMC estimation accuracy based on the TDDI7 and TDD22 indices.
    Moreover, the combination of Ti-VIi-CWSI space derived from UAV-Ground multi-model
    sensors and parameter-optimized EL model has great application potential in SMC

    of the SMC estimation mapping under different conditions In this section, we evaluate
    the robustness of the SMC inversion map under different field conditions. Fig.
    9 shows that SMC increases with soil depth, and SMC50 and SMC60 reach maximum
    values and then tend to be stable. However, there are significant differences
    in the treatment plots at T1 (100 S), T2 (70 S), T3 (55 S), T9 (85 S), and T10
    (55 S) in each period. According to field research, this plot is more likely to
    have more fruit trees suffering from kiwifruit decline syndrome, which in turn
    worsens the drought stress of water deficit (Savian et al., 2020). Additionally,
    the long-term and contagious nature of the decline syndrome causes its SMC to
    be greatly influenced by field conditions and fruit tree health. Download : Download

    field settings, we conducted a Pearson''s correlation analysis, incorporating
    a 1:1 line to illustrate the association between the true and predicted values
    of SMC at different depths. This analysis took into consideration different sampling
    periods (refer to Fig. 9) and distinct irrigation treatments (as indicated in
    Fig. 10). Our results indicate a strong correlation between the true and predicted
    values of SMC10 to SMC60 during each sampling period, with correlation coefficient
    (R) of 0.957 ± 0.026, 0.946 ± 0.056, 0.916 ± 0.098, 0.906 ± 0.127, 0.906 ± 0.108,
    and 0.919 ± 0.073 (p < 0.001), respectively. It is noteworthy that SMC inversion
    performed the worst (with R of 0.733 ± 0.126) during Period II with lower canopy
    cover (4th May, 2022), where the values of R for SMC10 to SMC60 are 0.930, 0.800,
    0.680, 0.580, 0.640, and 0.770, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate a significant
    correlation between the true and predicted SMC values under different water treatments
    (Fig. 11). The strength of correlation followed the order: 100 S > 55 S > 70 S
    > 85 S, with R of 0.973 ± 0.005, 0.970 ± 0.013, 0.965 ± 0.005, and 0.948 ± 0.021,
    respectively. The findings of this study suggest that the SMC inversion map derived
    from this research demonstrates strong robustness. Download : Download high-res

    information extraction for SMC estimation The utilization of UAV-based MS and
    TIR platforms has revolutionized the acquisition of detailed imagery of kiwifruit
    orchards. However, the intricate and dynamic canopy structure and underlying surface
    conditions of kiwifruit present challenges for conventional soil background removal
    methods based on canopy indexes. Previous research have underscored the efficacy
    of intelligent learning algorithms in extracting vegetation canopy and improving
    model accuracy (Meiyan et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2023). In this study, we leveraged
    the SVM algorithm and adaptive threshold segmentation algorithm to extract pure
    kiwifruit canopy MS and TIR images. Our investigation also revealed the substantial
    impact of the kiwifruit canopy sampling window size on model accuracy (Bai et
    al., 2021, Deng et al., 2023). To facilitate long-term monitoring of kiwifruit
    plant growth, we partitioned the kiwifruit area in the orchard into grids based
    on the size of each planting unit and standardized the extracted kiwifruit canopy
    information to minimize pixel discrepancies. The extraction of accurate kiwifruit
    canopy information from UAV imagery holds great potential for enhancing the estimation
    of SMC in the root zone of kiwifruit orchards. Furthermore, the detailed and standardized
    canopy information obtained from UAV imagery allows for a more comprehensive understanding
    of the spatial variability of SMC within the orchard, enabling targeted irrigation
    and management strategies to optimize kiwifruit growth and yield. 4.2. The performance
    of the n-D indices for SMC estimation The objective of this study is to establish
    a comprehensive n-D set of SMC sensitive indices using cost-effective UAV-Ground
    multi-sensor information, incorporating data pre-processing and optimal band combination
    screening methods. Sensitivity analysis revealed significant variations in the
    sensitivity of six depths of root zone SMC during the fruit growth period. Notably,
    the kiwifruit canopy displayed high vitality, high water transport demand, and
    low underlying surface complexity during Period II, influencing the correlation
    with SMC. Consequently, each index, except for Ts-based indices, exhibited the
    highest correlation with SMC40 in each period. Period III represents the peak
    period of kiwifruit water demand, but the vitality of the canopy is vulnerable
    to high-temperature weather, drought stress, and pest infection. Furthermore,
    strong mixed pixels in the canopy structure and the underlying surface of the
    orchard in this period impacted the accuracy of pure canopy information extraction.
    Therefore, except for Ta and Tc, TVDI and TDDI did not exhibit significant associations
    with SMC50 and SMC60. During Period IV, despite the field environment and canopy
    structure becoming more stable, long-term drought stress and pests lead to a low
    correlation between spectral indices and SMC. However, temperature-related indicators
    demonstrated a strong correlation with SMC20 to SMC60, except for SMC10. In Period
    V, CWSI, TVDI, and TDDI exhibited a strong correlation with SMC30, while only
    NDVI7,3 calculated by Red-edge705 and Green531 bands has a correlation with SMC.
    CWSI, TVDI, and TDDI displayed similar correlation, with vegetation humidity determined
    by Tc, canopy temperature-vegetation index, and field temperature-vegetation index-canopy
    surface temperature, respectively. TVDI effectively integrates vegetation index
    with CWSI, exhibiting a slight advantage over CWSI in performance. However, it
    still demonstrates relatively poor performance in time series analysis. TDDI,
    as proposed by Cheng et al. (2023), incorporates time series attributes through
    the Ta parameter, resulting in a vegetation drought index with time series characteristics.
    In this study, we further enhance TDDI by exploring the optimal feature combination
    of indicators, including MS-bands, six temperature parameters (Ta, Ts, Tc, Ta-Ts,
    Ta-Tc, and Tc-Ts), and CWSI, for kiwifruit root zones SMC inversion. Despite TDDI
    not providing more information compared to TVDI and CWSI, it shows promise in
    addressing orchards in diverse environmental conditions in future research and
    applications. Moreover, previous research has indicated that indicators such as
    ET0, SAVI, Soil Moisture Monitoring Index (SMMI), and canopy coverage exhibit
    superior performance in assessing plant water status (Das et al., 2021, Meiyan
    et al., 2022, Zhao et al., 2022). Therefore, it is recommended to include additional
    meteorological parameters and vegetation indices to provide data support for the
    comprehensive exploration of suitable orchard indicators under diverse environmental
    circumstances (Liu and Yang, 2023, Tao et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2022). Overall,
    the study highlights the potential of UAV-Ground multi-sensor data in estimating
    root zone SMC in kiwifruit orchards, providing valuable insights for future research
    and applications in agricultural water management. 4.3. The comparative analysis
    of classical ensemble learning models for SMC estimation The utilization of EL
    algorithms has garnered significant attention from agronomy experts in recent
    years (Teshome et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2022, Zhai et al., 2023). This heightened
    interest can be attributed to the remarkable advantages associated with EL algorithms,
    including high precision, fast calculation speed, and their applicability to small
    sample data (Bentéjac et al., 2021). In the context of this study, five classical
    EL models (RFR, GBDT, XGBoost, LGBM, Catboost) were selected, and their respective
    merits and drawbacks are elucidated in Fig. 6b. Among these models, the RFR algorithm
    emerges as the most fundamental and effective regression model, a conclusion supported
    by numerous research reports (Ning et al., 2023, Teshome et al., 2023, Wigmore
    et al., 2019). Moreover, we found that the Boosting models exhibited superior
    accuracy compared to Bagging (RFR) models in SMC estimation models, consistent
    with diverse studies such as SMC (Yu et al., 2022), yield (Chlingaryan et al.,
    2018, He et al., 2022, Maes and Steppe, 2019, Zhang et al., 2023), and drought
    conditions (Wang et al., 2023). This superiority can be attributed to the iterative
    nature of Boosting algorithms, which sequentially build multiple weak learners
    to correct the errors of previous models. This iterative process enables Boosting
    models to focus on instances that are misclassified or have high residuals, thereby
    improving the overall predictive performance. However, it is important to note
    that Boosting models may be more susceptible to overfitting and can be computationally
    intensive. Therefore, in the context of practical application in precision agriculture
    monitoring, it is essential to consider the appropriate combination of Boosting
    and Bagging models (such as stacking model) to leverage their respective strengths
    and mitigate their weaknesses. Additionally, researchers have observed substantial
    variations in the accuracy of different algorithms across various fields and time
    periods (Fan et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2017), which aligns
    with the findings of this comparative study. Hence, future investigations should
    consider distinct management modes, environmental conditions, meteorological parameters,
    and growth periods of orchards when selecting appropriate indexes and models that
    cater to specific requirements, while continuously adjusting parameters. 4.4.
    Outlook and future research In order to assess the influence of diverse field
    conditions, growth periods, irrigation treatments, and weather conditions on the
    water absorption capacity of kiwifruit roots at varying soil depths and the resultant
    alterations in SMC across kiwifruit cultivation regions, a systematic planted-by-planted
    grid mapping of SMC framework was conducted. The SMC10 to SMC60 mapping across
    different growth periods and irrigation treatments was employed as distinct datasets
    to appraise the reliability of the root zone SMC estimation model. Additionally,
    the optimization of n-D indices and the development of suitable EL model in this
    study present a cost-effective and efficient method for achieving high-resolution
    mapping of root zone SMC at the individual kiwifruit plant level. This technological
    advancement carries significant implications for improving irrigation management,
    augmenting kiwifruit yield, and enhancing water productivity. Further research
    is warranted to delve into the integration of other environmental variables and
    to devise real-time monitoring systems for kiwifruit cultivation. Moreover, the
    ten-band MS sensor and TIR sensor utilized in this study bear resemblance to the
    red-edge band specific to the Sentinel-2 satellite and the TIR band unique to
    Landsat-8. Furthermore, the meteorological and field temperature sensors employed
    are non-invasive, enabling continuous monitoring at a low cost. Consequently,
    future research can delve deeper into the experimental design of this study, integrating
    multi-source satellite fusion data, and through meticulous testing and refinement,
    aim to achieve the monitoring of SMC in the root zone of expansive orchards integrated
    with multi-source satellite and field sensor equipment. This integrated approach
    can furnish data support for precise management of farmland water status at the
    scale of irrigation areas. 5. Conclusion This study presents evidence of the significant
    potential of various n-D indices, such as kiwifruit canopy MS and TIR bands, NDVI10,6,
    NDVI7,3, EVI10,6,2, EVI10,3,1, CWSI, 4 TVDIs, and 24 TDDIs, for estimating kiwifruit
    root zone SMC during the fruit expansion period. Furthermore, TDDI, TVDI, and
    CWSI exhibited notably superior temporal characteristics compared to other n-D
    indices. Particularly, the Catboost models utilizing two optimal TDDIs (TDDI22:
    (Tc-Ts)-EVI10,6,2-CWSI and TDDI7: Tc-NDVI7,3-CWSI for SMC estimation demonstrated
    exceptional performance, with R2 and RMSE values were 0.966 ± 0.010 and 0.046 ± 0.003%,
    respectively. Additionally, the planted-by-planted mapping approach displayed
    strong performance in estimating root zone SMC during various fruit growth periods
    and under various irrigation treatments, as indicated by R value for SMC10 to
    SMC60 of 0.962 ± 0.024, 0.955 ± 0.049, 0.929 ± 0.083, 0.924 ± 0.108, 0.921 ± 0.092,
    and 0.929 ± 0.062, respectively. These findings offer valuable insights into the
    optimization of n-D indices and contribute to a deeper understanding of SMC estimation
    in kiwifruit orchards using multi-sensors and EL models. Nevertheless, it is important
    to acknowledge the existence of several limitations in this study. The per-plant
    grid SMC estimation mapping framework requires further refinement to be effectively
    utilized in precision irrigation management at the orchard scale. CRediT authorship

    due to context and vulnerabilities. In smart irrigation systems, some fog nodes
    use more or fewer computing resources to analyze the data according to sensor

    consider distinct contexts. Federated learning support fog-based IoT systems to
    detect faster the behavior of fog nodes as it enables them to perceive previous

    Intelligent edgeFederated learningFog computingInternet of ThingsUnsupervised
    learning 1. Introduction Fog computing can reduce the volume of data transferred
    to the cloud and decrease the IoT system response time [1,2] as it is physically
    located near the end devices, like sensors and actuators [3]. Besides these advantages,
    fog nodes are vulnerable to attacks and anomalous behaviors [4], which is not
    feasible to monitor manually [5], due to their massive numbers and distinct performance
    behaviors during execution. Cook et al. [6] ratify that detecting anomalies using
    supervised learning algorithms may cause adversities because the system cannot
    perceive new unknown behaviors on the fly. The heterogeneity of fog nodes considers
    the diversity of hardware resources, security policies, data analysis duration,
    and demands CPU and RAM usage [28]. Therefore, each fog node may have different
    expected performance behaviors. Let us consider, for example, two fog nodes with
    the same hardware configurations, where the expected behavior of the first one
    is receiving 200 packets per minute and 60 % CPU usage, but the second one expects
    1000 packets per minute and 20 % CPU usage. Therefore, each fog node can have
    distinct and unlabeled anomalous behaviors, which makes it appropriate to use
    unsupervised learning [14] to detect new behaviors. Knowing every fog behavior
    is essential because the expected behavior can vary according to context features.
    For example, in a smart hospital, a fog node can demand more or less hardware
    and network resources to store and analyze data because the data analysis frequency
    and duration depend on attributes like the number of patients, seasonality, and
    specific sickness endemic peaks. The same happens in a smart irrigation system,
    where some fog nodes use more or fewer computing resources to analyze the data
    according to sensor location, soil moisture, plant species, or annual seasons.
    This paper proposes the FL-Means system that uses unsupervised federated learning
    [7] to streamline the detection of fog node performance behavior (where one behavior
    is a single data cluster). FL-Means addresses the fog node''s veracity challenge
    (detection of expected and unexpected performance behaviors), preliminarily introduced
    by the TW-IoT framework [9]. However, TW-IoT focuses on general concepts without
    proposing or evaluating fog behavior veracity. Here, we consider that the same
    IoT system can have many fog nodes demanding different levels of computing resources
    (behaving differently). Our system can detect every fog node''s expected and anomalous
    performance behaviors, regardless of context variations. Also, it perceives these
    behaviors faster because it uses federated learning. Our system executes an unsupervised
    learning K-Means algorithm [8,31] in every fog node to recognize its performance
    behaviors individually. It also transmits these behaviors as local cluster centroids
    to the cloud side, and the cloud calculates global centroids, sending them to
    all fog nodes. Therefore, all fog nodes use global centroids to identify behaviors
    that occurred previously in other fog nodes and can make accurate predictions.
    Our system also preserves data privacy among fog nodes and the cloud because it
    only transmits data centroids [10], improving the IoT data trustworthiness [9].
    We assess FL-Means in three scenarios, using simulated sensors: (1) agility: evaluate
    FL-Means against a non-federated baseline approach, simulating several behaviors
    in two fog nodes, (2) scalability: explore the system scalability by varying the
    number of fog nodes sending local centroids to the cloud, and (3) heterogeneity:
    analyze the heterogeneity using different fog node hardware to verify the sample
    prediction time, the time to compute local centroids, and the time to receive
    the global centroids. In Scenario 1, we observe two situations where FL-Means
    predicts the fog node behaviors from 1710 to 8043 times faster than the baseline
    approach. Our approach also shows that FL-Means presents higher prediction accuracy
    for these cases but has similar accuracy to the baseline for other situations.
    In Scenario 2, we perceive that the number of behaviors and fog nodes affects
    the CPU usage and time to compute global centroids. When we test 100 local centroids
    for 12 cluster centers, the cloud calculates the global centroids in 1.02 ± 0.01
    s, and for 1000 fog nodes, this computation took less than seven seconds. Finally,
    in Scenario 3, we observe that even in the worst case, using Jetson Nano CPU computation,
    the fog node obtains the local centroids in 2.46 ± 0.02 s, it receives the global
    centroids in 3.18 ± 0.15 s (considering 100 fog nodes), and executes sample predictions
    in 46.77 ± 0.41 ms. We also have evidence that the FL-Means system may support
    the cloud in monitoring all fog node behaviors because the cloud receives the
    behaviors'' centroids from every fog node, decreasing IoT management costs. This
    paper unfolds the sections as follows: Section 2 details the background, Section
    3 covers the related work, Section 4 explains our unsupervised federated learning
    system, Section 5 reports the used methodology, Section 6 reveals our results,
    Section 7 presents the discussion, and finally Section 8 presents the conclusions
    and future work. 2. Background This section clarifies concepts about IoT Stages,
    clustering (unsupervised learning), and federated learning. 2.1. IoT stages This
    paper considers a fog-based IoT system unfolding four computing stages, three
    (thing, mist, and fog) at the edge and a fourth stage at the cloud side. The thing
    stage [11] perceives a context by sensors and executes the system''s decisions
    using actuators. The mist stage [12] can pre-process data before transmitting
    it to the fog stage [3], which can perform system decisions, and may reduce network
    traffic between the edge and the cloud. The cloud stage [13] has more computing
    power than fog and can analyze historical data to improve and make robust decisions.
    2.2. Clustering Unsupervised machine learning, also known as clustering, can cluster
    data samples without prior knowledge of any data category [14,35]. Clustering
    algorithms identify similarities between data samples to generate clusters through
    different strategies, like data density or distance between samples. Consequently,
    these algorithms use the data to create a data model that represents the found
    clusters. Some clustering algorithms only group data samples but do not predict
    which group a new data sample belongs. The algorithms K-Means, Mean-Shift, and
    BIRCH do not have this prediction limitation, also, it is well-known that K-Means
    compute predictions faster than Mean-Shift and BIRCH [14,31,36]. K-Means also
    is faster than other algorithms, according to the results in [36], which evaluated
    data reduction based on machine learning algorithms for fog computing in agriculture.
    The K-Means algorithm begins by randomly defining values for K clusters centroids.
    After that, K-Means iteratively calculates the arithmetic mean distance between
    the centroid and the cluster data points, assigning the computed mean values to
    each K centroid until the data points stay in the same cluster. The Mean-Shift
    algorithm uses the density-based clustering strategy to iteratively search the
    centroids of regions with the highest data points density. Then, Mean-Shift assigns
    these regions as the final clusters. BIRCH is a hierarchical algorithm that builds
    a data tree with leaves corresponding to subclusters and has a threshold value
    that limits each subcluster radius. BIRCH also groups subclusters at the ending
    of execution to obtain a K number of clusters. For K-Means, we mandatory need
    to determine the number of K clusters to generate a data model. However, it is
    impossible to speculate the number of K that obtains the best model. Therefore,
    we can evaluate it by calculating a validation index like Calinski–Harabasz [15].
    The Calinski–Harabasz index can decide the optimal number of clusters, revealing
    the best clustering when the index reaches the highest possible value. 2.3. Federated
    learning Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
    enables a computing system to train models from decentralized data sources [7].
    In other words, the federated learning approach supports an IoT system to collaboratively
    join different information from distinct edge nodes, enhancing the system''s decisions.
    In IoT, for example, the cloud can create a global model by aggregating individual
    local models of edge nodes. Imteaj et al. [16] and Hosseinalipour et al. [17]
    describe an FL approach in which the edge nodes collect data, generate a local
    model, and send the local gradients to the cloud. When the cloud receives these
    gradients, it runs a federated averaging algorithm to create a global model and
    transmit the global model gradient to edge nodes [7,10]. In IoT, using federated
    learning can also preserve local data privacy because it does not require exposing
    raw data records through the network [10]. 3. Related work Cook et al. [6] expose
    the challenge of detecting anomalies in IoT systems, considering contextual information,
    prior knowledge, scalability, and resource constraints. They also suggest that
    using a classifier for anomaly detection may pose difficulties in perceiving unexplored
    anomalies. Li et al. [18] present a literature review for federated learning,
    and they mention that “existing FL frameworks construct based on supervised learning
    method.” Moreover, they mention federated training for unsupervised machine learning
    as a new research frontier. Sater and Hamza [19] present a federated learning
    approach called FSLSTM to detect sensor energy consumption anomalies in smart
    buildings. They tested the FSLSTM against deep learning models with three types
    of sensors and observed that their proposal presented higher accuracy for detecting
    these anomalies. Yadav et al. [20] propose a federated unsupervised deep learning
    approach. Their approach uses autoencoders to learn unlabeled data and generate
    its own feature set. They evaluate their proposal using a dataset named CICIDS
    without the data labels, obtaining an accuracy of 97.75 % after 100 training rounds.
    Servetnyk, Fung, and Han [21] present an unsupervised federated learning approach
    for unbalanced data that combines the weight computation strategy with an algorithm
    like K-Means. They artificially generate a dataset with 16 clusters and 50 data
    points per cluster. In experiments, they observed that their proposal clustered
    the data better than centralized K-Means, and their results only focused on measuring
    clustering performance metrics. Ahmad et al. [32] proposed a streaming anomaly
    detection algorithm named HTM and evaluated their approach against other techniques
    using a benchmark called NAB. In the evaluation, they mainly measured latency
    and the NAB score. The study considered sensor temporal noise anomalies but did
    not concern a fog-based scenario. Sivanathan et al. [33] categorized the behavior
    of different IoT devices and developed an unsupervised clustering method to identify
    each device''s normal network traffic behavior. The authors also considered retraining
    models for detecting behavior changes due to a firmware upgrade of devices and
    obtained 94.7 % accuracy. Kumar, Karthik, and Nair [22] present a federated K-Means
    clustering that uses K-Means models as local models and calculates the cluster''s
    centroids average in the cloud. The authors assessed their proposal using well-known
    MNIST and EMNIST datasets. However, the study only focused on measuring the model''s
    accuracy. They also do not consider the continuous changeability of the optimal
    number of clusters for every single edge node. Examining the related work, the
    authors do not consider an IoT scenario containing thousands of fog nodes with
    distinct expected behaviors that can individually change according to the seasonality
    (such as the period of the day, month, or season of the year). Therefore, the
    main contribution of this paper is to present a system that can iteratively identify
    new behaviors of fog nodes using a clustering approach to predict the expected
    behavior of individual nodes, also considering the temporal features for distinct
    contexts, like in a smart irrigation system, where some fog nodes use more or
    fewer computing resources to analyze the data according to sensor location, soil
    moisture, plant species, or annual seasons, for example. Our system can also select
    the best model and identify all the fog node behaviors, which may favor diagnosing
    future faults of each node behavior. 4. FL-means system In this paper, we propose
    a system named FL-Means [34] that uses unsupervised federated learning to discover
    new unlabeled fog node behaviors during system execution, also enabling a fog
    node to identify the other fog nodes’ behaviors. FL-Means has a component executing
    on fog nodes and another on the cloud side, respectively named Fog-FL and Cloud-FL
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Fog-FL and Cloud-FL only transmit clusters centroids
    between fog nodes and the cloud side. In other words, these components do not
    transfer raw data; thus, our system enhances data privacy because it does not
    expose any collected information. Download : Download high-res image (375KB) Download

    cloud-FL component. Fog-FL collects a dataset named workingDB (Figs. 1 and 2),
    which has data samples such as CPU and RAM usage (%), packet delay among sensors
    and fog node (in milliseconds), throughput (Kbps), and the number of packets arriving
    in fog node by every T seconds. Before loop1 execution (Fig. 1), we feed the WorkingDB
    with a few data samples to obtain the known behaviors. During loop1 running, the
    Fog-FL continues to collect these data samples, inserting them in another dataset
    named samplesDB. On the fog side (Fig. 1), the FL-Means system executes five steps
    iteratively: (i) it uses WorkingDB as input to train different K-Means data models
    by varying K values, and it utilizes the Calinski–Harabasz index to decide the
    best model to select (ii) it extracts the clusters centroids of the selected model
    and sends it to the cloud, (iii) it receives new global centroids from the cloud,
    (iv) predicts each sample behavior (cluster) calculating the Euclidean distance
    of these samples from the global centroids and decide if the sample behavior is
    anomalous or not (we consider the expected behavior as the cluster that has more
    data points occurrences in workingDB), and (v) it updates workingDB by inserting
    the data samples of samplesDB in workingDB, because, during Fog-FL execution,
    samplesDB may have new behaviors that are not already stored in workingDB. Additionally,
    the FL-Means system normalizes every input data sample before generating a model
    or predicting its clusters. The Fig. 2 example details the steps presented in
    Fig. 1 and the interaction between the model generated from workingDB and the
    samplesDB. In the Fig. 2 example, the system contains a model from workingDB with
    two known behaviors (A0 and A1). Initially, the system generates a local model
    from workingDB and receives the global model from the cloud. During loop2 execution
    (step 4), it predicts every sample (line) of samplesDB as A0 or A1 behavior. After
    round 1 (all steps''s first execution), the system creates a new workingDB (by
    joining it with samplesDB). In rounds 2 and 3, the system uses the new workingDB
    formed after rounds and repeats the steps mentioned in Fig. 1. However, after
    round 3, the new workingDB model learns a new behavior A2, and now the system
    can detect it when it occurs in any fog node. Therefore, the system joins the
    initial workingDB with the subsequents samplesDB because it can generate models
    from data that appeared during execution time. The system receives each fog''s
    local centroids on the cloud side (Fig. 3). It computes the Euclidean distance
    between every local centroid to verify if it is lower than a threshold value and,
    in turn, marks the centroids that obey this condition. After that, the cloud merges
    the marked centroids by calculating these centroids’ arithmetic mean, and then
    we obtain new centroids values, which refer to combining similar fog node clusters
    centroids. Then, FL-Mean obtains the global centroids being: all the centroids
    of the fog node clusters that Cloud-FL did not merge and the merged fog node centroids.
    Finally, it sends global centroids to all fog nodes. In Fig. 3, the word pass
    means that there is no action for the algorithm execute. 5. Methodology We explore
    three Scenarios: (1) FL-Means against a baseline approach (without global centroids),
    (2) system scalability with thousand local centroids, and (3) FL-Means heterogeneity,
    using different fog node hardware configurations. In the experiments, we use CrateDB
    [23] to support workingDB and samplesDB and run the SenSE simulator [24] to generate
    a dataflow of thousands of packets (which contains the timestamp of the packet
    creation time). We also employ a naïve Linux stress-ng tool to overload the fog
    node CPU and RAM. For Fog-FL (Fig. 1), we configure T = 5 s and i = 48, and for
    Cloud-FL (Fig. 3), we set the threshold value = 0.2. In the experiments, we also
    use the dataset collected by Fog-FL in reference [25]. In the experimental environment
    (Fig. 4), we include the four IoT stages (Section 2.1): SenSE represents the thing
    and mist stages, while Fog-FL and Cloud-FL play the role of the fog and cloud
    stages, respectively. For every scenario, we assess all the distinct time metrics
    with 30 replications, from which we calculate the arithmetic mean, the standard
    deviation, and the 95 % asymptotic confidence intervals. Download : Download high-res
    image (270KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Experimental environment
    (for scenario 3, the fog runs SQLite3 [27] instead of CrateDB). Our simulated
    environment data flow (Fig. 4) is based on the real scenario developed for the
    SWAMP project [29,30], which developed an IoT smart water management system focused
    in high-precision smart irrigation. The project had four pilots: (i) MATOPIBA
    Pilot, in Luís Eduardo Magalhães - Brazil, (ii) Guaspari Pilot, in Espírito Santo
    do Pinhal - Brazil, (iii) Intercrop Pilot, Cartagena - Spain, and (iv) CBEC Pilot,
    San Michele/Fosdondo - Italy. In our experiment, we use time-driven sensors because
    we considered the environment for smart irrigation, as shown in [11]. Zyrianoff
    et al. [11] presented and evaluated a 5-layer IoT architecture with different
    configurations for smart agriculture and smart cities applications. In the investigation,
    the authors explained that real smart cities applications can use more event-driven
    sensors, in contrast to real smart agriculture applications that focus on time-driven
    sensors. 5.1. Scenario 1: accuracy and prediction time We use the Mosquitto MQTT
    Broker [26] to intercommunicate all IoT stages, and every stage runs on the Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. In Scenario 1, we compare our FL-Means system against a baseline
    approach, which is a system that only relies on the fog side. Therefore, the baseline
    does not include steps 2 and 3, mentioned in Fig. 1, without any federation learning
    technique. It also predicts samples (see step 4 of Fig. 1) using the naïve prediction
    method of the K-Means algorithm. 5.1.1. Performance behaviors for fog A We first
    simulate behavior A0 for 10 min and A1 for 20 min, and in subsequent rounds, execute
    behaviors A2 and A3 [25]. • A0: Null packet load (no network traffic). • A1: 1000
    packets per minute and CPU load by 70 %. • A2: 1500 packets per minute, CPU load
    by 100 %, and RAM by 50 %. • A3: 200 packets per minute and CPU load by 40 %.
    5.1.2. Performance behaviors for fog B We initially run behavior B0 for 10 min,
    B1 for 20 min, and B2 for 10 min. In subsequent rounds, execute behaviors B3,
    B4, and B5 [25]. • B0: similar to behavior A0. • B1: 500 packets per minute. •
    B2: 500 packets per minute and CPU load by 80 %. • B3: similar to behavior A1.
    • B4: similar to behavior A2. • B5: similar to behavior A3. 5.1.3. Timeline of
    behavior simulation We execute the experiments in 7 rounds (4 min each), using
    two fog nodes, Fog A and Fog B. As mentioned in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, before
    starting the experiments, the workingDB of Fog A has data records of behaviors
    A0 and A1, and the workingDB of Fog B has samples of behaviors B0, B1, and B2.
    Fig. 5 shows the occurrence of behaviors during the seven rounds and highlights
    the behaviors B3, B4, and B5 with a red outline when they appear for the first
    time in Fog B. Note that we run B3, B4, and B5 in Fog B after executing them in
    Fog A (as A1, A2, and A3). Download : Download high-res image (231KB) Download

    2: scalability We explore Cloud-FL scalability considering Fog A and Fog B with
    the local centroids of rounds 1 and 7 (see Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and Fig. 4).
    We also evaluate both fog nodes with 12 local centroids. Our experiments simulate
    fog nodes sending 2, 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000
    local centroids to the cloud (half Fog A and half Fog B). The cloud runs on Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations: • Conf.1: Fog A uses two local
    centroids from round 1 (Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.3), and Fog B uses three centroids
    from round 7 (Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3). • Conf.2: Fog A uses five local centroids,
    and Fog B uses six centroids from round 7. • Conf.3: Fog A uses 12 distinct clusters,
    and Fog B uses the same 12 centroids. 5.3. Scenario 3: heterogeneity We explore
    the FL-Means heterogeneity executing the Fog-FL component using different hardware
    devices. We assess Fog-FL in a Raspberry Pi 4, a Jetson Nano developer kit, and
    a personal computer (PC) with an Intel Core i7 processor. The cloud runs on the
    Linux Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4
    GHz and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations for the fog node hardware:
    • Raspberry: Raspberry Pi 4 Computer Model B running Linux 20.04 operating system
    with Quad-core ARM A72, 1.5 GHz, and 4GB memory. • Jetson: Jetson Nano Developer
    Kit running Linux 20.04 operating system with a Quad-core ARM A57, 1.43 GHz, and
    4 GB memory. • PC: A physical personal computer using an Intel Core i7-5500U processor
    with 2.4 GHz, 8GB RAM, and running Linux 20.04 operating system. 5.4. Metrics
    In scenario 1, we analyze the following metrics: (i) the Calinski–Harabasz index
    for every round; (ii) the number of clusters (it suggests the number of groups
    that fit better according to the Calinski–Harabasz validation index); (iii) the
    confusion matrix (assesses the K-Means data model accuracy); (iv) Accuracy of
    predictions (we evaluate the FL-Means system against baseline); (v) Euclidean
    distance between centroids of Fog A and B behaviors to identify which behaviors
    are similar; (vi) Time BDF, as the time that a fog node needs to correctly predict
    behaviors already learned by other fog nodes (FL-Means against baseline); (vii)
    Time to predict a known behavior in a single sample, where we assess FL-Means
    against a baseline. In scenario 2, we analyze the following metrics: (i) time
    to compute the global centroids and (ii) CPU usage of the Cloud-FL component.
    In scenario 3, we evaluate the (i) Time-Local as the time to compute the local
    centroids, (ii) Time-Global as the time to compute local centers and receive the
    global centroids, considering that a fog node is the first of 100 fog nodes to
    send the local centroids and the last to receive, (iii) Time-Pred-Fog as the time
    to K-Means sample prediction in a fog node (without federated learning) and (iv)
    Time-Pred-FL as the time of sample prediction using the global centroids. 6. Results
    In this section, we reveal our experiment results. 6.1. Results of scenario 1
    Scenario 1 presents the results for individual fog nodes (A and B), and we report
    the results for the FL-Means system against the baseline approach (see Section
    5.1). 6.1.1. Results for each fog node individual behaviors Before each round,
    the Fog-FL component (Fig. 1) runs the Calinski–Harabasz validation to select
    the best clustering model, varying the number of clusters by two up to 10, where
    we obtained the results shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7. After Fog-FL decides the number
    of clusters, we observe that it corresponds to the number of simulated behaviors
    for Fog A and B (as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5), except for rounds 6 and 7 of
    Fog A. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download : Download full-size

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A 2 2 2 3 3 5 5 B 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 In Table 1, we verify that the system
    finds the exact number of simulated behaviors for all rounds of Fog B. For rounds
    6 and 7 of Fog A, the Calinski–Harabasz validation suggests four clusters (Section
    5.1.1) but also identifies one more behavior (A4). After analyzing the A4 data
    points, we perceive that the system correctly identifies this new behavior because
    the delay of its samples is twice the value of behavior A1 records. Therefore,
    considering 5 clusters for the models in the last two rounds of Fog A is valid.
    Then, in these rounds, Fog A correctly perceives behaviors A0, A1, A2, A3, and
    A4. We generate a confusion matrix for the last selected models of Fog A and Fog
    B (Fig. 8). The confusion matrix presents the main diagonal tending to approximately
    98 % accuracy for Fog A and 100 % accuracy for Fog B (on a scale of 0.0–1.0),
    where rows and columns symbolize the simulated behaviors and the found clusters.
    Therefore, we perceive that the models are appropriate when comparing the clusters
    with the simulated behaviors (including found behavior A4). Download : Download

    the baseline We observe that during single sample predictions in Fog A (Fig. 9),
    the FL-Means system and the baseline approach present an accuracy lower than 80
    % for round 3 and equal to 0 % for round 5. The system generates these results
    because it does not immediately recognize the new behaviors A2 during round 3
    and A3 during round 5 (see timeline in Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image
    (261KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Accuracy of predictions for
    fog A. We can observe that behavior A3 never happened before round 5, for Fog
    A or Fog B (see Fig. 5). Therefore, the both systems (federated and non-federated)
    cannot perceive A3 until round 5 finishes, when will be generated a model created
    by a new workingDB with characteristics of behavior A3 (as mentioned in explanation
    of Fig. 2). In Fog A, the correct prediction of these new behaviors will only
    happen when the next round starts; in other words when Fog A generates a new k-means
    model that includes these behaviors as new clusters (see Table 1). During round
    3, for example, Fog A only knows the behaviors A0 and A1 (and behaviors B0, B1,
    B2, and B3 of Fog B if using the FL-Means system). However, no fog node has identified
    A2 yet (see Fig. 5), and it needs to wait until the next round to recognize this
    behavior because A2 is unprecedented for the entire system. In round 5, for example,
    the accuracy is 0 % (Fig. 9) because A3 is the only simulated in this round (see
    Fig. 5). However, the system can identify this behavior in the subsequent round
    6 because, after round 5, Fog A generates new models containing the most recent
    samples and identifies new clusters. In rounds 1, 2, 6, and 7, we observe an accuracy
    of 100 % for both approaches. In round 4, the FL-Means system presented an accuracy
    of 93.8 % against 100 % for baseline. In Fog B, we observe that the baseline does
    not correctly predict the behaviors B4 during round 4 and B5 during round 6 but
    that the FL-Means system detects these behaviors correctly and reveals the most
    accurate prediction values for all assessed rounds (Fig. 10). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system is most advantageous than the baseline because, in rounds 4 and 6, it detects
    the behaviors B4 (identical to A2) and B5 (like A3) without the Fog B needing
    to wait for the next round (to generate a new data model). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system identified B4 and B5 correctly in Fog B because the system previously learned
    them as Fog A behaviors (see timeline in Fig. 5 and Table 1). Download : Download

    predictions for fog B. During round 4, the Fog B individually only knows 4 clusters:
    B0, B1, B2, and B3 (see Table 1), but using the FL-Means system, it also knows
    that the behavior B4 is similar to A2 because Fog A model already knows the three
    clusters: A0, A1, and A2 (see Table 1 and Fig. 5). Analyzing Table 2, we also
    observe that the FL-Means system merged the behaviors B4 and A2 because the Euclidean
    distance between their centroids is lower than 0.2 (our threshold value). Table

    value = 0.2). FCa Rounds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A0 and B0 0.068 0.054 0.068 0.022 0.023

    0.163 0.111 A3 and B5 0.048 0.051 a FC = fog clusters. In Fog B, we perceive that
    the non-federated baseline approach presents a 0 % accuracy prediction during
    round 6 (Fig. 10) because we only simulate behavior B5 during this round. During
    round 2, even when Fog B uses FL-Means, it cannot identify the behavior B3 (identical
    to A1) because the Euclidean distance between B3 and A1 is higher than 0.2 (see
    Table 2). Therefore, in this case, FL-Means has an accuracy near the baseline
    approach (Fig. 10). The FL-Means system computes the Euclidean distances between
    similar behaviors above the threshold value for A1 and B3 until round 3 (Table
    2). However, in the following rounds, the distances of A1 and B3 decrease, and
    the system recognizes these behaviors as similar (Table 2). We also verify that
    FL-Means correctly recognizes and merges all other identical behaviors A0 and
    B0, A2 and B4, and A3 and B5 since their first occurrences because the distances
    between their centroids are lower than the threshold value (Table 2). The FL-Means
    system reveals an enormous gain considering the time BDF metric (Fig. 11) because
    it was 1710 times faster in round 4 and 8043 times faster in round 6 than the
    baseline approach, which needs to wait for the next round to identify the new
    behavior correctly. However, FL-Means and baseline are statistically tied in round
    2 because the distance between the behaviors A1 and B3 is not lower than 0.2 at
    this moment (see Table 2), and it needs to wait for the next round to detect the
    behavior B3 individually (see Table 1). In typical situations, we verify that
    both approaches present similar time costs to predict a known behavior in a single
    sample, around 30 ± 2 ms. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download

    of scenario 2 In Scenario 2, we analyze the system scalability, where we send
    two up to 40,000 local centroids to the Cloud-FL component. In our experiment,
    each local centroid refer to the number of fog nodes that send cluster centroids
    to Cloud-FL to generate global centroids (see Section 5.2). Fig. 12 shows that
    the time to compute global centroids for 100 fog nodes is, on average, 0.19 ±
    0.01, 0.35 ± 0.03, and 1.02 ± 0.01 s for Conf.1, Conf.2, and Conf.3, respectively.
    We also note that Conf.3 takes 6.82 ± 0.02 s for 1000 fog nodes, and Conf.3 takes
    31.08 ± 0.02 s with 5000 fog nodes to compute global centroids. Besides, these
    times present a correlation coefficient of 0.99996, 0.99991, and 0.99989 for Conf.1,
    Conf.2, and Conf.3, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (219KB) Download

    proportional to the number of clusters and fog nodes sending local cluster centers
    to the cloud. We also observe that cloud CPU usage increases when the number of
    fog nodes expands (Fig. 13), with a correlation coefficient of 0.92724. Download

    explores the heterogeneity of fog nodes by using three different hardware configurations:
    Jetson, Raspberry, and PC (see Section 5.3). In this scenario, the fog node generates
    and selects one data model to extract the local centroids (Fig. 1.). For the Time-Local
    metric, we observe that the PC configuration takes 5.85 times lower than Jetson
    and 2.28 times lower than Raspberry (Fig. 14). Download : Download high-res image

    generate local centroids (Time-Local) and for the fog node to obtain global centroids
    with 100 fog nodes (Time-Global). We also measure the Time-Global metric, which
    consists of a fog node calculating local centroids, sending them to the cloud,
    and receiving the cloud centroids (after the cloud sends the same global centroids
    to another 99 fog nodes). Therefore, the time to obtain the global centroids (Time-Global)
    is formed by the time to compute local fog node centroids, the time for the cloud
    to calculate the global centroids, and the time to receive the centroids from
    the cloud. For the Time-Global, we perceive that PC presents the lowest values
    and that Raspberry takes 1.81 times lower than Jetson for this metric (Fig. 14).
    In Fig. 14, we also discovered that Raspberry demands less time to process local
    centroids than Jetson because the FL-Means code runs on a CPU of 1.43 GHz against
    1.5 GHz of Raspberry Pi 4. In Fig. 15, we note that Time-Pred-FL elapses faster
    for every hardware configuration than Time-Pred-Fog. For Time-Pred-Fog, we observe
    that the PC configuration demands, on average, 7.27 less time to predict a sample
    against the Jetson and 3.76 times less than the Raspberry. We also perceive that
    even using the Jetson configuration, the Time-Pred-FL takes less than 47 ms to
    decide a sample cluster. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download :

    7. Discussion Based on the results, we observed that FL-Means presents accuracy
    and time gains for predicting unknown fog node behaviors. In an IoT scenario where
    at least one fog node has already learned a new behavior, the FL-Means system
    saves other fog nodes time to predict the same behavior when it appears to them
    for the first time. We also highlight that our system can detect new fog node
    behaviors by continuously training local models with the appropriate number of
    behaviors because it uses Calinski–Harabasz validation every round. Scenario 1
    shows that FL-Means does not merge the behaviors A1 and B3 when B3 appears in
    round 2 because the distance between them is higher than 0.2. In round 3, Fog
    B already learns B3 but does not recognize B3 as the same as A1. The distances
    between B3 and A1 only reduce when the behavior B4 appears at the end of round
    4 because B4 has data samples with the highest RAM and CPU usage, changing the
    cluster centroid of B3. We observe that the threshold for behaviors A1 and B3
    is higher than 0.2 in rounds 1 and 2, delaying the system to perceive that behaviors
    A1 and B3 are similar. Also, supposing we set the threshold to 0.1, the FL-Means
    will not detect that behaviors A2 and B4 are similar. Therefore, it is essential
    to report that the threshold value impacts the prediction time and accuracy results.
    Scenario 2 evidences that the cloud side demands more CPU usage and time to compute
    global centroids when the number of fog nodes increases. Scenario 3 shows that
    FL-Means executed correctly for the three different fog node hardware tested.
    We advise using a cloud component to compute the global centroids for fog nodes
    with the same hardware. For example, one Cloud-FL should calculate data from Raspberry
    fog nodes, and the other should receive data from Jetson fog nodes. The FL-Means
    system enhances IoT trustworthiness by enabling every fog node to learn all other
    fog node behaviors faster without sending any local raw data, only transmitting
    the centroids of the clusters, preserving privacy. Also, the FL-Means system supports
    the cloud in monitoring all expected and anomalous fog node behaviors because
    the cloud always receives the behaviors'' centroids from fog nodes. 8. Conclusion
    This paper presents an unsupervised federated learning system (FL-Means). The
    FL-Means system enables a fog-based IoT application to recognize fog node behaviors
    faster when they have already occurred in different fog nodes. It can also detect
    new behaviors by grouping them in clusters using the K-Means algorithm. We assess
    the FL-Means in three Scenarios: (1) when it identifies each fog node behavior
    individually and against a baseline approach (without the federated learning technique),
    (2) testing scalability, and (3) exploring heterogeneity. In Scenario 1, we execute
    the experiments in seven rounds of four minutes each, using a cloud server and
    two fog nodes that we call A and B. The FL-Means system correctly clustered all
    simulated behaviors for both fog nodes individually. In Scenario 1, we evidence
    that using FL-Means, Fog B adequately predicts the unknown behaviors only Fog
    A previously knew. FL-Means reveal 95.8 % accuracy against 79.2 % of the baseline
    in round 4 and 100 % against 0 % of the baseline in round 6. In the same situation,
    the FL-Means system predicts the behaviors in Fog B faster in rounds 4 and 6 than
    in the baseline approach. Examining Scenarios 2 and 3, with 100 fog nodes, we
    observe that the fog node needs to generate the local model and that our federated
    system only requires milliseconds or at least one second more to calculate a global
    model. We also have evidence that predicting a sample behavior using federated
    learning is faster than not using it. Therefore, our approach shows promising
    results for time-critical IoT applications. A complete system to detect anomalies
    and network attacks can be built on top of FL-Means, but we focused on detecting
    performance anomalies related to context. In future work, we intend to reduce
    FL-Means time response and explore fog nodes with distinct kinds of datasets,
    including network attacks. CRediT authorship contribution statement Franklin Magalhães

    High productivity with enhanced nutrient-use efficiency is one of the important
    desirable agronomic, economic, and environmental goals in crop husbandry (Haque,
    2006). In most crops, nitrogen (N) is the most limiting nutrient for crop production
    (Ågren et al., 2012), and its efficient use is important for economic and ecological
    sustainability (Mălinaş et al., 2022). Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a high
    N-demanding crop, where insufficient application of it may result in reduced production,
    whereas excessive fertilization implies wasting resources and an increase in environmental
    pollution (Good & Beatty, 2011). Nitrogen fertilization of wheat can account for
    up to 30% of the total production cost and around 50–75% of the N applied to the
    field is not used by the plant and is lost by leaching into the soil (Baresel
    et al., 2008; Hirel et al., 2011). Therefore, nitrogen is a key element required
    for plant growth, and is one of the most important yield-limiting nutrients in
    crop production in all agroecological regions of the world (Guo et al., 2019;
    Zhu et al., 2007). Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of the wheat nitrogen
    status is of great significance for growth diagnosis and precision management
    to achieve higher yield and better quality while also minimizing adverse environmental
    impacts (Yang et al., 2019). At present, the implementation of remote sensing
    (RS) technology in precision agriculture provides new opportunities for the non-destructive
    real-time diagnosis of plant nitrogen status (Blekanov et al., 2023; Sahoo et
    al., 2015) and precision nitrogen management over a large area (Rabatel et al.,
    2017). Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from multiple spectral bands are now widely
    used in developing N monitoring models for various crops (Basyouni et al., 2015;
    Jiang et al., 2020; Ranjan et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2023). This technology contributed
    to the development of RS-based variable rate N recommendation approaches, which
    mainly use the remotely sensed crop growth information as the chief attribute
    of N fertilization (Späti et al., 2021). Many researchers have attempted to derive
    the crop biophysical and chemical parameters using (VIs) derived from field spectral
    measurements (Dehghan-Shoar et al., 2023), and sensors on satellites (Jamali et
    al., 2023) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (Buthelezi et al., 2023). Even
    though satellite-based multispectral images are useful to aid N management, farmers
    are still reluctant to adopt RS technologies. Satellite images normally have lower
    spatial and temporal resolution and, in some areas, they can be distressed by
    cloud cover during the image acquisition (Hunt et al., 2005). UAVs have tremendous
    potential for high-resolution requirements for site-specific management of weed
    control (Anderegg et al., 2023; Esposito et al., 2021; Jurado-Expósito et al.,
    2021) and N recommendation (Jiang et al., 2023; Maresma et al., 2016). The advent
    of hyperspectral UAV sensors with narrow band widths made a breakthrough in crop
    monitoring by providing an accurate prediction of plant N levels and thereby N
    stress estimation. Leaf nitrogen content (LNC) of wheat was predicted by using
    first derivative normalized difference nitrogen index (FD-NDNI) and the first
    derivative ratio nitrogen vegetation index (FD-SRNI) with the help of random forest
    (RF) (Liang et al., 2018); the transformed chlorophyll absorption in the reflectance
    index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) on using partial
    least squares regression (PLSR) and modern machine learning (ML) methods, including
    artificial neural network (ANN), RF, and support vector machine (SVM) (Wang et
    al., 2021). Among the various non-parametric modeling algorithms, the RF approach
    performed best for estimating LNC in winter wheat using modified renormalized
    difference VI (RDVI) from UAV Multispectral Images (Zheng et al., 2018). Several
    other researchers also proposed UAV-based multispectral and hyperspectral VIs
    for LNC prediction in crops using different machine learning approaches (Fu et
    al., 2022; Jiale Jiang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017; Osco et
    al., 2020; Xu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022). On account of potential applications
    of UAV hyperspectral remote sensing in the field of agriculture and the importance
    of N management practices, the present study emphasizes the performance of various
    hyperspectral vegetation indices for wheat leaf N estimation. The study conducted
    involves an exhaustive comparative assessment of the VIs for wheat leaf N assessment
    and was performed in multiple stages, (1) UAV-based hyperspectral data collection
    and pre-processing (2) selection of the most significant indices for leaf nitrogen
    prediction and (3) prediction of leaf N through ANN using selected indices as
    input. Dataset Experimental site and field sampling An experiment was conducted
    on the Research Farm of ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi
    with wheat crop (variety-HD 3059) during the rabi (winter) season 2021-22. The
    field is situated between 28°38′29.99″N to 28°38′26.58″N latitudes and 77°9′0.99″
    E to 77°9′5.09″E longitudes. The experiment was conducted in a split-plot design
    with three irrigation types as the main plot: I1-soil moisture sensor-based irrigation,
    I2-CWSI-based irrigation, and I3-conventional irrigation. Under each irrigation
    level, there were five levels of nitrogen application i.e., 0, 50, 100, 150, and
    200 kgha−1corresponding to N0 to N4, respectively as sub-plot treatment. As a
    basal dose, one-third of recommended N and full recommended phosphorus (P) and
    potassium (K) were applied as urea (46% N), diammonium phosphate (18% N and 46%
    P2O5), and muriate of potash (60% K2O), respectively. The remaining N was applied
    later in two equal split doses during the first and second irrigations. There
    were three replications R1, R2, and R3. The wheat crop was sown on 13th December
    2021 and was harvested on 15th April 2022. The size of the sub-plot and main plot
    were kept as 93.6 m2 (7.2 × 13 m) and 468 m2 (7.2 × 65 m), respectively. The location
    map of the study area and its experimental layout is presented in Fig. 1. The
    study area experiences a semi-arid climate with warm long summers lasting from
    April to August, monsoon in July-September, and mild winter in October. The soil
    is sandy loam (Typic Haplustepts) having a medium to angular blocky structure
    and non-calcareous texture. The soil is slightly alkaline with a mean pH of 8.0,
    mean electric conductivity of 0.25dSm−1 and organic carbon of 0.57%. The average
    nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium (NPK) content of the soil is estimated as 217.1,
    52.6, and 508.0 kgha−1, respectively. Fig. 1 Study area map showing the Geographic

    images of the wheat crop were captured using a hyperspectral camera (Nano Hyperspec
    of Headwall Photonics Inc., Bolton, MA, USA) mounted on a hexacopter (Fig. 2).
    The UAV data acquisition was conducted on 7th February 2022 during day time between
    11:00 hrs to 12:00 hrs on a sunny day within a wind speed of 2–3 ms−1, relative
    humidity ranging between 39–41%, and a temperature of 21 °C. The specifications
    of the imaging sensor used are summarized in Table 1. The flight path planning
    for the survey has been done using UgCS Mission planning software (UgCS, 2017)
    which allows the remote monitoring of the flying route, speed of the drone, height
    above the ground, and overlapping. Fig. 2 a Drone with hyperspectral camera facing
    nadir, b image data acquisition in wheat field Full size image Table 1 Major specifications
    of UAV hyperspectral sensor Full size table Methodology Preprocessing of hyperspectral
    image data The pre-processing of the acquired hyperspectral image data involved
    (1) conversion of digital numbers (DN) to radiance, (2) calculation of reflectance
    values, (3) image orthorectification (4) generation of ortho-mosaicked image for
    analysis (5) spectral smoothening and (6) crop area segmentation. Raw data conversion
    The acquired raw data was converted to radiance followed by reflectance using
    Headwall SpectralView software version 3.1.4 (Headwall Photonics, Bolton, MA,
    USA). The dark signal needs to be captured during image data acquisition due to
    varying sensor characteristics, such as sensor settings and orientation. To obtain
    an absolute radiometric value from the sensor it has to be calibrated since its
    signal is subject to influences other than the impinging light. The raw hyperspectral
    data cubes use the dark reference of the sensor captured pre-flight. The radiance
    dataset of individual scan lines was processed using the white reference generated
    using the reflectance data from pixels of calibration tarp placed in the field
    during flight. The positioning information from Global Navigation Satellite System
    (GNSS) receivers and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) synchronized with data and
    the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model was used for
    orthorectification (Santos-Rufo et al., 2020). The geo-rectified hyperspectral
    data cubes were stitched together and validated by overlaying with Google Earth
    imagery. The signal noise present in the calibrated image has been removed by
    applying a Savitzky–Golay (SG) smoothening filter with a second-order polynomial
    and the frame lengths of 5, available in image processing software ENVI 5.5 (L3
    Harris Geospatial, Boulder, CO, USA) (Ge et al., 2019). Crop area segmentation
    The wheat canopy from 45 subplots was extracted using a combined approach of thresholding
    of hyperspectral normalized difference vegetation index (hNDVI) (Rouse et al.,
    1974) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) binary masks (Rejith et al., 2020). The
    threshold for the hNDVI was selected from the histogram representing the frequency
    of vegetation index values corresponding to all 45 subplots of different N treatments.
    A threshold value was selected halfway between the vegetation peak and the neighbouring
    trough. The SAM classification was further carried out using the endmembers spectra
    computed manually by selecting the pixels of wheat, other vegetation features,
    and soil. The SAM measures the spectral angle between the endmember spectra and
    the image spectra in n-dimensional space. Lowering the angle suggests a closer
    match to reference spectra. The hNDVI mask was later multiplied with SAM binary
    mask to generate a primary mask image. Then the morphological erosion operator
    (3 × 3 matrix of ones) was applied to it to remove the mixed pixels from the canopy
    edges. Finally, this approach generates a complete mask that was used for concealing
    the wheat pixels from the neighbouring soil, shadow, and grass pixels in the hyperspectral
    image dataset. The flow chart showing the proposed methodology adopted for the
    present study is given in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Flow chart showing the methodology adopted
    for the study Full size image Computation of vegetation indices After an exhaustive
    review of the literature, a total of 61 vegetation indices (Table 2) were selected
    for leaf N assessment using imaging spectroscopy (Adak et al., 2021; Chandel et
    al., 2019; Liang et al., 2018; Pradhan et al., 2013; Ranjan et al., 2012). It
    is evident from previous studies that, indices-based approaches combined with
    prediction techniques have yielded optimum results for N assessment. The NDVITs
    constructed by spectral and textural information of UAV multispectral imagery
    performed well in wheat leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) monitoring (Fu et al.,
    2022). Vegetation indices such as NDRE or RERVI composed of near-infrared and
    red edge bands of UAV—multispectral scanner (UAV-MSS) data showed better results
    for estimating crop nitrogen status in rice plants (Li et al., 2018). Four representative
    vegetation indices such as the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI),
    Red edge Chlorophyll Index (CIred−edge), Green band Chlorophyll Index (CIgreen),
    Modified Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with a blue band (mNDblue) were
    derived from the multi-angular UAV-MSS images for estimating LNC, plant nitrogen
    concentration (PNC), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), and plant nitrogen accumulation
    (PNA) of wheat canopies (Lu et al., 2019). Table 2 List of spectral indices commonly
    used for the N estimation (Rλ= reflectance at λ wavelength) Full size table To
    compare the performance of different spectral indices for leaf N content at various
    N fertilizer treatments, twenty-five points were randomly selected within each
    subplot by excluding an inner buffer distance of 1m from the borders. This approach
    facilitates the exact measurements of crops and avoids the areas of bare soil
    without crops (Maresma et al., 2016). At last, the mean of the values extracted
    at each point within a subplot was used to determine the best vegetation index/es
    to predict LNC. Three sets of top-most leaf samples were collected from each plot
    for N determination and their mean was taken. The N concentration of leaf samples
    was estimated using the Micro-Kjeldahl method (Guebel et al., 1991; Ranjan et
    al., 2012). Selection of suitable indices Selection of optimal spectral bands
    through R2 The R2 value for all 61 derived indices was calculated for the growth
    stage under study. R2 value equal to or higher than 0.7 was considered as optimum
    for N assessment. In this approach, an index-by-index linear correlation matrix
    was computed to interpret redundant information. Further, Pearson correlation
    coefficient (R) values have been squared (R2) to remove inverse correlation. Selection
    of optimal spectral bands through PPR-VIP statistics Projection pursuit regression
    (PPR) is a multivariate statistical technique comprising of three-layered architecture
    with input, hidden, and output layers. Unlike the linear regression approach,
    which assumes a direct linear combination of the predictor variables accumulating
    the cost of inaccurate predictions; PPR is a non-parametric regression algorithm.
    The algorithm helps in finding the most suitable model for prediction problems.
    Projection ‘directions’ or ‘strengths’ between input and hidden neurons; hidden
    and output neurons and the activation function are calculated by minimizing the
    error using least square criteria. The mathematical formulation of the model is
    given by Eq. 1. $$L= \\sum _{i=1}^{q}{[{y}_{i}-\\sum _{k=1}^{m}{\\beta }_{ik}{f}_{k}{(\\alpha
    }_{k}^{T}x)]}^{2}$$ (1) where, \\({\\alpha }_{k}^{T}=[{\\alpha }_{k1},\\dots \\dots
    ,{\\alpha }_{kp}]\\) is the projection directions given by weights between the
    input and the hidden layers; \\({\\beta }_{k}=[{\\beta }_{1k},\\dots \\dots ,{\\beta
    }_{qk}]\\) is the projection directions given by weights between the hidden layers
    and the output layer; \\({f}_{k}\\) is the activation function; \\({y}_{i}\\)
    is the response variable which is modelled as a weighted linear combination ofthe
    activation function. PPR learns layer by layer and calculates the weights by least
    square estimation. Variable importance Projection (VIP) is a statistical technique
    for synthesizing the contribution of predictors and response variables. This measure
    is highly dependent on the accuracy and importance of the fitted model (here,
    PPR). It summarizes the contribution of a variable to the model. The indices with
    the highest VIP values (centers of the peaks observed) have been selected by keeping
    the threshold value as 0.5. The equation is given as: $$\\sqrt{n\\frac{\\sum _{j=1}^{a}{b}_{j}^{2}{t}_{j}^{T}{t}_{j}{\\left(\\frac{{w}_{kj}}{\\left|\\left|{w}_{j}\\right|\\right|}\\right)}^{2}}{\\sum
    _{j=1}^{a}{b}_{j}^{2}{t}_{j}^{T}{t}_{j}}}$$ (2) where \\(b\\) is the regression
    coefficient, \\({w}_{j}\\) is the weight vector, \\({t}_{j}\\) is the score vector
    for the \\({k}^{th}\\) element. Selection of optimal spectral bands through VIF
    statistics The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) helps in measuring the multicollinearity
    in regression algorithms. It quantifies the inflation of variance of estimated
    coefficients. Inflation factors were calculated by regressing the predictor with
    every other predictor variable considered for the model followed by the computation
    of R-squared values. The VIF for the \\({i}^{th}\\) predictor is given by: $$VIF=
    \\frac{1}{1-{R}_{i}^{2}}$$ (3) where \\({R}_{i}^{2}\\) is the r-square value obtained.
    Artificial neural network (ANN) ANN mimics the functionality of a human brain
    where neurons work as the most fundamental unit to perform complex tasks. It is
    a three-layered architecture including input, hidden, and output layers, along
    with an activation function that ignites the most significant neuron as the output
    (Fig. 4). The fully connected structure is managed by weights from the input to
    the hidden layer followed by the hidden to the output layer (Fig. 5). ANN being
    a machine learning measure, can learn from the data and predict accordingly. The
    data traverses through the hidden layer which transforms the data into a usable
    form to generate the result, that is it helps in extracting useful information
    from raw data by generalizing the unknown facts. Fig. 4 Basic architecture of
    artificial neural network (ANN) Full size image Fig. 5 Single-layer perceptron
    Full size image For every input \\({x}_{i,}\\) the corresponding weight value
    \\({w}_{i}\\) is multiplied indicating the strength of the connection. The one
    with a higher influence on the output value is triggered. $$\\sum =\\left({x}_{1}\\times
    {w}_{1}\\right)+\\left({x}_{2}\\times {w}_{2}\\right)+\\dots \\left({x}_{n}\\times
    {w}_{n}\\right)$$ (4) where, \\(x=[{x}_{1},{x}_{2},{x}_{3}\\dots {x}_{n}]\\) and
    \\(w=[{w}_{1},{w}_{2},{w}_{3}\\dots {w}_{n}]\\) are the row vectors belonging
    to input and the weights respectively. Therefore, the dot product is given by:
    $$x \\cdot w = \\left( {x_{1} \\times w_{1} } \\right) + \\left( {x_{2} \\times
    w_{2} } \\right) + \\ldots \\left( {x_{n} \\times w_{n} } \\right)$$ (5) $$\\sum
    = x\\cdot w$$ (6) Bias acts as an offset for the activation function and produces
    the output value. $$z=x\\cdot w+b$$ (7) This intermediate value generated is passed
    to a non-linear activation function which governs the learning speed of the network.
    There exists a multitude of activation functions, depending upon the problem.
    One of the simplest ones is the sigmoid activation function, \\(\\hat{y}\\) gives
    the predicted value and \\(\\sigma\\) is the activation function, and it is computed
    as, $$\\hat{y}={\\upsigma }\\left(\\text{z}\\right)=\\frac{1}{1+{e}^{-z}}$$ (8)
    The training mechanism includes back-propagating the error by computing the gradient
    values with respect to the weight. The mean square error is calculated by the
    difference between the actual values (\\(y_{i}\\)) and the predicted values (\\({\\hat{y}}_{i}\\))
    of error, $${MSI}_{i}={({y}_{i}-{\\hat{y}}_{i})}^{2}$$ (9) The cumulative error
    for the entire training set is termed as loss function, which is calculated as,
    $$MSE= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum _{i=1}^{n}{({y}_{i}-{\\hat{y}}_{i})}^{2}$$ (10) Later,
    the weights can be optimized and hyper-parameters such as the minimum error, number
    of epochs, and learning rates can be fixed. A training: validation: testing ratio
    of 70:15:15 is used to measure the prediction accuracy of the ANN model. Results
    and discussions Variability in the measured leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC)
    The LNC is one of the major indicators used to describe the leaf nitrogen status
    in different crops. Figure 6a shows the variation in LNC at different levels of
    nitrogen and water stresses. Figures 6b, c are the maps showing the nitrogen stress
    levels and LNC. As an observation, for every irrigation level, the LNC shows an
    increasing trend with a decrease in nitrogen stress. The average value of LNC
    corresponding to N0 is 4.30% and for N4 treatment is 5.28%. The LNC ranges from
    4.19 to 5.12% in I1, 4.22 to 5.48% in I2, and 4.48 to 5.24% in I3 irrigation treatments.
    No significant change was observed with varying levels of irrigation. A similar
    trend is detected for the wheat plant in the case of LNC at different water and
    nitrogen stresses for the tillering stage (Ranjan et al., 2012). At the recommended
    value of 150 kgha−1 (N3), the LNC shows a maximum value of 4.90% in I1 and 4.69%
    in I2. When it comes to zero where no N application was done, the LNC varies between
    4.19% in I1 to 4.48% in I3. The variation in irrigation levels affects more on
    plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA) than LNC (Ranjan et al., 2012). The overall
    results of LNC indicate that the different N stress levels play an important role
    in the N status in the leaves of wheat plants. Fig. 6 a LNC variation at different
    levels of nitrogen and water stresses; b graded N levels; and c measured leaf
    nitrogen Full size image Optimal indices for leaf N prediction The pre-processed
    hyperspectral imagery of the wheat plots is shown in Fig. 7a. The wheat canopy
    area of the study site was successfully segmented using a combined approach of
    hNDVI threshold and SAM binary masks as expounded in the previous section. The
    crop area of 45 wheat plots is shown in Fig. 7b. These data were used for generating
    61 vegetation indices for analyzing the plant N status using LNC. Fig. 7 a UAV
    hyperspectral imagery of the experimental plot; b masked vegetation Full size
    image All the indices summarized in Table 2 are sensitive to plant N and hold
    significance for predicting the LNC using the feature importance score. A large
    number of vegetation indices were used to explore the potential of optimizing
    feature variables combined with machine learning models for predicting N content.
    The graph showing the feature importance scores for all 61 vegetation indices
    derived from R2 and VIP is shown in Fig. 8. The feature importance scores of R2
    and VIP help in ranking the 61 indices for selecting the best ones. The GMI1 performed
    the best with an R2 score of 0.81 while the NPQI performed the least with a R2
    score of 0.01. In the case of VIP, the best index is MSAVI with a performance
    score of 0.72 and the lowest performance was shown by BNI. Fig. 8 Variable importance
    ranking for vegetation indices derived from R2 and VIP Full size image The selection
    of important spectral variables for calculating VIF scores was done based on threshold
    criteria, R2 > 0.7, and VIP > 0.5. On applying these thresholds, 39 and 15 indices
    were generated from R2 and VIP respectively. Then the VIF technique was applied
    to these two sets of data for generating the optimal indices. The VIF generates
    15 and 13 indices each from these two sets, out of which 13 were found to be common
    and they were selected as the most suitable indices for N prediction. The GI and
    TVI were excluded from the final list of suitable indices since they were only
    obtained from the VIP calculation. The VIF score of the 13 suitable indices is
    shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 Graph showing the VIF scores obtained for selected indices
    Full size image Among the selected 61 indices, 13 indices showing the best correlation
    with measured leaf N are taken for Leaf N prediction. They are NDCI, GMI2, RI_half,
    PSSRa, SR_900, RI_1db, SR705, Ctr1, RI_3db, RVI3, GMI1, ZM, and MSAVI. The selected
    indices belong to Red-edge spectral region (0.7 and 0.8 µm) which is found sensitive
    toward LNC (Raj, 2021). The spectral regions 350–710 nm and 740–1100 nm are equivalently
    considered highly sensitive to LNC at different N stresses (Ranjan et al., 2012).
    In literature, the N deficiency in corn canopies was successfully derived by an
    increase in red reflectance and a decrease in NIR reflectance (Walburg et al.,
    1981). The red (671 nm), NIR (780 nm) and the spectral region between 550 and
    710 nm are relatively sensitive to plant N levels(Stone et al., 1996; Zhao et
    al., 2005). Since the visible bands are strong absorbents of chlorophyll especially
    in red and blue regions (Hansen & Schjoerring 2003; Pablo J. Zarco-Tejada et al.,
    2001), the optimal indices generated from the present study contain bands from
    visible and red-edge regions thus proving the ability to evaluate crop growth
    and N status. The vegetation indices developed by selecting spectral bands from
    visible regions show strong absorption by chlorophyll and hence it proved to be
    very useful in predicting the nitrogen status in plants (Ranjan et al., 2012).
    The indices such as Ctr1, GMI-1, GMI-2, NDCI, SR705, ZM and PSSRa are used for
    examining the Chlorophyll content in plants (Broge & Leblanc 2001; Gitelson &
    Merzlyak 1994). The RVI3 indicates the leaf nitrogen accumulation (Zhu et al.,
    2008). Further, MSAVI, RI-1dB, RI-3db, and RI-half are used for analyzing the
    vegetation sensitivity of plants. And finally, the indices such as SR_900 are
    used for measuring above-ground green biomass (Rouse et al., 1974). The N along
    with other macro-nutrients such as phosphorous (P) from soil are significant in
    the synthesis of chlorophyll during photosynthesis (Fredeen et al., 1990). So,
    N is one of the major constituents of chlorophyll which is closely associated
    with leaf color, crop yield, and growth (Fageria et al., 2010). Thus it is demonstrated
    that the optimal indices selected from the present study show a strong relationship
    with the leaf N content in plants. Figure 10 and 11 show the maps of optimal vegetation
    indices and Table 3 summarizes the characteristics by which the suitable indices
    are influenced. The maximum and minimum values corresponding to each index are
    specifically seen in plots with N4 and N0 treatments. The R2 score of these 13
    indices ranges from 0.66 to 0.81, which implies that their index values are best
    correlated with LNC. The highest VIF score was shown by both ZM and RI_half while
    the least score was shown by NDCI. Fig. 10 Vegetative Indices generated using

    characteristics Full size table Leaf nitrogen prediction ANN architecture with
    13 input, 10 hidden neurons, and an output node has been constructed to train
    the network for the prediction of N content. The training: validation: testing
    ratio is 70:15:15 with an R-square value of 0.97, 0.84, and 0.86 respectively.
    The regression plots shown in Fig. 12 illustrate the network output plotted versus
    the targets as open circles. The best linear fit is indicated by a dashed line
    and the solid line represents the perfect fit. Fig. 12 Regression plots for N
    prediction using ANN Full size image Further, the best validation performance
    is obtained at 0.067 mean square error (MSE) at 5 epochs. The result seems reasonable
    as the test set error and the validation set error have similar characteristics
    therefore any significant overfitting has not occurred [Refer to Fig. 13a]. The
    error histogram is plotted between the observed and predicted N values, after
    training the neural network, where the y-axis represents the number of samples
    in a particular bin, as shown in Fig. 13b. From Fig. 13c, the final value of the
    gradient coefficient at epoch number 11 is 0.0114 approximated with minimum error,
    also the gradient value keeps on decreasing with increasing the epoch. Fig. 13
    Performance evaluation using ANN for N prediction. a Best validation performance,
    b error histogram, c training set histogram Full size image The N-predicted map
    generated using the ANN is shown in Fig. 14. The predicted LNC ranges from 2.53
    to 6.51%. The current approach of N prediction significantly reduces the salt
    and pepper noise pertaining to the raw image. The noise is still observed in the
    overlapping regions due to the averaging of pixel values during ortho-mosaicking.
    Also, less salt and pepper noise and misclassification were reported for random
    forest (RF) (Wang et al., 2021) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classification
    (Zhong et al., 2020)of UAV data. This method presented is an alternate approach
    for the UAV-based imaging spectroscopy for predicting wheat leaf nitrogen using
    spectral modelling technique (Sahoo et al., 2023). Fig. 14 Leaf N prediction using
    ANN. a Measured LNC; b Predicted LNC Full size image Conclusion Leaf N assessment
    for the winter wheat crop concerning different nitrogen levels was successfully
    evaluated for the considered experimental field. A UAV-based hyperspectral push-broom
    scanner system seems to be capable of acquiring high-resolution spatial and spectral
    data for N studies in precision farming. However, the side overlap regions after
    mosaicking the scanlines is still an area of concern but later be tackled for
    the prediction of N values. The hyperspectral imagery of ultra-high spatial resolution
    was captured over the experimental wheat fields under varying irrigation and nitrogen
    treatments. After pre-processing and removal of spectral noises, the crop area
    is extracted for prediction of N values to avoid the intervening effect of other
    features such as impervious areas, soil, etc. Abrupt increase or decrease in reflectance
    values has been observed in the overlapping areas in multiple scan lines to generate
    the mosaiced image, which is decreased using ANN as a prediction model. About
    61 vegetative indices have been computed, out of which 13 most suitable indices
    were extracted using a combined approach of R-Square and VIP followed by the VIF
    technique. These optimal indices were used in the ANN model for the prediction
    of leaf N values for the entire field. The prediction model shows an R-square
    value of 0.97, 0.84, and 0.86 for training, validation, and testing respectively,
    suggesting high prediction accuracy. The generated N map seems to be similar to
    the ground-truth values of N produced for every plot making the proposed approach
    viable for the same. The approach seems to be fast, accurate, and suitable for
    N prediction, further, it may be upscaled for the farmer’s field level with the
    availability of field data. The generated spatial map may be used by a sprayer
    drone for site-specific nitrogen application to promote sustainability and economical
    use. A similar technique may be deployed for other crop-related parameters, such
    as chlorophyll and leaf area index (LAI), etc. as well. References Adak, S., Bandyopadhyay,

  description: The shortage of water stands as a global challenge, prompting considerable
    focus on the management of water consumption and irrigation. The suggestion is
    to introduce a smart irrigation system based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    aimed at minimizing water consumption while maintaining the quality of agricultural
    crops. In WSNs deployed in smart irrigation, accurately determining the locations
    of sensor nodes is crucial for efficient monitoring and control. However, in many
    cases, the exact positions of certain sensor nodes may be unknown. To address
    this challenge, this paper presents a new localization method for localizing unknown
    sensor nodes in WSN-based smart irrigation systems using estimated range measurements.
    The proposed method can accurately determine the positions of unknown nodes, even
    when they are located at a distance from anchors. It utilizes the Levenberg–Marquardt
    (LM) optimization algorithm to solve a nonlinear least-squares problem and minimize
    the error in estimating the unknown node locations. By leveraging the known positions
    of a subset of sensor nodes and the inexact distance measurements between pairs
    of nodes, the localization problem is transformed into a nonlinear optimization
    problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive simulations
    and experiments were conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed method
    achieves accurate localization of the unknown sensor nodes. Specifically, it achieves
    19% and 58% improvement in estimation accuracy when compared to distance vector-hop
    (DV-Hop) and semidefinite relaxation-LM (SDR-LM) algorithms, respectively. Additionally,
    the method exhibits robustness against measurement noise and scalability for large-scale
    networks. Ultimately, integrating the proposed localization method into the smart
    irrigation system has the potential to achieve approximately 28% reduction in
    water consumption.

    1. Introduction The global challenge of water scarcity is a pressing issue. Consequently,
    there is considerable emphasis on water consumption and irrigation management.
    Conventional agricultural irrigation involves a significant amount of water usage
    [1]. Hence, there is a growing need to explore smart agriculture approaches designed
    to diminish water consumption without compromising the quality of agricultural
    crops. Smart irrigation, driven by advancements in technology, holds great promise
    for optimizing water consumption and increasing crop productivity. One of the
    key technologies enabling smart irrigation is wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    [2]. These networks comprise spatially distributed sensor nodes that collect and
    transmit data on environmental conditions such as soil moisture, humidity, and
    temperature. In the context of smart irrigation systems, WSNs play a crucial role
    in monitoring and controlling these environmental parameters, facilitating efficient
    water usage and targeted crop management [3]. WSNs offer several advantages in
    the domain of smart irrigation. Firstly, they enable real-time and continuous
    monitoring of environmental variables, allowing farmers to receive decisions concerning
    irrigation schedules, fertilizer application, and pest management. This data-driven
    approach enhances precision irrigation practices by enabling tailored interventions
    at the individual plant level. Secondly, WSNs eliminate the need for manual data
    collection, reducing labor costs and improving operational efficiency. Additionally,
    WSNs provide a scalable and cost-effective solution, as they can be deployed over
    large agricultural areas, covering extensive farmlands [4,5,6]. Accurate localization
    of sensor nodes within the WSNs is crucial for achieving the desired precision
    and effectiveness of smart irrigation systems. Node localization is the process
    of identifying the physical positions of the sensor nodes within the network.
    Precise node localization enables spatially aware monitoring and control, allowing
    for targeted actions based on the specific conditions of different areas within
    the agricultural field [7,8]. For example, localized data on soil moisture levels
    can be utilized to implement irrigation strategies that precisely deliver water
    where and when it is needed, minimizing wastage and optimizing plant growth. The
    localization of sensor nodes in WSNs has been a subject of extensive research
    due to its critical role in various applications, including smart irrigation systems.
    Traditional localization techniques rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers
    or manual surveying methods, which may not be feasible or economical for large-scale
    deployments. Moreover, these methods often assume that the positions of all nodes
    are known or can be accurately measured. However, in practical scenarios, it is
    common to have a subset of nodes with known positions while the locations of other
    nodes remain unknown or imprecisely known [9,10]. The problem of localizing unknown
    nodes in WSNs has garnered significant attention due to its relevance in various
    applications [11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. In the context of smart agriculture, accurate
    localization of the unknown nodes allows for complete coverage and spatially aware
    decision-making. This capability permits precise and controlled water distribution
    to designated regions within agricultural fields. Through accurate identification
    of sensor node positions, the system adjusts irrigation strategies in response
    to real-time data, ensuring targeted water delivery at optimal times and locations.
    Such localization accuracy effectively minimizes water waste, mitigates the risk
    of over-irrigation, and facilitates customized irrigation scheduling. By estimating
    the coordinates of the unknown nodes based on their range measurements to anchor
    nodes with known positions, the overall network performance can be improved, resulting
    in more effective resource allocation and optimized irrigation strategies [18].
    In this paper, we address the challenge of localizing unknown sensor nodes in
    WSN-based smart irrigation systems. We propose a new localization method that
    can minimize the error in node localization. The proposed method utilizes multi-hop
    localization concept presented in [9] to accurately determine the positions of
    unknown nodes, even when they are located at a far distance from anchors. The
    range measurements are derived from the estimated distances between pairs of sensor
    nodes, typically obtained from received signal strength (RSS) measurements. By
    formulating the problem as a nonlinear least- squares optimization task, the proposed
    method leverages the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) optimization algorithm to reduce
    the error in estimating the node locations. Through extensive simulations and
    experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed
    method. The results highlight its potential for practical implementation in real-world
    smart irrigation applications, ultimately contributing to sustainable resource
    management and increased crop yields. The motivation behind this research is twofold.
    Firstly, accurate localization of all sensor nodes enables fine-grained monitoring
    and control, facilitating precise water allocation and targeted interventions
    in smart irrigation systems. Secondly, the localization method presented in this
    paper can be extended to various applications beyond smart irrigation, where the
    availability of accurate node positions is essential for efficient operation and
    decision-making. The key contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:
    Proposing a new localization method to localize unknown nodes in WSN-based smart
    irrigation systems using range measurements and the LM optimization algorithm.
    Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive simulations
    and experiments, highlighting accurate node localization amidst measurement noise
    and even when nodes are situated far from anchors. Highlighting the scalability
    of the proposed method for large-scale networks, showcasing its potential for
    practical implementation in real-world scenarios. Calculating the reduction in
    water consumption achieved through the implementation of the proposed localization
    method in the smart irrigation system. Table 1 provides a comprehensive list of

    the paper and suggests potential avenues for future research. 2. Related Work
    In this section, we provide a summary of the existing literature on node localization
    techniques in WSNs. Localization plays a crucial role in WSNs by enabling spatial
    awareness and precise monitoring in various applications, including smart irrigation
    systems. Numerous methods and algorithms have been proposed to address the node
    localization problem, aiming to achieve accurate and efficient localization results.
    We categorize the related work into three main approaches: range-based, range-free,
    and hybrid localization techniques [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. Range-based
    localization techniques rely on distance or range measurements between sensor
    nodes to estimate their positions [19,20,21,22]. The authors in [19] consider
    the RSS method for location identification. In [20], an unconventional localization
    method employing the least-squares method was presented. The localization of target
    nodes is achieved in [21] through the combined utilization of angle-of-arrival
    (AOA) and RSS measures. In [22] the authors use time-of-arrival (TOA), time-difference-of-arrival
    (TDOA), and the Chan algorithm to coordinate the unknown sensors. For instance,
    the well-known GPS is a range-based localization technique widely used in outdoor
    environments. However, GPS is not suitable for obstructed environments, making
    it less practical for smart irrigation systems. Moreover, equipping each sensor
    node with GPS receivers incurs significant expenses. Range-free localization techniques,
    on the other hand, do not rely on distance measurements but instead exploit connectivity
    information between sensor nodes to estimate their positions [23,24]. One common
    range-free approach is the centroid algorithm, which calculates the centroid of
    a set of anchor nodes to estimate the position of a target node [23]. Another
    range-free method is the distance vector-hop (DV-Hop) algorithm, which utilizes
    hop-count information and communication range to estimate distances between nodes
    [24]. These range-free techniques are often computationally efficient but may
    sacrifice localization accuracy compared to range-based methods. Hybrid localization
    techniques aim to combine the strengths of both range-based and range-free approaches
    to achieve more accurate and robust localization results [25,26]. These methods
    typically leverage both distance measurements and connectivity information. For
    instance, the iterative triangulation and trilateration (ITT) algorithm combines
    triangulation using distance measurements and trilateration using range-free connectivity
    information [25]. By leveraging the complementary nature of these two approaches,
    hybrid techniques can improve localization accuracy and overcome the limitations
    of individual methods [26]. The work in [9] proposes a regularized least-squares
    multi-hops localization algorithm specifically designed for WSNs. The algorithm
    aims to improve localization accuracy by incorporating both range-based and range-free
    localization techniques. The authors recognize the limitations of individual localization
    methods and propose a hybrid approach that integrates the advantages of range-based
    and range-free techniques. They introduce a regularization term to the least-squares
    optimization problem, which helps to mitigate errors and uncertainties in range
    measurements and connectivity information. By iteratively solving the optimization
    problem, the algorithm estimates the positions of unknown nodes based on the observed
    range measurements and connectivity information from neighboring nodes. While
    the work in [10] focuses on addressing the localization challenge in WSNs, our
    proposed approach complements this work by specifically targeting the localization
    of unknown sensor nodes in WSN-based smart irrigation systems. Our method leverages
    range measurements and the LM method to minimize localization errors and enable
    accurate positioning of the unknown nodes. Through extensive simulations and experiments,
    we showcase the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, contributing to
    the body of knowledge in localization techniques for smart irrigation applications.
    While various localization techniques have been proposed for WSNs, few studies
    specifically address the problem of localizing unknown nodes in the context of
    smart irrigation systems. The localization methods developed for smart irrigation
    systems often rely on known anchor nodes with GPS receivers or manual surveys.
    However, outfitting every sensor node with GPS receivers incurs significant costs.
    Moreover, in practical scenarios, the locations of some sensor nodes may be unknown
    or imprecisely known. This presents a unique challenge that requires specialized
    localization algorithms to estimate the positions of these unknown nodes. In this
    work, we propose a new method that addresses the challenge of localizing unknown
    sensor nodes in WSN-based smart irrigation systems. By utilizing range measurements
    and leveraging the LM optimization algorithm, our method aims to minimize the
    error in estimating the node locations. Through extensive simulations and experiments,
    we demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method, showcasing
    its potential for practical implementation in real-world smart irrigation applications.
    In the following section, we present the problem formulation and describe the
    mathematical framework for our proposed localization method. We then provide details
    on our approach, emphasizing the utilization of the LM algorithm for accurate
    node localization. 3. Proposed Localization Method A smart irrigation system based
    on WSNs presents a contemporary and forward-thinking approach to achieving efficient
    and sustainable irrigation practices. This system integrates a network of N sensors
    strategically positioned within the soil, plants, and environment to monitor and
    gather crucial data concerning soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and other pertinent parameters. Within our WSN, the locations of K sensor nodes
    are known, while the exact positions of the remaining M = N − K nodes are unknown.
    Nonetheless, we can overcome this challenge by employing a nonlinear least-squares
    approach to predict the locations of the unknown M nodes. The locations of these
    sensor nodes must be determined from the distances to nearby nodes (for example,
    estimated from the strength of signals received from those nodes). This section
    introduces the proposed method for localizing unknown sensor nodes in WSN-based
    smart irrigation systems using estimated range measurements. The proposed method
    effectively determines the positions of unknown nodes, even when they are distanced
    from anchors. The procedures of the proposed method are divided into two stages:
    the first stage is to formulate distance estimation into a nonlinear least-squares
    problem. Then, in the second stage, we apply the LM optimization algorithm to
    address this problem and minimize errors in estimating the unknown node locations.
    The next two subsections explain these procedures. 3.1. Nonlinear Least-Squares
    Problem Formulation The distance measurements can be represented by an undirected
    graph, as shown in Figure 1. In this figure, the number of vertices in the graph
    is N. The first M = N − K vertices represent the nodes with unknown positions.
    These nodes are denoted as the free nodes. The last K vertices are the nodes with
    known positions and are the anchor nodes. Figure 1. Network model example with
    9 anchor nodes (squares), 21 free nodes (circles), and 98 edges. The node coordinates
    are denoted as follows: 𝑝 1 =( 𝑥 1 , 𝑦 1 ),  𝑝 2 =( 𝑥 2 , 𝑦 2 ), …,𝑝 𝑁 =( 𝑥 𝑁
    , 𝑦 𝑁 ), (1) In Equation (1), the vectors p1, …, pN−K are the unknowns in the
    problem where the vectors pN−K+1, …, pN give the positions of the anchor nodes
    that are known. The RSS technique based on the radio propagation path loss model
    [27,28] is used to estimate the distance between a free node and an anchor node.
    The RSS in dBm within the log-normal shadow-fading model is expressed as [18]:
    RSS dBm ( 𝑑 𝑛𝑚 )= 𝑃 0 dBm ( 𝑑 𝑟 )−10𝛾 log 10 ( 𝑑 𝑛𝑚 𝑑 𝑟 )− 𝑆 𝜎 (2) where P0 represents
    the RSS at a reference distance dr, γ is the path loss exponent, dnm is the true
    distance between mth free node and nth anchor node, and Sσ denotes the log-normal
    shadowing effects, which follow a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and
    a variance of σ2. Using Equation (2), the estimated distance can be written as:
    𝑑 ̂  𝑛𝑚 = 𝑑 𝑟 log −1 10 ( 𝑃 0 dBm ( 𝑑 𝑟 )− RSS dBm ( 𝑑 𝑛𝑚 ) 10𝛾 ) (3) The edges
    in Figure 1 indicate the pairs of nodes for which a distance measurement is available.
    There are L edges, denoted by (i1, j1), …, (iL, jL). The L distance measurements
    are given as follows: 𝑑 𝑙 =‖ 𝑑 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑑 𝑗 𝑙 ‖+ 𝜀 𝑙 , 𝑙=1,2,…,𝐿 (4) where εl represents
    the measurement error. To estimate the location of the free nodes, we minimize
    the error function as follows: ∑ 𝐿 𝑙=1 (‖ 𝑑 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑑 𝑗 𝑙 ‖− 𝑑 𝑙 ) 2 = ∑ 𝐿 𝑙=1 (
    ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − −
    √ − 𝑑 𝑙 ) 2 (5) Equation (5) represents a nonlinear least-squares problem with
    variables x1, x2, …, xN−K and y1, y2, …, yN−K. Thus, we can conclude that our
    cost function f(u(l)) is as follows: 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )= ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙
    −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ − 𝑑 𝑙 (6) In Equation (4),
    we consider the points at the l-th iteration. As a result, utilizing the LM algorithm,
    we should try to minimize the following: ‖𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )+𝐷𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )(𝑢− 𝑢 (𝑙) )‖ 2
    + 𝜆 (𝑙) ‖𝑢− 𝑢 (𝑙) ‖ 2 (7) where D represents the Jacobian matrix, as explained
    in the next section, and λ is the regularization parameter. Thus, from our minimizing
    function in (6) and (7), the unknown positions can be formulated as a nonlinear
    least-squares problem. The solution of this problem is computed as follows: 𝑢
    ̂  = 𝑢 (𝑙) − ( 𝐴 𝑇 𝐴+ 𝜆 (𝑙) 𝐼) −1 𝐴 𝑇 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) (8) where I represents the identity
    matrix, (.)T is the matrix transpose, and 𝐴=𝐷𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) . The algorithm will continue
    to run until the termination condition is satisfied, which is: ∇𝑔( 𝑢 (𝑙) )=2 𝐴
    𝑇 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )≤ 10 −5 (9) 3.2. Levenberg–Marquardt Optimization Algorithm A crucial
    step in executing the LM algorithm involves the computation of the Jacobian matrix.
    Recall the definition of the Jacobian matrix, as follows: 𝐷𝑓(𝑧)= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢
    ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑑 𝑓 1 𝑑 𝑚 1 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 2 𝑑 𝑚 1 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 1 𝑑 𝑚 2 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 2 𝑑 𝑚 2 (𝑧) ⋮ ⋮ 𝑑 𝑓
    𝑛 𝑑 𝑚 1 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 𝑛 𝑑 𝑚 2 (𝑧) ⋯ ⋯ ⋱ ⋯ 𝑑 𝑓 1 𝑑 𝑚 𝑛 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 2 𝑑 𝑚 𝑛 (𝑧) ⋮ 𝑑 𝑓 𝑛 𝑑
    𝑚 𝑛 (𝑧) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (10) In the considered WSN, m1, m2, …, mn in (10)
    refer to x1, x2, …, xN−K and y1, y2, …, yN−K, with function f(z) defined in (6).
    It is clear that the matrix 𝐷𝑓(𝑧)∈𝕀 ℝ L×2(N−K) , as we have a row for each of
    the L edges, and we have 2(N − K) variables. Regarding the actual matrix entries
    themselves, there are four possible derivatives we could require in each row,
    with the rest of the entries in that row being 0. The four possible derivative
    expressions are listed in Equation (11): ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙)
    ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 )
    ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 √ −( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙
    ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 √ ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦
    𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 √ −( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 √ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥
    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (11) However, we can clearly notice that we have
    four possible conditions, as follows: both nodes are anchors, one of the two nodes
    are anchors (either the first node in the edge or the second node), and neither
    of the two nodes are anchors. In the following, we consider each condition separately.
    If the i-th edge contains nodes that are both anchors, the Jacobian matrix row
    is all zeros, since both variables are known (assuming points at the l-th iteration):
    ∇ 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑇 =[ 0 0 ⋯ 0 ] (12) If the i-th edge contains one anchor node,
    the Jacobian matrix row will contain the derivatives with respect to the unknown
    node, with the rest of the entries in that row being 0 (assuming points at the
    l-th iteration), node 2 as anchor: ∇ 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑇 =[ 0 0 ⋯ 0 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑
    𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 0 ⋯ 0 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 0 ⋯ 0 ] (13) Node 1 as anchor: ∇ 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑢 (𝑙) )
    𝑇 =[ 0 0 ⋯ 0 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 0 ⋯ 0 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 0 ⋯ 0 ] (14) The final
    condition among the four occurs if the i-th edge contains no anchor nodes, in
    which our Jacobian matrix row will contain the derivatives with respect to both
    of the unknown nodes (i.e., a potential of four non-zero elements in the row),
    all assuming points at the l-th iteration: ∇ 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑇 =[ 0 ⋯ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙)
    ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 ⋯ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ⋯ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 ⋯ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ⋯
    0 ] (15) The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm steps can be summarized as follows:
    Step 1: In each iteration of the algorithm, we first compute 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) , and
    then the Jacobian matrix 𝐷𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) row by row, with each row being evaluated
    for one of the four conditions described above. Step 2: Next, within the iteration,
    the code computes both ‖∇𝑔(𝑢)‖ and 𝑢 ̂  , in order to evaluate 𝑓( 𝑢 ̂  ) in comparison
    with 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) . Depending on this calculation, the algorithm updates u(l+1)
    and λ(l+1) as follows: 𝑢 (𝑙+1) = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨   𝑢 ̂  ,  𝑖𝑓  ‖𝑓( 𝑢 ̂  )‖ 2 < ‖𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙)
    )‖ 2 𝑢 (𝑙) , 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 (16) 𝜆 (𝑙+1) = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨   𝛽 1 𝜆 (𝑙)   𝑖𝑓  ‖𝑓( 𝑢 ̂  )‖ 2
    < ‖𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )‖ 2 𝛽 2 𝜆 (𝑙) ,    𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 (17) Step 3: If ∇𝑔( 𝑢 (𝑙) )=2 𝐴 𝑇 𝑓(
    𝑢 (𝑙) )≤ 10 −5 , then the algorithm will terminate out of the loop and return
    the calculated estimated coordinates of the unknown sensor nodes. Step 4: If the
    condition in step 3 is not satisfied, go to step 1. The following flow chart summarizes
    the proposed method steps and is indicated by Figure 2. Figure 2. Flow chart of
    the proposed method. 4. Results and Discussion In this section, MATLAB (R2022b)
    programming is used to execute the proposed method to predict the estimated coordinates
    of the unknown sensor nodes in the considered WSN. The algorithm will continue
    to run until the termination condition, ∇𝑔( 𝑢 (𝑙) )≤ 10 −5 , is satisfied. The
    first input argument N is the number of nodes in the network, and it varies according
    to the considered network scale. This includes K = 9 anchor nodes, positioned
    as in Figure 1. The N − 9 free nodes are placed randomly in a square area with
    size 100 × 100 m2. Two nodes are connected by an edge if their distance is less
    than or equal to normalized R. Figure 1 presents an example with N = 30 and the
    node communication range, R = 40 m. The first output argument E is an L × 2 array,
    specifying the L edges. The two entries of row l are il and jl, the nodes connected
    by edge l. The output argument is an N × 2 array with the coordinates of the N
    nodes. Typical values of β1 and β2 are β1 = 0.8 and β2 = 2. Table 2 summarizes
    the simulation parameters. Table 2. Simulation parameters. 4.1. Effect of Network
    Scale In this subsection, we study the effects of network scale on the performance
    of the proposed method. 4.1.1. Small-Scale Network We consider a small-scale network
    with N = 50 nodes, 9 of them are anchor nodes with known and fixed locations as
    follows: [(0, 0), (50, 0), (100, 0), (0, 50), (50, 50), (100, 50), (0, 100), (50,
    100), (100, 100)]. The free 41 nodes are placed randomly in a square area with
    size 100 × 100 m2. Figure 3 presents the estimation of the sensor coordinate using
    the proposed method. The open circles (blue) are the exact positions, while the
    filled circles (green) are the estimated positions. This figure indicates the
    accuracy of the proposed method in estimating the unknown location of the free
    nodes. Figure 3. Least-squares estimate of the sensor coordinate using N = 50.
    4.1.2. Medium-Scale Network In this part, we check the accuracy of the proposed
    method when increasing the number of network nodes to N =100 nodes. For fair comparison,
    we use 9 anchor nodes at the same location as in the small-scale case, i.e., there
    are 91 unknown free nodes. Figure 4 shows the estimated positions versus the exact
    positions, considering a medium-scale network (N = 100). This figure indicates
    the accuracy of the proposed method, even for a large number of free nodes. Figure
    4. Least-squares estimate of the sensor coordinate using N = 100. 4.1.3. Large-Scale
    Network Now we consider a large-scale network with N = 200 nodes, as shown in
    Figure 5. The obtained result in this figure ensures the ability of the proposed
    method to accurately estimate the position of the free nodes, even for a large-scale
    network. Figure 5. Least-squares estimate of the sensor coordinate using N = 200.
    Figure 6 presents the cost function versus number of iterations for the three
    network scenarios. As expected, the large-scale network requires the largest cost
    function compared to the other networks. Figure 6. Cost function versus number
    of iterations for 3 network scenarios. 4.2. Effect of Changing the Anchor Node
    Locations In this subsection, we study the effect of changing the position of
    the anchor nodes on the accuracy of position estimation using the proposed method.
    The 9 anchor nodes new location is located around the network center, as follows:
    [(20, 20), (50, 20), (80, 20), (20, 50), (50, 50), (80, 50), (20, 80), (50, 80),
    (80, 80)]. Figure 7 presents the least-squares estimate of the sensor coordinate
    using the three network scenarios considered above, i.e., N = 50 (a), 100 (b),
    and 200 (c). This figure indicates that the accuracy of the proposed method is
    affected by changing the anchor node’s location. However, the reduction in estimation
    accuracy is small, which ensures the robustness of the proposed method. The anchor
    node’s new location is around the network center; therefore, its accuracy becomes
    less than that at network boundaries. This figure also shows that as the number
    of free nodes increases from 50 to 200, the proposed method’s estimation accuracy
    decreases. Figure 7. Effect of changing the position of anchor nodes on the accuracy
    of the proposed method. (a) N = 50; (b) N = 100; (c) N = 200. 4.3. Performance
    Comparison In this subsection we compare the performance of the proposed method
    with other localization algorithms presented in the literature, such as improvement
    of the DV-Hop algorithm [9] and SDR+LM algorithm [9]. For fair comparison, we
    use the average localization error (ALE) presented in [10] and given as: ALE=
    ∑ 𝑁−𝐾 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 ̂  𝑖 − 𝑥 𝑖 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 𝑁−𝐾 − − − − − − − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − √ (18) where N − K represents the number of free nodes (unknown
    position nodes), ( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥𝑦 𝑖 ) and ( 𝑥 ̂  𝑖 , 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 ) are the exact and the
    estimated locations, respectively of node i. Figure 8 presents a comparison between
    the proposed method and the algorithms presented in [9,10] using the above-mentioned
    parameters and the large-scale network case. As explained above, the open circles
    (blue) are the exact positions, while the filled circles (green) are the estimated
    positions, and the black straight line that connects between the two circle types
    represents the positioning error. This figure indicates that the proposed method
    achieves the lowest localization error when compared to the other algorithms.
    Figure 8. Performance comparison between the proposed method (a), DV-Hop algorithm
    [9] (b), and SDR+LM algorithm [10] (c). In Figure 9, we study the effect of changing
    the number of anchor nodes on the accuracy of the location estimation of the proposed
    method. We consider the case of N = 200 nodes and R = 40. This figure presents
    the ALE versus the number of anchor nodes for the proposed method and the localization
    algorithms cited above [9,10]. Figure 9. ALE versus number of anchor nodes for
    the proposed method and the localization algorithms [9,10]. The depicted figure
    illustrates a clear trend wherein the ALE diminishes with an increase in the number
    of anchor nodes. This observation can be attributed to the deliberate augmentation
    of anchor nodes within the network, while keeping the total number of nodes constant.
    This augmentation is intended to reduce the hop count between the anchors and
    unknown nodes. As a result, the estimated distance between an anchor and an unknown
    node more accurately corresponds to the actual distance, leading to a decrease
    in the average positioning error. Additionally, the figure demonstrates that the
    proposed method yields a lower localization error compared to all other algorithms
    considered in the comparison. At a number of anchor nodes of 9, the proposed method
    achieves 19% and 58% improvement in estimation accuracy, respectively, when compared
    to the above-cited localization algorithms [9,10]. Where these algorithms estimate
    the positions of unknown nodes based on the observed range measurements and connectivity
    information from neighboring nodes, this reduces the estimation accuracy and increases
    the computational accuracy of these algorithms, while the proposed method is based
    on the LM estimation algorithm, which is more accurate than range-free localization
    algorithms. 4.4. Water Consumption Calculation Accurate sensor node localization
    is integral to the efficient functioning of a smart irrigation system and plays
    a crucial role in optimizing water consumption. In a smart irrigation network
    based on WSNs, precise knowledge of sensor node locations enables targeted and
    controlled water distribution to specific areas of agricultural fields. By accurately
    determining the positions of sensor nodes, the system can adapt irrigation strategies
    based on real-time data, ensuring that water is delivered precisely where and
    when it is needed. This localization precision minimizes water wastage, prevents
    over-irrigation, and allows for the implementation of tailored irrigation schedules.
    Consequently, the synergy between accurate sensor node localization and water
    consumption in a smart irrigation system leads to improved resource efficiency,
    reduced environmental impact, and sustainable agricultural practices. Due to the
    accuracy achieved by the proposed method, it is expected that smart irrigation
    with the proposed method can reduce the amount of water consumption when compared
    to other methods. The efficacy of irrigation relies on monitoring environmental
    conditions and plant requirements. This is due to the fact that plant water requirements
    are influenced by factors such as temperature, moisture levels, precipitation,
    and soil moisture. The values of these factors depend mainly on the accuracy of
    sensor node localization. Therefore, it is expected that the implementation of
    the smart irrigation system using the proposed method will result in a reduction
    in water consumption compared to alternative methods. Figure 10 illustrates a
    comparison among the methods examined in this paper concerning water consumption
    during one day for a small-scale network [1,29,30]. In this figure, we considered
    a pump with a capacity of 50 liters per hour, and the conventional irrigation
    system requires one hour for irrigation; therefore, it consumes 50 liters. On
    the other hand, the smart irrigation methods function four times a day, according
    to Figure 6 presented in [30], with different irrigation times, according to the
    considered method, as presented in Table 3 [1,29,30]. The analysis of the data
    was conducted utilizing SAS software [1] which determined the irrigation time
    for each irrigation method. This time represents the time during which the irrigation
    valve was on, according to the sensor reading. Figure 10. Water consumption comparison
    between the proposed method and the localization algorithms [9,10,30]. Table 3.
    Irrigation time and consumed water for the considered irrigation methods. As depicted
    in Figure 10, it becomes evident that the smart irrigation system employing the
    proposed method can substantially diminish the volume of water consumed in comparison
    to alternative methods. Specifically, it attains an impressive 28% reduction in
    irrigation water consumption when compared with the conventional irrigation technique.
    The accurate estimation of the sensor node positions ensures the delivery of water
    precisely where and when it is needed. In contrast, smart irrigation systems utilizing
    the DV-Hop algorithm [9], the SDR+LM algorithm [10], and the smart irrigation
    system without using localization method in [30] achieve approximately 20%, 14%,
    and 12% reductions, respectively, in the amount of water consumed when compared
    to the conventional irrigation technique. 5. Conclusions This paper addressed
    the challenge of localizing unknown sensor nodes in WSN-based smart irrigation
    systems, underscoring the pivotal role of accurate node localization for efficient
    monitoring and control. The proposed method, leveraging range measurements and
    the Levenberg–Marquardt optimization algorithm, emerged as a robust solution,
    minimizing errors in estimating the unknown node locations. Quantitative analysis
    revealed compelling results, showcasing the proposed method’s superior performance.
    Specifically, it achieved an impressive 19% and 58% enhancement in estimation
    accuracy compared to DV-Hop and SDR+LM localization algorithms, respectively.
    Extensive simulations and experiments across various network scales demonstrated
    not only the accuracy but also the scalability of the method, affirming its effectiveness
    even in large-scale scenarios. The numerical results unequivocally establish that
    the proposed method significantly improves estimation accuracy, substantiating
    its superiority over existing localization methods. This research provides concrete
    evidence of the method’s potential, emphasizing its practical applicability and
    potential for achieving a substantial 28% reduction in water consumption in smart
    irrigation systems where the accurate estimation of sensor node positions ensures
    the delivery of water precisely where and when it is needed. Future research includes
    exploring the influence of environmental factors on localization accuracy, integrating
    additional sensing modalities for enhanced precision, investigating scalability
    for larger networks, and developing energy-efficient algorithms to prolong network
    lifespan. Author Contributions All authors contributed equally. All authors have

    I. Introduction Crops and plants are prone to attack by various diseases and pests.
    These attacks are detrimental to the quality of crops produced and, subsequently,
    to the livelihood of the farmers. According to the literature, diseases, pests,
    and weeds contribute to 36% loss of crops [1]. The foremost cause of frequent
    plant diseases is a lack of supervision and monitoring. To overcome this challenge,
    advanced sensors based technology could be employed to install a supervision system
    in place. Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor technology is one of the leading
    solutions to monitor and keep track of the plant growth environment. Sensor signals
    along with machine learning algorithms have been shown to create robust disease
    detection and prediction systems [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. To abate crop loss due
    to diseases, researchers have proposed various disease warning systems. A few
    essential parameters for these models are leaf wetness duration (LWD), ambient
    temperature, and relative humidity [7], [8], [9]. The presence of water molecules
    on the surface of the leaves, paired with suitable ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, enables the germination of fungal diseases on the leaf canopy [10].
    Therefore, consistent measurement of LWD plays a crucial role in developing a
    sound disease prediction model. Researchers have explored various types of leaf
    wetness sensors (LWSs) out of which electronic LWS is deemed suitable for in situ
    measurements [10]. A lack of standard measurement practices has affected the in
    situ estimation of LWD values. In this work, an in-house affordable, temperature-compensated
    LWS has been used, which has been reported in our earlier works [11]. It highlights
    the key features of the novel LWS. The IoT-based sensor system enables remote
    sensing of the field parameters; thus, the system would work autonomously. The
    source of leaf wetness could be a valuable insight for predicting diseases. It
    would help farmers identify the cause of leaf wetness and enable them to take
    instant preventive measures. In a remote setting, the output from LWS can be used
    to determine the cause of moisture on the surface of the leaves. As suggested
    in [44], dew, rainfall, or irrigation are the plausible sources of wetness on
    the leaf canopy. In this work, these three causes of leaf wetness have been accounted
    for dew, rainfall, and irrigation. The LWS used in this work generates a frequency
    output corresponding to the presence of water on the leaf surface [44]. If water
    is present on the surface, the frequency declines from the baseline level and
    ascends again once the surface is dry [11]. As mentioned, each event produces
    a different frequency output when subjected to dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Therefore, the pattern generated through the frequency output of the LWS provides
    critical insight for detecting the source of wetness on the surface of leaves.
    Pattern recognition is a famous classification and detection technique. It is
    a process wherein the machine tries to classify the data according to the information
    gained from the regu- varieties observed in different types of data. There are
    several applications of pattern recognition like speech recognition, object identification,
    and classification of medical and explosive signals [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],
    [18]. In this work, pattern recognition has been explored for LWS data wherein
    the data points correspond to either dew, rainfall, or irrigation. Syntactic,
    template matching, and statistical models are used for pattern recognition [19].
    The rising popularity of neural networks (NNs) for feature extraction has driven
    researchers to explore NNs for pattern recognition [20]. NN is capable of feature
    extraction from numerical, image, and text-based datasets. Multilayer perceptrons
    (MLPs) are fully connected NN used for pattern recognition [21], [22], [23]. A
    class of NN called convolutional NN (CNN) is widely used for image classification
    [24], [25], [26], [27]. Networks like VGGNet [28], AlexNet [29], and GoogLeNet
    [30] are famous CNN structures used for pattern recognition from image datasets.
    In this work, an ensemble model is proposed, which takes the numerical and image
    data for classifying the source of wetness (dew, rainfall, or irrigation) on the
    plant. Based on the sensor data, this article aims to classify the leaf wetness
    events in one of the three categories: dew, rainfall, or irrigation. LWS data
    plays a crucial role in determining the source of leaf wetness. While the sensor
    produces time-series data, significant information can be extracted from the patterns
    observed in the frequency domain. Therefore, the time-series data has been converted
    to image form using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and spectrogram representation.
    In addition to LWS, the disease prediction system uses other sensors like ambient
    temperature and relative humidity sensors [11]. These sensors monitor the environmental
    conditions. Rainfall and dew are natural phenomena and are characterized by distinct
    environmental conditions. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Sensors System
    and Field Deployment In this work, the LWS and IoT-enabled system have been used,
    which is reported in [11]. Fabricated LWS produces frequency output when subjected
    to the water molecule on its sensing surface. Further, for the temperature and
    humidity measurements, commercial sensors MCP 9710 and HIH 5030 are used, respectively.
    Subsequently, these sensors are interfaced with the in-house developed signal
    conditioning and processing circuits. The data collected from these sensors are
    uploaded to the ThingspeakTM server every 30 min. For the field measurement, fabricated
    LWS was deployed on the Mango tree at 45° angles, as shown in Fig. 1. Further,
    the field measurements are carried out for four months where approximately 5000
    data points are collected. Fig. 1. Deployment of the sensor on the leaves. Show
    All SECTION III. Data Preprocessing The primary focus is to prepare the data for
    classifying the source of wetness on the leaf, which can arise mainly due to dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. This involves feature extraction to identify leaf wetness
    events caused by dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Further, data labeling is done
    for both numerical and image data. Numerical attributes are standardized and fed
    into the MLP model and subsequently image data is transformed into spectrograms,
    which are fed into the CNN model. Data augmentation techniques are applied to
    enhance dataset size and diversity. These processes collectively aim to facilitate
    the accurate classification of leaf wetness events in a dataset comprising 392
    instances of dew, rainfall, and irrigation events, which helps reduce overfitting
    and improve model accuracy. A. Feature Extraction The main objective of this work
    is to determine the cause of leaf wetness by analyzing the patterns generated
    by an LWS. Three distinct events, namely dew, irrigation, and rainfall, can make
    leaves wet. To apply a classification algorithm effectively, it’s crucial to isolate
    and extract these individual wetness events and create training and testing datasets.
    This is achieved by identifying specific points at the start and end of each event
    using the find_peaks function from the sciPy library. This function detects the
    highest values in a 1-D signal within a specified height range. Fig. 2 represents
    the signal with starting and ending points marked using orange and green colors.
    The resulting signal is then divided into separate events, leading to the creation
    of a dataset comprising 98 leaf wetness events, each marked by distinct starting
    and ending points. Fig. 2. Leaf wetness events marked with points. Show All B.
    Data Labeling 1) Tabular Data: In this work, a hybrid model is trained using both
    numerical and image data. Numerical data comprise data from sensors like ambient
    temperature sensors, relative humidity sensors, and LWS. Each wetness event is
    numerically characterized by four features, namely, LWD value, average ambient
    temperature, average relative humidity, and maximum magnitude of frequency. Average
    temperature and humidity values are calculated for the duration of each event,
    and the maximum magnitude of frequency is obtained from the output of LWS. LWD
    values are extracted from the frequency response of LWS after smoothening the
    signal. The procedure followed for calculating LWD values has been reported in
    our previous work [11]. The numerical features corresponding to a single-leaf
    wetness event vary broadly in magnitude. To avoid bias due to differences in the
    range of magnitude during the training process, the features are normalized using
    Minmaxscaler function available in scikit-learn library [33]. After normalization,
    all features would lie within a range of 0–1, eliminating any bias due to their
    magnitude. 2) Image Data: The dataset comprise individual frequency output responses
    corresponding to a particular event. To make it suitable for training a machine
    learning model, it has to be classified appropriately with the cause of the wetness.
    Three possible events are responsible for wetness on the leaves’ surface: dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. For ease of classification, the signal is inverted about
    the y-axis, such that a rise in the magnitude of frequency above baseline frequency
    marks the events. This is denoted by ( ΔF ) as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Isolated
    events from the frequency response of leaf wetness sensor corresponding to (a)
    dew, (b) rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All In this work, the time-series
    numerical data from LWS is transformed into image format to leverage the 2-D CNN
    model. CNN is one of the most popular NNs for image classification due to its
    high accuracy [34]. The signal is converted into the frequency domain from the
    time domain using an STFT to convert the numerical data for LWS into image form.
    STFT captures the signal’s frequency components over a small window length of
    256, which is the function’s default size, and tracks them across the duration
    of the signal. STFT of the frequency output of LWS has been computed using the
    scipy library [32]. In doing so, an attempt is made to capture the salient features
    of the patterns observed in the sensor output. These patterns are observed when
    the sensor detects the presence of water on the surface. Fig. 4 represents the
    spectrograms of STFT of the LWS sensor signals. It is evident from the spectrograms,
    as depicted in Fig. 4 that the intensity of frequency components differs for the
    different categories of events viz., dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Therefore,
    these spectrograms could be used for training a CNN-based classification model.
    The images are resized and converted to binary to assist the edge-detection capacity
    of CNN. Fig. 4. STFT spectrograms of leaf wetness sensor data for (a) dew, (b)
    rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All The frequency magnitude is the first indicator
    of the possible event that could have caused leaf wetness [44]. Leaf wetness due
    to dew is characterized by a frequency output response with a maximum magnitude
    less than or equal to 4 kHz. Therefore, all events for which the rise in frequency
    ( ΔF ) is less than or equal to 4 kHz are labeled “Dew.” Out of 98 leaf wetness
    events and 13 events for Dew have been obtained. Apart from considering the magnitude
    of the frequency output of LWS, to differentiate between the events due to irrigation
    and rain, a second parameter, LWD has been used. The events with a maximum magnitude
    of frequency greater than 10 kHz or LWD more than 19 h have been labeled as “Rain.”
    Subsequently, the rest of the events were labeled as “Irrigation.” From the given
    signal, 48 events due to rain and 37 events due to irrigation has been observed.
    Fig. 3 shows five signals, each corresponding to the three natural phenomena discussed
    above. The magnitude on the y -axis is under the criteria used to classify the
    events in the appropriate categories. C. Data Augmentation Data augmentation is
    a crucial strategy to prevent overfitting in NNs due to limited data. This study
    is critical because leaf wetness events are uncontrollable. Techniques like horizontal
    flipping and adding random Gaussian noise are applied to image data while preserving
    original patterns. Numerical data are also augmented with Gaussian noise. After
    using these techniques, the dataset grows from 98 to 392 leaf wetness events,
    enhancing the dataset’s size and robustness for machine learning purposes. SECTION
    IV. Proposed Model for Classification In this work, artificial neural network
    (ANN) is an attractive choice because it ensembles NNs that can be built to deal
    with different types of data at the same time. In this work, NN is devolved that
    is capable of learning both numerical data and image data simultaneously. The
    sub-model trained to learn numerical data is an MLP and that trained using the
    image data is a CNN. The model proposed in this work, has been implemented using
    the tensorflow library [36]. A. Multilayer Perceptron MLP is a class of feed-forward
    NNs with fully connected layers. It comprises input and output layers connected
    between multiple hidden layers. In this work, the MLP is supplied by four input
    features—LWD values, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity, and
    maximum magnitude of frequency observed for the event. As mentioned, the three
    types of layers in MLP have neurons responsible for propagating the information
    to the following layer. Fig. 5 shows a descriptive diagram of an MLP (sub-model
    1). The input features are supplied to the input layer. In this work, four features
    are used namely, LWD value, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity,
    and maximum magnitude of frequency. Let the input vector be represented by X i
    for i∈[1,4] . The input is passed on to the hidden layer. The output of the ith
    neuron in the lth hidden layer of MLP, y m [l]i , is the weighted summation of
    its input provided from the preceding hidden layer. The process is called forward
    propagation, accomplished by the following equation [23]: y m [l])i =F( ∑ i=1
    n−1 w m [l]i . a m [l−1]i + b m [l]i ) (1) View Source where w m (l)i and b m
    (l)i are the weight and bias of the neuron, respectively, and a m (l−1)i is the
    activated neuron from the previous layer. The function F(x) is the activation
    function assigned to each layer. For the hidden layers, it is a linear function
    called rectified linear unit (ReLu). This function maximizes the speed of training
    due to less computation and avoids the vanishing gradient problem [37]. In case
    of the input layer a m [l−1]i is replaced with X i . The output vector of MLP
    (sub-model 1) is denoted by Y m . Fig. 5. Proposed model for leaf wetness events
    classification. Show All B. Convolutional Neural Network A CNN was implemented
    for training the image data due to its superior image classification performance.
    CNN models learn by identifying the edges of the images during the training process.
    The convolutional layer is composed of 2-D filters, i.e., kernels, traverse over
    the entire image depending on the size of the kernel. The kernel is a 2-D weight
    matrix. The layer performs convolution of the filter and overlapping input and
    extracts the features of the given image. CNN follows the same process of forward
    propagation, as described in MLP, to transfer the information through the network
    layers. However, in this case, the input images of spectrograms are convolved
    with the filters. It is a multiplication operation on the 2-D input matrices,
    i.e., image and kernel. The following equation defines the convolutional process
    [45]: y c [l]u,v =F( ∑ i=0 p−1 ∑ j=0 q−1 w c [l]i,j . a c (l−1)(u+i),(v+j) + b
    c [l]u,v ). (2) View Source y c (l)u,v is the output of the lth convolutional
    layer at the (u,v) position. The variables w c [l]i,j and a c [l−1](u+i),(v+j)
    are the kernel and input image, respectively. Here, the dimension of the kernel
    is (p×q) . The activation function, F(x) , for intermediate layers is ReLu [37].
    Furthermore, a max-pooling layer is used to prevent over-fitting. The data is
    down-sampled by replacing the output of the convolutional layer with the maximum
    value observed in a particular neighborhood. The MaxPooling2D layer from tensorflow
    implements the max-pooling function [36]. A window of size 3×3 with a stride of
    2 is employed. This operation reduces the dimensions of the data and makes the
    computation much more efficient. An additional layer was added to ensure an effective
    learning process called batchnormalization. The principal objective of this method
    is to normalize the input to the following layer. The batch normalization layer
    from the tensorflow library is added to the model to ensure that the inputs are
    normalized and smooth and that the learning does not suffer due to bias toward
    a specific input owing to nonuniform distribution. Y c denotes the output vector
    of CNN (sub-model 2). C. Training the Hybrid Model The main advantage of the dataset
    collected in this work is data availability from various sensors. While the pattern
    observed in the frequency output of LWS directly corresponds to identifying the
    event that caused wetness on the leaves, the other sensors measuring ambient temperature
    and relative humidity offer critical insights into the environmental conditions
    when the leaf wetness event occurred. These environmental factors could assist
    the model in making a decision. As discussed in Section III-A, the sensor data
    is preprocessed and organized in tabular format. The patterns observed in the
    LWS data are converted to images, as discussed in Section III-B. Fig. 5 illustrates
    the model used to predict the leaf wetness event. The tabular and image data are
    processed parallelly using the first two sub-models. Sub-model 1 is a multilayer
    perceptron described in Section IV-A. It has three hidden layers, each activated
    using a ReLu function. Sub-model 2 is a CNN, as Section IV-B describes, with two
    convolutional and max-pooling layers and a final batch-normalization layer. The
    convolutional layers are activated using the ReLu activation function. The output
    of the two sub-models is concatenated and provided as to the standard NN. The
    connected outcomes can be represented as C=[ Y m , Y c ] T . (3) View Source The
    input passes through the model via forward propagation as described in (1) and
    (2), depending on the sub-model. The two sub-models are responsible for feature
    extraction from the original data received from the sensors. The NNs are adept
    at feature extraction because of their densely connected structure [22]. The sub-model
    outputs are concatenated into a single vector and used further for training. The
    final sub-model denoted in Fig. 5 is responsible for the predictions. The outcome
    of the NN ensemble is obtained from the last layer of the final sub-model. It
    has three neurons corresponding to each leaf wetness event—dew, rainfall, and
    irrigation. The output is the probability of occurrence of the event based on
    the input features. This output is achieved by applying “softmax” as the activation
    function to the output layer [38]. The process finds the normalized exponential
    value for each class σ( c o )= e c o ∑ N j=1 e c j . (4) View Source In the above
    equation, c o is the output value of a neuron for a particular class. The exponential
    divided by the exponential of every neuron in the output layer. Thus, (4) calculates
    the probability of occurrence of one of the events. The model is trained by back-propagation.
    The method aims to minimize the cost function of the prediction by reassigning
    weights. The cost function chosen for training this model is “categorical cross-entropy”
    which is suitable for multiclass classification [38]. In the multiclass category,
    the events belong to only one of the possible classes. The following equation
    represents the loss function: Loss=− ∑ o=1 3 t o log( y o ) (5) View Source where
    t o is the class’s true value, and y o is the predicted probability from the output
    layer, which uses the softmax function. The model has been trained for 200 epochs
    with a batch size of 32 because of the small size of the dataset. This combination
    would converge to a loss value faster. The optimizer used is Adam because of its
    superior performance [39]. Fig. 5 shows the complete ensemble model used in this
    work. SECTION V. Result and Discussion A. Exploratory Data Analysis This section
    uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize data trends. A pie chart in
    Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of leaf wetness causes, showing that rainfall
    is the most common (about half of the events), followed by irrigation (37.8%)
    and dew (13.3%). The June to October 2021 study aligns with the monsoon season,
    explaining the prevalence of rain-induced leaf wetness. Fig. 6. Pie chart distribution
    of leaf wetness events. Show All B. Model Performance The experiments are conducted
    for various hidden layers and neurons, and it has been found that the best accuracy
    achieved is around 96.13% for the ensemble model. Both model sub-model 1 (MLP)
    and sub-model 2 (CNN) were combined with another NN (final sub-model). As a result,
    the hidden layers are changed and neurons in sub-model 1, sub-model 2, and the
    final sub-model. It has been found that the best layers and neurons are three
    layers and 30-24-16 neurons for sub-model 1, four layers, and 128-64-24-12 neurons
    for sub-model 2 and four layers and 30-24-16 neurons for the final sub-model.
    Table I displays a comparison of many models. The recommended model outperformed
    several techniques in Table I, with an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE I Comparison
    of Different Models As mentioned in Section IV-C, the ensemble model is trained
    for 200 epochs with a batch size of 32. Fig. 7(a) and (b) shows the training and
    validation accuracy and loss for the proposed model. In this work, the proposed
    model architecture learns from a combination of numerical data and image data.
    The MLP is responsible for learning the numerical tabular data, while the CNN
    learns the image data, as described in Section IV. Fig. 7(b) demonstrates the
    characteristic decline of the loss curve, which validates the learning process.
    The steady decline of the loss curve for validation data indicates learning and
    the absence of overfitting by the model. From Fig. 7(b), it can be observed that
    the ensemble model converges the fastest to the lowest loss value. Fig. 7. (a)
    Model accuracy, (b) cross-entropy loss, and (c) ROCs for dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Show All Fig. 7(c) shows the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). This curve
    gives information about the classification capability of the trained model. The
    45° reference line shown in Fig. 7(c) denotes a model incapable of differentiating
    between positive and negative outputs. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) graph
    is a point where the true positive rate (TPR) is 1 and the false positive rate
    (FPR) is 0. A good ROC curve is closer to the top left corner and away from the
    45° line. Fig. 7(c) shows three ROC curves, one for each of the classes- dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. The AUC is an insightful indicator of the model performance.
    AUC measures the model’s capability to differentiate between the classes. In this
    work, the AUC for dew, rainfall, and irrigation is 0.99, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively.
    The output layer of the NN ensemble described in Section IV uses softmax activation
    function which produces a probability of each possible outcome. These probabilities
    are converted to absolute values of 0 or 1, where 0 indicates negative output
    and 1 indicates a positive output. Further, the precision and recall have been
    calculated as tabulated in Table II. Precision is the fraction of predicted positive
    values, which are actually positive the following equation. On the other hand,
    recall is the fraction of actually positive values that have been correctly predicted
    the following equation [43]: Precision Recall = (True Positive) (True Positive+False
    Positive) = (True Positive) (True Positive+False Negative) . (6) (7) View Source
    TABLE II Evaluation Metrics for Classification of Dew, Rainfall, and Irrigation
    Table II gives the precision and recall values for all the events, along with
    the F1 score. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It measures
    the model’s performance, accounting for the trade-off between precision and recall.
    From Table III, it can be observed that the version of the model is suitable for
    all the events. Slightly less memory is observed for dew. However, it is due to
    the limited number of samples. The average value of the F1 score is 0.8396, which
    signifies a good balance between precision and recall. The significance of a high
    F1 score is that the model can correctly identify the positive data samples. Table
    III presents a comparison of various ensemble models across different applications.
    Researchers have employed the CNN-LSTM model for applications in medical, robotics,
    pedestrian navigation, and e-commerce, while the Darknet19-CNN-LSTM model has
    been utilized for computer vision tasks. In this work, the MLP-CNN model has been
    adopted for agricultural applications and achieved an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE
    III Comparison of Different Ensemble Models for Different Applications SECTION
    VI. Conclusion Agriculture plays a pivotal role in a country’s economy and methods
    to make it more efficient should be devised. In this work, with the motivation
    of reducing the cost of early plant disease prediction systems, the leaf wetness
    sensor is used to detect the LWS and also the source of wetness on the leaf canopy.
    For this purpose, the data is collected from LWS, ambient temperature sensor,
    and relative humidity sensor. The initial preprocessing and data engineering helped
    us create a dataset that could be used to train a machine-learning model capable
    of predicting the natural event responsible for leaf wetness. The sensors produced
    numerical time series data indicative of the three leaf wetness events- dew, rainfall,
    and irrigation. STFT is applied to the LWS data to obtain an image since the patterns
    obtained in the sensor output for different events are different. Further, an
    MLP-CNN model is built, which is capable of learning from tabular data as well
    as image data simultaneously. The MLP with numerical data produced a satisfactory
    accuracy of 92.86% while the CNN model with image data produced an accuracy of
    62.93% and the ensemble NN (MLP-CNN) classifier produced an accuracy of 96.13%.
    It has been observed that the final model classified the leaf wetness events with
    an average precision and recall of 0.84 and 0.85, respectively. Authors Figures

  description: Canopy temperature in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and other crops is
    related to crop and soil water status. Multiple approaches have been used to measure
    canopy temperature, depending on the application of the data and available technology.
    Recent technological advances have made it possible to map canopy temperature
    using thermal cameras onboard unmanned aerial systems (UAS) at fine spatiotemporal
    resolution. Using a highly accurate UAS-mounted infrared camera, the objective
    of this study was to determine relationships of in-season cotton canopy temperature
    with seed cotton yield and soil moisture. This was accomplished in a two-year
    field study (2019 and 2020) with three irrigation (0, 40, and 80% ET replacement)
    and eight cotton variety treatments. Four in-season UAS flights were made per
    year. Using the approach described herein, it was possible to accurately exclude
    soil background information in thermal infrared orthomosaics using a simple threshold
    method without the need for ancillary imagery. This allowed accurate determination
    of average canopy temperatures across plots. Differences in canopy temperature
    and seed cotton yields across irrigation levels were largely aligned and, when
    comparing cotton varieties, there was evidence that canopy temperature identified
    subtle varietal differences that were not reflected in varietal yield differences.
    Overall, there were linear relationships between canopy temperature and seed cotton
    yield that ranged from weak to strong (R2 = 0.39 – 0.72, RMSE = 249.7 – 299.2
    kg ha−1), depending on growing conditions. Canopy temperature was generally correlated
    with soil volumetric water content (VWC), but the relationship was not consistently
    strong and depended on moisture sensor depth.

    water content 1. Introduction Water-use efficiency and drought tolerance are key
    traits for crop improvement, especially as pressure on available water resources
    continues to increase and the climate becomes more unpredictable. Climate projections
    for the Southern Great Plains region of the United States, for example, indicate
    that conditions in the second half of the 21st century will be drier than the
    most arid times in the last millennium [1]. Increasing water efficiency in irrigated
    systems and leveraging data to improve irrigation management decisions is similarly
    important, but it is necessary to account for both spatial and temporal variability
    in soil moisture caused by factors such as soil texture and uneven irrigation
    application. While mapping soil physical characteristics has become simpler through
    technologies such as electromagnetic induction sensing [[2], [3], [4]], mapping
    soil moisture at both fine spatial and temporal resolutions during the growing
    season is less practical. However, canopy temperature is closely related to both
    crop and soil water status [5] and advances in technology have made it possible
    to map canopy temperature using thermal cameras onboard unmanned aerial systems
    (UAS) at fine spatiotemporal resolution. The main crop physiological process that
    drives variability in canopy temperature is transpiration. Water is pulled from
    the xylem into the leaf mesophyll, evaporates into the air spaces within the leaf,
    and then diffuses out of the leaf through the stomatal pores [6]. For water to
    be taken up by roots and transported through the xylem to leaves, plants must
    maintain a transpirational water potential gradient and turgor pressure within
    cells. Transpiration provides a cooling effect for plants via the evaporation
    of water from the leaf surfaces. Water deficit stress induces stomatal closure,
    which limits transpirational water loss and reduces evaporative cooling [7]. This
    causes leaf temperatures, and thus canopy temperature, to increase relative to
    an unstressed, actively transpiring plant. Water stress and heat stress together
    can increase canopy temperature substantially, which can cause many adverse reactions
    in the plant and limit production [6]. Researchers have shown that infrared thermography
    can be useful for precision agriculture and more specifically for precision irrigation
    management [8]. Spatial variability of canopy temperature is closely related to
    irrigation management practices, irrigation application uniformity, and more directly
    to water deficit within the effective rooting zone of plants [9,10]. Infrared
    thermography also has potential advantages over gas-exchange measurements in plant
    phenotyping studies where stomatal responses are important [11], as canopy temperature
    measurements are not labor intensive [12]. Canopy temperature has performed similarly
    to multispectral vegetation indices for grain and lint yield estimation in different
    crops [13,14]. Canopy temperature is also strongly correlated to traits such as
    water use efficiency and leaf water potential, and is used to derive indices of
    water stress such as the Crop Water Stress Index or CWSI [8]. Thermal imagery
    could also be applied for disease detection, mapping soil properties, tillage
    mapping, drainage tile mapping, crop maturity mapping, and leaf water potential
    mapping [15,16]. Crop canopy temperature data is currently derived using several
    approaches, some of which have limitations for use in precision agriculture management
    or cultivar development. Terrestrial thermal data from satellite platforms such
    as Landsat is freely available, for example, but the spatial and temporal resolutions
    (e.g. 100 m and 16 days for Landsat 8) are currently too coarse for use in irrigated
    agriculture at commercial scales or in plant breeding programs [10]. Researchers
    have endeavored to capture canopy temperature more frequently and accurately by
    placing infrared thermometers (IRTs) directly in the field, putting them on ground-based
    phenotyping systems, or mounting them onto center pivot and linear irrigation
    systems [[17], [18], [19], [20]]. Field-based IRTs have spatial limitations, they
    present logistical challenges in the field, and they are expensive, especially
    if a large number of sensors (or points of measurement) is needed. When IRTs are
    mounted on irrigation systems, the system must be in operation to map canopy temperature
    and the measurements are susceptible to the effects of soil background prior to
    canopy closure. Canopy temperature measurements by ground-based phenotyping systems
    can likewise be affected by ground temperature in certain circumstances and are
    limited by the need for navigation on the field. Canopy temperature and indices
    derived from thermal data can overestimate water stress due to the influence of
    much warmer soil temperatures combining with cool crop temperatures [17,10]. Measuring
    crop canopy temperature by infrared thermography via UAS can be used to overcome
    many of the challenges and limitations presented by other approaches. But infrared
    thermography captured by an aerial system has suffered from the adverse influence
    of soil background. This is especially true early in the growing season when canopy
    cover is low and in dryland production systems in which the canopy never completely
    covers the ground [[15], [21], [22], [23]]. Researchers have tried to address
    this issue by also measuring a multispectral vegetation index to account for canopy
    cover in modeling endeavors [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28]]. While this improved
    water deficit stress detection with thermal imagery, removing soil background
    altogether was identified early as the ideal solution [5]. Drew et al. [29] developed
    a method to isolate crop canopy from thermal images by using a visible camera
    to distinguish between soil background and crop canopy. This technique may be
    useful if certain thermal cameras are used that have an integrated color camera,
    but thermal infrared cameras with dedicated sensors alone are typically more sensitive
    to subtle variations in temperature and therefore can more accurately distinguish
    canopy and soil. Scientists have begun investigating machine learning for leveraging
    rich datasets captured from UAS, but few researchers use techniques such as support
    vector machines or random forests to detect crop water stress [30]. While UAS
    now enable the collection of thermal imagery at unprecedented spatial resolutions
    that are fine enough to allow removal of soil background, few have explored techniques
    to accomplish this in row-cropping systems without ancillary data sources. Literature
    exploring cotton yield estimation with thermal imagery is also sparse. Therefore,
    the objectives of this study were to: 1) evaluate unmanned aerial infrared thermography
    for detecting differences in crop water stress across irrigation regimes and cotton
    varieties; 2) explore the relationship between UAS-derived canopy temperature
    and cotton yield across irrigation regimes and cotton varieties; and 3) examine
    the relationship between soil moisture and UAS-derived canopy temperature. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Study site This experiment was conducted in 2019 and
    2020 on a subsurface drip irrigated field at the Texas A&M University research
    farm near College Station, TX (30.550° N, 96.436° W). The field was managed with
    conventional tillage during this period and for more than 10 years prior to beginning
    the project. Belk clay, which is a fine, mixed, active, thermic Entic Hapluderts,
    is the prevailing soil type at the site [31]. The slope of the field is less than
    1 percent. The climate classification is humid subtropical and average annual
    precipitation is 1018 mm [32]. Weather data was collected on-site from a weather
    station located directly adjacent to the study field. Daily averages were used
    in subsequent calculations. 2.2. Experimental design and cultural practices The
    experimental layout was a completely randomized 3 × 8 factorial design with four
    replications. The first factor was irrigation rate, managed as a percentage of
    estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) requirement, with three levels: 80% (irrigated),
    40% (deficit-irrigated), and 0% (dryland). Data logged by the on-site weather
    station was used to estimate ETc requirements based on the FAO-56 method described
    by Allen et al. [33] and the growth stage-based coefficients for cotton published
    by Ko et al. [34]. Cotton variety was the second factor. Eight commercially available
    varieties were planted per growing season in April into four-row plots with 1
    m row spacing that were 12 m in length. Cotton was planted at 129,000 seeds ha−1
    to ensure crop production and yield were not limited by plant population density
    [35]. Seedbeds were prepared in December or January for planting each season.
    Cultural practices were similar between the two growing seasons. Weed control
    strategies included pre-emergence herbicide and glyphosate applied over-the-top
    when needed. Urea-ammonium nitrate fertilizer (32-0-0) was band-applied via knives
    at squaring in 2019 and prior to planting in 2020. To limit rank growth in 2019,
    mepiquat chloride was applied at the labeled rate. Chemical defoliants were applied
    at the end of September when the cotton reached approximately 60% open boll. During
    the first week of October each season, the two center rows of the four-row plots
    were harvested with a 2-row spindle picker. The picker was retrofitted with a
    scale inside the basket to measure seed cotton yield mass. Cotton stalks were
    destroyed with a flail shredder following harvest, and the residue was later incorporated
    by means of vertical tillage. 2.3. Soil volumetric water content Soil volumetric
    water content (VWC) data was collected continuously for one cotton variety, NexGen
    5700, with time domain reflectometry sensors (Model CS655, Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT). The sensors were placed near the center of two replicate NexGen 5700
    plots for each irrigation treatment at 15 cm and 30 cm soil depths. The sensors
    were placed at these depths because plant soil water extraction was expected to
    be active in this zone [36]. The number of sensors that were deployed was few
    due to equipment limitations. These sensors were installed on June 7 in 2019 and
    June 8 in 2020 and connected to a Campbell CR1000x datalogger with a 1 min scan
    interval and 15 min average. Only the VWC measurements logged during each UAS
    flight were used for further analysis. The VWC data collected over each UAS flight
    period was averaged and regressed (simple linear regression) against average canopy
    temperature determined by UAS from the same time. The VWC sensors were removed
    from the field prior to chemical defoliation. 2.4. Unmanned aerial system and
    image acquisition An ICI 8640P thermal infrared camera (Infrared Cameras Incorporated,
    Beaumont, USA) was used in the study. This camera represents some of the most
    advanced and accurate thermal camera technologies currently available. The thermal
    camera was attached to a DJI Matrice 600 Pro hexacopter (SZ DJI Technology Company
    Limited, Shenzhen, China) on a Gremsy H3 gimbal (Gremsy, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam)
    to maintain nadir view during flight (Fig. 1). The ICI 8640P camera had a 640
    × 512 radiometric imager that produced 14-bit thermal imagery for the spectral
    range between 7 and 14 μm. The sensor is a microbolometer with a sensitivity of
    0.02 °C at 30 °C and requires less than a Watt of operating power. The camera,
    which has a 12.5 mm manual focus lens with 50° by 37.5° field of view, was focused
    by hand on the ground using a laser rangefinder to position a photogrammetric
    target at the appropriate distance (40 m). The focusing ring was permanently marked
    to ensure the camera was correctly focused prior to each flight. Using UgCS flight
    control software (UgCS Integrated Systems, Riga, Latvia), photogrammetry missions
    were flown at approximately 40 m above ground level (AGL) to produce a 5 cm ground
    sampling distance. Four flights were conducted in 2019 on July 9, July 25, August
    12, and August 22. Four flights were conducted in 2020 on July 3, July 16, August
    4, and August 18. Download : Download high-res image (551KB) Download : Download

    Incorporated 8640p thermal infrared camera attached to a Gremsy H3 gimbal. The
    gimbal mount includes a rubber damping system to isolate any vibration produced
    by the hexacopter. Temperature-controlled reference targets made of aluminum plates
    with dimensions of about 60 × 60 cm were prepared in the scene before each flight
    for calibration purposes [37,38]. One reference target was heated for the high
    temperature reference (50 °C), while the other was cooled to serve as the low
    temperature reference (20 °C). Temperature was measured with nine thermistors
    distributed evenly across each reference plate and average temperatures during
    the flight were used for calibration. Optimal weather, defined as sunny conditions
    and minimal wind between about 12:30 and 14:30 (near solar noon), were chosen
    for flight times to ensure the best possible image quality capture. Permanent
    ground control points were installed with concrete footers and surveyed using
    a Reach RS+ Global Navigation Satellite System receiver (Emlid Limited, Hong Kong,
    China) with Trimble VRS real-time kinematic corrections (Trimble Navigation Limited,
    Sunnyvale, USA). 2.5. Image processing and analysis After each flight, raw 16-bit
    TIFF images were exported using ICI proprietary software. Orthorectified mosaics
    were generated using structure from motion photogrammetry (Pix4D S.A., Prilly,
    Switzerland). As described in detail by Han et al. [37], the heated and cooled
    temperature reference targets were identified in the orthomosaics and paired with
    their measured temperatures to build a linear regression model relating the thermal
    image digital numbers to measured temperature references. The equation from this
    regression was used to apply a radiometric calibration to produce a final orthomosaic
    with surface temperature in degrees Celsius. A threshold temperature was then
    selected for each orthomosaic using the bimodal temperature data histogram of
    all temperatures within the orthomosaic. Canopy temperatures were separated from
    soil temperatures by identifying the minimum or trough centered between the two
    local maxima (peaks) in the bimodal distribution. All pixels above the temperature
    threshold, which essentially represented the maximum canopy temperature in the
    orthomosaic, were set to a null value using ArcMap (ESRI, Redlands, USA). To confirm
    the threshold was accurate, the new image was displayed over a natural-color composite
    to ensure it matched the canopy area. This effectively removed soil background
    data from the surface temperature mosaics. Finally, a single canopy temperature
    for each plot was derived by averaging the temperatures within the plot vector
    boundaries. Fig. 2 is a flow chart that outlines the entire generalized workflow.

    workflow. Cool temperatures are represented by blue colors, while red colors indicate
    warm temperatures. 2.6. Data analysis Linear regression analysis was conducted
    in R Studio [39] to examine the relationship between canopy temperature and yield,
    and between canopy temperature and soil moisture for eight UAS flight dates over
    the two-year study. All available canopy temperature data within each year was
    also analyzed with multiple regression using the R leaps package [40], which returned
    the model with the highest Adjusted R2 value. The exhaustive search method included
    all possible subsets and was configured to select a maximum of three predictors.
    Linear models were evaluated using R2, root mean squared error (RMSE), and normalized
    RMSE (NRMSE). The NRMSE was calculated by dividing RMSE by mean yield and multiplying
    by 100. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of yield and canopy temperature was conducted
    in R Studio. Post-hoc means comparisons were made using Tukey''s Honestly Significant
    Difference. In addition to the time of UAS flights, heat units were also calculated
    to account for seasonal weather variation and to provide a more universal and
    physiological basis for analysis. Daily heat units were calculated using on-site
    ambient temperature and the development threshold temperature of 15.6 °C [41]
    using the following equation: 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Isolation and measurement
    of crop canopy temperature Using the approach described herein, soil background
    information was accurately excluded in UAS-derived thermal infrared orthomosaics
    using a simple threshold method without the need for ancillary imagery. This allowed
    direct and accurate non-contact determination of average canopy temperatures.
    Fig. 3 illustrates the results of this approach through a canopy temperature image
    overlaid onto natural color composite. The image shows the high temperature resolution
    and georeferencing accuracy of the approach. This method allowed for comparison
    of irrigation and cotton variety treatments in this study and the approach could
    be used in a wide variety of other agricultural and non-ag applications also.

    treatment effects on canopy temperature There were differences in seed cotton
    yield among irrigation treatments in both 2019 and 2020 (Table 1). There were
    also differences in canopy temperature among irrigation treatments on all flight
    dates in both years. Pairwise statistical comparisons of canopy temperature largely
    matched yield results among irrigation treatments, with some exceptions during
    earlier flights (Table 2). In 2020 the irrigated and deficit-irrigated treatments
    were not different early in the growing season (3 July and 16 July) when less
    than 1000 heat units had accumulated. In 2019, the deficit-irrigated treatment
    was not different than either the irrigated or dryland treatments at 774 heat
    units (9 July) and the deficit-irrigated and dryland treatments were not different
    at 989 heat units (25 July). This was likely due to rainfall during the previous
    two weeks that largely negated the need for irrigation in the deficit-irrigated
    treatment. Canopy temperature always differed among irrigation treatments for
    the flights conducted later in the season in August, as early as 1154 heat units.
    The irrigated cotton always had the lowest mean canopy temperatures, the dryland
    treatment had the highest canopy temperatures, and the deficit irrigated temperatures
    were generally moderate. These trends were noticeable in canopy temperature plots
    separated by irrigation treatment for the flight on 4 August 2020 (Fig. 4). Table

    Box and whisker plot of canopy temperature separated by irrigation treatment on
    4 August 2020 or 1154 heat units. Interestingly, there were differences among
    cotton varieties in seed cotton yield in 2019 and not in 2020, while there were
    differences detected among varieties in canopy temperature in 2020 but not in
    2019 (Table 1). Because there were differences in canopy temperature in 2020,
    only that data is presented (Table 3). Pairwise means comparisons showed that
    several cotton varieties had different canopy temperatures at two flight dates,
    both in August, despite the lack of differences in final yield. Varieties with
    cooler canopy temperatures also generally had greater yields, though not statistically
    greater (Table 3). The incongruity between the two datasets could be the result
    of physiological adaptations of the cotton varieties that allowed recovery from
    water deficit or related heat stress while minimizing yield loss. When screening
    for traits related to drought tolerance, Thorp et al. [42] similarly found significant
    differences in crop water use efficiency estimates (yield divided by amount of
    water consumed) among varieties derived from UAS multispectral remote sensing
    and noted that incorporating canopy temperature could improve the methodology.
    Results suggest that canopy temperature could be used to target labor-intensive
    data collection efforts such as plant gas exchange measurements, which are sensitive
    to the severity of crop drought stress [43]. Table 3. Means and statistical results

    and canopy temperature There were strong negative linear relationships between
    canopy temperature and yield in 2019 and 2020 (Table 4). Cotton plots with cooler
    canopy temperatures had higher yields, while plots with hotter temperatures had
    reduced yields. The linear regression models with canopy temperature from a single
    flight date in each year had R2 values that ranged from 0.39 to 0.72 with a RMSE
    of 249.7 to 299.2 kg/ha. For example, data from 16 July 2020 or 897 heat units
    is shown in Fig. 5. Thompson et al. [44] and Adams et al. [17] found similarly
    strong relationships between cotton yield and canopy temperature across irrigation
    treatments measured with IRTs mounted on proximal phenotyping systems. The best
    subset multiple regression model in 2019 included canopy temperature at 774 heat
    units (July 9) and 1237 heat units (August 12) and had an adjusted R2 = 0.57 and
    RMSE of 372.7 kg/ha (NRMSE = 15.2%). The best subset multiple regression model
    for 2020 had an adjusted R2 = 0.72 and RMSE of 250.1 kg/ha (NRMSE = 19.2%) and
    included canopy temperature from 709 to 897 heat units (July 3 and July 16). Both
    best subsets models included two independent variables (i.e. canopy temperature
    from two dates). Using a similar multiple regression approach to estimate cotton
    yield using UAS data, Siegfried et al. [38] investigated integration of in-season
    thermal data with multispectral indices and a “Boll Area Index” that was measured
    at maturity. They demonstrated that stronger correlations and lower error could
    be achieved by integrating multiple data types (i.e. thermal, spectral indices,
    and pixel classification techniques) into the model compared to multiple instances
    (i.e. flight dates) of the same data type. Table 4. Simple linear and multiple

    relationship between canopy temperature and seed cotton yield on 16 July 2020
    or 897 heat units. Plots with cooler canopy temperatures tended to produce higher
    yields; conversely, plots with warmer temperatures tended to yield lower. While
    the error in the models based on only thermal is moderate, they are derived from
    data collected early enough in the growing season that crop management practices
    could be adjusted using the results in a commercial production setting. For example,
    UAS could be used to quickly gather canopy temperature data to assess the distribution
    of irrigation water through variable-rate irrigation systems. The approach could
    be used to identify issues with irrigation systems, such as clogged sprinkler
    emitters. It could be used to understand field characteristics, such as suboptimal
    terrain and drainage patterns, which could be used as part of cost-benefit analysis
    for weighing mitigation options. It could be used to assess the severity of water
    stress in systems applying deficit irrigation regimes. 3.4. Relationship between
    volumetric water content and canopy temperature Canopy temperature derived from
    the thermal orthomosaics generally had weak negative linear relationships or no
    relationship with VWC measured by in-field sensors. Presentation of the few significant
    results that were observed are given here in the text only. In 2019, the only
    significant relationship between VWC at 15 cm depth and canopy temperature occurred
    at 1237 heat units (August 12) (R2 = 0.5). However, the relationship between canopy
    temperature from the same date with VWC at 30 cm deep was much stronger (R2 =
    0.9). The VWC at 30 cm was weakly correlated with canopy temperature at 1390 heat
    units on August 22 (R2 = 0.37). Out of both years, August 12 in 2019 (1237 heat
    units) was the only image date for which soil VWC also had significant differences
    among irrigation treatments, which were observed at both 15 cm (P = 0.04) and
    30 cm (P = 0.007) depths. Soil VWC at 30 cm furthermore had a strong relationship
    with yield on the same date (R2 = 0.81). Ritchie et al. [36] reported that the
    quantity of roots at 30 cm depth and deeper was much greater than at 15 cm in
    the conditions of their study, so it follows that VWC at 30 cm could be more strongly
    related to canopy temperature. The 30 cm sensors were also closer to the depth
    of the subsurface drip irrigation tape, although Kamara et al. [45] previously
    noted that emitter depth of drip irrigation did not affect cotton root depth or
    distribution in the conditions of their study. In 2020, the relationship between
    canopy temperature and VWC was even weaker. There was a positive linear relationship
    (R2 = 0.48) between VWC at 15 cm and canopy temperature at 897 heat units on July
    3. There was limited range in VWC (0.37 to 0.46) across irrigation treatments
    on that date caused by 50 mm rainfall over the previous two weeks. This suggests
    that the model was not necessarily related to crop water stress and therefore
    the relationship was not meaningful. The relationship was negative at 1356 heat
    units on August 18 (R2 = 0.4) when the soil was drier and there was a greater
    range in VWC (0.24 to 0.42). There were not any other significant relationships
    at 15 cm soil depth. For VWC at 30 cm, there was only one significant relationship
    on July 3 (R2 = 0.47), which had a slightly positive regression coefficient. As
    the model did not have a negative slope as expected, this was not likely related
    to crop water stress. Results may have been clearer if tensiometers were used,
    as such measurements are tied more directly to plant water stress [46] than VWC
    and would be sensitive to the effects of soil physical properties such as texture
    [47]. However, thermal imagery could likely be paired with soil moisture tension
    data from wireless sensor networks to better quantify soil moisture and crop water
    status together. 4. Conclusions Using the approach described herein, it was possible
    to accurately exclude soil background information in UAS-derived thermal infrared
    orthomosaics using a simple threshold method without the need for ancillary imagery.
    This allowed direct and accurate non-contact determination of average canopy temperatures
    without field-based equipment. The canopy temperature data was largely aligned
    with yield data across irrigation treatments, while it appeared that canopy temperature
    identified more subtle differences between cotton varieties that were not reflected
    in yield differences. Overall, there were linear relationships between UAS-derived
    canopy temperature and seed cotton yield, which ranged from weak to strong depending
    on growing conditions. While canopy temperature was generally correlated with
    soil VWC, the relationship was not consistently strong. This suggests that single
    time point soil VWC measurements are not always representative of crop water status
    and should not be used alone, but rather incorporated into broader irrigation
    management strategies. For example, thermal imagery could potentially be calibrated
    using georeferenced wireless soil moisture sensor networks for timely, high-resolution
    maps of soil moisture and crop water status. Ethics statement Not applicable:

    Abstract The present study analyzed the trends in patenting in the field of Precision
    Agriculture (PA) since the late 1970s, when the potential application of microprocessor‐based
    technology started to show its dramatic effects on agriculture. The patenting
    activities analyses conducted focused as first on the evolution of the terms that
    historically have been used to indicate the common principles linked to the concept
    of precision agriculture, to mine relevant keywords within massive datasets such
    as patent documents. Then, the rationale was to impose a sorting approach based
    on different criteria: (i) field of application (Positioning and Guidance Technologies;
    Information and Communication Technologies ICT; Measuring Technologies; Reacting
    Technologies); (ii) sensory technology (Positioning; Optical; Electro-chemical;
    Mechanical); and (iii) farming practices (Sowing; Fertilization; Protection; Irrigation;
    Harvest). The number of grants collected included 2003 results, with an enormous
    increase in the number of precision agriculture-related patents registered in
    the last years. This study emphasizes the central role of ICT and Global Positioning
    technologies in supporting several measuring and response technologies, highlights
    the increasing relevance of environmental sensors and image devices, notes the
    rise of unmanned vehicles in agricultural patents, and underscores fertilization
    as a dominant subject for patent activity among the farming practices. Previous

    agricultureTechnologies 1. Introduction In agricultural activities, the characteristics
    of the “production affecting objects” (e.g. plants, animals, machineries, but
    also parasites and weeds) and the conditions of the environment (atmosphere, soil,
    but also “social and economic environment” like market dynamics) vary continuously
    in the time and in the space. The managing of this highly variable context to
    optimize the results of agricultural activities, is the main goal of the agribusiness
    producers. The evolution of technologies in many different sectors (electronics,
    information and communication technologies, new materials, modeling) dramatically
    increased the availability of instruments and methodologies able to monitor this
    variability, to manage the related data, and to precisely apply the agronomic
    inputs. The combination of these tools and methodologies produced a new paradigm
    in farming: the Precision Agriculture (PA), that has been described as the way
    “to precisely define the right time, right way, and right place to manage agro-farm
    producing process” [1]. This evolution in technology and approach led to a deep
    innovation in agriculture permeating all the aspects of agricultural practices
    (e.g. plant status monitoring, weeds and pests control, soil properties monitoring
    and management). Within the innovation process, seen as the path of translating
    invention and/or existing knowledge into marketable solutions, the patents and
    trademarks system encourages and stimulates the inventors to share and apply their
    discoveries granting the protection of intellectual property and the control of
    commercial use of the inventions. In this view, the patents represent an up-to-date
    source of information not only on applied technology but also on application fields,
    and enables the monitoring of the innovation trends [[2], [3], [4]]. The patent
    data could be analyzed for determining innovation, analyzing innovation trends,
    forecasting technological developments, identifying technological vacuums/hotspots,
    and competitors [5]. A further advantage of patent analyses is that they are classified
    in databases, thus facilitating their retrieval [6]. A patent landscape search
    provides a snapshot of the patent state of art in a given technical discipline.
    These landscapes are used to understand a particular domain by using patent literature
    and derive the various insights based on the patent cluster extracted [7]. Since
    1990, the world has experienced a tremendous growth in the volumes of patents,
    but agricultural and related technologies account for a relatively small fraction
    of the total [8]. Taking into consideration the core sections for these technologies
    in the International Patent Classification, the author reported that agricultural
    and foodstuffs related patent applications in 2010 comprised 2.4 % of the total
    Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) of the World Intellectual Property Organization
    (WIPO) [9]. Quantifying, evaluating and benchmarking innovation in agriculture,
    therefore, is a significant, as well as complex, issue for both the public and
    private sectors, but also from an academic research perspective, because it can
    reveal the contribution to agriculture achieved in other sectors. Assessing patents
    in precision agriculture domain offers numerous advantages to stakeholders, as
    the following: Helping businesses and technology companies to identify the latest
    advancements in precision agriculture; Driving the R&D efforts to provide insights
    into existing technologies and areas where further research is needed; Gauging
    the maturity and potential of the precision agriculture market, crucial information
    for investors and funding agencies. Moreover, policymakers can use patent data
    to draft policies, regulations, and incentives that promote sustainable agricultural
    practices, whereas market analysts and consultants can use patent data to assess
    market trends and forecast future developments. Therefore, analysis of the patents
    in this domain could suggest numerous possibilities for additional technological
    advancements in precision agriculture. Based on this framework, this research
    focused on providing an overview on the technological developments in agricultural
    patents linked with the dictated of precision agriculture, on the changes in agricultural
    technology in terms of patent applications by specific sector with the purpose
    of forecasting future trends, identifying areas of concentration or lack of patents.
    To achieve the proposed objectives, as first step, a section discussed the evolution
    of the terms that historically have been used to indicate the common principles
    linked to the concept of precision agriculture. This expedient allowed to find
    relevant keywords within massive datasets such as precision agriculture patent
    documents. In subsequent steps, we classified them in relation to the field of
    application (Positioning and Guidance Technologies; Information and Communication
    Technologies ICT; Measuring Technologies; Reacting Technologies), (ii) sensory
    technology (Positioning; Optical; Electro-chemical; Mechanical) and (iii) farming
    practices (Sowing; Fertilization; Protection; Irrigation; Harvest) and fixing
    the patents in the timeline procedure to forecast future changes that are still
    happening. 2. Research background 2.1. Precision agriculture: the historical development
    of its meaning This introductory paragraph provides a background to the evolution
    of the terms linked to the concept of Precision Agriculture. If on one hand the
    principles and goals of a Precision Agriculture management strategy were clear
    from the beginning, on the other hand the terminology used to define them was
    not. This research comes from a terminology extraction output to identify the
    most effective keywords list for search engine optimization and to restrict the
    patents selection. In developed countries, agriculture has evolved over the years
    from a manual occupation to a highly automation demanding activities, utilizing
    a wide variety of tools and machines. Agricultural machinery patents date back
    to the early days of the patent system and a number of innovations were explored
    as early as 1920, picked with the application No. 1506706 [10] filed by Fred L.
    Willrodt (Steering attachment for tractors, 1924) in which the author patented
    a concept of fully autonomous agricultural vehicle. But we had to wait years until
    the technology was mature enough to really be effective, and, as early as 1970s,
    engineers began to concretely speculate about sensors able to recognize variations
    in time and space across the field and controllers able to react to these variations,
    varying the amounts of inputs. It encompasses wide-ranging technologies that started
    to be applied in agricultural activities when remote sensing [11], new soil sampling/testing
    approaches to detect soil variability [[12], [13], [14], [15]] and yield meter
    [16] were proposed. The potential to apply microprocessor‐based technology in
    mobile agricultural equipment actually dates back to 1978 in a patent application
    for a planter monitor [17], but it shall have to wait until the availability of
    the U.S. Department of Defense''s NAVSTAR satellite‐based Global Positioning System
    (GPS) to feel the significant effect of electronics in precision agriculture applications.
    Therefore, well before precision agriculture became an established practice, the
    early electronic equipment for sensing comprised fundamental aspects such as collecting
    georeferenced data, soil and grain yield monitoring and the Geographical Information
    System (GIS). The GPS system became fully operational in March 1994 [18], but
    since the early 1980s, numerous scientific papers and technical reports have been
    published concerning the new technologies/methodologies particularly involving
    geographical positioning systems [19,20], crop or soil monitoring sensors [21,22],
    data management [23,24], and agricultural machineries automatic control [25,26].
    In the same decade, integrating many of the above reported technologies/methodologies,
    some visionaries researchers argued how automation, sensing systems, positioning
    systems and information technology would transform agricultural crop production
    as the technology became widely available [27]. The idea of a variable rate fertilizer
    spreader was studied by several scientists during the early to mid-1980s. Pierre
    Robert [28], often regarded as the father of precision agriculture, indicated
    in his PhD dissertation titled “Evaluation of Some Remote Sensing Techniques for
    Soil and Crop Management” that farm management could be improved using color infrared
    aerial photography from the previous year in association with soil series maps.
    Johnson et al. [29] developed the concept of ‘custom prescribed tillage’. In 1985,
    Rust [30] introduced the concept of ‘farming by soil’, intended as the rate of
    fertilizer that varies according to digitized soil maps. The potential of spatially-variable
    fertilizer and pesticide application has led to a number of attempts to commercialize
    the technology. The first commercial precision agriculture technology for site-specific
    application was based on a patent issued in 1986: the U.S. patent 4630773 [31]
    of Ortlip, owned by Soil Teq. Inc. In the patent claim section, it was clearly
    stated how the rates of fertilizer application is supplied according to digital
    maps. It employs a computerized control system with a digital soil map, determines
    vehicle location, adjusts feeders based on soil type, and utilizes aerial photographs
    and soil testing to customize product rates for different soil types. Schueller
    [32] from the University of Florida introduced into scientific literature the
    term “site-specific”. According to this author, “the continuing advances in automation
    hardware and software technology have made possible what is variously known as
    spatially-variable, precision, prescription, or site-specific crop production”.
    Gradually, the terms “farming by soil” and “site-specific farming” were replaced
    by “variable rate” technology [33]. Robert et al. organized in 1992 the first
    workshop “Soil Specific Crop Management”, in which the terms “site-specific crop
    management” and “site-specific agriculture” were widely recognized and used [34].
    However, gradually many of these terms were replaced by “precision farming”. In
    the Second International Conference on “Site-Specific Management for Agricultural
    Systems” [35], five contributes reported the terms “precision farming” or “precision
    agriculture” in the title. In the preface of the proceedings, Robert analyzed
    that have been used various names to describe the same basic concept: farming
    by soil, farming by the foot, spatially prescriptive farming, computer aided farming,
    farming by computer, farming by satellite, high-tech sustainable agriculture,
    spatially variable field operations, soil-specific crop management, site-specific
    farming, ending the list with the term “precision farming”. However, in his opinion
    [36], precision farming had a broader meaning, including a wider set of agronomic
    practices such as soil sampling procedures, fertilizer and chemical rate selection,
    timing of applications, and type of machinery selection. Blackmore [37], in the
    paper “Precision farming; an introduction” realized that although new technologies
    enabled new processes, the core of Precision Farming was the understanding and
    management of variability. He defined it as a comprehensive system designed to
    optimize agricultural production by carefully tailoring soil and crop management,
    to correspond to the unique condition found in each field while maintaining environmental
    quality. In the same year, Emmert and coworkers [38] published a brief guide about
    “precision farming” a means of growing crops by making more efficient use of inputs
    such as fertilizers and pesticides. So, the term “precision farming” was formally
    introduced into scientific literature in 1994 and by the mid-1990s, what we now
    regard as a paradigm in agriculture, was being referred to precision agriculture
    and the related concept and set of tools nowadays also known as “smart farming”.
    Entering the new era of the digital economy, digital technology has gradually
    penetrated all aspects of today''s society, with high potential for impact in
    agriculture. In this framework, “digital agriculture” and the similar terms such
    as “smart farming”, “e-agriculture”, as well as “agriculture 4.0”, are increasingly
    used terms to refer to the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)
    with remote and proximal sensing, artificial intelligence-based techniques, big
    data analytics, processing algorithms, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain
    technology and machine learning with the aim to monitor, control and optimize
    the activities of agricultural production in terms of productivity and sustainability.
    All this, once again, led to the evolution of terminology used. In true, there''s
    a blurred line between definitions of Precision Agriculture, Smart Farming or
    Digital Agriculture. For some authors smart agriculture fall under the definition
    of precision agriculture, some others use the term Precision Agriculture only
    when referring to production or precise measurements. Others claim it in a more
    holistic approach of smart solutions to capture data and interpreting them using
    computing technologies to make farm operations more predictable and efficient
    [39,40]. In general, all of them refer to the use of modern technologies to manage
    farms in order to improve yield, reducing input and human labor requirements.
    2.2. Precision agriculture technology, sensor and applicator controllers In view
    of what just claimed, the precision agriculture approach is founded on engineering
    technology applications to well-established agronomic management practices. The
    concrete application of these principles, in fact, is strictly dependent on technological
    innovations to acquire, manage, and utilize a large quantity of data required.
    PA refers to a range of rapidly developing technologies which provide more precise
    information about the managed resources and allow variable management of them.
    To this regard, till now, there were few attempts to classify of Precision Agriculture
    Technologies (PATs) and most of them categorizing PATs in three main categories.
    Khanna et al. [41] grouped the range of technologies contributing to the data
    collection, decision making and management processes into diagnostic and applicative
    techniques. Diagnostic technologies are methods of detecting and analyzing spatial
    variability at sub-field level (GPS, GIS, yield monitors, and crop scouting or
    remote sensing systems), whereas applicative tools implement site-specific input
    application decisions using computer-controlled devices that vary input applications
    across the field, focusing on variable-rate application and guidance technologies.
    In the same year, Keskin [42] classified into three main groups of technologies
    as Data Collection, Data Processing/Decision Making and Variable-Rate Application.
    McBratney et al. [43] classifies PATs in Hardware and Sensors; Data Analysis and
    Decision Support Systems; and Commodity. Schwarz and coworker [cited by 44] categorized
    the range of PA technologies as Recording technologies, Reacting technologies
    and Guidance technologies, all relying on some form of geographical positioning
    systems. More recently, Zarco-Tejada et al. [44] categorized PATs in a linear
    manner, following the timeline of use of the technologies ending up in three categories,
    namely Remote Sensing; Guidance Systems; and Variable Rate Applications. Finally,
    Balafoutis et al. [45] divided the smart farming technologies into Data Acquisition
    Technologies; Data Analysis and Evaluation Technologies; Precision Application
    Technologies. When sensors were taken into account, precision agriculture uses
    intensive data and information collection from proximal and remote sensors. Sudduth
    [46] attempted to classify the sensing technologies into GPS for Location Sensing,
    Close-range Sensors and Remote Sensing. Most recently, Veena and coworkers [47]
    identified six sensing technologies which are implied in precision agriculture
    to provide data to monitor and optimize crop yields: Optical Sensors, Electro-chemical
    Sensors, Location Sensors, Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors, Airflow Sensors and
    Agricultural Weather Stations. From planting to crop harvest, Kakarla and coworkers
    [48] categorized the whole farming process into five different areas (Planting;
    Soil management; Nutrient and Water management; Pest and Diseases management;
    Yield harvesting and Post-harvest processing), whereas they identified several
    categories of sensing systems that are used in agriculture (Remote sensing; Computer
    vision; RGB; Multispectral; Hyperspectral; Thermal; Lidar; Synthetic Aperture
    Radar). In real world, generally patents collected many principles and different
    technologies for plant sensing, and do not easily fall into these classifications.
    3. Methodology 3.1. Collection of patent data and analytics processes The workflow
    of the present study is divided into several steps, as shown in Fig. 1. In the
    first step, a literature review was carried out to mine relevant keywords derived
    from the study of the evolution of terms historically used to refer to the common
    principles associated with the concept of precision agriculture, described in
    the previous Section 2.1. In a second step, fourteen relevant keywords were chosen
    based on knowledge acquired (“digital agriculture”, “high-tech sustainable agriculture”,
    “precise farming”, “precision agriculture”, “precision farming”, “prescription
    farming”, “site specific crop management”, “site-specific farming”, “smart agriculture”,
    “smart farming”, “soil-specific crop management”, “spatially prescriptive farming”,
    “spatially variable field operations”, “variable rate technology”), because they
    has been historically used and/or are sometimes used interchangeably today. Download

    Patent analysis process flow applied in the study. In the third step (data collection),
    an extensive use of the freely available patent databases has been made in the
    USA (http://www.uspto.gov/patft/index.html), Europe (http://ep.espacenet.com/-
    http://www.epo.org), World International Patent Organization (http://pctgazette.wipo.int/).
    In addition, this review includes data from Google Patents Interface (patents.google.com/advanced),
    that indexes more than 87 million patents with full text from the patent offices
    of 17 different countries, and the user-friendly interface of the Google''s search
    engine. The search was carried out also using different set of Boolean operators
    like AND, OR, NEAR, etc. Data of non-English patents were based on the interpretation
    of abstract and claims by means of Google translation tools. The time span was
    set from January 1970 to December 2022. A detailed patent search strategy (step
    four) was designed to identify and retrieve relevant patents on PA, then a structured
    framework was developed for categorizing precision agricultural technologies,
    sensing technologies and agricultural practices to create a taxonomy (see section
    3.2). Precision agriculture, indeed, encompasses a set of sophisticated tools,
    systems and technologies (sensors, tractors, drones, terrestrial platforms, etc.)
    for its full realization, many of which were not specifically developed for agriculture.
    Moreover, patent implementations could be related to the development of single
    sensing device or to the whole system integrating perception, actuation, and decision
    making. To provide the needful restrictions, the search (step five) was narrowed
    keeping in the database only the grants that match the aspect of innovation in
    the five identified agricultural practices and/or the technologies explicitly
    designed for precision agriculture, while keeping out purely technological innovation
    common to several productive contexts. To be clear, we keep into the database
    patents related to sampling the grain characteristics (moisture content, harvest
    yield, etc.) detected at a plurality of locations by mean a GNSS system located
    in an associated vehicle, excluding patents focused just on methods or tools for
    the automatic location of vehicles. Moreover, it was kept out from the search:
    1) the duplicate patents (double patenting occurs when patents are filed by the
    same inventors claiming the same invention in different countries, because they
    has its own system of patent numbering); 2) the patents on topics regarding precision
    agriculture in livestock industry or aquaculture (also knows as “Precision livestock
    farming” that shares common terms with this search); 3) agricultural biotechnologies;
    4) plant breeding, 5) post-harvest precision innovations. Patent analysis was
    conducted manually through the collective expertise of three PhD experts in precision
    agriculture techniques and practices along with one expert specializing in socio-economic
    aspects. It was carried out on entire patent texts to avoid being misled by patent
    information and involved a series of steps, including extracting patents from
    patent databases, extracting information from the patents, and analyzing the extracted
    information to infer the logical conclusions. Since the subjectivity of the selection
    process could represent an issue, to design the selection process as objectively
    as possible the outcome of the downloading procedure was cross-validated, by comparing
    the relevance of the downloaded patents in terms of coherence with the investigated
    sector. All the recovered documents were stored and treated in Excel spreadsheet
    containing the patent number, the title, the year of publication, the country
    of publication, the inventor or the author''s name, the abstract and claims. We
    first examined the analysis of the identified PATs, and, in separate section,
    related them to agricultural practices. It is expected that data records are replicated
    when compared parallelly with other areas. 3.2. Precision agriculture technologies
    and sensing technologies classification Following the scientific literature review
    in previous sections 2.2, many aspects of PA have been analyzed and categorized
    focusing on three relevant technologies or areas of application that can summarize
    in guidance technologies, data acquisition, data processing/decision making/variable-rate
    application. With the purpose of providing a more accurate analysis and comprehensive
    categorization of PATs that this research aims to achieve, a special attention
    has been addressed to those technologies used for facilitating data information
    exchange, digitalization of farming, data storage, decision-making tools and wireless
    communication. Hence, we identified the following four Precision Agriculture Technologies:
    “Positioning and Guidance Technologies”; “Information and Communication Technologies”;
    “Measuring Technologies”; “Reacting Technologies”. The first group provide the
    essential spatial data to conduct the site-specific management, but also information
    allowing the vehicle to navigate along a pre-set path within the field. Second
    group includes focused on data management (sharing, exchange, storage and communication),
    processing and analysis and decision-making purposes. Measuring technologies consist
    of proximal and remote sensor-based systems that record data able to be mapped
    into a farm analytics and management systems. The last group that includes reacting
    technology is the actual application of the precision agriculture. The implementation
    of precision agriculture principles involves various aspects and activities that
    growers undertake during cultivation of crops. Therefore, we related the precision
    agriculture technologies to the following crucial agricultural practices “Sowing”,
    “Fertilization”, “Protection”, “Irrigation”, “Harvesting”. A special attention,
    in our patent search, was also focused on the technologies addressed to measure
    parameters and properties of soil, due to their crucial role for precision agriculture.
    In this field, several grants were addressed to developed to specific soil sensors
    as pivotal data inputs for a profitable use of nutrients or water. We also produced
    a classification to describe sensors and actuators, describing them using the
    domain of interest and the measurements they make. A sensor monitors conditions
    and signals when changes occur, whilst an actuator receives a signal and performs
    an action. Given the aim of the paper, to describe technological advances in sensor/actuator
    design, we classified them in four main categories. 1) Position: use the Global
    navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and the mapping technologies. 2) Optical:
    use electromagnetic waves to detect the level of energy absorbed or reflected
    by a medium. In this context camera-based imaging are the way for remote sensing
    of plants, since detailed information can be get from spectral and spatial intensity
    distribution (RGB, Lidar, infrared, Multi/Hyper-spectral, thermal cameras). 3)
    Electro-chemical: use ion-selective membranes that produce a voltage output in
    response to the activity of selected ions (H+, K+, NO3−, Na+, etc.) and measure
    electrical resistivity or conductivity, capacitance or inductance. 4) Mechanical:
    measure forces, weight or impact. In this category were enclosed the acoustic
    sensors that quantify the sound produced by a tool interacting with the grain,
    for instance. A separate discussion was deserved for the vectors, such as the
    unmanned platforms in Precision Agriculture. 4. Precision agriculture technologies
    Without any restrictions provided by our patent selection strategy, with all the
    abovementioned keywords as search parameters, the number of grants obtained resulted
    in over 4890 outcomes, but keeping out from the search the duplicate and the off
    topic patents, the database counted 2,003, with an enormous increase in the number
    of precision agriculture-related patents registered in the last decade. Fig. 2

    grant per year were counted from the first identified grant on precision agriculture
    in 1986 [31] to the 1998. In next the decade 1999–2008, the number of grants reached
    an average of 17 per year, then a relevant increase in the number of grants patented
    was found until 2014 (with an average of 58 patents per year). From 2015, a dramatic
    increase of the number of grants were recorded, picked with the 233 grants counted
    in 2018. In 2019 and 2020 the number of patents showed a sharply contraction,
    driven by an overall decline in worldwide trademark-filing activity in China [9],
    whereas patent-filing activity returned to growth in 2021. The 49 % of patents
    in precision agriculture are granted in the past five years. China''s National
    Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) processed 61 % of all patents on
    precision agriculture applications (Fig. 3). With over 1200 total grants, China
    patented approximately three-fold than the United States patent system. These
    numbers do not necessarily correspond with intense advances in innovation, because
    in CNIPA patents being granted for small design tweaks and incremental changes
    versus entirely new inventions. While the United States holds the top spot in
    the relevance of innovation, China is expected to continue its dominance in the
    raw quantity of patents published. Download : Download high-res image (220KB)

    use of location sensors, the most advanced precision agriculture practices continue
    to require and apply positioning technologies. A total of 703 grants were counted
    (35 % of the patent granted in PA), 43 % of these are granted in the last five-year
    period 2018–2022 (Fig. 4 - Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (185KB)

    that a patent could be reported multiple times as it could refers to different
    technologies. a The number of Positioning sensors was not reported with in the
    Positioning and guidance technologies. The global positioning technologies based
    on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS, - such as the US NAVSTAR GPS, the
    Russian GLONASS, the European GNSS Galileo, China''s BeiDou, the Japanese Quasi-Zenith
    Satellite System, and India''s NAVIC) or the tools that allow users to capture,
    store, manipulate and analyze spatial information (the Geographic Information
    Systems - GIS) are one of the most common device in precision agriculture. As
    a result, patents in this field relate to provide high-accuracy GNSS-based data
    that can easily be integrated with the ground truth information recorded in the
    field, such as field boundaries, optimizing machine operations, crops cover, crop
    health, weed infestation, yield monitoring and land mapping. The computational
    functionalities of such systems call for improved ICT architecture, creating synergies
    previously unexplored, both in terms of technical development and regarding new
    domains of applications. In this view, we counted a total of 222 grants (61 %
    of these are granted over the past quinquennium) that are associated to technologies
    that combines uses of GNSS and ICT (Table 1). A great number of grants (430, 47
    % granted in the five-year period 2018–2022) make use of position to react to
    a site request, whereas 286 (36 % in the 2018–2022 period) were the grants that
    related global position data to sensors measuring a variety of field and crops
    parameters. Among the sensors, optical (188, 53 % granted in the 2018–2022 period,
    i.e. light detection and ranging, LIDAR, hyper and multispectral cameras) and
    electrical sensors/actuators (178, 39 % granted in the 2018–2022 period, i.e.
    accelerometers, ultrasonic sensors, gyroscopes, etc.) are often used in environmental
    perception and navigation in land vehicles in integration with GNSS or as an alternative
    to it, in scenarios such as indoor environments where the GNSS technologies lack
    precision or fail entirely. Innovation in the field of positioning sensors have
    been addressed to develop Real Time Kinematic (RTK) devices that boosted GNSS
    accuracy with dual-frequency receivers, enabling real-time positioning at centimeter
    level, to trace operation, to monitor crops or, paired with computer vision and
    sensors, to contribute to smart and autonomous farm machineries development. 4.2.
    Information and communication technologies (ICTs) ICTs encompass many different
    types of technologies, from computers and internet to radio communications, to
    Internet of Things and their impact are playing a pivotal role in promoting innovation
    in the agriculture sector. These innovations (including software and hardware
    aspects, data handling, data communication, data interpretation) are revolutionizing
    agriculture, not only in developed economies but also in developing countries.
    The analysis of data revealed 792 grants (40 % of the patent granted in PA), 58
    % of these granted over the past quinquennium (Fig. 4). It delivers a collection
    of technologies and processes that hold great promise for agriculture and rural
    development. Increased efficiency of PA practices are the result of remote control
    and management of machinery using satellite positioning, while data from farm
    operations are collected and analyzed, often in conjunction with information on
    weather data to provide new efficient decision-making tools that promote agricultural
    productivity and manage natural resource effectively. Innovation have been addressed
    to develop wireless sensors as standalone unit or connected as networks called
    wireless sensors network (WSN). For these reasons, it is not surprising that a
    higher number of patents make use of ICT in measuring rather than reacting technologies
    (485 and 332 grants, respectively). 4.3. Measuring technologies Precision agriculture
    requires development of sensors for measurement of crop and soil properties, environmental
    conditions, pest''s identification and diffusion. A number of 1172 grants (59
    % of the patent granted in PA), 29 % of these are granted in the past five-year
    period 2018–2022, are associated to technologies able to monitor environment parameters
    or to characterize a crop status by sensors placed on the ground, canopy, vehicles
    or aerial platforms. In this context, the optical sensors, which use the light
    to measure plant/soil properties (by means of measure of fluorescence, reflectance,
    irradiance, etc.) counted the highest number of grants (544, 58 % over the period
    2018–2022, Table 1) in precision agriculture (i.e., soil nutrient and moisture
    levels, crop health status, etc.). These are followed by electro-chemical sensors
    (501, 42 % in the period 2019–2022), usually ion-selective electrodes and solid-state
    electrochemical sensors providing key information required. Relative humidity,
    air and soil temperature, soil moisture and soil nutrient sensors are areas whose
    sensor advance increased the most. 4.4. Reacting technologies Sensing technologies
    provide actionable data to be processed and implemented as need to optimize crop
    yield while minimizing environmental effects. Having such information at a real-time
    interval, automated actuation devices can be used to control irrigation, fertilization
    and pest control in order to offset the adverse conditions. Variable-rate technology
    (VRT) allows input application rates to be varied across fields for site-specific
    management of the field variability. In this context, 878 grants were counted
    (44 % of the patent granted in PA), 21 % of these in the period 2018–2022. VRT
    can be characterized as a fairly complex technology to use, and many systems to
    be integrated. When the typology of sensor/actuator technology was taken into
    account, the controlled equipment incorporates position (430, as previously reported),
    electro-chemical (314, 50 % in the period 2018–2022), optical (199, 58 %), and
    mechanical (57, 37 %) sensors (Table 1). 5. Precision agriculture technologies
    in agricultural practices 5.1. Precision agriculture technologies on sowing Within
    this topic, 176 patents (9 % of the patents granted in PA – Fig. 5) were counted,
    43 % of these granted in the last quinquennium. Modern precision seeding equipment
    manages to place the seeds and plantlets uniformly at proper distances and depths
    for optimal access to moisture and sunlight. In this field, reacting technologies
    accounted the highest number of grants (146, 42 % in 2018–2022 period – Fig. 6,
    Table 2), followed by those that have as main goal to locate and navigate agricultural
    vehicles within a field for sowing procedures (82, 33 % over the period 2018–2022),
    ITC (49, 65 %) and measuring (34, 47 %). Among the sensory technologies (Table
    3), the greater number of grants patent were counted in electro-chemical sensors
    (68, manly represented by actuators), followed by optical (31) and mechanical
    sensors (17). Download : Download high-res image (231KB) Download : Download full-size

    5.2. Precision agriculture technologies on fertilization The analysis of data
    revealed 412 patents (21 % of the patents granted in PA - Figs. 5), 45 % of these
    granted in 2018–2022 period, in somewhat related to a fertilizer control system.
    Reacting technologies engineered for the optimal supply of nutrient are the object
    of the highest number of grants (306, representing the 74 % of patents in this
    field – Fig. 6, Table 2), followed by positioning (195), ICT (136) and measuring
    (118) technologies. In this peculiar field, the electric actuators accounted 136
    grants (Table 3), whereas the innovation relates to optical sensors to acquire
    information able to adjust rates of fertilizer (both in real time or based on
    previously gathered data such spectral image) counted 112 grants. To date, the
    dominant remote sensing technologies are addressed to grant sensor in visible,
    near infrared (NIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength. Mechanical sensors
    and actuators were less represented (17). 5.3. Precision agriculture technologies
    on protection Within this topic, 277 grants addressed to support agricultural
    pest and weed management strategies (14 % of the patent granted in PA - Figs.
    5), 42 % of these are granted in the period 2018–2022. The grants associated to
    crop protection, even in somewhat outnumbered than fertilization, had percentage
    values substantially similar. In practice, it is not possible to make a clear
    distinction between spreading a fertilizer or an insecticide or an herbicide,
    as they tend, in terms of machine innovation, to overlap each other. The highest
    number of grants (216, 78 % of the patents granted in this field – Fig. 6, Table
    2) had as main topic reacting technologies, followed by location and guidance
    technologies (144), ICT (100) and measuring technologies (65). The main part of
    the innovation on this field presents invention related to optical sensors (77,
    Table 3) and the related methods for automatic identification of pests or weeds
    by means of digital RGB camera, whereas 73 patents relate to devices, systems
    and methods that through the use of electric sensors/actuators using GPS knife-based
    systems or to turn on individual nozzles where each knife or nozzles are independently
    controlled by the GPS/RTK technology. 5.4. Precision agriculture technologies
    on irrigation Notwithstanding the importance of controlling irrigation for higher
    yield production, just 122 patents have been granted (6 % of the patent application
    granted in PA - Fig. 5), most of them (32 %) granted in the 2018–2022 period.
    Also for irrigation, reacting technologies accounted the highest number of grants
    (82, 67 % of the patents granted in this context - Fig. 6, Table 2), followed
    by ICT (57) and measuring technologies (44), whereas position technologies achieved
    20 grants. When sensors were taken into account (Table 3), the most represented
    grants were the electro-chemical sensors/actuators (66), followed by the grants
    concerning the optical sensor (20). In fact, the main part of the innovation in
    this field is represented by sensors devoted to measure soil moisture and temperature,
    or acquire weather information using a real-time wireless in-field sensing (wireless
    radio communication) to provide information to control software for site-specific
    sprinkler irrigation. 5.5. Precision agriculture technologies on harvesting An
    accurate measure of crop yield or the development of an automated fruit harvesting
    are useful for farmers for a number of reasons, including labor saving, storage
    requirements, planning fertilization necessities on the next crop cycle, or cash
    flow budgeting. Within this topic, 204 are the grants identified (10 % of the
    grants in PA – Fig. 5), mostly represented by measuring technologies (130, 63
    % of the patents granted in this context - Fig. 6, Table 2), followed by location
    and guidance technologies (88), reacting (77) and ICT (37). The innovation on
    this field has been directed toward the development of electrical sensors (90,
    Table 3), followed by optical (70) and mechanical sensors (51). Under the mechanical
    sensor family was included the acoustic, ultrasonic and impact-based sensors,
    and a large number of grants developed this kind of sensors in harvest machine
    to measure crop yield. Several impact-based yield sensors, available from the
    middle of 1990s [49], have been patented almost exclusively in grain crops. Lowenberg-DeBoer
    [50] defined “killer application” when GPS-based information technology has been
    combined with yield monitors. Yield, indeed, is an indirect indicator of the various
    crop and soil parameters (such as moisture, nutrients, pest problems, etc.) able
    to relate the spatial information on both yield and soil properties to the main
    factors affecting crop productivity. The recent advances in spectral imaging technology
    enabled the development of new sensors that estimate various crop parameters from
    spectral imagery data. At this regard, a number of patents were addressed to develop
    complex vegetation index models to detect crop yields. Another point worthy of
    mention is the increasing number of patents applications that disclose automatic
    harvesting of fruits by a robot (34 between years 2020 and 2022), where fruit
    detection and localization on trees using computer vision and robot arm motion
    are described. 5.6. Precision agriculture technologies to identify soil properties
    How previous reported, precision agriculture began, during the mid-1980s, with
    farming by soil and progressed, in the early 1990s, to the approach based on continuous
    real-time sensing of spatial variations in soil properties using sensors mounted
    on tractors [51]. A total number of 242 grants was addressed to acquiring soil
    parameters, the mostly represented by electro-chemical sensor (130), followed
    by optical sensor (61). The main part of the innovation regarding soil sensors
    are based on the detection of water content and soil properties (soil organic
    matter, nutrient level, pH and topsoil depth) includes determination of available
    phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg),
    the cation exchange capacity (CEC), salinity, nitrate, sulfate, certain micronutrients,
    and heavy metals. The patents devoted to measure these parameters applying diverse
    types of technologies, such as field-based electric sensors, machine vision, airborne
    multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing, satellite imagery, thermal imaging,
    among others. 6. Unmanned platforms in precision agriculture Although in our classification
    it has not been specifically identified as separate PAT, the use of unmanned platforms
    in their various ground and aerial forms (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle – UAV and Unmanned
    Ground Vehicle - UGV) represents definitely a breakthrough tool in precision agriculture,
    almost as much as the use of global position technology at the beginning of the
    ‘90s. They provide unparalleled spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution through
    a range of sensors and cameras capable of carrying out detailed data collection
    for vegetation, drought plant stress, weed and pathogen detection, nutrient status
    and growth vigor assessment, and yield prediction [52]. Over the past five years,
    the number of patents using unmanned vehicles in precision agriculture applications
    has exponentially increased, with a total of 137 grants, 85 % of these are granted
    from 2018. Equipped with GNSS receivers, artificial intelligence, wireless networks
    and inertial measurement units, unmanned vehicles are capable of being fully-fledged
    mobile measurement platforms. Patents in this peculiar field disclosed multi-data
    acquisition devices for various operations devoted to monitoring (such as mapping,
    land inspection, checking for diseased crops, etc., 45 %) or managing the crops
    (spraying fertilizers, herbicide or pesticide, for pollinating of crops, application
    of defoliating agent to assist harvesting, etc., 55 %). The innovation in this
    peculiar field was addressed to the development of components for aerial spraying
    of pesticide (34 %) or fertilizer (30 %). Most of China-originated filings relate
    to UAV''s able to dispense treatments, whereas in the rest of the world, filings
    are spread across applications in areas such as sensors, crop management systems,
    data processing and spray systems. As a main advantage, the unmanned vehicle systems
    can acquire low-cost information of the within-field spatial variation through
    imagery with centimeter resolution. Consequently, it is not surprising that a
    great number of patents (43 %) make use of optical sensors (RGB, multispectral,
    hyperspectral, infrared cameras, Lidar, electromagnetic sensors). If earlier sensors
    on board were more of an adaptation of existing technologies, the latest sensors
    are mostly developed from scratch with the express intent of being utilized on
    UAV or UGV. Patent activity on the electro-chemical sensors devoted to the gas
    sensing applications (8 %) are still poorly represented in a precision agriculture
    context. 7. Conclusions and future outlook This paper represents one of the first
    attempts to analyze patenting activities in the field of Precision Agriculture
    over the period 1970–2022. Patents count was used as the most suitable proxy for
    innovation, and, from this perspective, the patent database has been very useful
    to catch innovation performance at global scale. To date, the impact of patents
    on innovation and development of agricultural technologies has not systematically
    assessed, and such evaluation was sorely needed. Although some recent efforts
    have been made [53,54], due to the nature of patent documents and the information
    associated with them, patent data is particularly nasty. Very often, the patent
    focused just on a peculiar aspect of the device implementation, but without being
    blind to the possibilities to further enactment of the entire system. Moreover,
    a significant number of patents appear to be essentially noise, and systematic
    biases remain in patent statistics, the full evaluation of which necessarily should
    be achieved through a careful classificatory and survey research. This study tries
    to fill this gap, classifying precision agricultural technologies, sensing technologies
    and agricultural practices, and providing a comprehensive overview of changes
    and trends in the development of agricultural technologies, through the definition
    of a taxonomy used to extract, analyze and categorize the patent data. Precision
    agriculture could be certainly considered one the most significant innovation
    introduced to agriculture in the last thirty years, but its adoption rate, at
    least for the first 15 years, did not meet expectations [55] for several different
    reasons. There was no clear evidence of economic feasibility associated with precision
    agriculture [56], due to high technological risk, primarily in the form of obsolescence.
    To this, it must be added a parallel lack of progress in developing of proper
    decision-support systems oriented to the application of the information acquired
    [43]. Another aspect of no less importance was the lack of excludability which
    results in an insufficient incentive for private sector to produce the innovation
    in the first place [57]. Then something changed in these recent years, and the
    number of patent grants in PA, which in 2011 was 74, tripled in 2018, reaching
    a total of 233 grants. Similar results were achieved by Tey and coworkers [54]
    obtained in a patent network analysis comparable findings, noting a fourfold increase
    in patent applications between 2010 and 2019. Over the past ten years, in fact,
    the private companies have become more involved in developing on-farm technologies
    (such agricultural machinery, post-harvest technology, electronic sensors) where
    the market role and intellectually property right (such patents, copyrights and
    trademarks) has long been used to increase the appropriability of innovation-related
    benefits. Moreover, the advancement in low-cost powerful computers, real-time
    controllers, sensing and communication technologies has significantly brought
    down the cost of systems and devices, making precision agriculture feasible. Simultaneously,
    wireless technologies allowed setup remote sensors with several advantages including
    easy installation, cost-effectiveness, small size and low power consumption [58].
    In this view, although the adoption of technologies for precision agriculture
    systems is still a challenging and dynamic issue for farmers, the great part of
    innovation in PA in the past few years seems addressed to help smallholder to
    surmount these obstacles by providing reliable and easy to use information, offering
    competitive advantage that can be introduced into farming without too much effort
    or cost. But the fact that the rise in patenting occurred mainly in new technology
    areas (such as ICT, spectral imaging technology, navigation sensors), where inventions
    have been more intense over the past few year, suggests that patent grants reflect
    trends in invention. This study, indeed, unveiled that the ICT and Global Positioning
    technologies plays an essential role as a key cross-cutting tools supporting several
    measuring and reacting technologies, with the higher number of related patents
    granted in the 2018–2022 period. From the early use of computers and the development
    of basic software for farm management, to the most recent agriculture widespread
    adoption of internet, big data analytics and Internet of Things, ICT is nowadays
    playing a crucial role in promoting sustainable farming practices. Looking forward,
    it would expect to count more patent filings directed toward the artificial intelligence
    (AI), augmented reality, machine vision and cloud-machine learning-based crop
    management systems and robotic [59]. In our research, we counted 16 patents in
    the last three years which explicitly mentioned the use and development of algorithms,
    artificial intelligence and machine learning application specifically developed
    for precision agriculture. Artificial intelligence is being used for crop monitoring,
    pest control, and yield prediction, while robots are aiding in labor-intensive
    tasks like harvesting and weeding. When the innovation on positioning technologies
    was taken into account, it was initially focused on the enhancement of the positioning
    accuracy (e.g. RTK technology), then, from the 2000s, the positioning technology
    started to be merged to other technologies including inertial navigation systems
    and sensors, while actual investments are addressed to the autonomous guidance
    of tractors, rover, robots and UAV to carry out farming tasks such as tilling,
    planting, fertilizing, applying pesticide, weed control and harvesting. Undeniably,
    unmanned platforms offer a wide range of applications to transform traditional
    agricultural practices into Agriculture 4.0 that integrates advanced technology
    to optimize agricultural productivity, sustainability, and efficiency [60]. The
    heavy concentration of activity on sensors/actuators development, as showed by
    the highest number of related patents recorded in this study, was intended to
    enhance versatility in the number of parameters covered, accuracy, reproducibility
    and response times (in the order of one to few seconds). Over the past few years,
    there has been a growing interest in the application of imaging technologies [61]
    and environmental sensors for their application in precision agriculture. When
    combined with satellite data, sensor-derived information is used to make fairly
    accurate forecasts or diagnosis, for spatial, spectral, radiometric applications,
    for yield projection, land use classification, biomass estimation. These tools
    and methods can provide support for the implementation of precision technologies
    and the adoption of best practices to optimize resource use and to improve the
    efficiency and profitability of agricultural operations while minimizing their
    impact on the environment, in both developed and developing economies. In these
    latter, incorporating precision agriculture dictates into the agricultural practices
    can contribute to food security, economic growth, and sustainable development,
    helping these nations in unlocking the possibilities of contemporary agricultural
    technology. In the final analysis, our evidence, for the first time provides some
    support for the potential use of patent statistics as proxy measure of innovation
    in PA, as well as the rates and the directions of innovation process and the aggregate
    information, that can be drawn from the huge amount of data achieved in this study,
    seem to be indicative of the trend of innovation on Precision Agriculture domain.

  description: Given the rising worldwide need for food, both in terms of quantity
    and quality, agricultural renewal is becoming more essential. Consequently, agricultural
    machine learning is required to increase production. The most important activity
    that farmers must complete is cultivating their fields. Agriculture must adhere
    to strict water resource usage guidelines. Precision irrigation locates and fulfils
    the irrigation needs of plants. Understanding the dynamics of soil humidity requires
    sophisticated models of soil–plant-atmosphere systems, which are complicated systems.
    In light of this, the objective of this article is to assess the recent modifications
    to growing-season characteristics that are significant to agriculture, such as
    the commencement of the growing season, the length of the growth period, and the
    region of the season’s maximal elevation. According to the season and region they
    wish to sow their seeds in, the suggested strategy helps farmers choose the right
    crops. Using support vector classifier and KNN classifier 99% and 97% experimental
    results of soil humidity deficit demonstrate that the recommended. We were able
    to differentiate the distinct influences of humidity based on the country or location
    at the start of the season, identifying both positive and negative trends globally.
    We investigated the association between the amount of food produced and the peak
    of the growing season in irrigated agriculture. The electrochemical sensors, which
    track changes in the soil, environment, and plant directly, impact plant growth.
    Soil moisture sensors were positioned at 10, 20, and 35 cm depths to forecast
    the amount of water in the soil throughout a crop. This unique research and its
    promising results give a crucial contribution to the answer to the problem of
    anticipating and controlling groundwater for farmed use sustainability.

    Accesses Explore all metrics Abstract Given the rising worldwide need for food,
    both in terms of quantity and quality, agricultural renewal is becoming more essential.
    Consequently, agricultural machine learning is required to increase production.
    The most important activity that farmers must complete is cultivating their fields.
    Agriculture must adhere to strict water resource usage guidelines. Precision irrigation
    locates and fulfils the irrigation needs of plants. Understanding the dynamics
    of soil humidity requires sophisticated models of soil–plant-atmosphere systems,
    which are complicated systems. In light of this, the objective of this article
    is to assess the recent modifications to growing-season characteristics that are
    significant to agriculture, such as the commencement of the growing season, the
    length of the growth period, and the region of the season’s maximal elevation.
    According to the season and region they wish to sow their seeds in, the suggested
    strategy helps farmers choose the right crops. Using support vector classifier
    and KNN classifier 99% and 97% experimental results of soil humidity deficit demonstrate
    that the recommended. We were able to differentiate the distinct influences of
    humidity based on the country or location at the start of the season, identifying
    both positive and negative trends globally. We investigated the association between
    the amount of food produced and the peak of the growing season in irrigated agriculture.
    The electrochemical sensors, which track changes in the soil, environment, and
    plant directly, impact plant growth. Soil moisture sensors were positioned at
    10, 20, and 35 cm depths to forecast the amount of water in the soil throughout
    a crop. This unique research and its promising results give a crucial contribution
    to the answer to the problem of anticipating and controlling groundwater for farmed
    use sustainability. Similar content being viewed by others Automation in Agriculture

    Article 13 September 2021 1 Introduction Using crop growth stimulation, environment,
    management, and plant genetics influence crop development at the plot and field
    sizes. Depending on the intended purpose, simulation methodologies are more sophisticated
    and need more data to physically based crop development models quantify the factors
    that underlie crop development and growth (Thaler et al. 2018). Satellite data
    and ground segments continually collect data on cloud cover, wind speed, and temperature
    and collect real-time data. As a result, machine learning (ML) algorithms usually
    may leverage a wide range of data from diverse sources to improve the accuracy
    of weather forecasts. It’s possible to study and adequately anticipate various
    weather occurrences because of the large quantity of data that can be processed
    and the need for enhanced now casting methods. Meteorological data (radiometer,
    satellites, and atmospheric measurements) and geographical data are used in existing
    now casting algorithms to provide reliable forecasts. Climate and weather monitoring
    to dedicate, the satellite system is a kind of satellite Data is gathered by scanning
    Earth using radiometers carried by the weather satellites themselves. Unmetered
    agricultural water usage is unmetered globally, despite the significance of surveillance
    for crop management. Unmetered surface water abstractions account for roughly
    30% of total surface water abstractions in the Murray–Darling Basin Commission’s
    latest report (Hanemann and Young 2020). Relative humidity, obtained from temperature
    and precipitation, has been discovered to impact insect population dynamics strongly.
    This is particularly true during the early phases of insect development. Some
    insects have reported quicker embryonic development and egg hatchability when
    relative humidity increases (Tamiru et al. 2012). Although that may impair crops
    growth performance at both extremes of relative humidity, high humidity may induce
    crop death via drowning and pathogen infection. In contrast, low humidity can
    prevent plants from emerging due to water deficiency from moisture loss (Norhisham
    et al. 2013). To increase crop yields, farmers decide not to test their soil as
    a result. As a result, farmers still lack knowledge about meteorological variables
    like temperature and air relative humidity (RH), as well as the qualities of soil
    like porosity, type, and pesticide concentrations. Because of this, farmers apply
    varying amounts of irrigation and fertilizer in relation to the specific amounts
    needed for a given crop in a given soil and environmental situation. Applying
    fertilizer insufficiently can negatively impact crop yield and cause farmers to
    lose money (Awasthi and Reddy 2013). The issue of mass cancer is brought on by
    over fertilization, which contaminates ground water and affects several parts
    of Punjab state (Mittal 2013). some farmers may take soil samples to a lab for
    examination; however this sample will not accurately represent the soil of a big
    field spanning hundreds of hectares. Additionally, the characteristics of the
    soil fluctuate. As an outcome, soil measurements collected experimentally once
    are not reliable for long agricultural seasons. To accurately apply agricultural
    inputs, detailed spatial–temporal data from farm regions regarding soil and atmospheric
    conditions must be acquired on a regular basis (Fig. 1). Such data enables the
    accurate application of necessary crop inputs, such as herbicides or irrigation.
    Precision agriculture is the technique of precisely regulating agricultural demands
    with information and technology to maximize rewards for farmers (Kone et al. 2015).
    Fig. 1 Precision agriculture WSN Full size image Measuring the airspace inside
    the plant canopy is often used to create empirical disease models. Most weather
    sensors are placed above the top and outside the field when a model is predicting.
    The impacts of distant measurements within the canopy may be minor, but as the
    crop grows, they become more significant (Gumestad et al. 1995). According to
    research, the accuracy of the forecast for out-of-field substitutes degrades with
    a range from fields to meteorological data (Gillespie and Sutton 1979). While
    remote sensing may offer a solution to the problem under discussion (Fig. 2),
    it is not a cost-effective method, and the information gathered is regional in
    nature, not accurately reflecting local conditions (Seelan et al. 2023). Our goal
    was to estimate global agricultural output fluctuations using seasonal climate
    forecasts. An eco-physiological procedure growth and yield model was combined
    with a dynamic seasonal humidity model to forecast crop growth in worldwide areas
    (Table 1). Fig. 2 Temporal data for atmospheric and soil conditions Full size

    About 70% of Indians work in agriculture. The research (Gowda and Reddy 2020)
    focuses on estimating and predicting agricultural yields using historical data
    from the farmed area. Developing a forecasting model using machine learning methods
    considers several elements such as moisture, humidity, soil conditions, and other
    things. Decision Tree, Random Forest and Polynomial regression are utilised as
    machine learning methods. The system improves by mixing it with other sectors
    like cultivation, horticultural, etc. 2.1 Humidity sensors in PA Humidity is the
    measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. Relative humidity (RH%), which
    is the ratio of partial water vapour pressure to saturation vapour pressure, is
    the most often used indicator of atmospheric humidity. Relative humidity is influenced
    by the system of interest’s pressure and temperature. The probability of precipitation,
    dew, fog, and rain is indicated by humidity. Since most crops are particularly
    sensitive to these climatic conditions, precision agriculture significantly relies
    on accurate and highly sensitive relative humidity sensors (Pelegrí-Sebastia et
    al. 2012). Humidity sensors find significant applications in contemporary industries
    such as the pharmaceutical, paper, and printing sectors; museums; cold chain applications;
    and green house applications, among others. Humidity (RH) sensors have been incorporated
    by the majority of researchers in their precision agricultural studies. 2.2 Humidity
    sensor designs and modeling Three categories can be used to group electric Humidity
    sensors according to how they sense. There are three types of humidity sensors:
    thermal conductivity based, resistive, and capacitive. Two metallic resistors
    are used in thermo conductivity-based humidity sensors; one is shut off from the
    environment and the other is exposed to it. By using the same electrical biasing
    (Fig. 3), the resistors are heated (Fig. 4). The exposed resistor cools to a lower
    temperature as a result of the humidity in the surrounding air, and its thermal
    conductivity changes with humidity. Humidity is sensed using the signature created
    by the differential in thermal conductivity between two metal resistors (Ruiz-Garcia
    et al. 2009). Fig. 3 Block diagram of wireless sensor node Full size image Fig.
    4 Thermo conductivity–humidity sensors Full size image Thick and thin film conductors
    coated in polymers, such as nafion and polyvinyl alcohol, are used by resistive
    humidity sensors; the number of these conductors can be adjusted in response to
    the relative humidity of the environment (Fig. 4). Capacitive humidity sensors
    are essentially capacitors with electrodes printed on thin polyimide sheets. The
    lectric constant of polyimide thin films is influenced by humidity. The limitations
    of resistive and capacitive humidity sensors stem from their nonlinear transmission
    characteristics. An analog front end circuit and a subsequent signal processing
    circuit must be built in order to take nonlinear factors into consideration. In
    recent times, artificial neural networks have been used to linearize sensor features.
    Humidity thermo sensors exhibit long-term stability, low hysteresis, and linear
    response. However, because metal resistors must be heated to the proper temperature,
    they are not power-efficient. Capacitive humidity sensors are efficient in terms
    of power usage, sensitivity, and reaction time. However, the variation in the
    surrounding temperature negatively impacts their linearity. 2.3 Statistical techniques
    involvement Using the UST dataset of 10 years of field experiments over US states
    and Canadian provinces, (Pant et al. 2021) constructed a model that can forecast
    soybean production during the growing season. To predict crop production, proposing
    a system using LSTM and temporal attention, 30 weeks of meteorological data each
    year, and a simplified representation of the genotype to capture changes in various
    responses to environmental factors. That evaluated the efficiency of the suggested
    Temporal Attention mechanism to the layered LSTM model in two variants of each
    model’s input time step count. This study also examined LASSO regression, SVR-RBF,
    and the USDA’s latest model. The study (Soode et al. 2015) aims to maximise agricultural
    yield while decreasing the likelihood of incorrect crop selection. An ensemble
    model as learners was developed to bring forth harvesting for the site-distinct
    parameters, with naive bayes, random forest and KNN serving as learners. Future
    improvements to the research collection will be strengthened by an increase in
    the number of characteristics. Warm climates get more sun than cold regions. In
    warm temperatures, that may open field cropping all year if water is not a problem.
    So protected cropping hasn’t gotten much attention in the past. In recent years,
    authorities and farmers in dry and warm climate zones have begun investigating
    protective farming, and it is critical in hotter regions with unpredictable rainfall
    and significant water absorption. India’s agricultural industry uses a lot of
    water. Groundwater levels are declining, and climate change is causing changes.
    Many Indian states disagree on how to use river water for agricultural purposes.
    In order to combat water scarcity, smart farming uses sensors to track soil temperature,
    fertilizer content, water level, and weather predictions. The EDYN Garden sensor
    is another (Gupta 2016). 3 Proposed methodology Agriculture has always been the
    foundation of our nation. Conditions often change nowadays. So knowing the weather
    is challenging to develop crops. We need to employ technology to analyse crop
    data and advise farmers to establish crops properly (Fig. 5). The nutrient is
    also an essential role in crop growth. Considering just one or two factors while
    developing an appropriate prediction model may not be adequate. A wide range of
    data on elements such as humidity, temperature, rainfall, and other variables
    are gathered and evaluated. Input for the prediction model will come from this
    analysis. Fig. 5 Proposed work of crop prediction Full size image 3.1 Dataset
    collection This study relied only on publicly available data from the Government
    of India. Since 2011, this has been procured for use in the Kharif and Rabi seasons
    of agricultural productivity. This study will focus on a few characteristics that
    have the most significant influence on agricultural production from the first
    dataset. 3.2 KNN algorithm When it comes to machine learning (ML), the k-nearest
    neighbour (k-NN) approach is regarded as one of the best. Each feature in our
    training dataset is treated as different dimensions in a particular place. The
    values each observation has for this feature are taken as its coordinates in that
    dimensions, so we end up with a collection of spatial points. The distance between
    two points in this space uses to measure their similarity, as long as the metric
    is adequate. The data allocating to clusters is based on their proximity and the
    Euclidean distance between them. Even though the data in this cluster are diverse,
    they are also comparable. $${\\text{D}}\\left( {{\\text{X}},{\\text{Y}}} \\right)
    = \\sqrt {\\sum\\nolimits_{{{\\text{i}} = 1}}^{{\\text{N}}} {\\left( {{\\text{X}},{\\text{Y}}}
    \\right)^{2} } }$$ (1) The formula for euclidian distance shows in Eq. (1). It
    uses to figure out how far apart two points on a plane are from one another. As
    far as I can tell, there isn’t a learning phase with KNNs. A simple distance calculation
    determines which training rows are closest in the distance to the test set. The
    records are more comparable when set at a more relative distance. The lazy learner
    approach or analogy learning is a term for this method. Despite this, it is still
    regarded as the most efficient. Algorithm steps (1) To begin, open the data file.
    (2) Set the \"k\" value to zero. (3) This step should be repeated as many times
    as necessary to get the desired class. (4) Examine each training line''s distance
    from the test data, and then calculate the distance. The Euclidean distance chose
    using this method since it is the most common. Chebyshev, cosine, and other similar
    measures are among the options. (5) Calculate the distances between the two points
    and sort them in ascending order of increasing distance. (6) For each categorised
    row, get the top k rows. (7) Select the line with the most significant degree
    of continuity. (8) Returns the classes you expected. KNN may be used in various
    ways, including as a grouping tool like the one pictured above. 3.3 Support vector
    classifier This method is used in both regression and classification situations.
    It handles many categorical and continuous well. Using SVC, a class may be separated
    by a hyper plane in 3D space SVC iteratively builds an ideal hyper plane to reduce
    error. With SVC, the goal is to discover the optimal MMH to classify the data.
    Equations (2)–(5) provides an approximation of the classifier for linear and polynomial
    with forward current node. $${\\text{Linear}}\\;{\\text{Equation}} - {\\text{K}}({\\text{X}},{\\text{Y}})

    Data pipelines often include tasks like hyper parameter tweaking and cross-validation,
    two of the most common. Specific information and understanding are required to
    create a project for the hyper-parameters, usually obtained through the investigation
    process. To achieve better accuracy in a model, parameter tuning picks values
    for a parameter that are more accurate than the default value. In examining the
    various kernel, the following criteria are taken into consideration. Algorithm
    steps 1. The normalization of data 2. Train and test data are splitted 3. Hyper-parameter
    tuning is initialized 4. Test and Train data model is operation by hyper-parameter
    tuning 5. Optimization of model is analyzed, if it’s not optimized step 4 is processed
    6. The forecasting model for crop production 7. Output is predicted for this anticipated
    model 3.5 K-NN and SVC modeling for crop yield prediction Using the K-NN and SVC
    approach for agricultural production prediction, this paper surveys the field’s
    current knowledge. To predict an unknown parameter from known values, K-NN and
    SVC analysis is employed. The input parameters studied in this study include temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture and rainfall, which are the primary characteristics for
    a decent crop yield. Still, several more aspects may be considered (Gowda and
    Reddy 2020). A prediction for an unknown crop yield may be made using the closest
    measured values of both the nearest neighbours by calculating the Euclidean distance
    between them and the unknown crop yield. 3.6 Data pre-processing and feature selection
    Pre-processing is required after selecting the dataset. Formatting, cleaning,
    and sampling are among the stages. Initially, the data is formatted to suit your
    needs. Cleaning data is removing or repairing jumbled data. A tiny random sample
    of the chosen data may be explored considerably quicker than the whole dataset.
    The last stage is converting the data that was picked. Various engineering aspects,
    such as scaling, feature aggregation, and so on, are used to turn the preprocessed
    data into data suited for machine learning algorithms. Several features are consolidated
    into a feature that is much more relevant to the issue you are attempting to address
    the confusion matrix (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 Confusion matrix for remote sensing and
    soil data Full size image 4 Results and discussion It was necessary to conduct
    this experiment to learn how the KNN algorithm works and how this can use it to
    estimate yields based on three different inputs. The following is a list of the
    input data Tamil Nadu (India’s) province. Alkaline, sandy, chalky and clay: 1395
    cents per acre. Millet was predicted as a possible crop by the algorithm with
    97% accuracy. They found laterite soil in Salem’s district, and an area of 1395
    cents was granted for testing. The method anticipated that the region would have
    a laterite soil type (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 a and b Model accuracy and loss for KNN
    and SVC Full size image This paper compares the accuracy, execution time (in seconds)
    and Accuracy scores of KNN and SVC algorithms, which are implemented in Python.
    In a classification report, the accuracy of predictions is assessed. The Precision
    is a classifier’s ability to not misclassify a negative instance as a positive
    one in Fig. 8a and b. Fig. 8 a and b Model accuracy and Loss for KNN and SVC Full
    size image 5 Comparison chart For scientific and statistical analysis (Gümüşçü
    et al. 2019), such variables are documented. It’s possible to anticipate agricultural
    production using data mining methods from various places. They expect wheat, jute,
    T-Aman, and mustard yields in this research. We had to spend six years gathering
    information on the medium- and high-land soil properties in different Bangladeshi
    sub districts. We used several data mining methods to conduct our research. Reduce
    the amount of features using a genetic approach, and eliminate (Afrin et al. 2018)
    excessively high processing time caused by the high dimension of the data set
    to increase estimation performance. Take into account environmental factors like
    temperature and soil nitrogen levels while developing and cultivating crop plans
    using energy estimation to achieve greater yield efficiency and resource conservation
    (Sakthipriya and Naresh 2022). In comparison to current models in a variety of
    domains, the experimental results of soil nutrient of humidity, temperature, and
    97% and 98% show that the proposed method may be used to automatically find the
    most efficient KNN and SVC model. For the estimations performed using both components
    and the parts selected with a genetic algorithm, the highest accuracies were obtained
    using the method with classification. Overall, the results showed that wheat planting
    dates could be determined successfully from climate information obtained in the
    first 300 days with the help of machine learning techniques combined with feature
    selection using genetic algorithm, which will prevent low productivity, financial
    and labor loss as a result of inaccurate planting date (Table 2 and Fig. 9). Table

    Full size image 6 Conclusion and future enhancement Machine learning has so much
    more to explore as new algorithms and methodologies emerge in the future. In our
    paper, we manage crops. We intend to publish additional articles on certain States
    and encourage more scholars to pursue study in agriculture since it is the primary
    source of food in India. It provides 60% of the GDP. However, since 2022, its
    per capita water supply has decreased, causing several crop losses. There are
    also several farmer suicides throughout India, who work extremely hard yet do
    not get the desired outcomes owing to various causes. This document is a minor
    contribution to the agricultural industry, devoted to all farmers, to assist them
    profit from a new technology they are unaware it. Finally, as engineers, we must
    assume responsibility and contribute to the advancement of our community or nation.
    By using ambient, pH, and soil moisture sensors, crop prediction accuracy can
    be increased. This might suggest an appropriate crop based on the location’s market
    needs and neighboring farmers. Availability of data and materials The dataset

    Summary The existing study aimed to assess four soil moisture sensors’ capacitive
    (WH51 and SKU: S EN0193) and resistive (Yl69 and IC Station) abilities, which
    are affordable and medium-priced for their accuracy in six common soil types in
    the central region of Iraq. The readings’ calibration for the soil moisture sensor
    devices continued through two gravimetric methods. The first depended on the protocols’
    database, while the second was the traditional calibration method. The second
    method recorded the lowest analysis error compared with the first. The moderate-cost
    sensor WH51 showed the lowest standard error (SE), MAD , and RMSE and the highest
    R² in both methods. The performance accuracy of WH51 was close to readings shown
    by the manufacturing company (1%), as the MAD amounted to 1.62%. Through both
    methods, the average MAD for sensors ranged from 4.76% to 7.36%, with this result
    considered acceptable, especially for low-cost sensors with insufficient available
    information for accuracy. In general, the average mean absolute percentage (MAPE)
    for all sensors was 25.54%, which means that the validity of the measurement for
    the l ow-cost sensors reached 7 5%. It encourages their use by plant breeders
    in irrigation, as the error rate was less than the specified depletion of 50%
    for available water in irrigation, where all study textures showed that the sensor
    reading reached the limits of 72 (±2), adopting 3% MAD for all sensors. The study
    affirms that, except for the IC station sensor recommended for irrigation use
    only in sandy-sandy loam soils, low-cost sensors have suitable accuracy for irrigation
    management. Keywords: Soil moisture sensors, gravimetric methods, calibration
    equations, accuracy, MAPE , WH51 Key findings: For all the sensors’ calibration
    through both methods, the average MAD ranged from 4.76% to 7.36%, and these results
    showed considerable acceptance, especially for low-cost sensors. In general, the
    average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) for all sensors was 25.54%, which authenticates
    the validity of the measurements for inexpensive sensors (75% or more), encouraging
    their use in the irrigation field by applying its calibration equation. Download

  description: The agricultural sector faces several difficulties today in ensuring
    the safety of food supply, including water scarcity. This study presents the design
    and development of a low-cost and full-featured fog-IoT/AI system targeted towards
    smallholder farmer communities (SFCs). However, the smallholder community is hesitant
    to adopt technology-based solutions. There are many overwhelming reasons for this,
    but the high cost, implementation complexity, and malfunctioning sensors cause
    inappropriate decisions. The PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project aims to make digital and
    innovative agricultural technologies more appealing and available to these communities
    by advancing the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box” concept. Considered a vital
    resource, collected data are used to detect anomalies or abnormal behavior, providing
    information about an occurrence or a node failure. To prevent agro-field data
    leakage, this paper presents an innovative, smart, and sustainable low-cost irrigation
    system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze anomalies
    and problems in water usage. The sensor anomaly can be detected using an autoencoder
    (AE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). We will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with time series records from the datasets and replace
    detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When integrated with an IoT
    platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling of sensor anomalies
    and can help create supervised datasets for future research. In addition, anomalies
    can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning approaches, applying
    CNN/BiLSTM architecture. The results show that AEs outperform the GANs, achieving
    an accuracy of 90%, 95%, and 97% for soil moisture, air temperature, and air humidity,
    respectively. The proposed system is designed to ensure that the data are of high
    quality and reliable enough to make sound decisions compared to the existing platforms.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract The agricultural sector faces several difficulties
    today in ensuring the safety of food supply, including water scarcity. This study
    presents the design and development of a low-cost and full-featured fog-IoT/AI
    system targeted towards smallholder farmer communities (SFCs). However, the smallholder
    community is hesitant to adopt technology-based solutions. There are many overwhelming
    reasons for this, but the high cost, implementation complexity, and malfunctioning
    sensors cause inappropriate decisions. The PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project aims to make
    digital and innovative agricultural technologies more appealing and available
    to these communities by advancing the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box” concept.
    Considered a vital resource, collected data are used to detect anomalies or abnormal
    behavior, providing information about an occurrence or a node failure. To prevent
    agro-field data leakage, this paper presents an innovative, smart, and sustainable
    low-cost irrigation system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    to analyze anomalies and problems in water usage. The sensor anomaly can be detected
    using an autoencoder (AE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). We will
    feed the autoencoders’ anomaly detection models with time series records from
    the datasets and replace detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When
    integrated with an IoT platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling
    of sensor anomalies and can help create supervised datasets for future research.
    In addition, anomalies can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning
    approaches, applying CNN/BiLSTM architecture. The results show that AEs outperform
    the GANs, achieving an accuracy of 90%, 95%, and 97% for soil moisture, air temperature,
    and air humidity, respectively. The proposed system is designed to ensure that
    the data are of high quality and reliable enough to make sound decisions compared
    to the existing platforms. Keywords: IoT; smart farming; anomaly detection; low

    to increase by close to 2 billion by 2050, causing a rapid escalation in food
    demand. To cater to the needs of the increasing population, the agricultural industry
    needs to be modernized, smart, and automated [1]. The food and agriculture organization
    (FAO) [2] claims that small-scale farming significantly contributes to rural economies
    and food security. On the other hand, smallholders usually deal with a range of
    restrictions that reduce their ability to produce profitably and advance the economy
    [3]. However, smallholder farmer communities (SFCs) have not benefited from adopting
    solutions to increase irrigation efficiency because of the high starting costs
    and the high skill levels needed to understand the technology. Recently, the fourth
    industrial revolution (IR 4.0) paradigm shift has ushered in a surge in technological
    innovation and sustainable transformation across various industries and sectors
    [4]. The innovative use of printed sensors for measurement and monitoring in smart
    agricultural applications has garnered considerable attention. Smart farming utilizing
    printed sensors is in its infancy and requires additional research [5]. Significant
    limitations restrict SFCs’ productivity and profit potential. As a result of a
    variety of crucial issues, including a lack of agricultural expertise, financial
    resources, climate change, and market access to address these challenges, we propose
    in this research a low-cost (USD 260) smart farming system for monitoring and
    prediction that will assist SFCs in forecasting future data in order to compute
    their water demands and properly schedule irrigation. The sensor component employs
    a low-cost design that is basic but sturdy and efficient, inspired by various
    do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives and previous contributions [6,7]. In terms of
    accuracy and error reduction, the system outperforms others. In this context,
    the goal of the PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project [8] is to increase the visibility and
    accessibility of digital and smart agricultural technologies among small and medium-sized
    farms. To meet the needs of this community, the suggested solutions must be economical,
    easy to implement in the field, and, most importantly, adaptable to current agricultural
    techniques. As a result, by inventing a low-cost, smart irrigation control system,
    INTEL-IRRIS hopes to transform the view that SFCs have of what was formerly highly
    expensive technology. INTEL-IRRIS also hopes that by using the “intelligent irrigation
    in a box” idea, they can make smart irrigation systems as easy to set up and use
    as home appliances, with a small investment compared to how much money they make.
    The main objective of this research is to improve on our previous work [3,9] by
    increasing the accuracy of low-cost sensors for data collection so that our water–soil–plants–climate
    interaction models will provide increased accuracy of predicted environmental
    factors to enhance the irrigation efficiency of smallholder farmers. There is
    a current need for our low-cost fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, that employs deep
    learning to analyze in real-time the anomalies and problems that appear in low-cost
    sensors. To reach this goal, we propose a low-cost, sustainable irrigation system
    that helps smallholder farmers manage irrigation more efficiently by providing
    a low-cost, open-source, autonomous, and easy-to-use smart irrigation control
    system that takes advantage of IoT capabilities, as shown in Figure 1. Figure
    1. “Intelligent irrigation in a box” idea of PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project. We will
    implement the “Intelligent Irrigation in a Box” idea by presenting a sensor/ control/actuator-based
    “plug-and-sense” system using significant technological advances from the last
    few years, including IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and decision support systems
    (DSS). This technology may be linked with existing irrigation infrastructure [10,11],
    allowing it to be controlled according to smallholders’ customs. Using sensor
    technologies, the provided platform collects critical physical phenomena such
    as soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity, water level, water velocity,
    and light intensity using a DL methodology. An unsupervised learning approach
    is well-suited for detecting anomalies, especially in cases with limited labeled
    time-series samples and complex, nonlinear climate and soil patterns. According
    to the literature, the most promising approaches for anomaly detection are Autoencoders
    [12] and GANs [13] in time series. The sliding window technique is highly appropriate
    for predicting future sensor readings through a supervised learning approach.
    Utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture, combining convolutional and recurrent
    neural networks, enables the attainment of a minimal estimation error for similar
    sequence-to-sequence prediction problems [14]. Consideration is given to a novel
    Fog-IoT-Cloud platform for storing, analyzing, and using vast volumes of acquired
    data to assist SFCs in managing the irrigation mechanism efficiently. This work’s
    main contributions are as follows: (i) The design and development of a low-cost
    fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, fully targeted towards smallholder farmer communities
    (SFCs) to enhance irrigation decision making. (ii) We provide a comprehensive
    performance assessment and comparison between the autoencoders (AE) and generative
    adversarial networks (GAN) to detect anomalies in environmental factors data.
    (iii) Predicting the most important environmental factors (air temperature, air
    humidity, soil moisture) based on field sensory data and weather forecast data
    using CNN/BiLSTM architecture to provide SFCs with recommendations. The rest of
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the relevant
    literature on irrigation systems. The INTEL-IRRIS fog-IoT/AI system, at the heart
    of the architectural design discussed in this paper, will be presented in Section
    3. Sensor anomaly detection for smart irrigation systems is provided in Section
    4. Section 5 describes the most important environmental factors that can be predicted
    using deep learning. Finally, conclusions and future trends are given in Section
    6. 2. Related Studies In this section, we present a review of the relevant literature
    on irrigation systems. Each of them has focused on various aspects of the irrigation
    task. As illustrated in Table 1, we categorize the studies based on the following
    criteria: (i) Underground sensing: the IOUT requirement emerges partially or fully
    buried underground for real-time monitoring and soil sensing; several essential
    irrigation characteristics include soil moisture, soil texture, soil salinity,
    etc. (ii) Environmental sensing: it is used to monitor important weather pattern
    changes in real-time. (iii) Geographic information systems (GIS): provide a potent
    instrument for near-real-time analysis of crop status. Ground-based equipment,
    aerial drones, and satellites all collect GIS agriculture data. (iv) Soil texture:
    on precision agriculture (PA), we computed the useable reserve of water (RU) based
    on the soil texture (clay, limon, sand, organic matter). (v) Machine learning
    approaches: it indicates whether the study considered machine learning approaches
    for intrusion detection systems. (vi) Deep learning approaches: it specifies if
    the study was focused on deep learning approaches for intrusion detection systems.
    (vii) Low-cost: the objective of the Intel-Irris project is to use low-cost sensors
    by dividing the cost by a factor of 10 to 100. (viii) Anomaly detection: the detection
    of anomalies is a crucial stage that will enhance the quality of results in predictive
    modeling and pattern extraction, enabling the identification of problems and facilitating
    decision making in data-based services. In our previous works [3,9], we suggested
    an Edge-IoT-Cloud platform based on a deep learning methodology for monitoring
    and predicting farmers’ ability to satisfy crop water demands when there is insufficient
    rainfall. Recently, Citoni et al. [15] published a review and analysis of currently
    available LoRaWAN-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) applications for intelligent
    agriculture. Vuran et al. [16] focus only on the underground factors; however,
    environmental sensing and SIG play a very important role in irrigation tasks.
    Optimizing water resources for agricultural production using an automated irrigation
    system has proven feasible and cost-effective, as proposed by Gutierrez et al.
    [17]. Table 1. A comparative analysis between the proposed platform and previous
    platform.   A few scientific studies focus on the application of data processing
    techniques to agricultural data in order to develop a more robust decision support
    framework. Roopaei et al. [22] presented an appropriate approach to identifying
    key parameters to schedule irrigation: the amount of water used was monitored,
    irrigation was scheduled on the basis of the canopy temperature distribution of
    the plant, and data were collected by means of thermal imaging. However, using
    the thermal imaging technique has many drawbacks that affect irrigation scheduling:
    different emissivities and reflections from surfaces obstruct precise temperature
    measurements, and most thermal imaging cameras have ±2% accuracy. Also, thermal
    images are difficult to interpret for specific objects with erratic temperatures.
    Aurora et al. [25], using unsupervised algorithms, devised and tested a three-step
    irrigation system for urban parks. By extracting prior knowledge using a multivariate
    approach, this methodology reduces the time required by univariate anomaly detection
    systems to analyze the entire univariate time series. Goap et al. [19] proposed
    a smart irrigation architecture based on IoT and a hybrid approach that relies
    on DL to predict soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensor data collected
    from recent and past weather forecasts to predict soil moisture. However, environmental
    sensing is not sufficient to make a good irrigation schedule, and the authors
    also do not take into consideration the crop coefficient and the soil texture.
    Chen et al. [26] suggest a new approach for making irrigation decisions in paddy
    rice farming that uses deep Q-learning and short-term weather predictions. The
    new method was compared to the widespread practice of flooded irrigation in southern
    China. The results indicated the reliability of the daily rainfall forecast and
    the efficiency of the Deep Q-Learning strategy for saving water. Boursianis et
    al. [23] discussed the AREThOU5A IoT platform subsystems and their primary operations,
    as well as the deployed layered architecture stack. Within the context of the
    AREThOU5A IoT platform, an innovative method for delivering power to the platform’s
    IoT modules has been implemented. Cheema et al. [24] constructed an intelligent
    system with multiple sensors and devices related to internet of things (IoT) technologies.
    In addition, they developed an Android application called \"Kistan Pakistan\"
    that allows illiterate and low-literate farmers to remotely administer its functions.
    Pham et al. [20] described a low-cost and full edge-IoT/AI system targeting smallholder
    farmer communities and how it can provide the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box”
    concept. It offers an “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the control component
    that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway and, as a result,
    does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP partner [27]. In
    contrast to previous research, the current study incorporates four factors to
    improve irrigation efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability, and the sustainability
    of agricultural production. In particular, we take into account the following
    factors: (i) soil texture; (ii) crop coefficient; (iii) sensed data with the weather
    forecast; and (iv) sensing of the subsurface parameter, in this instance, soil
    moisture. The objective is to calculate the requisite water quantity based on
    these variables. 3. Supplying Smallholder Farmers with Smart Technology 3.1. A
    Summary of the INTEL-IRRIS and PNR Projects As stated earlier, INTEL-IRRIS [8]
    aims to make digital and intelligent agricultural technology more appealing and
    accessible to small and medium-sized farms. However, a compromise will be made
    to accomplish the primary aim: to create a low-cost irrigation system that SFCs
    can implement out of the box. The soil moisture sensor component follows a basic,
    resilient, and cost-effective design that has been substantially influenced by
    several do-it-yourself projects and prior contributions [6,20]. Unlike low-cost
    sensors that often offer unreliable data, INTEL-IRRIS will significantly improve
    the quality of collected data with (i) improved calibration of various sensors;
    (ii) the calculation of the needed amount of water based on the farm’s soil texture
    and crop coefficient; and (iii) the prediction of environmental factors based
    on field sensory data using DL. 3.2. Smart and Sustainable Irrigation System Figure
    2 shows how the smart farming system architecture collects, transfers, and processes
    physical parameters from small-scale farming, such as soil moisture, air temperature,
    air humidity, water level, water flows, the intensity of light, combustible gas,
    etc., in order to improve irrigation efficiency by deploying a low-cost, open,
    autonomous irrigation control system based on IoT and AI techniques [28]. The
    irrigation scheduling algorithm determines the amount of water required to maintain
    the maximum production potential without wasting water (i) for a particular crop,
    (ii) at a specified time, and (iii) for a specific soil type. The following section
    summarizes the proposed platform’s details. Figure 2. Global view of our proposed
    operational architecture. 3.3. Hardware Architecture As illustrated in Figure
    2, the network component of our platform is supplied via multi-hop communication
    between box A (the sensor layer) and box B (the gateway node) up to box C (the
    fog layer). Finally, a virtual machine (VM) is created on the Azure cloud to deploy
    multiple anomaly detection and prediction models. In addition to using NRF24L01
    modules for wireless communication and Arduino boards as microcontrollers, we
    also intended to use Raspberry Pi 3 B+ boards as a fog layer. 3.4. Software Architecture
    Using open-source development tools, we created a software architecture to reduce
    bandwidth, latency, cost, load balancing, and scalability, as shown in Figure
    3. Using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, communication
    between the gateway and server is established. The TCP transport layer protocol
    ensures dependable data transmission (COAP uses UDP). Because of this, it is encrypted
    with SSL, supports quality of service (QoS parameter 2: requires messages to be
    delivered exactly once), and has a much shorter message header than HTTP. Figure
    3. Global view of our software architectural proposal. 3.5. Box A: Sensing Node
    The sensing node, which depicts the field data gathering tool, falls short of
    the total of USD 140. An Atmega328 microprocessor reads the output from these
    sensors. For around two dollars (USD), it may be used to construct a cheap design
    strategy for the Arduino. As seen in Figure 4, this box’s sensor layer devices
    are designed to collect data from smallholder farmers and transmit it using the
    NRF24L01 radio module, which is available for roughly 5 dollars (USD) and enables
    the supply of a radio communication layer with an SPI interface. The farmer can
    examine the data and keep an eye on the crops in real-time since the data may
    be kept in a private database or in the cloud to construct a dataset. Figure 4.

    and NRF module are in the box. Figure 4 provides a comprehensive description of
    the box’s sensors. We then set the NRF24L01 module to write mode and supply the
    destination address; we read the sensor values using the analogRead function on
    the data pins. The measured data are structured and transmitted to the IoT gateway
    every hour, where historical data are stored to detect anomalies at the fog layer.
    For the power supply of the sensor node, we used rechargeable 9 V batteries. Table
    2 lists the cost of all components. In total, a sensing and actuation node costs
    USD 260. A large portion of the budget is for the cost of box C. Table 2. The
    proposed platform cost. 3.6. Box B: Relay Node The relay node acts as an intermediate
    device and transmits the packets to the IoT gateway. In listening mode, we set
    up the gateway node by supplying the node address from whence the packets come,
    the channel number (122), and the data structure; if the data are received, it
    changes to sending mode, at which stage we provide the address of the next node.
    The power supply of the relay node was improved by using two AA batteries. 3.7.
    Box C: IoT Gateway Fog computing facilitates the operation of computation, storage,
    and networking services between end devices and cloud computing. Box C permits
    data to be transmitted to the internet network, but not for a total of USD 90.
    We picked a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ type board since it has adequate hardware resources
    for processing and is based on the Linux kernel, making it compatible with most
    languages and AI libraries. It needs a 5 V power supply, an external Wi-Fi 802.11
    card, and an Ethernet connector to connect to the internet. We used Python to
    create a concurrent TCP server (one thread per request), and we started by loading
    the prediction models from disk into the main memory (the kind of “*.tflite” files
    after the conversion to Tensorflow Lite). When a request comes in, a thread handles
    the receiving and preprocessing, resulting in the prediction. If we are looking
    for anomalies, we must compare the model outputs to an error threshold and provide
    the answer. On demand, we can also utilize the service to adjust the error levels
    of the various models. The server regularly delivers messages that include information
    such as the node’s IP address, available resources (RAM and CPU), and network
    latency. NodeJS listens on the serial port “/dev/tty0” at 115,200 baud. We extracted
    the measurements whenever new data were written to the port (separated by commas).
    We verified that all of the sensors were operational. This information is saved
    in the MySQL database for the time being. Finally, we produced a structured package
    including the latest six readings of each sensor, which had to correlate to the
    detection model anomaly entries. Then, we transmitted the latter to the Python-implemented
    service, which includes the various models; after receiving the answer, we checked
    for anomalies. An HTTP server configured using the “Express” module and listening
    on port 7000 sends the application pages to the browser. The route to each page
    is specified, and communication occurs via the “WebSocket” protocol. Every hour,
    a temporal event is triggered, which transmits the last received packet if none
    has come, allowing us to forecast it. The integrated Wi-Fi card is employed as
    an access point for configuration and adjusting the thresholds of anomaly detection
    models (leaving a means to reach the local network). Finally, data visualization
    from the gateway is required to assist the developer during maintenance. We investigated
    adding slave nodes that handle resource-intensive processing to enhance computing
    power and load balancing. The Raspberry Pi 3 B+ card’s Wi-Fi card creates a wireless
    network that the cluster uses to communicate. 3.8. Cloud Layer We suggest using
    cloud services to store significant volumes of data generated by sensors in order
    to guarantee the accessibility and availability of our platform everywhere and
    at any time. Furthermore, we use them to anticipate future meters, ensuring scalability
    and more resources when our platform is overloaded (elasticity). A free student
    offer was provided to us, and we will utilize it to create a VM with a public
    IP address that we can access via the remote desktop protocol (RDP). As seen in
    Figure 5, Influx DB offers a limited free cloud service, so setting up a user’s
    dashboard for data analysis and monitoring is straightforward. Figure 5. Monitoring
    and analysis of data on the cloud service. 4. Sensor Anomalies Detection for Smart
    Irrigation Systems Deep learning is becoming increasingly popular for tasks beyond
    image recognition, segmentation, and classification. Non-image data have been
    gaining more and more attention in recent years due to the advancement of IoT
    [29]. The main idea of unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series data is to
    identify whether data observations conform to normal data distributions over time.
    With this technique, we can discover patterns and anomalies that are otherwise
    hard to find. In order to spot unexpected patterns or anomalies as the data changes
    over time, it is crucial to comprehend how each variable within the time series
    affects the others. As shown in Figure 6, the received measurements are consolidated
    with the time series records in the local database. These merged data are used
    as input for anomaly detection models, which aim to identify any anomalies or
    unusual patterns within the data. The reconstructed inputs from the model are
    employed to estimate a corrected value for the abnormal measurement. The goal
    is to correct any inaccuracies or abnormalities identified in the original measurement.
    Once the new measure has been adjusted using the sensor value estimation model,
    it is stored back in the local database. This ensures that the corrected measure
    is available for future reference or analysis. In our research, the scarcity of
    labeled anomaly data poses a challenge. Therefore, GANs and AEs present advantageous
    options as they can effectively perform anomaly detection. Additionally, these
    techniques are capable of learning representations that capture both global and
    local dependencies within the data, enabling them to understand complex patterns
    effectively. GANs, in particular, leverage a discriminator network that can accurately
    classify anomalies. AEs focus on reconstructing input data and strive to minimize
    the reconstruction error. A threshold on the reconstruction error allows for the
    efficient identification of anomalies. Figure 6. Illustration of IoT gateway sensor
    anomaly detection and correction process. 4.1. Generative Adversarial Networks
    (GAN) Unsupervised anomaly detection using generative adversarial networks (GAN),
    as illustrated in Figure 7, involves training two models: a generator and a discriminator.
    The generator learns a model representing normal time series variability, while
    the discriminator learns to identify data points that do not conform to the normal
    behavior. The discriminator can then distinguish between time-series data corresponding
    to normal behavior. Moreover, using GANs for unsupervised anomaly detection in
    time-series data helps identify more complex anomalies than traditional methods
    since it can learn more complex dependencies between different variables within
    the time series (backpropagation). Figure 7. Overview of GAN structure. 4.2. Autoencoder
    (AE) Autoencoders are popular-deep learning-based anomaly detection models that
    have been observed to be reliable and effective. What makes this model so successful
    is its ability to reduce the time-series data to a lower dimension and reconstruct
    them in a higher dimension. As illustrated in Figure 8, this encoding and decoding
    can be performed with the help of different deep learning layers, such as convolutional
    layers. Then, the data are decoded to a higher dimension using an autoencoder
    algorithm. These reconstructed data can then be compared to the primary data to
    detect anomalies. Autoencoders have been a successful tool for anomaly detection
    in time-series data. Their efficiency can even be increased with the use of regularization,
    dropout, and noise-reduction techniques. Moreover, the autoencoder model is able
    to independently extract features from the input data, leading to better accuracy
    and lower computing costs. Figure 8. Overview of autoencoder network architecture.
    4.3. Problem Formulation Considering a time-series dataset 𝐷=[ 𝑋 1 ,  𝑋 2 ,…,  𝑋
    𝑛 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑛 , where each 𝑋 𝑖 =[ 𝑥 1𝑖 ,  𝑥 2𝑖 ,…,  𝑥 𝑡𝑖 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡 (for 𝑖=1,…,𝑛 ) comprising
    data obtained from sensors over a specific period of time t, the suggested model
    is trained with a subset of the dataset 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑘 which only contains normal
    samples, where k is the number of training samples. The samples for testing are
    𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 =[ 𝐷 𝑣 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 , 𝐷 𝑢 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×(𝑣+𝑢) , with v and u representing the number
    of normal and abnormal samples, respectively, and 𝑛=𝑘+𝑣+𝑢 . Due to the imbalanced
    nature of the time-series data, the size of normal samples is greater than that
    of abnormal samples. A GAN-based model is trained with 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 to reduce the output
    for each output 𝑋 𝑖 in 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 . After the training process as shown in Appendix
    A, 𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is passed through the trained model to evaluate it according to unseen
    samples during the learning. The trained generator can then generate fake normal
    samples from the noise vector. The discriminator model is used to accurately classify
    samples into normal or abnormal sequences. Autoencoders can be used as techniques
    for unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection. To train an autoencoder,
    this technique involves training a model on a dataset that contains only normal
    data. We use a supervised learning approach by dividing the dataset into training
    and testing sets. The training 𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and testing 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 sets are divided into
    input and output components by applying the sliding window approach. This approach
    uses the previous time intervals as both the input and output variables. This
    technique allows us to apply supervised learning to the autoencoder network. To
    evaluate the performance of the trained model, we used the reconstruction error,
    ℒ(𝑥, 𝑥 ̂  ) , which measures the differences between the original input and the
    consequent reconstruction. The amount of discrepancy between a reconstructed representation
    and the original instance is used to calculate the anomaly score. The larger the
    difference, the greater the probability that it is an outlier. Moreover, the cutoff
    point for identifying anomalies can be adjusted by employing cross-validation
    to determine the most suitable threshold (Th) for the reconstruction error. 4.4.
    Dataset Preprocessing The data used in this analysis were obtained from distinct
    sources, as shown in Table 3. These datasets were selected as they encompass soil
    and weather information and have the same hourly sampling rate to address the
    univariate anomaly detection and forecasting queries. The transformation for anomaly
    detection models involves three steps. Firstly, the time series are scaled between
    0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This is an important step as it helps the network
    learn faster and converge with ease. Secondly, the time series is split into training,
    testing, and validation data. The training set consists of the first 80%, the
    testing set consists of the next 10%, and the validation set consists of the last
    10%. Lastly, the training and testing splits are divided into input and output
    components by using the sliding window technique with sequence length 6 for anomaly
    detection models. Table 3. Description of datasets used to train deep learning
    models. 4.5. Implementation We implemented a Generator network to produce fake
    samples. As shown in Table 3, it consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM,
    and dense layers with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Binary cross-entropy
    measures the performance of a binary classification model whose output is a probability
    value between 0 and 1. We implemented a Discriminator Neural Network that outputs
    a score for each sample, indicating whether it belongs to the real or fake sample.
    This Discriminator consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers.
    To obtain a probability value, a Sigmoid activation function is applied to the
    final layer. We implemented an Autoencoder Neural Network that tries to output
    the same inputs with less reconstruction error. This neural network consists of
    one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers, followed by a dropout layer
    to help prevent overfitting. Adam optimization is a stochastic gradient descent
    method based on the adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments.
    In our case, we used the Adam optimizer implemented in the Keras/TensorFlow library,
    with a learning rate of 0.001 and β 2 set to 0.5. GAN models are trained for 2000
    epochs with a batch size of 128, and the autoencoder models are trained for 50
    epochs with a batch size of 8. After each epoch, the model is stored on the hard
    drive to select the best model before overfitting occurs. The detailed network
    architecture of the autoencoder model can be found in Table 4, and the detailed
    network architecture of the GAN is presented in Table 5. Table 4. Network architecture
    of AE model. Table 5. Network architecture of GAN model. 4.6. Description of Evaluation
    Metrics After the learning process, the best model was selected and evaluated
    using balanced class validation data that contain 1000 normal and 1000 abnormal
    samples labeled by agronomy experts. Table 6 summarizes the evaluation metrics
    of the anomaly detection models related to soil moisture, air temperature, and
    air humidity. Table 6. Evaluation metrics of anomaly detection models. The metrics
    used for evaluating the anomaly detection models include precision, recall, F1
    score, and accuracy. They are calculated as follows: Accuracy= 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 𝑇 𝑝 +
    𝑓 𝑛 + 𝑓 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 Precision= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑝 Recall= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑛 F1−score=2× 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
    𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 True Positive (TP): represents the number of abnormal samples
    correctly classified as attacks (correct detection). False Positive (FP): represents
    the number of normal samples wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection).
    True Negative (TN): represents the number of normal samples wrongly classified
    (correct detection). False Negative (FN): represents the number of abnormal samples
    wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection). Accuracy: reports the proportion
    of properly categorized samples to all other samples in the testing set. Precision:
    reports the percentage of samples properly categorized for all TP and FP in the
    testing set. Recall: the ratio of TP samples to the total number of TP and FN
    samples is known as recall. The F1-score reports the harmonic mean between precision
    and recall. 4.7. Results and Evaluation We trained a GAN model on soil moisture
    data for 2000 epochs, with an early stop mechanism implemented to stop training
    if the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN
    model for soil moisture at 5 cm depth converged at 500 epochs, while the model
    for 20 cm depth converged at 2000 epochs. Autoencoders were also trained for 100
    epochs, with models saved to the hard drive after each epoch. The model before
    the overfitting occurred was selected, with the models at epoch 38 and epoch 20
    being chosen for soil moisture models at depths of 5 cm and 20 cm, respectively.
    According to Table 6, the accuracy of each model ranged from 57.10% to 97.60%,
    while the F1 score ranged from 43.40% to 97.60%. Among the models, AE obtained
    the maximum accuracy and F1 score of 97.60% and 97.60%, respectively, while GAN
    achieved accuracy and F1 scores of 87.50% and 88.88%, respectively. The autoencoder
    error thresholds were set according to the 95% percentile of training data. As
    shown in Figure 9, we chose four-month time-series data from a soil moisture dataset,
    covering the time period from October 2010 to January 2011. Figure 9. Results
    of anomaly detection models on the soil moisture parameter. The GAN anomaly detection
    model identifies many anomalies in the normal behavior of soil moisture sensors,
    which may lead to false alarms for the farmer. On the other hand, the autoencoder
    model only picks up anomalies in the curves’ peaks that result from irrigation
    or rainfall. We trained a GAN model for detecting anomalies in air temperature
    for 3000 epochs and added an early stopping feature that would stop the training
    if the loss for the generator and discriminator remained low for 20 consecutive
    epochs. The training of the GAN model for air temperature in New York was observed
    to converge at 2700 epochs, while the training of the model for Philadelphia converged
    at 1870 epochs. Additionally, we also trained autoencoders for 100 epochs, saving
    the models after every epoch. The model that was trained before overfitting occurred
    was selected, with the models at epochs 95 and 87 chosen for air temperature models
    in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. The error thresholds for the autoencoder
    models were set based on the 95th percentile of the training data. This resulted
    in high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models compared to
    the GAN models, with the precision being similar for both. As illustrated in Figure
    10, we selected four-month time-series data from an air temperature dataset, from
    October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN anomaly detection model detects abnormalities
    in the normal behaviour of the air temperature sensor, whereas the autoencoder
    model recognizes the typical pattern of the air temperature sensor and does not
    detect any anomalies. Figure 10. Results of anomaly detection models on the air
    temperature parameter. We trained a GAN model for anomaly detection in air humidity
    for 2000 epochs with an early stopping mechanism in place to stop training if
    the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN model
    for air-humidity in New York converged at 680 epochs, while the model for Philadelphia
    converged at 1412 epochs. Additionally, autoencoders were trained for 100 epochs,
    and the models were saved after each epoch. The model before overfitting occurred
    was chosen, with the models at epochs 93 and 100 selected for air humidity autoencoder
    models in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. This resulted in high accuracy,
    precision, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models, which performed better
    than the GAN models. The data used in Figure 11 were a four-month time series
    of air humidity from October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN model identifies anomalies
    in the normal behavior of the sensor, while autoencoders recognize the normal
    patterns of the data and detect only a few anomalies. As per the model validation
    results, the autoencoder-based models demonstrated high accuracy and precision
    in detecting anomalies compared to the GAN models. To optimize the models without
    sacrificing accuracy, they were converted using TensorFlow Lite and deployed on
    IoT gateways. An API and a simple web UI were established to configure the anomaly
    error thresholds and alert end users of any sensor malfunctions, as presented
    in Figure 12. Figure 11. Results of anomaly detection models on the air humidity
    parameter. Figure 12. Configuring anomalies and error thresholds in the IoT gateway
    web application. 5. Irrigation Factors Forecasting Using Deep Learning As illustrated
    in Figure 13, the developed system incorporates various microservices, including
    anomaly detection, forecasting, and data analytics, to enhance farmers’ ability
    to make irrigation decisions. These microservices are exposed through the system.
    To provide the farmer with the necessary tools for monitoring and forecasting
    climate and soil measurements, we have implemented a time-series NoSQL database
    to efficiently handle the large volume of sensor data. This type of database is
    particularly well suited for managing time-dependent data and enabling efficient
    manipulation operations. Additionally, it supports auto-scaling capabilities,
    ensuring that the system can handle increased data loads if required. To provide
    accessibility to the system, we have deployed multiple web servers that host web
    applications. Figure 13. Illustration depicting the interaction between end users
    and cloud services within a system. This allows the farmer to access the system
    and its functionalities through a user-friendly interface. To an ensure optimal
    performance and distribution of user requests, load balancers are implemented
    to evenly distribute the incoming traffic across the deployed web servers. In
    the next experiment, we will test the accuracy of the soil and weather forecasting
    models using autoencoders. In the first stage, we will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with data from the datasets and replace detected anomalies
    with the reconstructed inputs. The obtained data are structured into sequences
    in the next stage by applying the sliding window approach. This methodology improves
    those observed in previous studies [3,28] when integrated with an IoT platform,
    as a tool for simplifying the labeling of actual anomalies, and can assist in
    the creation of supervised datasets for future research in the field. Prediction
    models based on deep learning techniques can also correct anomalies. We use the
    previous 24 records as inputs and the next 24 as outputs. This technique allows
    us to apply supervised learning to soil and weather parameter forecasting tasks.
    5.1. Forecasting Model for Potential Irrigation Factors Based on the previous
    comparison of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders (AEs) for
    finding anomalies, it was found that AEs are more accurate and have a lower rate
    of false alarms. As a result, AE models were chosen for the data collection process.
    This section aims to evaluate the performance of the forecasting models after
    applying data clearing and correction techniques, which are intended to enhance
    the data’s quality and reliability for accurate forecasts. Table 6 shows the architecture
    of the model. This architecture is a sequence-to-vector transformation, where
    the input sequence goes through a series of operations to pull out features and
    capture temporal relationships. This process involves using both convolutional
    and LSTM layers. The convolutional layers extract pertinent features from the
    input sequence, while the bidirectional LSTM architecture processes the input
    sequence in both forward and backward directions, enabling the model to capture
    past and future context simultaneously. Finally, the output of the LSTM layer
    is fed into a fully connected layer for additional processing and to generate
    the final output of the model. This architecture enables the model to effectively
    analyze and understand the input sequence, producing a condensed vector representation
    as the ultimate result. 5.2. Evaluation Metrics of Forecasting Models Based on
    Deep Learning Models When analyzing prediction models of future measurement performance,
    the following metrics are typically used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square
    Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are the three most commonly used
    loss metrics to evaluate the performance of DL models related to regression problems.
    They are given as follows: MSE MAE RMSE = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 |
    𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 | = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − √ 5.3. Results and
    Discussion According to our empirical study, the Adam optimizer from Keras/TensorFlow
    with a learning rate of 0.001 was used for training the CNN/BiLSTM models for
    200 epochs using a batch size of 32. The model was saved after each epoch to pick
    the best model before overfitting occurred. Table 7 displays the in-depth structure
    of the CNN/BiLSTM models. The model inputs a sequence of 24 previous values to
    predict the next 24 subsequent sensor measures. As shown in Table 8, the evaluation
    results for the soil moisture forecasting model are presented for two different
    depth sensors (sm_5 and sm_20). For sm_5, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model achieved an MSE of 1.2273, an RMSE of 1.1078, and an MAE of 0.999. However,
    a significant performance improvement was observed when 1025 anomalies were replaced,
    resulting in a notable decrease in MSE to 0.272243, RMSE to 0.52176, and MAE to
    0.4703. These findings demonstrate that replacing anomalies positively impacted
    the model’s ability to forecast soil moisture at sm_5 sensors, leading to more
    accurate predictions. In the case of sm_20, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model yielded an MSE of 1.70128, an RMSE of 1.3043, and an MAE of 1.234. Table
    7. Network architecture of parameter forecasting model. Table 8. Evaluation of
    soil moisture forecasting model. Subsequently, when 716 anomalies were replaced,
    a slight performance improvement was observed, resulting in a reduced MSE of 0.8740,
    an RMSE of 0.9348, and an MAE of 0.861. The decrease in the MSE, RMSE, and MAE
    values indicates enhanced accuracy in the model’s predictions for sm_20 sensors,
    although the improvements were comparatively smaller than those observed for sm_5.
    These results underscore the significance of replacing anomalies in the dataset
    to improve the forecasting accuracy of the model. The improvements achieved for
    the sm_5 sensors demonstrate the substantial impact of addressing anomalies on
    the model’s performance. However, for the sm_20 sensors, the improvements were
    relatively modest, suggesting that anomalies had a lesser effect on the model’s
    predictions in this particular case. According to the results, the autoencoder
    model trained on clean data demonstrated the best forecasting performance, as
    shown in Figure 14. The actual and expected soil moisture were nearly identical,
    with minor discrepancies at the 5 cm and 20 cm depths. Table 9 presents the evaluation
    of an air temperature forecasting model for New York and Philadelphia, considering
    scenarios with and without anomaly replacement. The air temperature model in New
    York, not replacing anomalies, resulted in an MSE of 20.1318, an RMSE of 4.4868,
    and an MAE of 3.497. However, when 1140 anomalies were replaced, the model’s performance
    improved significantly, with the MSE decreasing to 17.7633, the RMSE decreasing
    to 4.2146, and the MAE decreasing to 3.436. This suggests that replacing anomalies
    enhanced the model’s accuracy in predicting air temperature in New York. Figure
    14. Results of soil moisture forecasting models over four months. Table 9. Evaluation
    of air temperature forecasting model. Similarly, for air temperature in Philadelphia,
    the model achieved an MSE of 16.2342, an RMSE of 4.0291, and an MAE of 3.3 when
    anomalies were not replaced. After replacing anomalies, the model’s performance
    improved further, resulting in an MSE of 4.635611, an RMSE of 2.1530, and an MAE
    of 1.648. This indicates that anomaly replacement positively influenced the model’s
    forecasting accuracy in Philadelphia. Overall, the results underscore the significance
    of anomaly replacement in improving the accuracy of the air temperature forecasting
    model, as depicted in Figure 15. The findings demonstrate that addressing anomalies
    led to more precise predictions for air temperature in both New York and Philadelphia.
    As indicated in Table 10, the evaluation results of an air humidity forecasting
    model for two locations are as follows. In New York and Philadelphia, the model’s
    performance was assessed under different scenarios where anomalies were either
    not corrected (corrected anomalies = 0) or replaced using a correction model.
    In the case of air humidity forecasting in New York, the results show that replacing
    anomalies had a minor positive effect on the model’s performance. Although the
    improvements in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values were relatively small, they indicate
    a slight increase in the accuracy of the model’s predictions after anomaly replacement.
    Figure 15. Results of air-temperature forecasting models over four months. Table
    10. Evaluation of air humidity forecasting model. Similarly, for air humidity
    forecasting in Philadelphia, replacing anomalies had a limited impact on the model’s
    performance. The reduction in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values was minimal, suggesting
    only a slight improvement in the accuracy of the model’s predictions. Overall,
    the results indicate that replacing anomalies had a limited influence on the performance
    of the air humidity forecasting model in both New York and Philadelphia, as shown
    in Figure 16. Anomalies may have a relatively small effect on the accuracy of
    the model’s predictions for air humidity in these locations. However, the long-term
    forecast error was significantly high due to various factors that can impact air
    humidity patterns, such as air temperature, air pressure, wind speed, and air
    pollution. After validating the models obtained, they were converted using TensorFlow
    Lite to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy and deployed on the cloud.
    An API and web dashboard were developed to display and predict weather and soil
    parameters, as shown in Figure 17. Figure 16. Results of air-humidity forecasting
    models over four months. Figure 17. Estimating irrigation measures using a web
    application accessible online. 6. Conclusions and Future Trends This article introduces
    version 1.0 of the INTEL-IRRIS low-cost and fog-IoT/AI system, developed by the
    University of Oran 1 for SFCs. We present an IoT-based smart farming system that
    integrates anomaly detection based on autoencoders, demonstrating superior performance
    compared to GANs with accuracy rates of 90% for soil moisture, 95% for air temperature,
    and 97% for air humidity. Additionally, anomalies can be adjusted using reconstructed
    inputs from autoencoder models. The results showcase minor estimation errors for
    soil moisture and air temperature hourly forecasting models, indicating the effectiveness
    of our approach. The proposed solution improves the effects observed in previous
    studies and can also assist in creating supervised datasets for future research
    in the field. This platform will need more research that takes into consideration
    several perspectives: To enhance the accuracy of the acquired data, we will increase
    the accuracy of low-cost sensors using autonomous and remotely managed techniques
    to improve the different sensors’ calibration [32]. As a consequence, our water–soil–plant–climate
    interaction models will prescribe more correct measures. To enhance the reliability,
    accessibility, and tracking of sensors and actuators, incorporating a blockchain
    security framework is recommended. This integration will establish a strong mechanism
    for data integrity, availability, and traceability in the system. The design and
    implementation of precision PA-based Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
    like Lora and Sigfox. These approaches are designed to conserve energy, like the
    Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN), and enhance the irrigation efficiency
    of large-holder farmers. Offer the “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the
    control component that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway
    and, as a result, does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP
    partner [27]. Traditional deep learning systems need centralized data gathering
    and processing, which is becoming more unfeasible due to efficiency issues and
    rising data privacy concerns. Due to these qualities, federated learning has been
    a hot topic in smart agriculture. We intend to conduct a comprehensive assessment
    of the FL approach and the centralized machine learning models. Author Contributions

    learning 1. Introduction The optimization of agricultural management practices
    to improve food quality and crop yields is complicated due to complex field conditions
    that can limit the effectiveness of farmer management objectives (Haque et al.,
    2022). Therefore, obtaining information on the spatio-temporal variability of
    plant growth in agricultural fields is becoming increasingly important (Ilniyaz
    et al., 2022). Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a vegetation attribute that is strongly
    correlated with crop vegetation development (Gao et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2022)
    and associated with various climatic conditions including rainfall events, air
    temperature and solar radiation (Jaroensutasinee et al., 2023). It is used in
    various applications, including evapotranspiration modeling, crop development
    monitoring, genotype selection, phenotyping, pesticide application, climate change
    analysis, and photosynthesis capacity determination (Chen et al., 2022; Gao et
    al., 2022a,b; Liu et al., 2021a; Qiao et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2022). Therefore,
    rapid, accurate, timely, and non-destructive monitoring of LAI is crucial for
    effective agricultural management (Zhang et al., 2022). Currently, approaches
    for determining LAI through ground observation can be categorized into direct
    and indirect measurements (Liu et al., 2021a). Direct measurements involve manually
    picking crop samples, removing their leaves from the stem and using tools to calculate
    LAI by measuring leaf area (Chen et al., 2022). Ground-based LAI measurements
    are destructive, labor-intensive, costly, and limited by small sampling areas.
    These techniques do not offer dynamic, real-time crop monitoring. While satellite
    remote sensing has been used for agricultural LAI monitoring, its coarse resolution
    limits its applicability for plot-scale management (Liu et al., 2021a; Ma et al.,
    2022). Indirect measurements use optical techniques, which are less harmful to
    vegetation and the environment and quicker and more convenient than direct measurements
    (Fang et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2019). Recent techniques for estimating LAI using
    proximal sensors, such as digital cameras (Mora et al., 2016), fisheye cameras
    (Zarate-Valdez et al., 2012), and thermal imaging (Banerjee et al., 2018), have
    improved the reliability and speed of LAI assessment. However, these techniques
    provide only point-scale LAI information (Comba et al., 2020). Traditionally,
    LAI monitoring relied on manual sampling, which cannot provide real-time monitoring.
    In contrast, remote sensing technology allows for timely, dynamic, and large-scale
    crops monitoring. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of remote
    sensing technology to estimate various crop characteristics, such as biomass (Zhang
    et al., 2021b), yield (Tunca et al., 2018), evapotranspiration (Gao et al., 2021),
    and chlorophyll content (Qiao et al., 2020). For LAI monitoring, many studies
    have utilized handheld radiometers (Gao et al., 2021), Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV)
    images (Gao et al., 2022b), and satellite images (Kang et al., 2022). Ground-based
    devices have the advantage of being non-destructive and accurate but are limited
    in their ability to monitor large areas continuously (Ma et al., 2022). Satellite
    images have potential for crop LAI monitoring, but their coarse resolution makes
    them better suited for forest LAI monitoring. Compared to satellite platforms,
    UAVs have become valuable tools for crop LAI monitoring due to their ease of use,
    flexible flight patterns, and low cost (Liu et al., 2021a). Many researchers have
    used UAVs equipped with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors for agricultural
    LAI monitoring. Yao et al. (2017) demonstrated that the modified triangular vegetation
    index (MTVI2) obtained from multispectral UAV images effectively estimated wheat
    LAI. High-resolution UAV images have also been used to estimate LAI in a various
    of crops, including wheat (Hasan et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021a), rice (Duan
    et al., 2019), maize (Qiao et al., 2022), sunflower (Tunca et al., 2018), apple
    orchards (Liu et al., 2021b), bell pepper (Tunca et al., 2022), vineyards (Ilniyaz
    et al., 2022), mangroves (Zhao et al., 2022), soybeans (Viña et al., 2011), and
    sorghum (Gano et al., 2021). Previously, LAI estimation using remote sensing relied
    on a single vegetation index (VI). However, as crops develop, spectral VIs become
    saturated, making it difficult to detect changes in LAI (Liu et al., 2021b). More
    recently, researchers have used several spectral bands or VIs to overcome this
    limitation (He et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017). Furthermore, machine learning
    (ML) approaches have been employed in LAI modeling based on several VIs and other
    parameters significantly relevant to crop LAI. According to previous scientific
    studies, ML-based LAI estimation algorithms perform better than models that use
    only a single VI or spectral band data (Zha et al., 2020). They can fit nonlinearly
    connected parameters, exhibit greater accuracy, reduce prediction error, and show
    better generalization (Liu et al., 2021b). For example, Tang et al. (2022) used
    support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and back propagation neural
    network (BPNN) to build a model for estimating winter wheat LAI. The model had
    high accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.83 and a root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) of 0.27 m2m-2. Gao et al., 2022a, Gao et al., 2022b developed a model
    for vineyard LAI estimation using RF, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and
    Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), and found that a hybrid ML model using RF and
    RVM with 9 input variables performed best (r = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.28 m2m-2). Qiao
    et al. (2022) used deep learning for maize LAI estimation using ten different
    VIs and found that the normalized difference red edge (NDRE) index was the best
    for LAI estimation. Du et al. (2022) built a maize LAI estimation model based
    on RGB-based VIs and found that RF performed best for both whole crop growth stages
    and individual growth stages, with a high R2 (0.71–0.88) and the lowest RMSE (0.12–0.25
    m2 m−2). These studies demonstrate that ML algorithms are effective tools for
    estimating LAI accurately. This study aims to develop an ML model for estimating
    the LAI of sorghum using a combination of multispectral, thermal, and crop height
    data obtained from UAV systems. The study also aims to identify the best combination
    of input data for the LAI estimation algorithm and to evaluate the accuracy of
    the generated ML model using ground measurements. 2. Material and methods 2.1.
    Study area A two-year field experiment was conducted on sorghum in 2020 and 2021
    at the Black Sea Agricultural Research Institute in the Bafra plains in Samsun,
    Turkey. The location of the experiment is at 41°36′N, 35°55′E, and it is 15 m
    above sea level (Fig. 1). The region has a sub-humid climate with an average annual
    rainfall of 717.9 mm per year, an average annual temperature of 14.6 °C and reference
    evapotranspiration of 860 mm per year. The soils in the experimental plots were
    alluvial and colluvial, with a total available water content of 177.2 mm per m−1.

    treatments. Crop height map (a), NDVI map (b), and thermal map (c). 2.2. Field
    experiment design As shown in Fig. 1, the total experimental field area was 0.1
    ha and consisted of four different irrigation levels: S1 (Full irrigation), S2
    (70% of the S1), S3 (40% of the S1), and S4 (rainfed). The experimental design
    was a randomized complete block design with three replications. The aim was to
    create differences in plant growth and development under water stress conditions
    by applying various irrigation levels, thus obtaining a range of LAI values. The
    S1 irrigation represented the total water needed to satisfy the crops'' water
    requirements. As soil moisture levels decreased to 40% of the available soil water
    content, irrigation was applied to replenish soil moisture, with 16 irrigations
    in 2020 and 10 in 2021. The rain-fed treatment plots were not irrigated beyond
    the initial establishment period. Specifically, in 2020, the rain-fed plots received
    a one-time application of 13 mm of irrigation water, and in 2021, they received
    25 mm during crop emergence. For the remainder of the growing season in both years,
    the rain-fed treatment relied solely on natural precipitation without supplemental
    irrigation. This allowed us to observe sorghum growth, development, and LAI responses
    under a severely water-limited rain-fed regime compared to the irrigated treatments.
    Soil water content within the crop root zone was monitored throughout the experiment
    using a neutron probe moisture meter (Model 503 DR, Campbell Pacific Nuclear).
    The neutron probe enables non-destructive in situ measurement of volumetric soil
    moisture content. Soil moisture readings were taken at incremental 30 cm depths
    down to 120 cm. Probe calibrations for the study area soil type were conducted
    as recommended by Köksal et al. (2011) prior to the beginning of the experiment.
    Irrigation was scheduled using the soil moisture data obtained from the neutron
    probe readings over the growing season to achieve the intended irrigation treatments.
    Continuous soil moisture monitoring allowed for the direct observation of moisture
    dynamics in the crop root zone under the different water stress levels. The experimental
    plots were 10 m long and 6.3 m wide, with 2.1-m alleys separating them. Sorghum
    was used as the test crop. ‘Öğretmenoğlu’ (Sorghum bicolor L.) sorghum type was
    chosen for this study because it is one of the most widely cultivated cultivars
    in the region. Seeds were sown on May 15, 2020, and May 20, 2021, in rows spaced
    0.7 m apart with 0.05 m between plants. The experiment was conducted using standard
    cultivation practices to minimize the effects of pests and diseases on crop performance.
    The sorghum grains were harvested on September 23, 2020, and September 27, 2021.
    2.3. Remote sensing data collection In this study, high-resolution multispectral
    and thermal images were acquired, and sorghum crop height was estimated using
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform consisting of a DJI Matrice 300 (6.3
    kg UAV weight, 2.7 kg maximum payload, and up to 55 min flight time) and a Micasense
    Altum camera (Seattle, WA, USA). The Micasense Altum camera has a mass of 357
    g, a resolution of 2064 × 1544 pixels for blue, green, red, red-edge, and NIR
    images, and 160 × 120 pixels for thermal images. The camera also has a DLS-2 (Downward
    Light Sensor) sensor that collects data on incoming light to the ground to calibrate
    the multispectral sensors accurately. Prior to each flight, the Micasense Altum
    camera was calibrated using a radiometric calibration panel to ensure accurate
    reflectance data across all available spectral bands. Flights were conducted at
    key growth stages of the sorghum crop. We used the DJI Pilot application for flight
    planning to ensure consistent coverage and image quality. The same flight parameters
    and camera settings were used for each UAV mission. Flights were conducted at
    a 40 m altitude, 2 m/s speed, with 85% front/side overlap resulting in a 2 cm
    Ground Sampling Distance (GSD). These parameters were selected to balance high
    resolution with efficiency based on the camera Field of View (FOV), plot dimensions,
    and the desired GSD. Lower altitudes and higher overlap yielded negligible improvement
    in spectral data quality. All UAV flights were conducted between 12:30–13:30 under
    clear sky conditions. Four ground control points were placed around the study
    area for geometric correction and registration of the UAV images, which remained
    fixed throughout the sorghum growing period. Crop height data were obtained by
    subtracting the digital surface model (DSM) from the digital elevation model (DEM).
    The DSMs calculated from the UAV images acquired after sowing were considered
    the DEM in the study area, while the DSMs obtained at each sorghum growth stage
    were treated as the DEM in the field (Zhang et al., 2022). Agisoft MetaShape software
    (Agisoft LLC, St Petersburg, Russia) was used for geometric correction, image
    stitching, and other pre-processing operations to obtain high-resolution multispectral,
    thermal, and crop height maps of the study area. This study utilized fourteen
    commonly used Vegetation Indices (VIs) for accurate LAI estimation in sorghum.
    The formulations of these VIs are provided in Table 1. Table 1. Formulations of

    et al. (2007) 14 The selection of these VIs was based on a review of prior literature
    that evaluated the sensitivity of different indices for estimating LAI in cereal
    crops. Vegetation indices such as NDVI, GNDVI and NDRE have shown a strong correlation
    with sorghum or similar crop LAI. The use of unrelated indices could result in
    an underestimation of LAI if they saturate early or an overestimation of LAI if
    they are sensitive to soil background effects (Liu et al., 2021a). 2.4. Leaf area
    index measurements The in-situ LAI values were calculated using destructive methods.
    UAV missions were conducted on the same day that crop samples were collected.
    Over the two-year experimental period, a total of 19 field campaigns were conducted
    (10 in 2020 and 9 in 2021) to cover all sorghum phenological stages. A total of
    228 sorghum LAI measurements were taken for two consecutive experimental years
    (120 in 2020 and 108 in 2021). Three representative sample crops from each experimental
    plot were randomly selected. The leaves of the whole plant were removed and attached
    to a white paper with a scale. The leaves were arranged on the paper sheet in
    a way that ensured there was no overlap between them. The paper was then scanned,
    and the total sorghum leaf area was calculated for each experimental plot. LAI
    was calculated using Eq. (15). The LAI values of the selected crops for each experimental
    plot were then averaged to calculate the plot-level LAI. (15) 2.5. Machine learning
    algorithms This study combined multispectral, thermal, and crop height data from
    UAVs with sorghum LAI measurements over two years to create several machine learning
    (ML) models for estimating the LAI. Five different ML algorithms were used: Extra
    Trees Regressor (ETR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression
    (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbour Regression (KNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XgBoost).
    These ML algorithms have been widely used in many previous studies (Gao et al.,
    2022b; Kira et al., 2017; Mastelini et al., 2022; Qiao et al., 2022; Tang et al.,
    2022). The 228 destructively measured LAI samples were randomly split into a 3:1
    ratio (152 for training and 76 for testing). The choice of 3:1 training/testing
    ratio was based on common practices for ML modeling with datasets under 500 samples.
    This ratio provided stable performance across 5 rounds of cross-validation. Lower
    training fractions resulted in poorer model fits indicating inadequate training
    data. Normalization is not always necessary in ML models, but when the input dataset
    features have different ranges, it can help improve model performance and reliability
    (Banda et al., 2018). In this study, Min-Max Scaling was used to scale the input
    parameters and was calculated using Eq. (16). (16) The Extra Trees Regressor (ETR)
    is a machine learning technique that combines the outputs of multiple decision
    trees. All decision trees are trained using the entire sample dataset, and the
    final prediction is determined by taking the average of all the individual trees''
    predictions. ETR works similarly to Random Forest Regression (RF), but the key
    difference is that while RF subsamples input features with replacement, ETR passes
    the entire set of input features to each decision tree. Random Forests Regression
    (RFR) is a highly adaptable and robust ensemble classifier built from a forest
    of decision trees or regression trees. The RFR algorithm is a highly accurate
    predictive modeling technique for regression (Niu et al., 2021). It is an ensemble
    method that combines the predictions of multiple individual models to make a more
    accurate final prediction. In an RFR, each model is a decision tree, and the predictions
    of all the trees are combined by taking the average of their predicted values.
    This process is done by sampling the training data with replacement and training
    a decision tree on each sample, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve
    the model''s generalization. One benefit of using an RFR is that it can handle
    both linear and nonlinear relationships in the data and a mix of categorical and
    numerical variables (Küçüktopcu, 2023). The K-NN regressor model works by finding
    the K data points in the training set that are closest to the point to make a
    precise prediction. The model then takes the average target values of the K data
    points to make the prediction. The number K is the only hyperparameter of the
    K-NN model that needs to be specified before training the model. The main advantage
    of the K-NN regressor model is that it is simple to understand and implement.
    However, it requires high computational resources, which is one of its disadvantages.
    Additionally, the KNN regressor model is sensitive to the K value, and if the
    K value is not set correctly, the model can produce poor estimations (Yildirim
    et al., 2023). An SVM regressor aims to determine the hyperplane that best fits
    the data by minimizing the distance between the data points and the hyperplane.
    The SVM regressor is a robust algorithm capable of handling high-dimensional data
    and complicated nonlinear connections. It is also highly resistant to overfitting
    due to its regularization parameter, which allows the user to adjust the model''s
    complexity. Particularly for large datasets, the SVM regressor can be computationally
    costly. SVM regressor is very sensitive to selected hyperparameters, such as the
    regularization parameter and the kernel function. Hyperparameters must be fine-tuned
    for optimal performance (Cemek et al., 2022). XGBoost is one of the powerful ML
    algorithms for gradient boosting. Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique
    that uses an ensemble of weak predictive models, such as decision trees, to produce
    a robust model that can make accurate predictions. The ability of XGBoost to process
    large data sets and high-dimensional data is a great advantage. XGBoost''s advanced
    features and robust predictive capabilities make it suitable for various tasks.
    For example, parallel computing capability can train large datasets in less time
    (Gao et al., 2022b). This study utilized PyCaret''s “Feature Selection” feature
    function to implement feature selection procedures and obtain useful information
    from highly correlated features. This helped exclude redundant features from the
    ML regression analysis, improving the model''s accuracy. Reducing the complexity
    of the model by using fewer features also made it easier to understand and explain
    (Ilniyaz et al., 2022). The feature selection process involved running an estimator
    as a first step to calculate the feature importance of the parameters, followed
    by excluding the parameters with the lowest importance and evaluating the model''s
    performance (Ilniyaz et al., 2022). Tuning hyperparameters is an essential step
    in the machine learning process, as the choice of hyperparameters can significantly
    affect the model''s performance. This study used a grid search method to find
    an optimal set of hyperparameters. The hyperparameters for each ML algorithm were
    tuned using grid search with 5-fold cross validation. The search ranges were:
    KNN (n_neighbors = 5 to 12), SVM (C = 0.1 to 10, gamma = 0.001 to 1), RF (n_estimators
    = 100 to 500, max_depth = 5 to 20), and XGBoost (learning_rate = 0.01 to 0.2,
    n_estimators = 100 to 500, max_depth = 3 to 10). The optimal parameters were n_neighbors
    = 9 for KNN, C = 1 and gamma = 0.01 for SVM, n_estimators = 300 and max_depth
    = 10 for RF, and learning_rate = 0.1, n_estimators = 300, max_depth = 7 for XGBoost.

    was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), root means squared
    error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). R2 values were considered as a measure
    of the proportion of the variance in the predicted values in the model. A higher
    R2 value indicates a better-fitting model. RMSE is a measure of the difference
    between the estimated and measured values. The smaller RMSE value, the better
    the model fits the data. The MAE is another measure of the difference between
    the estimated and measured values. Like the RMSE, a smaller MAE value indicates
    a better-fitting model (Küçüktopcu et al., 2023). R2, RMSE and MAE were calculated
    using Eqs. (17), (18), (19). (17) (18) (19) 3. Results 3.1. Leaf area index measurements
    Table 2 presents the statistical data for sorghum LAI measurements under different
    irrigation treatments. The LAI values were significantly higher in the S1 irrigation
    treatment compared to the other three treatments (p < 0.05). The S2 irrigation
    treatment had a slightly lower LAI value than the S1 irrigation treatment. However,
    it was still significantly higher than the S4 irrigation treatment (p < 0.05),
    but there was no significant difference between the S3 irrigation treatments (p
    > 0.05). The lowest LAI values were observed in the S3 and S4 irrigation treatments,
    and significant differences were found between the two (p < 0.05). Table 2. Destructive

    steadily over the first seven weeks, reaching a maximum of 9.7 (S1) and 8.4 (S4)
    on DAS 91. After this peak, LAI began to decline, falling to 6.7 for S1 and 4.6
    for S4 by the end of the season. A similar trend was observed in 2021, with LAI
    peaking on day 97 (10.8 for S1 and 7.8 for S4) and then decreasing to 8.4 for
    S1 and 7.4 for S4. Download : Download high-res image (425KB) Download : Download

    PyCaret''s feature selection function was employed to investigate the impact of
    input parameters on the sorghum LAI estimation model. The results of the feature
    importance analysis, as shown in Fig. 4, indicate that NDVI_Hc (NDVIxHc) was the
    most influential feature, followed by SAVI and GNDVI. The least important feature
    was B2 (Green). Furthermore, vegetation indices calculated using multiple spectral
    band data generally exhibited greater importance than single-band data. The results
    also revealed that B6 (thermal) had lower importance compared to VIs. According
    to Mayer et al. (2022), a subset of features was selected based on feature importance
    values that exceeded 0.05. These variable feature importance results led to the
    utilization of the following parameters for constructing ML models: NDVI_Hc, SAVI,
    GNDVI, NDRE, NDVI, SR, RBNDVI, and B5 (near-infrared). Download : Download high-res

    the results, the K-NN and ETR algorithms had the lowest MAE values, at 0.197 and
    0.198, respectively. Both algorithms also achieved a high R2 value of 0.97. The
    RMSE values for K-NN and ETR were 0.46 and 0.49, respectively. The XGBoost algorithm
    had a slightly higher MAE of 0.47 and RMSE of 0.64, with a lower R2 value of 0.95.
    The RFR had a higher MAE of 0.52, RMSE of 0.67, and a slightly lower R2 value
    of 0.94. The SVR algorithm had the highest MAE and RMSE values, at 0.69 and 0.88,

    (ML) models employed accurately estimated sorghum LAI values, as evidenced by
    the proximity of the scatter points to the 1:1 line in the figures. However, there
    were some cases in which the ML models overestimated or underestimated the sorghum
    LAI by a magnitude greater than 5. Additionally, it was noted that the ML models
    used in this study tended to overestimate lower sorghum LAI values. 4. Discussions
    4.1. Leaf area index results The present study aims to investigate the impact
    of different irrigation amounts on changes in the LAI of sorghum plants. The study
    results demonstrate that as the irrigation amount increased, the LAI values of
    the sorghum plants also increased. Conversely, the LAI values of the water-stressed
    plots decreased. These findings suggest that treatment S1 is the most effective
    in maintaining a high LAI, followed by treatment S2. On the other hand, treatments
    S3 and S4 were sufficient for maintaining lower LAI values. A previous study conducted
    by Tunsagool et al. (2022) has shown that water deficit stress can induce abiotic
    effects in plants. Aydinsakir et al. (2021) stated that different irrigation amounts
    significantly affected the LAI of sorghum plants. They observed that increasing
    irrigation deficiency led to a decrease in sorghum LAI, which is consistent with
    the results of the current study. In this study, the LAI values of the sorghum
    plants ranged from 0.3 m2m-2 to 11.2 m2m-2. These values are similar to the maximum
    LAI value of 9.51 reported by Bendorf et al. (2022). Aydinsakir et al. (2021)
    calculated a maximum LAI of 15 m2m-2 in the first year of their experiment and
    16.1 m2m-2 in the second year. Differences could be attributed to errors in destructive
    LAI measurement due to factors like incomplete leaf collection, tools used, and
    assumptions in calculations (Chen and Black, 1992). 4.2. Feature selection Input
    selection for ML models is crucial in achieving high-accuracy results and avoiding
    overfitting. In addition to identifying input parameters that are highly correlated
    with the target variable, feature selection can also reduce production time and
    cost. This study used the PyCaret feature selection function to select appropriate
    inputs for sorghum LAI estimation. The results of the feature importance analysis
    showed that certain features, such as NDVI_Hc and vegetation indices calculated
    from multiple spectral bands, had a more significant influence on the sorghum
    LAI estimation model than others. NDVI, a measure of plant greenness, reflects
    crops'' chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity. NDVI''s sensitivity to
    leaf density in sorghum makes it a vital indicator of LAI. As sorghum leaves expand,
    there is an increase in the absorption of red light and reflection of near-infrared
    light, enhancing NDVI values. This trend aligns with LAI, as both are indicators
    of the crop''s vegetative vigor. Empirical studies corroborate this, showing a
    strong correlation between NDVI and LAI in sorghum. This verifies our selection
    of NDVI as a primary feature for LAI prediction in our models. Canopy height is
    directly linked to plant growth and biomass in sorghum. It provides a physical
    dimension of the crop''s development, supplementing the spectral information from
    NDVI. Integrating canopy height with NDVI offers a more comprehensive view of
    sorghum''s condition. In our machine-learning models, canopy height helps capture
    the physical growth patterns of the crop, which might not be entirely detectable
    through spectral indices. This dual approach enhances the model''s capability
    to estimate LAI accurately, demonstrating the importance of including NDVI and
    canopy height as features in our analysis. These findings are consistent with
    the results of Zhang et al. (2022), who reported that LAI estimation accuracy
    using VIs + Hc was higher than using only VIs. However, the B6 (thermal) feature
    had lower importance. Stobbelaar et al. (2022) found that LAI has a weak correlation
    with thermal data, while Liu et al. (2021a) found that thermal information improved
    model accuracy. These differences may be attributed to variations in plant species,
    environmental conditions, and used sensors. 4.3. Machine learning model results
    The primary objective of this study was to assess the performance of five ML algorithms
    for estimating sorghum LAI using multispectral UAV images and crop height estimations.
    The algorithms examined were k-NN, XGBoost, RFR, SVR, and ETR. The performance
    of each algorithm was evaluated using the metrics MAE, RMSE, and R2. The results
    of this study showed that the K-NN and ETR algorithms had the highest accuracy
    for estimating sorghum LAI. Both algorithms had low MAE and RMSE values and high
    R2 values, indicating a strong correlation between the estimated and measured
    sorghum LAI values. The XGBoost and RFR algorithms also performed well, with moderate
    MAE and RMSE values and high R2 values, but did not perform as well as the K-NN
    and ETR algorithms. The SVR algorithm had the lowest accuracy, with high MAE and
    RMSE values and a moderate R2 value. These results suggest that the K-NN and ETR
    models have strong stability and generalization ability for sorghum LAI estimation.
    This finding is consistent with the findings of Khan et al. (2022) in their study
    on oil palm yield estimation. The superior performance of the K-NN algorithm in
    estimating sorghum LAI is likely due to its robustness to noisy data and ability
    to handle high-dimensional data. On the other hand, the effectiveness of the ETR
    algorithm in estimating sorghum LAI may be attributed to the generally better
    performance of tree-based ML algorithms compared to other baseline models (Khan
    et al., 2022). The lower accuracy of the SVM model compared to the K-NN and ETR
    models in sorghum LAI estimation may be related to the core challenge of SVM,
    which involves determining the kernel function and related parameters. The selection
    of these parameters, such as the kernel function and penalty factor, can be limited,
    which may contribute to the lower accuracy of the SVM model (Tang et al., 2022).
    Accurately estimating LAI is essential for understanding the growth and health
    status of sorghum crops, as LAI is closely related to photosynthesis and plant
    growth. ML algorithms enable rapid and accurate estimation of sorghum LAI, saving
    time and resources compared to traditional methods such as destructive measurements.
    One potential limitation of this study is that estimated sorghum LAI values greater
    than five m2m−2 showed higher dispersion. This discrepancy could be attributed
    to the limited number of higher LAI values in the dataset used to train and validate
    the ML models. Previous research by Liu et al. (2021a) has demonstrated that the
    data''s sample size and diversity can significantly impact model performance.
    It is crucial to ensure that the dataset used for model training and validation
    represents the full range of LAI values the model may encounter in real-world
    applications. In addition to the dispersion of higher LAI values, the ML algorithms
    used in this study tended to overestimate lower sorghum LAI values (0–2 m2m-2).
    This could be due to the lack of pixel segmentation, which may negatively impact
    sorghum LAI estimation, particularly in early growth stages. Du et al. (2022)
    also found that pixel segmentation is significant for achieving high accuracy
    in LAI estimation. Further research and dataset diversification may help address
    these limitations and improve the accuracy of sorghum LAI estimation using ML
    algorithms. 5. Conclusion This study aimed to evaluate the potential of high-resolution
    UAV data and ML models for estimating the LAI of sorghum. A two-year field experiment
    was conducted, during which LAI values were measured using destructive methods,
    and high-resolution UAV data were collected for input into the ML model. The ML
    algorithms tested included K-NN, ETR, XGBoost, RF, and SVR. The results showed
    that K-NN had the best performance, followed by ETR. Feature selection analysis
    indicated that the combination of NDVI and canopy height was the most important
    predictor, followed by SAVI and GNDVI. Additionally, using VIs calculated from
    multiple spectral bands was more effective than using single bands alone. These
    findings suggest that multispectral UAV images and ML models can be valuable tools
    for efficiently and accurately estimating LAI in sorghum, supporting precision
    agriculture applications. Moreover, the study suggests that using low-cost UAVs
    equipped with multispectral sensors may be a cost-effective and reliable method
    for LAI estimation using ML models. In future research, it would be worthwhile
    to investigate the effect of different UAV flight heights and image shooting angles
    on LAI estimation. Additionally, as canopy height is a crucial predictor of LAI,
    further studies could focus on using LIDAR sensors for LAI estimation in sorghum
    and exploring other machine-learning algorithms. The potential of deep learning
    techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning methods,
    holds promise for handling complex, high-dimensional UAV data more effectively.
    Additionally, applying these refined algorithms to various crop types beyond sorghum
    could provide invaluable insights. This expansion would test the generalizability
    and adaptability of the developed models and contribute to a broader understanding
    of crop-specific nuances in LAI estimation. Furthermore, a critical aspect of
    future studies should be these models'' temporal and spatial scaling. Investigating
    how these algorithms perform over different growing seasons and across varied
    geographical landscapes will be essential in assessing their robustness and applicability
    in diverse agricultural settings. This study provides valuable insights into the
    potential of combining UAV technology and ML algorithms for agricultural applications,
    specifically for estimating LAI in sorghum, which can contribute to more efficient
    and data-driven farming practices. CRediT authorship contribution statement Emre

  description: Rapid and accurate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) estimation is essential
    for water resource management of irrigated lands. Nevertheless, due to the significant
    uncertainties in the inputs of conventional ETc equations and the inaccessibility
    of their proper spatial and temporal distribution values, precision agriculture
    requires a more accurate evaluation of ETc using efficient methods. Combining
    remote sensing (RS) data and machine learning (ML) techniques has provided a considerable
    capacity for estimating ETc, which can address these challenges. This study aims
    to develop a framework for ETc estimation based on the four most popular tree-based
    ML algorithms, namely M5-pruned (M5P), random forest regression (RFR), gradient-boosted
    regression trees (GBRT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). For this purpose,
    multisource RS data and meteorological and ground measurements (Meteo-GM) were
    used during three growing seasons (2018–2021) in irrigated croplands of the Sugarcane
    & By-Products Development Company in Khuzestan, southwest Iran. Since the unavailability
    of optical sensors, e.g., Landsat-8 data, in cloudy conditions restricts their
    enduring application, an alternative approach employing the Sentinel-1 Synthetic
    Aperture Radar (SAR) data for ETc estimation was also proposed. A set of 23 scenarios
    of various unique combinations of the available parameters was developed to ensure
    that a proper decision could be made for ETc estimation under any conditions.
    Eventually, the contribution of the input variables to estimate ETc was evaluated
    using the Sobol sensitivity analysis. The results showed that the RFR algorithm
    provided the most accurate ETc estimation in all scenarios, followed by the XGBoost,
    GBRT, and M5P algorithms (R2 = 0.92–0.99, RMSE = 2.02–0.32 mm d-1). The Meteo-GM
    models’ performances were improved by incorporating optical and thermal infrared
    (TIR) (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.32 mm d-1) and SAR (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.65 mm d-1)
    RS data. In addition, Sobol's sensitivity analysis revealed that maximum temperature,
    wind speed, pan evaporation, leaf area index, moisture stress index, and inverse
    dual-pol diagonal distance were the most influential input variables in the ETc
    estimation. This study can be used as a reference to simplify the ETc calculations
    using a novel application of ML as a helpful basis for precision irrigation management
    from the point to the regional scale in any weather conditions.

    and content Highlights • A comprehensive crop evapotranspiration (ETc) investigation
    was performed using different input variables from the point to the regional scale.
    • Two approaches were suggested to estimate ETc in data-deficient areas based
    on the RFR algorithm using optical, thermal, and SAR remote sensing data. • ETc
    was significantly correlated with optical and dual-polarization synthetic-aperture
    radar (SAR) vegetation indices. • Using D1609 and MSI in the ETc estimation was
    more accurate than NDVI. • Tree-based machine learning models provided a reliable
    estimate of ETc in the study area. Abstract Rapid and accurate crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) estimation is essential for water resource management of irrigated lands.

    Recent research provides an alarming view on the world population that will increase
    by 30 percent by 2100 (United Nations, 2019). Therefore, maintaining and increasing
    agrarian production is a significant challenge for agricultural policy (Behzad
    et al., 2009). In many irrigated farming areas, irrigation, primarily consumed
    as crop evapotranspiration (ETc), is the principal water source and the most restricting
    factor for agricultural productivity due to improper precipitation distribution
    (De Vries et al., 2010). In this context, reliable estimation of ETc on a temporal
    and spatial scale is essential for irrigation scheduling, determining crop water
    stress (CWS), hydrological equilibrium studies in a watershed system, and stabilizing
    groundwater resources. ET estimation methods can be classified into physical-based
    and data-driven models. Physical-based models construct equations for ET by drawing
    upon different theoretical assumptions, including energy conservation, gradient-flux
    similarity, complementary relationship, and the Budyko hypothesis. Some physical-based
    ET models may contain parameter and structural errors (Hu et al., 2021). Conversely,
    data-driven models employ fewer physical mechanisms and use different machine
    learning (ML) algorithms, including linear regression (LR), symbolic regression,
    support vector machine, neural network, and tree method, to directly estimate
    ET from climate forcing data (Han et al., 2021, Hao et al., 2022). Also, the emergence
    of the big-data era and advancements in artificial intelligence have led to a
    growing interest in these models. Granata (2019) used M5-Pruned (M5P), random
    forest regression (RFR), and support vector regression (SVR) to model ETc in humid
    subtropical climates in Central Florida. The M5P algorithm used net solar radiation,
    sensible heat flux, soil moisture content (SMC), wind speed, mean relative humidity,
    and mean temperature and was the most accurate model. Ge et al. (2022) estimated
    greenhouse tomato ET using meteorological parameters using eight models, e.g.,
    LR, SVR, K neighbors’ regression (KNR), RFR, AdaBoost regression (ABR), bagging
    regression (BR), gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT), and extreme gradient
    boosting (XGBoost). XGBoost was reported as the best-performing model by selecting
    the input variables Rn, RH, RHmin, Tmax, and Tmin. However, data-driven models
    commonly necessitate a substantial quantity of observational data to facilitate
    model training, and they provide limited mechanistic explanations outside their
    capacity for fitting. Also, these models do not consider the influential factors
    in ETc estimation, such as vegetation conditions, plant diseases, and irrigation
    and fertilizer management. The advent of remote sensing (RS) technology has significantly
    facilitated the implementation of some ET methods, as the land surface parameters
    obtained through RS over extended periods can serve as inputs to different ML
    models (Zhang et al., 2016). Based on the data employed, ETc models derived from
    RS fall into two categories: statistical methods dependent on vegetation index
    (VI) and comparatively more intricate models derived from the surface energy balance
    (SEB) equation. Though the SEB method has been stated as an efficient approach,
    it is challenging because minor mistakes in estimating the land surface temperature
    (LST) lead to significant errors in evaluating sensible heat flux. Moreover, only
    a handful of sensors provide thermal infrared (TIR) data in an open-source format
    (Bai, 2023). In this regard, approaches based on VIs were presented to estimate
    ETc to benefit from RS data while preventing the challenges of SEB-based methods.
    Satellite-derived reflectance-based VIs are valuable for monitoring plants and
    estimating crop water use based on growth stages at various spatial scales (Fan
    et al., 2021). Shao et al. (2021) reported that VIs could be used as near-real-time
    substitutes for the crop coefficient (Kc) because they describe plant development
    circumstances. Notably, Kc is a crucial parameter often required for ETc estimation.
    VIs can also represent the spatial heterogeneity between fields. Although integrating
    RS techniques with ML models to estimate ETc holds significant promise, several
    obstacles require attention (Abbasi et al., 2021, Liu et al., 2021, Mosre and
    Suárez, 2021). Optical RS methods cannot alone offer a direct and reliable detection
    to assess CWS and crop water requirements (CWR) due to the potential instrumental
    limitations, i.e., not using thermal bands (Nouraki et al., 2021). These limitations
    prompted the development of hybrid or experiential approaches for estimating ETc
    that combine the essential benefits of thermal and optical information (Ahmad
    et al., 2021). Mosre and Suárez (2021) developed LR models to estimate daily and
    monthly ETc in arid and cold regions. Their estimates based on a combination of
    RS data and weather parameters performed better than those based on weather data
    alone. Similarly, Liu et al. (2021) estimated ETc in South America by combining
    MODIS images and meteorological data using the RFR and SVR algorithms. The conclusion
    was that the RFR algorithm was superior. In addition, normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI), temperature, and precipitation parameters significantly affected
    ET estimates. Although these methods have been successfully utilized in several
    situations, these sensors could only make valuable acquisitions under almost cloudless
    conditions. This led to the reliance on radar sensing, particularly Sentinel-1
    Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which can provide continuous observation of agricultural
    areas under all weather conditions (McNairn & Shang, 2016). Various studies have
    applied Sentinel-1 SAR data to monitor vegetation areas (Bhogapurapu et al., 2022,
    Gururaj et al., 2019, Periasamy, 2018). There is currently a lack of significant
    studies that have assessed the utility of Sentinel-1 SAR data in ETc estimation.
    This indicates that there is still a need for further investigation to provide
    more insights into modeling and to develop an efficient analytical tool for operational
    applications. Overall, the radar-based vegetation features derived from the dual-polarimetric
    (dual-pol) SAR images are an emerging requirement for the research teams working
    on microwave RS for precision farming, forest management, environmental monitoring,
    and other relevant applications. In light of these issues, the main objectives
    of this study include the following: (i) To develop optimal models of distinct
    input variables for estimating ETc based on the ML algorithms to avoid using calibration
    parameters and empirical relations. (ii) To evaluate the potential of the RS data,
    including optical/TIR and Sentinel-1 SAR data, in predicting ETc spatially and
    temporally in all-weather circumstances. (iii) To assess the capability of the
    ML algorithms, e.g., M5P, RFR, GBDT, and XGBoost, to estimate ETc and determine
    the optimal algorithms. (iv) To use global sensitivity analysis to identify the
    order of importance, dependencies, and interactions between meteorological and
    ground measurement (Meteo-GM) data and RS data in ETc predictive models. 2. Material
    and methods 2.1. Machin learning regression algorithms Supervised ML algorithms
    could be divided into three categories depending on their learning mechanisms:
    models based on tree structures, generalized linear classifiers, and neural networks.
    In this study, decision tree models were selected to predict ETc for two primary
    reasons. First, decision tree-based models are one of the most popular ML algorithms.
    It has been widely employed in research and industry due to its high performance
    in problem-solving and less effort for data preparation during preprocessing.
    Secondly, these models are easy to represent visually and explain to technical
    teams and other users (Quinlan, 1992). 2.2. M5-pruned The decision tree is a data-oriented
    tree structure that produces nodes representing the algorithms. The M5P algorithm
    is a modified version of M5 (Quinlan, 1992) and a data-driven, decision-tree-based
    model developed by Wang and Witten (1996). M5P is presented to combine decision
    tree algorithms and linear regression functions in the leaves, which, unlike other
    ML algorithms, such as ANN and SVR, clearly explain the patterns and connections
    intrinsic to the data using rules and regression equations. Also, they handle
    high-dimensional datasets efficiently despite their simplicity. M5P first divides
    the input space into several subspaces using the standard deviation reduction
    factor (SDR), and then each subspace’s data is used to develop a linear regression
    model. In the next step, the nodes of the extended tree are pruned to prevent
    overfitting issues. Finally, the discontinuities caused by the pruning procedure
    are eliminated using the smoothing technique. Witten and Wang (1996) have provided
    a more detailed algorithm description. However, researchers believe single decision
    tree models perform poorly by reducing the amount of data and increasing complexity
    (Kotsiantis, 2013). Accordingly, ensemble learning techniques were proposed to
    improve the generalization and stability of individual algorithms by integrating
    several trained models employing the identical learning algorithm (Sagi & Rokach,
    2018). In this study, the bagging and boosting strategies were used to minimize
    the variance and bias of individual algorithms. Both techniques combine a group
    of weak classifiers to produce a more accurate, stable, and efficient model. 2.3.
    Random forest regression Introduced by Breiman (2001), RF is an ensemble learning
    method based on the statistical theory that combines the concepts of decision
    trees and bagging to solve classification and regression problems. The RF model
    overcomes the overfitting problem by training each single regression tree using
    the bootstrap method to resample the training data. The RFR algorithm generates
    multiple bootstrap samples with replacements from the original training data set
    (about 67 %) to create various regression trees (ntree), known as ‘in bag’ data.
    In comparison, the excluded data set (about 33 %) is known as ‘out-of-bag’ data
    (OOB) (Breiman, 2001). This reduces the model’s total variance and yields reliable
    results. In addition, the OOB samples are used to measure the variable importance,
    which indicates the predictive power of each variable and is used to optimize
    the selection of input parameters. Finally, the predicted value of an observation
    is computed by aggregating all decisions of the individual trees. Breiman (2001)
    has provided a more detailed description of the RF methods and parameters. During
    this process, four parameters need to be optimized in RF: (1) the number of trees
    in the forest (N_Estimators), (2) the maximum depth for each decision tree (Max_Depth),
    (3) the minimum number of samples on leaf nodes (Min_Samples_Leaf), (4) the minimum
    number of samples required to split an internal node (Min_Samples_Split). 2.4.
    Gradient-Boosted regression trees and extreme gradient boosting Friedman (2001)
    introduced gradient-boosted machines as a supervised ML technique. This approach
    is successively trained as a sequence of tree models, and the subsets of each
    weak learner are combined with a loss function and gradient descent optimization
    to produce a new strong learner. As a result, both GBRT and XGBoost adhere to
    the gradient boosting principle. A detailed description of the methodology and
    learning of the GBRT and XGBoost algorithms can be found in the literature of
    Friedman (2001) and Chen and Guestrin (2016). The XGBoost algorithm is an enhanced
    GBRT method that consists of several decision trees and is generally used for
    classification and regression problems (Chen & Guestrin, 2016). However, the XGBoost
    algorithm is distinct from GBRT in some aspects; a case in point, in contrast
    to GBRT, XGBoost utilizes a second-order Taylor expansion in its loss function,
    while GBRT only uses a first-order series expansion. On the other hand, the objective
    component of the XGBoost algorithm uses normalization to avoid overfitting and
    minimize the model’s complexity. Overall, both algorithms increase the weight
    of incorrectly classified training samples (with significant errors) and decrease
    the weight of those satisfactorily classified. The prior wrongly categorized subsamples
    are processed several times with increased vigilance to minimize the error rate
    (Chen & Guestrin, 2016). This last characteristic enables the XGBoost and GBRT
    algorithms to attain more accuracy than individual decision tree models. The hyper-parameters
    of the GBRT and XGBoost algorithms included n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_leaf,
    min_samples_split, learning_rate, subsample, max_delta_step, gamma, and colsample_bytree.
    This study used Python (version 3.9) software to build the ML algorithms. 2.5.
    Study area and Ground-Based observations The field measurements were conducted
    in the Sugarcane & By-Products Development Company lands. This company is the
    most extensive sugarcane agro-industrial in Iran, located in the Khuzestan province,
    southwest of Iran (Fig. 1). According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification
    (Kottek et al., 2006), the climate in this region is typically hot arid desert
    climates with an average yearly temperature of 22.92 ℃ and 2270.24 mm yr−1 of
    yearly evaporation from open pans. Precipitations are concentrated in fall and
    winter (Nov-Feb) with an average annual total of 203 mm. The soil texture of the
    area was silty clay and silty clay loam with a field capacity (FC) ranging between
    0.33 and 0.41 m3/m−3 and a permanent wilting point (PWP) ranging between 0.14
    and 0.19 m3/m−3, obtained using a pressure plate apparatus on soil samples collected
    in the area. In recent years, the area devoted to sugarcane cultivation was over
    800 km2 in the province’s southern region. Its local growth period ranges from
    nine months to more than a year. According to the region’s rainfall distribution
    and climate conditions, it is necessary to rapidly and accurately determine ETc
    for irrigation management in the area. Therefore, the meteorological variables
    and ground measurement data, including leaf area index (LAI), plant height (H),
    and soil water content (SWC), were used to estimate sugarcane ET (Table 1). Download

    station in the study area daily from 2018 to 2021. It should be noted that precipitation
    (P) was arranged with a 20-day delay due to the temporal rainfall distribution
    in the area. Soil moisture (SM) at the experimental location was measured using
    the conventional gravimetric procedure at 0–30 and 30–60 cm depths, representing
    the root development zone of sugarcane over the crop growth seasons. LAI, defined
    as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area, was calculated
    using a scanner. Sugarcane height, equal to the distance from the soil surface
    to the tip of the longest leaf, was measured using a measuring tape. The study
    area’s sugarcane farms were evenly partitioned into rectangular units with 25
    ha (250 m × 1000 m), and eight fields were selected to monitor the crop details.
    Ground measurements were collected simultaneously as the satellites passed through
    the study area at 24 control locations, three in each field, during the sugarcane
    growth period. Also, to eliminate inadvertent measurement error, each sampling
    location’s parameters were measured three times, and the ultimate mean value was
    used to determine the sampling point’s actual parameters. Based on the FAO-56
    model, ETc is computed by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and
    the Kc, which incorporates the crop-specific properties, i.e., crop transpiration
    and soil evaporation throughout the growth period (Eq. 1). For this purpose, the
    Penman-Monteith FAO-56 method was considered the standard method for ET0 calculation.
    This method is universally accepted for ET0 estimation based only on meteorological
    conditions (Allen et al., 1998). ETc = Kc × ET0 (1) (2) Where Rn is net radiation
    at the crop surface (MJ m-2d-1), G is soil heat flux density (MJ m-2d-1); T is
    the mean daily air temperature at 2-m height (°C), U2 is the wind speed at 2-m
    height (m/s), es is saturation vapor pressure (kPa), ea is actual vapor pressure
    (kPa), Δ is slope vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1), and γ is psychrometric constant
    (kPa °C−1). The mid-season and late-season Kc values were modified for local climatic
    conditions and crop height (h) using the below equations: (3) Where Kcmid-FAO
    is Kc recommended during different stages by the FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998),
    U2 is the mean daily wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1), RHmin is the mean daily
    minimum relative humidity (%), and h is the average plant height (m). The daily
    Kc values during the crop growth stage were determined by Eq. (4) (Allen et al.,
    1998): (4) Where: i is the day number within the growing season, Kci is the crop
    coefficient on the day i, Lstage is the length of the stage under consideration
    (days), and ∑(LPrev) is the sum of the lengths of all previous stages (days).
    2.6. Remote sensing data This study’s RS data for spatial–temporal analyses were
    satellite Earth observations (EO) from multispectral Landsat-8 and dual-pol C-band
    Sentinel-1 SAR sensor. Notably, the Sentinel-2 bands have a higher spatial resolution
    (10 m or 20 m) than the corresponding Landsat-8 bands (30 m). Nevertheless, since
    the physical nature of ET is highly reliant on temperature, Sentinel-2 data were
    not employed in the study due to the lack of a thermal band. These EOs were downloaded
    from the United States Geological Survey’s data distribution (USGS) (https://glovis.usgs.gov/)
    and the ESA Copernicus data hub () websites, respectively. The cloud-free Landsat-8
    images were preprocessed using the environment for visualizing images (ENVI) 5.3.1
    software (Harris Corporation, Melbourne, FL, USA). The preprocessing consisted
    of two main steps: radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction by the Fast
    Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) module (Matthew
    et al., 2002). In addition, cloud cover filters from the Function of mask (FMask)
    algorithm (Zhu et al., 2015, Zhu and Woodcock, 2012) were applied to each image
    to identify cloud and shadow pixels. Subsequently, the spatial resolutions were
    resampled to 10 m using the nearest neighbor technique (Lima et al., 2019, Zhang
    et al., 2023). Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products in Interferometric
    Wide swath mode (IW) with backscatter coefficients in dual-pol (VH and VV) were
    selected in this research and preprocessed by the Sentinel Application Platform
    (SNAP) to produce sigma-naught corrections through several steps presented in
    Fig. 2 (Foumelis et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res image (562KB) Download

    data using machine learning models. Over three years, a total of 110 Landsat-8
    and Sentinel-1 SAR images were collected and preprocessed using ENVI 5.3.1 and
    SNAP version 9.0.0 of ESA with the Sentinel-1 Toolbox version 8.0.5 (Table 2).
    Optical/TIR data and SAR VIs provide helpful information about spatio-temporal
    changes in plant growth and phenological phases, which can be subsequently employed
    to estimate ETc. Accordingly, these data can enhance experimental methods of ETc
    estimation spatially. Optical/TIR data are good proxies for representing vegetation
    changes and ultimately estimating ETc (Liu et al., 2021, Shao et al., 2021). However,
    cloud cover is a crucial barrier restricting the exploitation of these data, necessitating
    the employment of SAR RS approaches. This study individually used optical/TIR
    data (Table 3) and SAR VIs (Table 4) to estimate sugarcane ET. Table 2. Satellite

    for estimating ETc in this study. After preparing the data, Pearson correlation
    analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation coefficient and the order of
    significant factors in changing ETc. This is a relevant and dominant evaluation
    method whose outcomes can be a helpful reference for determining different input
    scenarios of the ML algorithms (Ge et al., 2022). Also, hyperparameters are the
    most critical elements significantly affecting the ML models’ performance. Thus,
    it is essential to adjust them in the algorithms. This study used the K-fold cross-validation
    (CV) method combined with grid search (GS) to modify the hyperparameters. K-fold
    CV determines the test error rate by excluding a subset of the training data (i.e.,
    a validation set) from the model fitting process and then using the fitted model
    to predict the validation subset. In this research, K was set to 5. Moreover,
    the predictor variables were randomly divided into 70 % for the training step
    and 30 % for the validation process to develop a reliable ML algorithm. 2.8. Sensitivity
    analysis Sensitivity analysis can investigate uncertainty in a model’s output
    with a greater understanding of the model’s function and potential interactions
    between parameters to evaluate input variables’ contribution to the modeling.
    Therefore, it can reduce model complexity, computational time, and costs. Sobol’s
    method is a variance-based global sensitivity analysis process that can evaluate
    sensitivity throughout the entire input space, considers the complex and nonlinear
    component interactions when determining sensitivity index values, and uses more
    sophisticated sampling techniques. More detailed descriptions can be found in
    the literature of Sobol (1993). The Sobol method provides three distinct sensitivity
    indices about model sensitivity: first-order (Si), higher-order (Sij) (e.g., second-,
    third-, etc. orders), and total-order (ST). These indices are calculated as follows.
    (5) (6) (7) where Vi is the contribution to Var(Y) due solely to the effect of
    Xi, and Varxi is the variance resulting from the contribution of all parameters
    except Xi. This study used the Python package SALib to calculate the Sobol indices
    and generate the samples. 2.9. Accuracy assessment of model performance Two widely
    used statistical indicators evaluated the performances of the M5P, RFR, GBRT,
    and XGBoost models in estimating sugarcane ETc, i.e., coefficient of determination
    (R2), root mean square error (RMSE): (8) (9) where N shows the number of the output
    data series; and are the measured and average of measured ETc, respectively; and
    is predicted ETc. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Correlations of ETc and variables
    Fig. 3 depicts the temporal distribution of daily ETc over three years. ETc ranges
    between 0.82- and 29.11-mm d-1, with a standard deviation of 6.84 mm d-1, over
    the whole dataset. ETc has lower values during the early and late growing seasons,
    ranging from 1 to 2 mm per day from October to December. The maximum ETc value
    in June, during the sugarcane plant development stage, reaches more than 27 mm
    d-, which is expected for a semi-arid region. Pearson’s correlation coefficient
    analysis (P-Coefficient) was used to investigate the significance of RS-derived
    data (optical/TIR data and SAR VIs), meteorological variables, and ground measurement
    data to ETc (Fig. 4). The findings indicate a statistically significant positive
    correlation between ETc and all meteorological variables, except for RHmax, RHmean,
    RHmin, and P, which negatively correlated with ETc. In contrast, Han et al. (2021)
    reported that the prediction model’s accuracy was optimal when considering the
    precipitation variable. Download : Download high-res image (254KB) Download :

    Correlation coefficients (R) for ETc, LAI, Height, VIs, and meteorological parameters.
    It was determined that Tmax, Umean, and Epan play significant leadership roles
    in the area, so they were selected as input variables in the ML models. Also,
    Tmax had the highest correlation coefficient with ETc (0.80). This parameter can
    be measured almost everywhere with basic and affordable instruments. Therefore,
    in addition to adding Tmax as an input to most scenarios, it was also analyzed
    in an individual scenario (scenario-3). Liu et al. (2021) used correlation analysis
    to investigate the influence of meteorological parameters on ETc. They found that
    ETc had the most significant correlation with Tmean. The analysis of correlations
    between ETc and ground data revealed that the most influential ground data on
    ETc were LAI and SM30-60 (Fig. 4). The correlation coefficient between ETc and
    LAI was 0.60, which indicated that vegetation growth was closely related to the
    crop ET. LAI is the interface of the biosphere’s circulation of energy or matter,
    reflected in plant structure alterations. According to Pereira et al. (2020),
    a higher vegetation cover results in increased absorption of solar photons by
    plants, leading to a heightened energy conversion through transpiration. This
    outcome aligns with Shao et al. (2021) findings. Based on the results above, incorporating
    SWC data as a critical environmental factor that impacts stomatal conductance
    and soil evaporation fraction can significantly improve the ETc prediction accuracy
    using the ML approach. Significant positive correlations (P < 0.05) exist between
    ETc and the twelve factors derived from Landsat-8, except for the EVI and Brightness
    variables. The correlation between ETc and LST, NIR, NTR, NIRv, Greenness, MSI,
    and NDVI is more substantial than this relationship with GNDVI and NMDI. Notably,
    this study’s optical/TIR indices are highly associated with vegetation dynamics
    and soil and crop water content (Liu et al., 2021, Mosre and Suárez, 2021). As
    shown in Fig. 4, the highest correlations between ETc and SAR VIs were obtained
    from IDPDD, DPSVI, and VH. Five spectral indices, namely VV, RVI, DPRVIc, VDDPI,
    and DPDD, failed the significance test (P > 0.05). Although the correlation between
    ETc and SAR VIs was weaker than optical/TIR data, they were analyzed as independent
    models in this research due to their advantages and usability in all weather conditions.
    Depending on the variable input types, three models were generally classified
    based on Meteo-GM variables, optical/TIR data, and SAR VIs. Then, different scenarios
    were determined from each model according to the correlation coefficient (Table
    5). Table 5. The combinations of input variables for the machine learning models.

    data Table 6 presents the results of hyperparameter selection based on 5-fold-CV
    for the RFR, XGBoost, GBRT, and M5P algorithms in different scenarios. Table 5
    details Meteo-GM-based ETc estimation scenarios, numbered 1 to 9. The first three
    scenarios only employed meteorological data; ground measurement data, including
    LAI, H, SM0-30, and SM30-60, were added to the subsequent scenarios. The RFR,
    XGBoost, and GBRT algorithms showed similar and effective performance in all scenarios
    of the Meteo-GM model in ETc estimations, while the M5P algorithm exhibited the
    lowest accuracy (Table 7). In all algorithms except M5P, scenario-2 (S2) ETc estimations
    were more consistent with the standard ETc than S1 and S3 (R2 = 0.92–0.93, RMSE
    = 1.91–2.01 mm d-1) (Table 7). This result indicates that ML approaches can satisfactorily
    estimate ETc with only meteorological parameters (Tmax, Umean, Epan). Moreover,
    excluding Tmean, Tmin, RHmax, RHmean, RHmin, Sh, Rs, and P from the input variables
    has no substantial impact on the effectiveness of the RFR, XGBoost, and GBRT estimations,
    except M5P. The Morgan-Granger-Newbold (MGN) test was performed to analyze the
    significance of the algorithm’s accuracy in S2. The results showed that the RFR
    algorithm has a significant difference with the M5P algorithm (MGN = 2.15) but
    not with GBRT (MGN = 1.93) or XGBoost (MGN = 1.87). As expected, the ensemble
    learning models, i.e., RFR, GBRT, and XGBoost, performed nearly identically due
    to the similar nature of the input variables and their limited variation. Table

    2.89 When LAI, H, LAI, and SM30-60 were added to S4, S6, and S9, the ML algorithms
    could produce better predictions than S2 (Table 7). The RFR and XGBoost algorithms
    performed best in all three scenarios, with R2 values over 0.98. Comparing the
    ML algorithms, the M5P algorithm with R2 values between 0.95 and 0.96 and RMSE
    values between 1.36 and 1.46-mm d-1 produced the lowest prediction accuracy, but
    it was still satisfactory. The MGN test revealed that the RFR and XGBoost algorithms
    differed significantly in S4 (MGN = 3.6) and S9 (MGN = 2.42) but not in S6 (MGN
    = 1.817). According to Table 7, the findings of S5 indicated that the performance
    of the ML algorithms using meteorological parameters and SWC without considering
    vegetation conditions was lower than S4, which does not include SWC (RMSE = 0.94–2.24
    mm d-1). Therefore, the superiority of using LAI over SWC in ML models for estimating
    ETc is reaffirmed. LAI substantially impacts the quantity of solar radiation absorption,
    significantly affecting ET''s long and short-term periods (Gao et al., 2008).
    Shao et al. (2021) proposed the integration of LAI in ML models for estimating
    corn Kc to avoid significant errors. Omitting the Epan and Umean parameters in
    S7 and S8 significantly reduced ETc prediction. The importance of these two parameters
    could be attributed to the fact that the sugarcane plant’s development period
    in the area coincides with the summer and high temperatures, which are inherently
    associated with high ET. Due to the sugarcane’s rapid development, which may reach
    more than 3 m, the warm local winds that blow over the area during this period
    can also play an essential role in ETc changes. It should be noted that S9, with
    all meteorological parameters, has provided lower results than S6 (Table 7). Therefore,
    it is confirmed that increasing the number of input variables does not necessarily
    lead to improving the ML algorithms’ performance. The Meteo-GM model’s S2, S4,
    and S6 were generally selected as this class''s most practical scenarios. Also,
    the RFR algorithm was identified as the best ML algorithm in all three mentioned
    scenarios based on the MGN test. Furthermore, M5P led to the highest scattered
    and residual values in ranges of 5–12 mm and 25–30 mm in S2, S4, and S6, respectively,
    and tended to overestimate ETc in these ranges (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). However, Granata
    (2019) reported different results regarding the superiority of the M5P algorithm
    over the Bagging, SVR, and RF algorithms in predicting actual ET, using flux,
    SMC, wind speed, RHmean, and Tmean as input variables. Download : Download high-res

    Violin plot for distribution of residuals in different scenarios (Scenarios 2,
    4, 6, 11, and 19). 3.3. Assessment of remote Sensing-Based ETc models The optical/TIR
    model included seven ETc prediction scenarios from S10 to S16. In the training
    phase, the RFR, GBRT, and XGBoost algorithms led to remarkably high values of
    R2, more significant than 0.96. In particular, RFR is characterized by the highest
    R2 and lowest RMSE values in S11 (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.32 mm d-1). Also, according
    to Fig. 5, the ETc estimates from S11 using the RFR algorithm against standard
    ETc were closer to the 1:1 line (Fig. 5 d), showing that RFR is more accurate
    than other ML algorithms, notably M5P, which has the highest residuals in the
    ranges 5–10 mm d-1 and 25–30 mm d-1 (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the MGN test results
    revealed a significant difference between the algorithms in all-optical/TIR model
    scenarios. Hao et al. (2022) introduced a novel methodology, titled endmember-based
    soil and vegetation energy partitioning (ESVEP-RF), for estimating crop growing
    season ET using MODIS data over 12 years (2003–2012, 2018, and 2019) from five
    flux towers in Nebraska and Michigan. This approach combines the strengths of
    the trapezoidal model and RF algorithm. The findings indicated that ESVEP-RF exhibits
    a high capacity to estimate ET precisely, provided an adequate and representative
    quantity of training samples was available. Nevertheless, the primary constraint
    of ESVEP-RF pertains to the requirement of crop type and planting date as inputs
    for the ESVEP model to compute various parameters, including accumulated growing
    degree day, height, and aerodynamic resistance. This data exhibits significant
    uncertainties that have the potential to impact the accuracy of the ET calculation
    significantly. Notably, the technique employed in computing the gridded instantaneous
    latent heat flux is applicable solely under cloudless circumstances. The optical/TIR
    model results showed that ETc could be accurately predicted by combining meteorological
    parameters with the spectral indices, considering the vegetation conditions. Meanwhile,
    the simultaneous use of meteorological parameters, optical/TIR information, and
    ground measurement data reduced the accuracy of the ML algorithms (i.e., S12-S15).
    This is consistent with Mosre and Suárez’s (2021) findings, which demonstrated
    that it is possible to produce reliable and precise estimations of daily and monthly
    ETc by incorporating RS data and meteorological parameters into ML algorithms.
    Notably, S10, which only included optical/TIR data derived from Landsat 8, provided
    satisfactory results by the RFR, GBRT, and XGBoost algorithms ranked based on
    RMSE values in descending order of GBRT > XGBoost > RFR, which is consistent with
    the MGN test results. Accordingly, optical and thermal RS data can reliably predict
    ETc in regions with inadequate meteorological variables to estimate ETc. This
    fact agrees with the findings of Abbasi et al. (2021). Generally, the main advantage
    of using optical/TIR information compared to ground measurement data like LAI,
    SM, and H is that they do not allow extrapolation of estimates to vast areas due
    to their point measurements characteristic. However, spectral indices like NDVI,
    NIR, NIRv, NTR, MSI, D1609, Greenness, and LST band could reflect vegetation,
    structural, and phenological conditions information and reveal SM and CWS spatially,
    which can be easily extensible to large areas. According to Table 5, the ETc prediction
    model based on SAR VIs was developed from scenarios 17 to 23. By comparing different
    scenarios in the SAR VIs model to estimate ETc, S17, using only SAR RS data, had
    the least accuracy in predicting ETc. In contrast, S19 provided the highest level
    of precision across all ML algorithms (R2 = 0.96–0.98). In S19, ground measurement
    data was used in addition to meteorological variables and SAR VIs, which may account
    for its superiority over S18. Nevertheless, S18 performed satisfactorily using
    meteorological parameters and dual-pol SAR data (VH, IDPDD, and DPSVI) (R2 = 0.94–0.97).
    Also, the RFR algorithm was the best ML algorithm in both S18 and S19 based on
    the MGN test. Fig. 5 (e) shows the scatter plots for the simultaneous use of dual-pol
    SAR data, meteorological parameters, LAI, and SM30-60 in the ML algorithms. The
    highest data dispersion was obtained in the M5P algorithm. In contrast, the RFR
    algorithm had the lowest scattering and residual values, leading to the highest
    ETc estimation accuracy (Fig. 5 e and Fig. 6). The current findings indicate that
    dual-pol SAR data, including VH, IDPDD, and DPSVI, can effectively describe vegetation
    changes during different growth stages, similar to optical/TIR data. This study’s
    findings are consistent with previous SAR-based crop growth monitoring research
    (Bhogapurapu et al., 2022, Gururaj et al., 2019, Periasamy, 2018). For instance,
    Chintala et al. (2022) reported VH as the best parameter for sugarcane growth
    monitoring. Also, the ML algorithms’ performance decreased by omitting Umean and
    Epan parameters in scenarios 20–23, demonstrating the importance of combining
    SAR data and meteorological parameters. The MGN test and Table 7′s statistical
    measures indicate that the RFR algorithm is reliable for estimating ETc in S2,
    S4, S6, S11, and S19. The results indicated that ensemble learning models were
    more effective than single decision tree models for ETc modeling. The M5P model’s
    structure renders its results highly unstable, as even minor variations in the
    input can lead to significant changes in the model. In contrast, this is not true
    for ensemble learning models, i.e., RFR, GBRT, and XGBoost (Kersaints, 2013).
    According to prior studies, the XGBoost algorithm was expected to perform better
    than the RFR algorithm (Ge et al., 2022). As in S2, where only meteorological
    parameters were used, a similar result was observed between these two algorithms.
    However, the RFR algorithm outperformed the XGBoost algorithm when the types of
    input variables were expanded, i.e., adding ground measurement data and RS information
    to the input dataset. Also, the RFR algorithm requires fewer hyperparameter adjustments
    than the GBRT and XGBoost algorithms, making it more straightforward for less-technical
    users. Overall, the main advantage of the ETc prediction approach based on the
    RFR algorithm and RS data is that it allows managers and appraisers to spatially
    and temporally estimate ETc in areas where meteorological parameters are not readily
    available. 3.4. Comparison of the spatial distribution of ETc To enhance comprehension
    of various ETc model outputs at the regional scale, Fig. 7 illustrates the spatial
    distribution pattern of ETc predicted by the optical/TIR-RFR and SAR-RFR models
    on May 21st and May 18th of 2020, respectively. These times were chosen due to
    the extensive vegetation growth and high ETc rates. As expected, the SAR-RFR model
    was highly consistent with the optical/TIR-RFR model at different spatial and
    temporal scales. Notably, soil moisture (due to irrigation), vegetation conditions,
    soil properties, and meteorological variables significantly influence the ETc
    variations in the area. Therefore, the high spatial heterogeneity of ETc at the
    specified times can be attributed to varied irrigation schedules and different
    growth stages in sugarcane fields. Download : Download high-res image (924KB)

    2020, respectively. 3.5. Sensitivity analysis of model input variables The Sobol
    technique was used to perform a global sensitivity analysis to evaluate the RFR
    algorithm’s dependability under particular scenarios (Fig. 8). Tmax, Umean, and
    Epan played the most significant role in the RFR algorithm’s ETc estimation in
    all optimal scenarios (Fig. 8). In S2, Epan was more sensitive than Tmax. In contrast,
    in S4, S6, S11, and S19, the Tmax sensitivity value was higher than Epan, and
    no significant difference was observed between them. In S4, LAI and H were moderately
    sensitive in the estimation process but less critical than meteorological parameters.
    Also, similar results were observed by LAI with a higher sensitivity than the
    SM30-60 parameter in S6. Although obtaining accurate SM in soil deeps is challenging,
    it had minor sensitivity to the RFR algorithm’s performance in S6 (ST and S1 =
    0.003). Similar to previous studies (Fan et al., 2021, Shao et al., 2021), Sobol’s
    sensitivity analysis reveals that LAI is the most vital predictor parameter from
    the ground measurement dataset, which can reflect long-term observations of plant
    phenology changes. Download : Download high-res image (425KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. First-order and total sensitivity for RFR models in (a)
    S2, (b) S4, (c) S6, (d) S11, and (e) S19. The error bar represents the standard
    deviation of sensitivity indices. As expected, LST was so sensitive that its impact
    on ETc estimation was comparable with Epan and Umean parameters in S11 (ST = 0.20,
    S1 = 0.18). Following these three parameters, the most sensitive variables were
    NIR, MSI, and D1609. S11′s results might be because the parameters derived from
    RS data describe not only the vegetation conditions but also contain the crop
    water content information. Another interesting result was the higher importance
    of these three optical data than NDVI in the estimation. This may be because NDVI
    exhibits greater sensitivity during low greenness phases, while it becomes saturated
    during high vegetation greenness periods, limiting its ability to depict vegetation
    growth accurately (Hao et al., 2022). On the other hand, Liu et al. (2021) introduced
    precipitation, temperature, and NDVI as the most influential parameters for predicting
    ET. Accordingly, LST, NIR, MSI, and D1609 are essential parameters for ETc estimation
    using the optical/TIR approach, which requires special attention for further spectral
    and spatial improvement. In addition to meteorological variables and LAI, IDPDD
    indicated higher importance than other input parameters in S19 (ST = 0.03, S1
    = 0.017). Notably, ETc estimated by the SAR VIs approach is affected by vegetation
    indices and meteorological parameters; hence, the simultaneous use of IDPDD and
    LAI led to better vegetation monitoring. Fig. 8 demonstrates no significant differences
    between the total and first-order sensitivity, meaning that the input parameters
    in each scenario do not substantially interact. 4. Conclusions This study developed
    three new methods based on Meteo-GM variables, optical/TIR data, and SAR VIs to
    estimate daily sugarcane ETc using tree-based models, i.e., the M5P, RFR, GBRT,
    and XGBoost algorithms. The estimations were performed under different conditions,
    including climate data constraints and clear-sky and cloud-cover circumstances,
    during three years in irrigated croplands in southern Khuzestan, Iran. Different
    scenarios were determined for each approach based on the correlation coefficient
    between the input variables. The decisive parameters obtained by the correlation
    coefficient in the Meteo-GM approach were rated as Epan > Tmax > Umean > LAI >
    SM30-60. The plant height variable was at the bottom of the list. In the models
    based on the optical/TIR data and SAR VIs, the correlation coefficient ranked
    the most critical input factors as follows: LST > NIR > NTR > NIRv > Greenness
    > MSI > D1609; IDPDD > VH > DPSVI. S2, using Tmax, Umean, and Epan as input variables,
    had the highest prediction capabilities in meteorological data scenarios, where
    all the applied ML algorithms performed admirably (R2 = 0.91–0.93). This scenario
    had the benefit of directly providing ETc without requiring crop coefficients.
    Also, the existence of Tmean, Tmin, RHmax, RHmean, RHmin, Sh, Rs, and P in the
    input variables does not confer significant benefits over their absence, so it
    is efficient in areas with insufficient meteorological data. Moreover, S4 and
    S6 simulated the most accurate ETc among the Meteo-GM approach scenarios (R2S6
    = 0.95, R2S4 = 0.96) by incorporating meteorological variables and ground measurement
    data (LAI and SM30-60) using the RFR algorithm. The findings indicate that RFR
    outperformed the other ML algorithms in clear-sky and cloud-cover circumstances
    using S11 and S19 with RMSE values of 1.51- and 1.62-mm d-1, respectively. Generally,
    the GBRT, XGBoost, and RFR algorithms showed nearly identical performance, while
    M5P was the least effective algorithm but still satisfactory. Sobol sensitivity
    analysis revealed that the Tmax, Umean, and Epan parameters were critical for
    estimating ETc in all models. The suggested methods help researchers better grasp
    the uncertainty in ETc estimation without impairing the precision of the results.
    However, applying these methods under conditions distinct from this study will
    depend on data availability for adjusting the parameters and selecting the appropriate
    approach. ML models have the potential to exhibit comparable or superior performance
    to complex physical methods, especially in the context of large-scale investigations.
    However, it is essential to note that these models lack the interpretability inherent
    in physical models. Therefore, it is recommended that future research endeavors
    explore the integration of ML and physical models at both local and large scales
    to minimize uncertainties and enhance ETc prediction accuracy. Funding “Shahid

  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

  description: Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has emerged as a reliable method
    for soil moisture and snow estimation. However, the applicability of this method
    beyond research has been limited due to, among others, the use of relatively large
    and expensive sensors. This paper presents the tests conducted on a new scintillator-based
    sensor especially designed to jointly measure neutron counts, muons and total
    gamma rays. The neutron signal is first compared against two conventional gas-tube-based
    CRNS sensors at two locations. The estimated soil moisture is further assessed
    at four agricultural sites, based on gravimetric soil moisture collected within
    the sensor footprint. Muon fluxes are compared to the incoming neutron variability
    measured at a neutron monitoring station and total gammas counts are compared
    to the signal detected by a gamma ray spectrometer. The results show that the
    neutron dynamic detected by the new scintillator-based CRNS sensor is well in
    agreement with conventional CRNS sensors. The derived soil moisture also agreed
    well with the gravimetric soil moisture measurements. The muons and the total
    gamma rays simultaneously detected by the sensor show promising features to account
    for the incoming variability and for discriminating irrigation and precipitation
    events, respectively. Further experiments and analyses should be conducted, however,
    to better understand the accuracy and the added value of these additional data
    for soil moisture estimation. Overall, the new scintillator design shows to be
    a valid and compact alternative to conventional CRNS sensors for non-invasive
    soil moisture monitoring and to open the path to a wide range of applications.

    Heng, and Gabriele Baroni Abstract Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has emerged
    as a reliable method for soil moisture and snow estimation. However, the applicability
    of this method beyond research has been limited due to, among others, the use
    of relatively large and expensive sensors. This paper presents the tests conducted
    on a new scintillator-based sensor especially designed to jointly measure neutron
    counts, muons and total gamma rays. The neutron signal is first compared against
    two conventional gas-tube-based CRNS sensors at two locations. The estimated soil
    moisture is further assessed at four agricultural sites, based on gravimetric
    soil moisture collected within the sensor footprint. Muon fluxes are compared
    to the incoming neutron variability measured at a neutron monitoring station and
    total gammas counts are compared to the signal detected by a gamma ray spectrometer.
    The results show that the neutron dynamic detected by the new scintillator-based
    CRNS sensor is well in agreement with conventional CRNS sensors. The derived soil
    moisture also agreed well with the gravimetric soil moisture measurements. The
    muons and the total gamma rays simultaneously detected by the sensor show promising
    features to account for the incoming variability and for discriminating irrigation
    and precipitation events, respectively. Further experiments and analyses should
    be conducted, however, to better understand the accuracy and the added value of
    these additional data for soil moisture estimation. Overall, the new scintillator
    design shows to be a valid and compact alternative to conventional CRNS sensors
    for non-invasive soil moisture monitoring and to open the path to a wide range
    of applications. How to cite.  Gianessi, S., Polo, M., Stevanato, L., Lunardon,

    2024. Received: 28 Oct 2022 – Discussion started: 01 Nov 2022 – Revised: 07 Oct
    2023 – Accepted: 19 Oct 2023 – Published: 16 Jan 2024 1 Introduction Soil moisture
    plays a key role in the hydrological cycle controlling water and energy fluxes
    at the land surface (Seneviratne et al., 2010; Vereecken et al., 2008). For this
    reason, an accurate monitoring of this variable is crucial in many applications,
    ranging from agricultural water management (Lichtenberg et al., 2015), runoff
    generation and floods (Bronstert et al., 2011; Saadi et al., 2020) and landslide
    prediction (Abraham et al., 2021; Zhuo et al., 2019). The main challenges in monitoring
    this variable are related to its strong spatial and temporal variability driven
    by the different hydrological processes at the land surface (Haghighi et al.,
    2018) and further aggravated by human activities like irrigation and drainage
    (Domínguez-Niño et al., 2020). Several instruments for monitoring soil moisture
    are available nowadays, ranging from invasive point-scale soil moisture sensors
    to remote sensing methods with larger coverage (Babaeian et al., 2019; Corradini,
    2014; Ochsner et al., 2013). More recently, attention has been paid to the development
    and assessment of the so-called proximal soil moisture sensors (Bogena et al.,
    2015). These non-invasive near-ground detectors have the advantage of estimating
    soil moisture over an intermediate scale (10–200 m radius) and at subdaily resolutions,
    providing a new perspective for hydrological observations (Ochsner et al., 2013).
    Among these non-invasive techniques, cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) (Zreda
    et al., 2008) has shown good performance in several environmental conditions like
    natural ecosystems (Franz et al., 2012), meadows (Zhu et al., 2016), cropped fields
    (Rivera Villarreyes et al., 2011; Coopersmith et al., 2014) and forests (Heidbüchel
    et al., 2016; Jeong et al., 2021). This technique relies on the negative correlation
    between natural neutron fluxes in a specific energy range (0.5 eV–100 keV) and
    hydrogen pools at and in the ground, providing the base for monitoring soil moisture
    (Zreda et al., 2012), snow (Schattan et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2016) and biomass
    (Baroni and Oswald, 2015; Jakobi et al., 2018). It is noteworthy that this negative
    correlation has been detected for a long time but mostly considered a nuisance
    in space weather monitoring (Hands et al., 2021; Hendrick and Edge, 1966) and
    rock dating (Gosse and Phillips, 2001). First studies showing the value of this
    signal for hydrological applications were presented only some years later, based
    on a neutron detector installed below the ground (Kodama et al., 1979). Its application,
    however, remained limited to some integrations into long-term observation networks
    for snow estimation (Morin et al., 2012). A strong contribution to the development
    and spread of this technique was provided only more recently when the need for
    a better understanding of the interaction of these neutron fluxes and soil moisture
    led to its investigation (Zreda et al., 2008). In this context, the neutron detector
    had been installed aboveground, and the signal agreed well with soil moisture
    over an area of several hectares and down to a depth of several decimeters (Franz
    et al., 2012; Köhli et al., 2015), providing a new prospective monitor of hydrological
    variables at the land surface (Desilets et al., 2010). Nowadays, this aboveground
    CRNS method is used by many research groups worldwide, and it is integrated into
    some national monitoring systems to provide a better understanding of hydrological
    processes and to support water management and assessments (Andreasen et al., 2017b;
    Bogena et al., 2022; Cooper et al., 2021; Hawdon et al., 2014; Upadhyaya et al.,
    2021; Zreda et al., 2012; Evans et al., 2016). Initially, all the CRNS detectors
    were based on proportional gas tubes filled in with helium-3 or boron trifluoride
    (Schrön et al., 2018; Zreda et al., 2012). Alternative sensors are now emerging
    that could also pave the way for new and wider applications (Cirillo et al., 2021;
    Flynn et al., 2021; Patrignani et al., 2021; Stevanato et al., 2019; Stowell et
    al., 2021; Weimar et al., 2020; van Amelrooij et al., 2022). In this context,
    the scintillator-based neutron detector design showed a good capability to measure
    neutrons with different energies (Cester et al., 2016). A first prototype specifically
    for soil moisture estimation was developed and tested, showing good performance
    in comparison with independent soil moisture observations (Stevanato et al., 2019).
    This detector was further improved by, e.g., reducing environmental temperature
    effects on the recorded signal and reducing its energy consumption (Stevanato
    et al., 2020). First comparisons with independent data confirmed the good performances
    of these devices (Gianessi et al., 2021), with the additional advantage of measuring
    muons for on-site incoming neutron correction (Stevanato et al., 2022). In this
    study, we present a comprehensive description and assessment of this new scintillator-based
    CRNS detector. The assessment is performed based on (i) a comparison of the detected
    neutron counts with conventional gas-tube-based CRNS instruments at two experimental
    sites, (ii) a comparison of the derived soil moisture with independent gravimetric
    soil moisture measurements at four additional experimental sites, (iii) a comparison
    of detected muons with incoming neutrons measured at a neutron monitoring station,
    and (iv) a comparison of total gamma counts with a conventional gamma ray spectrometer
    at one experimental site. The added value of muons and gamma particles simultaneously
    recorded by the sensor are also explored and discussed. 2 Materials and methods
    2.1 The detector assembly Scintillators have been identified as a promising alternative
    to proportional gas tubes for measuring neutrons in many applications (Peerani
    et al., 2012). The main advantages are the use of cheaper and safer materials
    than proportional gas tubes based on helium-3 or boron trifluoride, respectively.
    Moreover, the flexibility in manipulating the detecting material (e.g., thin layers)
    allows us to optimize the sensitive area and to develop relatively efficient but
    compact sensors. The scintillators are made of plastic or organic materials that
    emit photons in the visible or near-ultraviolet (UV) region when hit by radiation.
    The scintillator materials used for neutron detection, in particular, have a unique
    property, in comparison to inorganic scintillators, in that they release light
    in different ways when hit by different particles. The identification of the type
    of particle or ray is achieved by means of pulse shape analysis (PSA), which exploits
    the different profiles at the time of the signals. Among others, a typical parameter
    used in this analysis is the so-called pulse shape discrimination parameter (PSD),
    which is given by the ratio of the integrated charge in the tail of the signal
    with respect to the total integrated charge. An example is shown in Fig. 1a, which
    shows how different particles (here thermal neutrons and cosmic muons) populate
    very different regions in the PSD vs. integrated-charge plane. For more details
    on the analysis and on the parameters used for the identification of the single
    events, we refer to more specific studies (e.g., Cester et al., 2016). In the
    present study, we use the scintillator-based sensor FINAPP3 developed by FINAPP
    s.r.l. (http://finapptech.com/en, last access: 14 January 2024). The main parts
    of the sensor are shown in Fig. 1b. The sensor hosts two main detectors. The first
    detector (detector 1 in Fig. 1b) is a multi-layer zinc sulfide Ag-doped scintillator
    mixed with lithium-6 fluoride powder embedded in a silicone-based matrix. Epithermal
    neutrons are further moderated by the polyethylene shield and brought to thermal
    energies (around 0.026 eV), where the neutron capture cross section on Li-6 is
    the maximum. The Li-6 embedded inside the detectors has a large cross section
    for neutron capture. When a Li-6 nucleus captures a neutron, then a nuclear reaction
    occurs, and the compound Li-7 breaks into an alpha particle (He-4) and a triton
    (H-3), with a large energy release of almost 5 MeV. This energy is converted into
    light (a flash of optical photons) by the ZnS(Ag) crystals. The energy release
    in the thin layers of the scintillator (a few hundreds of microns) is strong for
    local interactions coming from the neutron–Li capture reaction products, providing
    a large electrical signal that is well above the voltage threshold used to cut
    the instrument noise. This detector can also measure cosmic-ray-induced muons
    (in the energy range of around 4 GeV) that are distinguished by a real-time PSD,
    as described above. The possibility to detect muons in the same device was proven
    by the comparison with standard muon telescopes (patent no. IT102021000003728).
    The second main detector (detector 2 in Fig. 1b) is a small (2 in. ×2 in.; 5.08 cm
    ×5.08 cm) commercial organic scintillator (EJ200 from Eljen Technology Inc.).
    Due to the low effective atomic number Zeff, typical of organic materials, gamma
    rays interact with this scintillator mainly by Compton scattering, providing the
    spectrum shape of the Compton continuum from zero to the Compton edges. In the
    energy range above 3.0 MeV, no gamma rays are present but only signals with a
    larger energy deposit (e.g., 10 MeV); this is mainly due to cosmic muons. For
    this reason, this second detector can not only measure muons as the first detector
    but also the total gamma ray fluxes in the energy range between 0.3 and 3.0 MeV.
    For more details about the detected signals, we refer to more specific studies
    (Boo et al., 2021; Ford et al., 2008). Finally, two commercial photomultipliers
    (PMTs in Fig. 1b) from Hamamatsu Photonics (Hamamatsu, Japan) are used to transform
    the light (visible photons) to an electric pulse. The sensor can be further integrated
    with air pressure, air temperature and air humidity sensors. A single electronics
    board takes care of detector signal acquisition, real-time data processing and
    data logging to a remote server. All the components of the detector are in a box
    of about 40 × 30 × 20 cm, with a total weight of 8 kg. Energy consumption is minimized
    to 0.4 W (35 mA at 12 V), and it is supplied by a relatively small solar panel
    (20 W) installed above the sensor. Overall, the new sensor assembly provides neutrons,
    muons and gamma counting rates that can be further corrected and elaborated on
    to retrieve soil moisture, as described in the next sections. Figure 1(a) Typical
    pulse shape discrimination (PSD) vs. integrated-charge plot for a FINAPP3 detector.

    sensor FINAPP3, with the two main detectors, photomultiplier (PMTs), board and
    battery. 2.2 From neutron counts to soil moisture estimation The measured neutron
    count rates N are corrected for air pressure (fp), variability in the incoming
    neutron flux (fi) and air vapor (fv) to account for local atmospheric effects
    based on the following correction factors (Zreda et al., 2012): where β= 0.0076 (mb−1),
    α= 0.0054 (m3 g−1); p and h are air pressure (mb) and absolute humidity (g m−3);
    I is the incoming flux of cosmic-ray neutrons induced by galactic primary particles
    in the Earth''s atmosphere (counts per hour, cph); and href, pref and Iref are
    reference values (here the average is taken) of air pressure, absolute air humidity
    and incoming neutron flux during the measuring period, respectively. Air pressure
    and relative air humidity are generally measured locally (or taken from a weather
    station nearby) and the latter can be converted into absolute air humidity using
    measured air temperature. In contrast, data of the incoming fluctuations are commonly
    downloaded (e.g., from https://www.nmdb.eu/nest/, last access: 14 January 2024)
    from dedicated neutron incoming monitoring stations located at some places globally
    (Simpson, 2000). For the specific case study, data from JUNG station at Jungfraujoch
    (Switzerland) are used for the correction, as commonly adopted in many applications
    in central Europe (Bogena et al., 2022). Finally, the corrected neutron count
    rate Nc is transformed to volumetric soil moisture θ based on Desilets equation
    (Desilets et al., 2010): where ρbd and ρw are the soil bulk density (kg m−3) and
    water density (kg m−3), respectively; θoffset is the combined gravimetric water
    equivalent of additional hydrogen pools, i.e., lattice water (LW) and soil organic
    carbon (SOC); and N0 is approximately the counting rate of the detector at a site
    during very dry soil conditions. The value N0 can be calibrated based on independent
    soil sampling campaigns, as suggested in different studies (Schrön et al., 2017;
    Franz et al., 2012). The data processing described above has been implemented
    in a simple spreadsheet available from Baroni (2022b). For a more advanced data
    processing that also integrates additional external datasets, readers can refer
    to Power et al. (2021). 2.3 Assessment of neutron counts to other conventional
    CRNS sensors at two sites (Austria and Germany) The comparison to other conventional
    gas-tube-based CRNS detectors has been conducted at two experimental sites (Fig.
    2). The first site is located at Marchfeld (near Vienna, Austria; 48.24∘ N, 16.55∘ E).
    The second site is located at Marquardt (near Potsdam, Germany; 52.45∘ N, 12.96∘ E).
    The recorded time series covers the period of 7 months, starting from May 2021,
    when a FINAPP3 detector was installed at both sites. Figure 2Experimental sites
    at (a) Marchfeld (near Vienna, Austria) and (b) Marquardt (near Potsdam, Germany).
    At Marchfeld experimental site, the FINAPP3 sensor is compared with a CRS2000
    device, a boron-10 trifluoride proportional gas tube produced by Hydroinnova (https://www.hydroinnova.com,
    last access: 14 January 2024) and that has been used in many studies (Andreasen
    et al., 2016; Baroni and Oswald, 2015; Hawdon et al., 2014). At the Marquardt
    site, several CRNS sensors of different designs are available for comparison (Heistermann
    et al., 2023). In the present study, we selected a sensor based on two boron trifluoride
    proportional gas tubes (a double CRNS sensor system type called BF3-C-4) from
    Lab-C LLC, sold by Quaesta Instruments (https://www.quaestainstruments.com, last
    access: 14 January 2024). This sensor provides a high sensitivity for neutron
    detection and thus a good signal-to-noise ratio, which promises potential for
    estimating soil moisture at even about hourly time resolutions (Fersch et al.,
    2020). All the detectors have been installed at a height of around 1.5 m above
    the ground and placed at a distance of a few meters distance apart. Considering
    the large footprint of the signal detected, this horizontal difference is considered
    negligible for the comparison (Rivera Villarreyes et al., 2011; Patrignani et
    al., 2021; Schrön et al., 2018). All the detectors have been equipped with a solar
    panel and with GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) data transmission
    for supporting long-term observations and real-time monitoring. 2.4 Assessment
    of derived soil moisture with independent gravimetric soil sampling campaigns
    (Italy) A second assessment of the FINAPP3 sensor was carried out by a series
    of independent gravimetric soil sampling campaigns. The experiments were conducted
    in 2021 at four experimental sites located in the Po river plain, northern Italy
    (Fig. 3). At the San Pietro Capofiume (44.65∘ N, 11.64∘ E; near Bologna, Italy)
    and Legnaro sites (45.34∘ N, 11.96∘ E; near Padova, Italy), the sensors were installed
    over a grassland with low biomass that is surrounded by agricultural cropped fields.
    Conversely, at Ceregnano (45.05∘ N, 11.86∘ E; near Rovigo, Italy) and at Landriano
    (45.31∘ N, 9.26∘ E; near Pavia, Italy), the sensors were installed in the middle
    of agricultural fields, where fast biomass growth and irrigation took place. More
    specifically, at Landriano, sorghum was cropped and irrigated by a sprinkler system.
    At Ceregnano, soybeans were cultivated and irrigated by a variable rate irrigation
    ranger system. The soil texture at the experimental sites is quite homogenous
    over the main area investigated by the sensors (approximately 100 m radius), except
    for Ceregnano, where a sandy fluvial deposit crosses the loamy field. Figure 3Experimental
    sites with FINAPP3 sensor (white points) and locations where gravimetric soil
    samples (red points) have been collected for comparison (pictures from © Google
    Earth). At Ceregnano site, a gamma ray spectrometer (Medusa Radiometrics gSMS)
    was also installed few meters from the CRNS sensor. Download At each site, weather
    data were collected by meteorological stations operated by the Regional Environmental
    Protection Agencies (ARPA) at the same positions at which the CRNS sensors were
    installed or located in close proximity (a few kilometers). In these cases, the
    meteorological observations have been considered representative of the local conditions.
    Moreover, three field campaigns were conducted during the vegetation season to
    collect soil samples for the calibration and assessment of the CRNS signal. The
    sampling took into account the sensitivity of the signal decreasing with distance
    from the sensor. Specifically, undisturbed soil samples were collected at 18 locations
    (red points in Fig. 3) and at four different depths (0–5, 10–15, 20–25 and 30–35 cm
    from the soil surface) for a total of 72 soil samples. Gravimetric water content
    for each soil sample was measured by oven-drying method (105 ∘C for 24 h). A mixed
    soil sample was further prepared at each site to measure soil organic carbon (SOC)
    and lattice water (LW). These two parameters have been measured by a loss on ignition
    (LOI) method, respectively, with a cycle of 24 h at 500 ∘C and 12 h at 1000 ∘C
    (Barbosa et al., 2021). All the values have been processed to account for the
    spatial sensitivity of the neutrons detected, based on the most recent methods
    (Schrön et al., 2017). A simple spreadsheet in which these weighting functions
    have been implemented is publicly available (Baroni, 2022b). The results are summarized
    in Table A1 in the Appendix. 2.5 Assessment of muons counting rate The use of
    muons has been shown to be a possible alternative to the use of the neutron monitoring
    stations for incoming correction, since they are produced from the same cascade
    as cosmic-ray-induced neutrons in the atmosphere (Stevanato et al., 2022). We
    also test this signal in the present study, and for sake of clarity we report
    here on the main data-processing steps. Specifically, muons are first corrected
    to account for air pressure and air temperature effects as follows: where Eq.
    (6) is analogous to the pressure correction for neutron flux (see Eq. 1)'' p and
    T are the air pressure (mb) and air temperature (∘C), respectively; and pref and
    Tref are the reference value (here the average is taken) of air pressure and air
    temperature during the measuring period. In contrast to the neutrons, the effect
    of air vapor on the muon counting rate has been not identified so far (Dorman,
    2004; Maghrabi and Aldosary, 2018), and it is also not considered in the present
    study. It is noteworthy that the whole air temperature profile should be considered
    for the correction. This would better represent the atmospheric condition, and
    it would better capture the effect on muons. Some studies, however, have shown
    how the use of air temperature measured at 2 m height provides a good approximation
    of the muon effect (de Mendonça et al., 2016). This approach is used also in this
    study, but it should be further tested in future research. For the muon assessment,
    first the parameters βM and αM are derived, based on the data collected within
    this study to evaluate the effect of air pressure and air temperature on the muon
    signal. These values are then compared with βM = 0.0016 mbar−1 and αM = 0.0021 ∘C−1
    provided by Stevanato et al. (2022). These values have been estimated based on
    a recursive analysis conducted on a relative long time series collected at the
    same area (1-year time series collected at around 200 km distance). For this reason,
    the values can also be representative of the experimental sites of the present
    study. Refinements of these values should be expected in case of application in
    different locations. The corrected muon flux MC is then compared to the incoming
    variability measured at the neutron monitoring station usually adopted for CRNS
    incoming correction (https://www.nmdb.eu/, last access: 14 January 2024). Finally,
    the effect of using a muon signal instead of using neutron counts from a neutron
    monitoring station for the incoming correction (Eq. 2) and soil moisture estimation
    is also presented and discussed. 2.6 Assessment of total gamma rays The measurements
    of gamma rays have been shown to be a valid approach for soil moisture estimation
    at relative small scale, i.e., tens of meters (Baldoncini et al., 2018), or for
    identifying irrigation events at agricultural sites (Serafini et al., 2021). More
    specifically, gamma rays measured above the ground (e.g., by a detector installed
    about 2 m from the ground) are mainly produced by radionuclides in the soil. The
    gamma ray fluxes are also attenuated by the presence of water in the soil, due
    to the increased average absorption coefficient of the wet soil with respect to
    the dry soil. For this reason, the gamma ray signal (i.e., the 40K full-energy
    peak at 1.46 MeV or, in any case, in the energies between about 1.0 and 2.5 MeV)
    shows a negative correlation with the amount of water in the soil, and thus this
    relation can be used to estimate the soil moisture dynamic (Strati et al., 2018).
    In contrast, gamma rays in the energy range of 214Pb (352 keV), a radon progeny,
    has a much stronger volatility, and it is also present in the atmosphere. Thus,
    a fast increase in the gamma rays in the energy range of this photo peak can be
    detected during precipitation events due to the effect of radon atmospheric deposition.
    In contrast, during an irrigation event, no such behaviour is expected. It is
    noteworthy that the gamma signal should not be corrected for other effects (i.e.,
    air pressure, air temperature and air humidity). For these reasons, it can provide
    some advantages when using neutrons for soil moisture application. For the assessment
    of the gamma signal measured by FINAPP3, a stationary cesium iodide (CsI) gamma
    ray spectrometer (gSMS, Medusa Radiometrics, https://www.medusa-radiometrics.com/,
    last access: 14 January 2024) has also been installed at Ceregnao site in 2021,
    a few meters away from the CRNS location. A direct comparison between total gamma
    fluxes measured by the two sensors is performed. The capability of the signal
    to discriminate precipitation and irrigation events is also explored in the present
    study, based on the data collected at the experimental sites. 3 Results 3.1 Comparison
    between neutrons detected by FINAPP3 and conventional CRNS sensors The corrected
    hourly neutron count rates measured by the different sensors are shown in Fig.
    4. As expected, the sensors have different sensitivities, with a mean neutron
    counting rate over the period at Marchfeld of 1279 and 1797 cph for FINAPP3 and
    CRS2000, respectively, and at Marquardt of 1187 and 8387 cph for FINAPP3 and Lab-C,
    respectively. Accordingly, the relative lower sensitivity of FINAPP3 produced
    a higher amount of statistical noise when compared to its benchmark (CRS2000 or
    Lab-C, respectively). However, this difference is less substantial when the signal
    is smoothed over a longer time interval. Specifically, the analysis shows a good
    agreement of the detected signals (R2= 0.66) at a 1 h integration time. The performance
    improves (R2= 0.91) when the values are already integrated over a 6 h interval.
    The good correlation can also be appreciated by looking at a fast drop of the
    neutron counting rates during a short timescale (Fig. 4c, d). For this reason,
    the FINAPP3 sensor can be considered reliable for many applications, while it
    is suggested to employ a more sensitive detector for especially demanding settings,
    e.g., when focusing on fast (e.g., hourly) hydrological processes like canopy
    interceptions (Andreasen et al., 2017a; Baroni and Oswald, 2015) or mobile applications
    (Jakobi et al., 2020). Figure 4Comparison of measured neutrons in 2021 at the
    (a–c) Marchfeld site, Vienna, Austria, and the (d–f) Marquardt site, Potsdam,
    Germany, by the two different sensor pairs (CRS2000 and FINAPP3; Lab-C and FINAPP3).
    Panels (a) and (d) show the hourly values (in orange) and are based on a running
    average of 6 h (in blue). Panels (b) and (e) show the neutron fluxes corrected
    for air pressure, with a running average of 6 h. The relative counts over the
    mean are shown for comparison. Panels (c) and (f) show a zoom-in during a fast
    drop in the neutron counts. Download 3.2 Assessment of the derived FINAPP soil
    moisture with independent gravimetric soil samples The neutron counts collected
    at the four Italian experimental sites were transformed to volumetric soil moisture,
    as described in Sect. 2.2, using all the soil samples for the calibration of the
    parameter N0 (Eq. 5). Before the transformation, the corrected hourly neutron
    values were smoothed with a Savitzky–Golay filter to decrease the random fluctuations
    at a short time period, as suggested in the literature (Franz et al., 2020). The
    calibration curves obtained, based on all the gravimetric soil samples, are shown
    in Fig. 5 (dashed black lines), together with some performance metrics between
    estimation and observation (coefficient of determination R2 and RMSE). Moreover,
    calibration curves based on the data collected during only one single soil sampling
    campaign are added to better visualize the differences (gray lines). Figure 5Calibration
    curves obtained at each site (Legnaro, San Pietro Capofiume, Ceregnano and Landriano)
    using data collected during one single field campaign (gray lines) or based on
    the best fit over all of the samples (dashed black line). Download At the Legnaro
    site, the calibration curve aligned well the observations, with a high goodness
    of fit (R2>0.9; RMSE = 0.006 g g−1). In contrast, at the other three sites, the
    goodness of fit deteriorated, with the worst case obtained at Ceregnano site (R2>0.2;
    RMSE = 0.041 g g−1). These performances are in agreement with studies conducted
    with other conventional CRNS sensors (e.g., Franz et al., 2012), and they can
    be explained in relation (i) to the effect of other hydrogen pools like biomass
    (Baatz et al., 2015; Franz et al., 2015; Jakobi et al., 2018) and (ii) to the
    contributions to the signal from remote areas (Schattan et al., 2019; Schrön et
    al., 2017). Specifically, the very good fit at the Legnaro site can be explained,
    considering that the FINAPP3 sensor has been installed at a grass site with low
    biomass, and the surrounding areas are characterized by relatively small agricultural
    fields (see Fig. 3). In these conditions, the soil samples represent the average
    soil moisture within the footprint well, and no additional hydrogen pools are
    relevant. As such, the results support the sufficiency of one single calibration
    campaign and the accuracy of the detected signal when these conditions are met.
    At San Pietro Capofiume, the FINAPP3 sensor was also installed at a grass site
    with low biomass. This area, however, reached very low soil moisture values during
    the summer. In contrast, the remote areas are large irrigated maize cropped fields
    (i.e., with much higher expected soil moisture). As recently discussed (Schrön
    et al., 2023), in these particularly heterogeneous conditions, the sensor can
    detect soil moisture changes at a more remote distance than the actual footprint,
    and the gravimetric soil samples collected during the field campaigns could be
    not representative of the average soil moisture condition detected by the sensor.
    On the one hand, this can explain the unrealistic apparent negative soil moisture
    values estimated during August. On the other hand, it supports the need for additional
    soil samples at the irrigated areas to provide a soil moisture basis more representative
    of this CRNS footprint. Finally, at Ceregnano and at Landriano, the FINAPP3 sensors
    were installed at the center of a homogenous cultivated field, where the contribution
    of the fast biomass growth to the detected signal should be expected. Thus, the
    apparent overestimation of soil moisture towards the peak of the growing season
    at both sites is very plausible. Some corrections to the signal to account for
    the biomass contribution have been suggested in the literature (Baatz et al.,
    2015; Franz et al., 2015; Jakobi et al., 2018), but it is beyond the scope of
    the present study to assess these approaches. The use of more recently proposed
    soil moisture–neutron relation could also be tested in future studies to see possible
    compensations for these effects (Köhli et al., 2021). Anyway, these results confirm
    the need to conduct, when possible, more than one calibration campaign to account
    for some of these effects (Heidbüchel et al., 2016; Iwema et al., 2015). Finally,
    the time series collected at the four experimental sites in Italy are shown in
    Fig. 6. The FINAPP3 signal was regularly recorded and transmitted over the entire
    period. Only a few data gaps were experienced, and they are related to short periods
    of low power supply by the solar panel during wintertime. At all the sites, the
    estimated soil moisture dynamic responds well to precipitation. As previously
    discussed, the derived soil moisture values are in good agreement with the gravimetric
    soil moisture (green crosses). For these reasons, the results show how FINAPP3
    can be considered a reliable soil moisture sensor that can be integrated in long-term
    monitoring networks, as proposed by other studies (Cooper et al., 2021; Zreda
    et al., 2012; Bogena et al., 2022). Figure 6Estimated volumetric soil moisture
    (m3 m−3) by FINAPP3 in 2021 at the four experimental sites (black line) compared
    to the weighted average soil moisture, based on soil samples and gravimetric methods
    (green crosses). At each site, the precipitation is also shown (blue bars). Download
    3.3 On the use of muons for incoming corrections Muons have been recorded simultaneously
    by the detector at all of the experimental sites. Some malfunctions in the pulse
    shape discrimination integrated in the electronic board and on the data transmission
    have, however, been initially identified. These malfunctions were later fixed,
    but some data have been corrupted. For this reason, the muon time series cover
    a shorter period in comparison to the neutron counts (i.e., June–November). Figure
    7 shows the muon counting rates collected at Legnaro site, for example, but similar
    results have been detected in the other experimental sites. As expected, the results
    show a strong relation between measured muon counting rates and air pressure (Fig.
    7a). The slope of the relation (−0.0018) is also very similar to the value obtained
    by Stevanato et al. (2022) (i.e., −0.0021). In contrast, within the present study,
    no relation is detected between the pressure-corrected muons and air temperature
    (Fig. 7b). The behaviour is attributed to the relatively short time series and
    the small temperature range (±5∘). However, the representativeness of air temperature
    measured at 2 m height in comparison to the need for a whole-atmosphere air temperature
    profile is also questionable, and it should be further investigated (de Mendonça
    et al., 2016). The residual spread in the relationship suggests that the influence
    of factors to the signal other than cosmogenic muons cannot, however, be excluded,
    and it should be considered in further studies. Figure 7Comparison of data collected
    at Legnaro site. (a) Relative air pressure vs. muon counting rate. (b) Air temperature
    vs. pressure-corrected muon counting rate. Download The muon counting rate is
    further analyzed by comparing its dynamic to the incoming neutron fluxes measured
    at a neutron monitoring station (Jungfraujoch) and based on the effect on the
    derived soil moisture (Fig. 8). During most of the monitoring period, the main
    fluctuations are clearly visible in both muon and incoming neutron (JUNG) time
    series (Fig. 8c). On some days (e.g., on 5 July, when a precipitation event occurred),
    some differences are detected that might be attributed to different local atmospheric
    conditions between the experimental sites and Jungfraujoch, where the incoming
    neutron fluxes are measured. However, these differences do not propagate into
    significant differences in derived soil moisture. For this reason, the analysis
    within the present study is not conclusive, but longer time series (e.g., years)
    with stronger incoming variability are needed to test the use of muons for the
    incoming correction. Figure 8(a, b) The average precipitation over the four Italian
    experimental sites. (c, d) The incoming correction based on neutron monitoring
    station (JUNG) and based on the average muon detected at the four experimental
    sites (Muons).The standard deviation is also shown as gray area. (e, f) Estimated
    soil moisture using the two different approaches for the incoming correction of
    the signal, based on the standard approach of data from neutron data base (e.g.,
    JUNG plotted as an orange line) and using locally detected muons (blue line).
    The measurements refer to the year 2021. Download It is noteworthy that one single
    relevant event has been recorded at the beginning of November (Fig. 8d). During
    this period, a fast drop in the incoming fluxes has been detected, producing an
    ∼ 8 % increase in the incoming correction (if neutron monitoring is concerned).
    In contrast, the fluctuations in the muons are much smoother. At the current stage,
    the reasons for these differences have been not identified, but only some hypotheses
    are formulated. First, the FINAPP3 muons count rate is relatively low, and the
    recorded signal is smoothed over a relatively long time period (days) to reduce
    the statistical errors. For this reason, short-term dynamics cannot be captured.
    Second, the muon detector is also not directional (e.g., as a telescope looking
    upward), but it measures muon particles that are scattered in all the directions.
    These characteristics could produce some differences in comparison to the directional
    detector when these fast and strong events are considered. For this reason, the
    need for a bigger or directional muon detector could be considered for further
    developments to detect events that occurs during relatively short period. Still,
    it is interesting to note the propagation of these different corrections into
    soil moisture estimation. Specifically, a precipitation event was observed over
    all the Italian sites during this strong incoming neutron variability. Accordingly,
    soil moisture should have increased to some degree. The effect of the incoming
    correction based on the neutron monitoring station, however, smoothed this effect,
    and the soil moisture remained constant or even started to dry down. In contrast,
    by using the muon signal, the soil moisture increased. While the magnitude of
    this increment is, in some cases, questionable if compared, for instance, to the
    increment recorded during the earlier precipitation event, these results support
    previous findings that muon detection can be a possible approach to better account
    for local atmospheric conditions. In this context, FINAPP3 can be considered a
    valuable sensor for collecting new data for further testing this hypothesis. The
    use of continuous independent soil moisture measurements should, however, be designed
    for benchmarking. 3.4 Assessment of measured total gamma rays The comparison between
    total gamma counts (TGCs) measured at the Ceregnano site by FINAPP3 and gSMS Medusa
    is shown in Fig. 9. On average, the sensitivity of the FINAPP3 is lower, with
    an average counting rate over the monitored period of 2531 counts per hour (cph).
    In contrast, the gSMS Medusa sensor showed higher sensitivity and an average counting
    rate over the monitored period of 8281 cph. The correlation between the two signals
    is low, at an hourly time resolution (R2= 0.08), mainly due to the presence of
    extreme values observed during the precipitation events. The correlation increases
    (R2= 0.32) with a consistent detected dynamic (Fig. 8b) when these extreme values
    are removed, and the time series is smoothed over a 6 h time window. Figure 9Comparison
    between total gamma counts measured by FINAPP3 and gSMS Medusa gamma ray spectrometer
    in 2021 at the Ceregnano site. Download The measured total gamma counts are further
    compared to the soil moisture simultaneously derived by FINAPP3 and with precipitation
    and irrigation events (Fig. 10). Please note that a relatively shorter time series
    (June–September) in comparison to the neutron time series is shown due to some
    malfunctions of the electronic board and data transmission that have been initially
    deprecated the gamma signal, as also discussed for the muon signal. The collected
    results show a negative correlation with the soil moisture dynamic estimated based
    on the neutron counts (i.e., TGC increases with soil moisture decreasing, and
    vice versa). Thus, the results confirm how the total gamma fluxes are attenuated
    by the presence of water in the soil, providing the scientific basis for the development
    of a gamma ray sensor for soil moisture estimation (Strati et al., 2018). However,
    the total gamma counts show a higher dynamic at a subdaily timescale in comparison
    to the estimated neutron-based soil moisture, and the correlation between the
    signals is weak (Pearson correlation coefficient r= −0.18). For this reason, further
    experiments and analyses should be conducted to better understand the added value
    of this signal for soil moisture estimation. Among others, the weak correlation
    can be attributed to the smaller horizonal and vertical footprint of the gamma
    fluxes (< 25 m radius; < 15 cm depth) in comparison to the neutron (∼ 100 m radius;
    ∼ 40 cm depth). Thus, a dedicated soil sampling campaign within the theoretical
    soil volume detected by the gamma particles should be performed for better assessment.
    An exponential decrease in the sensitivity of the signal has also been suggested
    in the literature in both horizontal and vertical directions (Baldoncini et al.,
    2018). However, considering that the gamma footprint is strongly affected by the
    height of the detector installation (van der Veeke et al., 2021), further and
    more dedicated experiments should be performed to develop specific weighting functions
    and to conduct a proper assessment. Figure 10(a, b, c) Precipitation (blue) and
    irrigation (light blue) (mm d−1), (d, e, f) volumetric soil moisture estimated
    by FINAPP3 (m3 m−3) and (g, h, i) total gamma counts (TGC) over the mean of the
    monitored period (year 2021). Download It is noteworthy, however, that a peak
    in the total gamma radiation generated by the deposition of atmospheric radon
    during the precipitation events is clearly identifiable. In contrast, no such
    peaks occur during the irrigation events. The results are shown in Fig. 10, where
    two short periods are visualized as an example. For this reason, while the use
    of total gamma radiation for soil moisture estimation will require additional
    refinement, the new sensor can be used for discriminating the increase in the
    soil moisture due to irrigation, in contrast to precipitation events, as shown
    in other studies using more dedicated gamma ray spectrometers (Serafini et al.,
    2021). The use of this signal to extend existing gamma ray dosimeters can also
    be foreseen (Rizzo et al., 2022). 4 Conclusions This study presents the activities
    conducted to test a new CRNS sensor design, based on scintillators for non-invasive
    soil moisture estimation. The results show that the new sensor performed very
    well in different environmental conditions in comparison to other conventional
    gas-tubes-based CRNS sensors (R2>0.9 at 6 h integration time) and based on several
    gravimetric soil moisture samples (RMSE < 0.04 m3 m−3). The sensitivity of this
    new sensor design was found to be suitable for monitoring daily temporal soil
    moisture changes over the long term (years). However, the signal-to-noise ratio
    was relatively high at an hourly timescale, and only the aggregation to a 6 h
    interval yielded a reasonable robustness of the signal. For this reason, a more
    sensitive detector should be considered when fast hydrological processes such
    as canopy interceptions or roving applications are targeted. Part of the tested
    sensor design contains components that simultaneously measure muons and total
    gamma radiation. In previous studies, muons were found to be a potential candidate
    to support the correction for incoming cosmic rays (Stevanato et al., 2022). On
    the other hand, the use of gamma ray spectrometry was identified as an alternative
    method for non-invasive soil moisture estimation (Baldoncini et al., 2018) and
    irrigation discrimination (Serafini et al., 2021). The muons measured within the
    present study confirmed the negative correlation with the air pressure that has
    been found in the literature (Stevanato et al., 2022; de Mendonça et al., 2016).
    The effect of the air temperature was, however, not identified, suggesting the
    need for longer time series and a wider temperature range. The incoming correction
    using muons showed some differences in the incoming variability detected by the
    neutron monitoring station that could be attributed to different local atmospheric
    conditions. In most of the period, however, the effect on the soil moisture estimation
    was negligible. Further analyses with longer time series should then be conducted
    to better understand the added value of detecting this radiation form. A comparison
    to other recently proposed alternatives, like the use of neutron spectroscopy
    (Cirillo et al., 2021) or improvements on the use of neutron fluxes measured at
    the neutron monitoring station (McJannet and Desilets, 2023), should also be performed.
    The sensor had also a good performance in the measurements of the total gamma
    radiation in comparison to a gamma ray spectrometer (R2= 0.29 at 6 h integration
    time). The signal also showed a negative correlation to soil moisture, as presented
    in other studies with the focus on specific gamma energy ranges, e.g., 40K (Strati
    et al., 2018; Baldoncini et al., 2018). The correlation using total gamma counts
    is, however, weak (Pearson correlation coefficient r= −0.18), suggesting the need
    for additional studies for a better understanding of the signal response and of
    the footprint size for soil moisture estimation. In contrast, high peaks of total
    gamma radiation generated by a shower of radon in the atmosphere have been detected,
    allowing a clear identification of precipitation vs. irrigation events. Overall,
    this tested sensor design has shown to be a valuable alternative to more traditional
    CRNS detectors for soil moisture estimation. Considering that it can be built
    smaller than conventional neutron systems and offers the potential benefit of
    the additional detection of muons and total gammas, it can also pave the way for
    new and wider applications like space weather applications (Hands et al., 2021;
    Rizzo et al., 2022) and for monitoring agriculture water use (Foster et al., 2020).

  description: Internet of Things plays an important role in agriculture monitoring
    area. The Weather prediction supports to the farmers make prediction in rainfall
    season through prior identification. Farmers want help maximizing boom efficiency,
    protecting assets and optimizing manufacturing through IoT. Changing climate patterns
    have implications for all walks of existence. Shrewd and complex weather forecasting
    is important to early forecast to reduce the impact of climate styles. Agriculture
    is a huge industry that is laid low with weather change. To acquire those desires,
    farmers need a weather forecasting result for planting and irrigation. Rainfall
    prediction using Internet of Things (IOT) sensors is a tough challenge in weather
    forecasting. Problem in machine earning techniques have feature hidden patterns
    in recorded weather records. Rainfall forecast refers back to the understanding
    of weather condition parameters, together with temperature, air strain, humidity,
    wind pace, etc. Rainfall forecast is the priority for early prediction of rainfall
    IOT sensors which helps each farmers and the people. Because the general public
    in India depend on agriculture. This paper introduces the Linear Regression Rainfall
    Prediction Technique (LRRPT) for rainfall estimation to select the importance
    of features. Often there may be a range at the same time to analyze the occurrence
    of weather conditions with weather impact rate (WIR). The system performs a forecasting
    process based on historical weather information and produces Categories of rainfall,
    along with wind velocity and temperature. In keeping with the characteristic importance
    the ANFIS neural network is carried out to expect the rainfall forecasting depends
    on the climate records carried out to test the forecasting technique. Experiments
    show that the system can achieve better prediction accuracy 91% precision 93%
    recall 94% and f-measure 92% in rainfall forecast.

  description: The objective of this study is to examine how IoT-enabled intelligent
    irrigation systems can be used in rice agriculture. The study uses sensors to
    gather environmental data in real time, such as temperature, water level, humidity,
    and humidity sensors. Machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks
    (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), and random forests
    (RF), are then used to process the data in order to predict future water demand.
    Experimental findings The efficacy of the system indicates, where ANN demonstrates
    the greatest accuracy of 95.6%, followed closely by SVM of 93.2%, DT of 88.7%,
    and RF of 86.5% These performance indicators indicate the robustness and accuracy
    of the model in forecasting environmental conditions for irrigation highlighting
    the positive. The effectiveness of each model is further demonstrated by confusion
    matrices, which provide instances of true positives, false positives, true negatives,
    and false negatives. Achieving a successful integration of IoT and machine learning
    ensures a proactive response to changing field conditions and lowers the risk
    of resource misuse through precise adjustments to the water supply. The results
    emphasise the potential of technology-driven solutions to increase precision agriculture,
    leading to sustainable practices that optimise yields while conserving resources.
    The study offers vital insights for agricultural stakeholders, opening the road
    for flexible and adaptable solutions that solve the problems of contemporary rice
    production in the face of altering climates and global food.

    Bluetooth classic (HC-06 module) and ESP8266 module (ESP-01) were implemented
    for wireless transmission. A fuzzy inference system was used to evaluate the performance
    of sending data, using the variables bit error rate (BER) and percentage efficiency

    of things; artificial intelligence; Wi-Fi INTRODUCTION The analysis of water quality
    for irrigation can assist in minimizing problems with irrigation equipment, such
    as obstruction in localized systems (Allende et al., 2015 ). The sensitivity to
    clogging depends on the emitter characteristics and the physical, chemical, and
    biological water quality (Baeza & Contreras, 2020 ; Zhoua et al., 2019 ). Water
    quality can be obtained through laboratory analysis of samples or the use of portable
    equipment such as multiparametric probes. Mendonça et al. (2017) recommended the
    use of probes, as they allow the automatic collection of data through contact
    with water bodies, not requiring sample collection or transport for analysis in
    laboratories, in addition to displaying real-time results. High costs and the
    need for installation in a safe place can be cited as limitations. In this sense,
    Cunha et al. (2020) emphasized the need to develop multi-parameter meters based
    on more accessible platforms and sensors, with support for communication technologies
    that enable data collection and remote access in real-time. The use of embedded
    micro-controlled platforms and accessible sensors, with connectivity based on
    basic assumptions of the well-known Internet of Things (IoT), is present in irrigated
    agriculture (Ogidan et al., 2019 ; Pandit et al., 2019; García et al., 2020 ).
    However, few studies have addressed the performance of the various existing communication
    architectures. The application of transmission quality metrics is indispensable
    for a concise inference. For this purpose, there are indicators such as the bit
    error rate (BER), received signal strength indication (RSSI), header error check
    (HEC), and packet error rate (PER) (Conti et al., 2003; Wel & Yan, 2007 ). In
    addition, Chiasserini & Rao (2003) emphasized that the joint and simultaneous
    appreciation of these metrics as an intelligent combination is preponderant for
    satisfactory inference. Fuzzy logic is widely applied for applications in multivalued
    analysis and decision support systems (Sá & Wen, 2019; Veronez et al., 2019 ).
    A fuzzy inference system (approximate estimation method) can be used to model
    the behavior of a process in terms of reliability even with ambiguous and uncertain
    information (Mousa et al., 2014 ; Rizvi et al., 2020). Therefore, it may help
    in the evaluation of information transmitted by wireless communication protocols.
    In this context, this study aimed to develop and evaluate an affordable multiparametric
    probe, as well as the performance in the remote data transmission by Bluetooth
    classic and Wi-Fi. MATERIAL AND METHODS The development of the multiparametric
    probe turned to the automatic analysis of water quality physicochemical variables
    from the pH (potential of hydrogen), turbidity, and total dissolved solids (TDS)
    sensors. The experiment was carried out at the Laboratory of Hydraulics and Irrigation
    of the Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil. Prototyping platform
    and sensors The selected hardware model was the Arduino Nano and the IDE (Integrated
    Development Environment) software, exclusively for this type of development. The
    Arduino Nano is a small board (45 x 18 mm), complete and compatible with the breadboard
    based on ATmega328 (Arduino Nano 3.x), functioning as a microcontroller. The pH
    (potential of hydrogen) was measured using a Ph4502c sensor module and a Bnc Diymore
    probe electrode. According to the manufacturer, it has the following characteristics:
    working voltage of 5 ± 0.2 volts, operating current of 5 to 10 mA, operating temperature
    range from 0 to 60 °C, analog output (0 to 5 volts), and pH measurements from
    0.0 and 14.0, with an alkaline error of 0.2 pH units. A TSW30 TZT teng Official
    Store turbidity sensor with interface board and signal conditioning was used for
    turbidity quantification. According to the manufacturer, it has the following
    specifications: operating voltage of 5 volts, a maximum current of 30 mA, temperature
    from 30 to 80 °C, analog output (0 to 4.5 volts), and measurement range from 0.0
    to 1000 ± 30 NTU. A KS0429 Keyestudio total dissolved solids (TDS) sensor was
    also used. It has a working voltage in the range of 3.3 to 5.5 volts, a working
    current from 3 to 6 mA, a maximum temperature of 55.0 °C, and analog output (0
    to 2.3 volts). The measurement range is from 0.0 to 1000.0 ppm or 0.0 to 1000.0
    mg L−1, with a measurement error of ±10% f. s. (25 °C). Sensor calibration The
    direct calibration methodology was used for the Ph4502c sensor module, from pH
    standard solutions, that is, previously known values (pH values of 1.79, 4.5,
    6.88, 12.13, and 13.99) and quantified by a benchtop pH meter. The indirect method
    was used for the turbidity sensor calibration. For this purpose, a Digimed DM-TU
    portable digital turbidimeter previously calibrated in Nephelometric Turbidity
    Unit (NTU) and solutions obtained from water and soil at different concentrations
    were used. In the process, the sensor under calibration and the portable meter
    acted on the same samples. A total of eight solutions with turbidity values of
    1.3, 158.0, 255.4, 315.2, 427.4, 571.5, 632.8, and 713.0 NTU were used. The direct
    method was applied to obtain the calibration regression of the total dissolved
    solids (TDS) sensor, using solutions with known electrical conductivity (0.50,
    1.0, and 2.0 dS m−1). The simple linear regression model was chosen for the calibration
    equations of all sensors. The slopes and intercepts of the models were estimated
    by two approaches. The ordinary least squares (OLS) method was used to estimate
    the parameters in the first approach. The parameters in the second approach were
    estimated using the generalized least squares (GLS) method, which is an efficient
    method to estimate coefficients of a linear model in the presence of heteroscedasticity
    and/or correlation between observations. The general form of the simple linear
    regression model in matrix notation is given by [eq. (1)]. (1) Where: Y is the
    vector of observations (response variable); X is a matrix containing the explanatory
    variable; β is the vector of coefficients, and ε is the error vector of the regression
    model. The β estimator by the ordinary least squares (OLS) method is vector b,
    obtained according to [eq. (2)]. (2) Different assumptions of the OLS method need
    to be satisfied so that the regression analysis can be properly used, producing
    the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). The independence assessment was performed
    using the Durbin-Watson test for first-order autocorrelation, homoscedasticity
    using the Breusch-Pagan test, and normality given by Kolmogorov-Smirnov. The β
    estimator (bGLS vector) in the generalized least squares method (GLS) can be expressed
    by [eq. (3)] when there is a certain residual correlation. (3) The matrix W can
    be constructed according to [eq. (4)] to correct the correlation between the cases.
    (4) Where: ρ is a correlation coefficient, in absolute values. The ρ estimation
    considered that the error covariance structure was first-order autoregressive,
    AR(1). Thus, observations ε at time t, denoted by εt, are obtained by [eq. (5)].
    (5) Where: at is white noise with zero mean and constant variance. In the case
    of uncorrelated observations, but with unequal variance, the variance-covariance
    matrix W is diagonal but has non-equal diagonal elements (wn). In this situation,
    the β estimator (bWLS vector) is commonly known as weighted least squares (WLS).
    Thus, the matrix W is given by [eq. (6)]. (6) Therefore, if W is diagonal, but
    with unequal diagonal elements, the observations have unequal variance although
    not correlated. On the other hand, the observations will be correlated if W has
    elements outside the non-zero diagonals. Furthermore, W can represent heteroscedasticity
    and the correlation between residues, simultaneously. Thus, if necessary, the
    models were adjusted considering one of the following ways: GLS method for autocorrelation
    correction, WLS for non-homogeneous variance, and the generalized least squares
    method with correction for both dependence and heteroscedasticity. The adjustments
    were performed using the R software, more specifically the gls (generalized least
    squares) function of the nlme library, specifying the argument corAR1 to correct
    autocorrelation by the first-order autoregressive structure and/or weights for
    heteroscedasticity. Details on methodology and implementation in R can be found
    in Pinheiro & Bates (2000). The indicators correlation coefficient (r), coefficient
    of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), index of agreement (d) by
    Willmott et al. (1985), and the confidence or performance index (c) were used
    to measure the statistical performance of the models. The RMSE metrics and the
    index of agreement were calculated only for OLS adjustments since these parameters
    are associated with a simple linear regression of ordinary least squares (OLS),
    according to Willmott et al. (1985), being estimated from the decomposition of
    the mean error by the referred method. According to Luiz (2013), the coefficient
    of determination (R2) for the GLS and WLS methods is not a good estimator, as
    the sum of squared residuals and the total quadratic sum consider both sampling
    errors and model error. Thus, R2 was not estimated for generalized methodologies.
    The significance of the regressions was given using Student’s t-test for the slope
    (b) and linear (a) coefficients. All tests were performed at a 5% significance.
    The regressions were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and
    Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to select the most appropriate estimation
    methodology. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity The multiparametric probe was built
    to support wireless data transmission collected by sensors from Bluetooth and
    Wi-Fi connectivity platforms, technologies that are compatible with Arduino. Bluetooth
    classic was implemented by the HC-06 module. The data collected by sensors connected
    to the Arduino were transferred to HC-06 from the Arduino/HC-06 interface, which
    uses serial communication, and then to a mobile application on a smartphone. A
    mobile application, acting as a master, was created for monitoring, while the
    module functioned as a slave. The basis of application routines was programmed
    in Delphi language, IDE Rad Studio Rio 10.3.3 Community Edition by Embarcadero®.
    The compilation was intended for the Android platform. The mobile software was
    named DTblue and is available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.madilopassos.DTblue,
    whereas the user manual is available at https://dt04.com.br/dtblue/manual.pdf.
    Regarding connectivity via wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), The 802.11 g/b/n standard
    for wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) connectivity was used from the ESP8266 ESP-01 module
    with Wi-Fi V3.0. The module was used as a Wi-Fi Serial Bridge to interface with
    Arduino Nano V3. The ESP-01 functioned as the master, requesting data from the
    Arduino (slave) in this connection. A WebService was built with real-time visualization
    by web browsers to monitor the traffic data. The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
    and styles (e.g., colors, fonts, and spacing) by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
    were used for front-end development. The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor was used for
    the back-end. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was used for information
    transfer. Paid services offered by the Umbler® platform were used for hosting
    and domain registration. It supports PHP technologies and MySQL database, which
    were used in the elaboration of the WebService. The registered domain has the
    electronic address http://dt04.com.br/. Probe evaluation and fuzzy modeling Five
    collections (tests), denoted by 01, 02, 03, 04, and 05, were performed with the
    sensors collecting and transmitting data at the same time after setting up the
    probe and building the tools to verify the consistency and efficiency of the water
    quality data. Solutions obtained by adding vinegar and sodium bicarbonate aiming
    at leading to reading variations were used to obtain data from the pH sensor.
    Turbidity data were obtained from “clean” water and water plus soil solution at
    different concentrations. Solutions of water and sodium chloride at different
    proportions were used for measurements with the total dissolved solids sensor.
    The Arduino Nano was programmed in each test (01, 02, 03, 04, and 05) to send
    the collected data every 1.0 minute for 8.0 hours at two monitoring distances
    (1.0 and 10.0 m) by the Bluetooth classic and Wi-Fi transmission protocols using
    the HC-06 and ESP-01 modules, respectively. Thus, each database should consist
    of a total of 480 values per sensor. The variables bit error rate (BER) and percentage
    efficiency (Ef) were adopted for the creation of the fuzzy sets and performance
    classification. BER was calculated according to [eq. (7)]. (7) Where: Ne is the
    number of bits received in error, and Nbits is the total number of bits received.
    Ef was calculated to analyze the data transmission efficiency, that is, recorded
    for each request during the sending time. It was estimated as the ratio between
    the number of values received by the number that would be sent/received if there
    were no errors, according to [eq. (8)]. (8) Where: Nr is the number of values
    received, and N is the total number of values sent (480.0 for 8.0 hours every
    1.0 minute). Once the input variables were defined, the performance classification
    was performed based on a fuzzy inference system. Its architecture consisted of
    three modules: fuzzification, inference, and defuzzification. In the first stage,
    the input variables BER and Ef of three membership functions were modeled with
    triangular and trapezoidal shapes and linguistic terms low, medium, and high.
    The classification proposed by Anderson (2011) was adopted to write BER in terms
    of linguistic variables, as well as the construction of its universe of discourse,
    while the clustering approach was used for the percentage efficiency in an attempt
    to discriminate clusters and guide writing in linguistic terms and because no
    classification was found in the literature. For this purpose, the Ef data for
    the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi platforms were applied to the k-means algorithm. Its objective
    function is defined by [eq. (9)]. (9) Where: ||xi (j) − cj || is the Euclidean
    distance between a data vector xi (j) and the center of the cluster cj, indicating
    the distance from n data points to the centers of k clusters. The number of clusters
    was identified by testing k values (k = 1, …, 5) to apply the visual method called
    the elbow. The number of clusters was determined by the maximum curvature point
    of the graph (Yuan & Yang, 2019 ). The percentage efficiencies for the execution
    of the methodology were calculated for the data transmitted by Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
    in groups of 8.0 hours (total) and subgroups of 4, 2, and 1 hour. The number of
    clusters was fixed at 3 using the elbow method and after some experimentation.
    Thus, the linguistic terms for Ef were defined from the observed centroids. Table
    1 shows the triangular and trapezoidal numbers for BER (a), Ef (b), and the output.
    The latter was associated with five membership functions. Thumbnail TABLE 1 Triangular
    and trapezoidal numbers for BER (a), Ef (b), and output (performance). Regarding
    the inference mechanism, nine control rules were established relating the three
    membership functions of BER with the three of Ef. The set of elaborated rules
    was interpreted by the Mamdani inference method, also known as the Mamdani controller
    (Mamdani, 1973). The maximum composition of the minima (max-min) was used for
    the composition of each control rule. The centroid or center of gravity method
    was chosen for defuzzification. The Python programming language was used to develop
    the model, implement the fuzzy logic, and cluster analysis, particularly the scikit-fuzzy
    and scikit-learn libraries. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Multiparametric probe and sensor
    calibration The cost of manufacturing the affordable multiparametric water quality
    probe with all sensors and accessory components was around US$ 42.82, calculated
    as of 6/22/2021. The prototyping of low-cost multiparametric for different purposes
    probes is recurrent, as observed by Ungureanu et al. (2010) , Faustine et al.
    (2014) , and Win et al. (2019) . However, Cunha et al. (2020) noted that the authors
    infer about stability in remote transmission, noise, reduced cost, and portability,
    without validating the collected information or models. Regarding the methods
    for estimating the regression parameters, the evaluation of the assumptions of
    the ordinary least squares (OLS) method by the Durbin-Watson, Breusch-Pagan, and
    Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to verify the premises of independence, homogeneity of
    variance, and normality for the pH, turbidity, and total dissolved solids (TDS)
    sensors are shown in Table 2. There was no premise regarding the residuals that
    must be verified for the generalized least squares (GLS) method (Luiz, 2013).
    Thumbnail TABLE 2 Durbin-Watson, Breusch-Pagan, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics
    and sample size (n) of simple linear calibration equations. The assumption of
    the absence of autocorrelation between cases for calibration equations of all
    sensors was not met. Thus, a residual first-order correlation, AR(1), was found
    according to the Durbin-Watson test. Some causes of residual dependence may be
    due to measurement errors or omissions of important variables in the model. Nevertheless,
    unbiased coefficients can be obtained, but they will not be efficient and significance
    tests and confidence intervals are unreliable (Chen, 2016 ). The presence of correlation
    between the errors generated by the models is possibly related to how the calibration
    data were collected, as ten readings with the sensors were taken in the same experimental
    units (solutions) at different times, configuring a test with repeated measures.
    Thus, there may be a correlation between the data obtained at these times, and,
    overall, these correlations are higher at closer times (Yokoo, 2014 ). Heterogeneity
    of variance of error terms was observed for the adjustments of turbidity and total
    dissolved solids, with non-normality for the latter. Violation of homoscedasticity
    can be associated with the presence of measurement errors or the absence of independent
    variables in the model, promoting errors in the significance tests and confidence
    intervals and, even though the least-squares coefficients continue to be unbiased,
    they are not efficient (no minimum variance) (Figueiredo-Filho et al., 2011).
    According to the Gauss-Markov theorem, the coefficients obtained with the distance
    from normality for residuals are biased and inefficient. Thus, the ordinary least
    squares method did not produce the best linear unbiased estimator for the calibration
    equations of the pH, turbidity, and TDS sensors. Importantly, only the Ph4502c
    sensor module, which has automatic compensation for room temperature, did not
    provide relaxation of the assumptions of heterogeneity of variance or absence
    of normality of residuals. Therefore, the solution temperature can be a key factor
    to be measured, as it influences several other parameters. Pinto et al. (2011)
    stated that the potential difference generated between the indication and reference
    electrodes is not only a function of the solution pH but also sensitive to temperature
    changes. Thus, the solution temperature interferes with the pH reading, and the
    higher the temperature, the higher the pH (Pratami et al., 2020 ). Both measures
    are necessary and must be integrated into a monitoring system (Patil et al., 2015).
    The pH meter of the present study has a temperature sensor for automatic compensation
    of the air temperature, but the liquid temperature is not measured. Regarding
    the turbidity measurements, part of the temporal dispersion of the readings may
    be due to the water + soil solutions used for calibration since a reduction in
    turbidity was observed with the deposition of material in suspension at the base
    of the container. In addition, the manufacturer reports temperature correlation
    with the readings provided by the sensor. Gillett & Marchiori (2019) also highlighted
    the need for periodic calibration after a certain period of use. In terms of total
    dissolved solids (TDS), the conductivity of ions in water depends on water temperature
    (Cloete et al., 2016 ). Ions move faster when water is hot and, therefore, the
    apparent conductivity is increased when water reaches higher temperatures (Rietmanm
    et al., 1985). Although the temperature of the solutions has not been measured,
    the developed multiparametric probe has support for a temperature sensor that
    can perform the proper compensation, and the DS18B20 can be used for this purpose.
    Table 3 shows the linear equations fitted by the OLS and GLS methods for the pH,
    turbidity, and TDS sensors. Only the intercept of the adjustment of total dissolved
    solids of the GLS method was not significant. Thumbnail TABLE 3 Models (ŷ) of
    the relationship between pH, turbidity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) values
    with voltage (x, volts). As the violation of non-correlation and heteroscedasticity
    was verified, the GLS method with both corrections was applied to estimate the
    coefficients of turbidity and total dissolved solids sensor equations. However,
    only the residual autocorrelation effect was considered for the pH adjustment.
    Table 4 shows the calibration performance measures, root means square error (RMSE),
    coefficient of determination (R2), correlation coefficient (r), index of agreement
    (d), and confidence index (c) for sensor adjustments of pH, turbidity, and TDS.
    Thumbnail TABLE 4 Statistics of model performance, root mean square error (RMSE),
    coefficient of determination (R2), correlation coefficient (r), index of agreement
    (d), and confidence index (c). The turbidity and pH calibration equations for
    the OLS methodology showed the highest precision, according to the coefficients
    of determination (R2) of 0.9401 and 0.9342, respectively, while TDS estimated
    the lowest R2 (0.8335). The performance statistics express good precision of the
    adjustments. However, the use of linear models provided by OLS must be careful
    due to the relaxation of at least one assumption regarding the residuals. Thus,
    the evaluation and selection of the method with higher statistical consistency
    were based on the Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) information criteria. The results
    are shown in Table 5. Thumbnail TABLE 5 Akaike information criterion (AIC) and
    Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The AIC and BIC values for all adjustments
    were lower for the coefficients estimated by the generalized least squares method.
    The Akaike criterion weighs between adequacy to data and adjustment complexity
    (Sobral & Barreto, 2016 ). As a rule of choice, the lower the AIC and BIC values,
    the better the model (Pho et al., 2019 ). In this case, the low AIC and BIC values
    denote the superiority of linear regressions by the generalized least squares
    estimator considering heteroscedasticity and/or residual autocorrelation. Some
    authors have evaluated only the statistical performance of the models and reported
    good precision in the sensor calibration equation using the OLS methodology. Cunha
    et al. (2020) implemented an integrated system (hardware and software) for surface
    water analysis and found R2 values between 0.996 and 0.998 for the pH sensor when
    comparing the readings with equipment available on the market. Gillett & Marchiori
    (2019) developed four low-cost continuous turbidity monitor sensors, calibrated
    in the range from 0 to 100 NTU and attached to the outside of a transparent tube
    at angles of 90 and 180 degrees, and obtained R2 values ranging from 0.9934 to
    1.0000 for a multiple linear fit. Jorge Junior (2019) observed R2 = 0.995 for
    the calibration of the SKU SEN0189 turbidity sensor. Probe evaluation and fuzzy
    modeling Table 6 shows the results for the parameters of transmission quality
    (BER), efficiency (Ef), and performance (fuzzy logic) for monitoring data at distances
    of 1.0 and 10.0 meters with the Bluetooth classic communication technology (BT).
    Among others, BT comprises short-range transfer technologies (Lia et al., 2018
    ) at initial speeds of 1 to 2 Mbps, implementing the concept of frequency-division
    multiplexing, i.e., it adopts a frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) time-slot
    scheme based on the forward error correction (FEC) coding technique (Conti et
    al., 2003; Nikitha et al., 2018). Thumbnail TABLE 6 Transmission quality (bit
    error rate, BER), efficiency (Ef), sample size (N), and performance for Bluetooth
    classic during 8 hours of monitoring and 1-min transmission interval. Tests 01,
    02, and 04 at a distance of 1.0 meter showed no inconsistencies in the packages
    sent (BER = 0.00), but the sending efficiency (Ef) presented inconsistencies,
    with excellent performance, with a membership of 1.00, when associated. In the
    concept of membership, an element belongs to the set with a degree of membership,
    that is, an element can partially belong to more than one set at the same time
    (Pessoa et al., 2020 ). The IEEE 802.15.1 standard of tests 03 and 05 provided
    noisy bits BER of 3.60×10−2 and 4.11×10−3, respectively. Despite the high transmission
    efficiency, test 03 presented a classification of poor (membership of 1.00) and
    good for test 05. Tests 02, 04, and 05 at 10.0 meters showed no information loss
    (BER = 0.00), only a delay in sending, with excellent performance for tests 02
    and 04 and poor for tests 01 and 05. Shin (2002) reported that unrestricted access
    to the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) spectrum exposes Bluetooth devices
    to a high level of interference, classified into two categories. The first category
    is linked to non-Bluetooth devices, such as IEEE 802.15 and HomeRF wireless PANs,
    and operates at the 2.4 GHz band, with IEEE 802.11 also operating at this band
    for wireless LAN. The second category is due to other Bluetooth connections (self-interference),
    as these networks adopt an ad-hoc topology called piconet and scatternet, which
    allows many Bluetooth devices to coexist in the vicinity. Thus, an open Bluetooth
    connection nearby may result in interference. Regarding the problems associated
    with non-Bluetooth devices, failures observed during the tests (Table 6) can be
    justified by the presence of the HC-06 (IEEE 802.15.1) and ESP-01 (802.11 g/b/n)
    modules operating from simultaneously on the same board. In fact, Mathew et al.
    (2010) highlighted that, as they operate in the same 2.4 GHz ISM band, there is
    mutual interference, a problem already addressed by Conti et al. (2003), Golmie
    et al. (2003), and Wel & Yang (2007) . Chiasserini & Rao (2003) reported that
    influences between 802.11 and BT occur whenever the interference energy is sufficient
    to cause a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver and the two transmissions
    of the system overlap in both frequency and time. Conti et al. (2003) emphasized
    that a careful evaluation should consider the presence of thermal noise, propagation
    impediments, interference, the relative distance between the interfering systems,
    modulation formats, coding techniques, frequency hopping, packet structures, and
    traffic loads. Table 7 shows the results for readings at distances of 1.0 and
    10.0 meters with the standard 802.11 g/b/n Wi-Fi platform (ESP-01). No failures
    were observed in the transferred packets (BER = 0.00) for all tests at both distances.
    Thus, distance did not influence BER. Thumbnail TABLE 7 Transmission quality (bit
    error rate, BER), efficiency (Ef), sample size (N), and performance for Wi-Fi
    during 8 hours of monitoring and 1-min transmission interval. Similarly, Ef had
    its results influenced by transmission delays, as observed in the Bluetooth tests.
    Also, it manifested a higher magnitude at 1.0 m (98.12%) and smaller at 10.0 m.
    (93.33%). Furthermore, the proposed fuzzy inference system produced an excellent
    output in all tests, with a degree of membership of 1.00. As previously described,
    Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards influence each other. However, the IEEE 802.11 standard
    defines physical media (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layer protocols (Golmie
    et al., 2003). When a node using IEEE 802.11b as the wireless standard wants to
    send a packet over the network, it uses the carrier detection protocol running
    on the media access control (MAC) layer to determine whether the media is busy
    or idle and uses their knowledge of 802.11 and BT activity to predict collisions
    (Chiasserini & Rao, 2003; Mathew et al., 2010 ). Challoo et al. (2012) studied
    the interference between Wi-Fi mainly as an aggressor in Bluetooth and ZigBee
    and concluded that IEEE 802.15.4 has a small impact on the IEEE 802.11 performance,
    while IEEE 802.11 can have great significance on the ZigBee and Bluetooth performances.
    Furthermore, instabilities in connection and signal attenuation can influence
    performance. Correia et al. (2016) studied the potential and limitations of automation
    with a low-cost platform and developed a prototype for automatic irrigation monitoring
    and control, with remote activation via WEB application. The authors reported
    that the signal underwent attenuation in the distance between the router and the
    module of 10 m in a straight line due to the walls, furniture, and appliances
    arranged between the devices. CONCLUSIONS Low-cost platforms (hardware) enabled
    the development of the multiparametric probe with a total of US$ 42.82. The experimental
    calibration in the evaluation of probe sensors must be very careful because it
    can harm statistical inferences regarding the adjustments and, therefore, in the
    monitoring of water quality parameters. The applied fuzzy inference system was
    satisfactory and allowed the performance evaluations according to the conditions
    of the proposed study, managing to capture the distinctions between the investigated
    protocols from transmission quality (BER) and efficiency (Ef) parameters. Among
    the communication technologies supported by the probe, the platform for Wi-Fi
    communication (IEEE 802.11 g/b/n) via ESP8266 version 01 presented the best performances
    compared to Bluetooth classic (IEEE 802.15.1) by the HC-06 V2.0 + EDR module.

  description: This paper investigates a wireless sensor network deployment -monitoring
    water quality, e.g. salinity and the level of the underground water table -in
    a remote tropical area of northern Australia. Our goal is to collect real time
    water quality measurements together with the amount of water being pumped out
    in the area, and investigate the impacts of current irrigation practice on the
    environments, in particular underground water salination. This is a challenging
    task featuring wide geographic area coverage (mean transmission range between
    nodes is more than 800 meters), highly variable radio propagations, high end-to-end
    packet delivery rate requirements, and hostile deployment environments. We have
    designed, implemented and deployed a sensor network system, which has been collecting
    water quality and flow measurements, e.g., water flow rate and water flow ticks
    for over one month. The preliminary results show that sensor networks are a promising
    solution to deploying a sustainable irrigation system, e.g., maximizing the amount
    of water pumped out from an area with minimum impact on water quality. © 2007

    Analysing and modelling traffic is one important step in the performance evaluation
    of communication systems. In this paper we focus on first responder (FR) networks.
    The goal is to figure out models that can be used to generate realistic synthetic
    push to talk voice traffic for single talk groups to be used in network simulation.
    Our work is based on an empirical long-time measurement of one FR channel. The
    analysis of the trace shows significant short- and long-range correlations as
    well as variations of load over time. As the characteristics analysed are similar
    to ones observed in disaster area (DA) traces, we consider n-state and 3-state
    (semi)-Markov models. After fitting the parameters of these models to the traces,
    synthetic traffic streams for the different models are generated and finally evaluated
    by both visual and statistical analysis. Published in: 32nd IEEE Conference on

    SECTION I. Introduction In the last decade, there has been a lot research in the
    area of ad hoc and mesh networks. These networks can overcome failure of single
    components by their very definition. Thus, ad hoc and mesh networks are seen as
    reliable solutions for public safety wireless communication systems. Simulative
    performance evaluation is used during the development of algorithms and protocols
    for these networks. However, for these simulations realistic traffic modelling
    is required. In this paper we focus on traffic modelling for first responder (FR)
    communication systems, i.e. communication systems used by paramedics and fire
    fighters during their daily work. Even though we find slowly upcoming data services,
    the main application today still is voice communication: different users communicate
    via push to talk voice calls. Each call is initiated by one sender that starts
    speaking and stops after a certain amount of time. There is only a half-duplex
    connection (unlike a telephone call): while one user speaks, the others have to
    listen. Different calls with semantic connection (e.g. question and answer) may
    be regarded as one conversation or session. In that sense a conversation consists
    of an arbitrary number of calls between two callers, and typically, the callers
    alternate in calling each other. The users that communicate with each other share
    one broadcast voice communication channel. Technically this broadcast voice communication
    channel may be realized e.g. as a separated physical channel or as a multicast
    group. The term talk group abstracts from the technical realization. In this paper,
    we analyse and model the push to talk traffic typical for FR systems. The kind
    of traffic in FR communication systems is similar to the push to talk voice traffic
    in catastrophe or disaster area (DA) scenarios. Thus, one goal in this paper is
    to evaluate whether models we developed for DA scenarios can be adapted for FR
    scenarios. We base our analysis on real traces obtained on the main FR channel
    of Bonn (Germany) in 2006. The remaining part of this paper is structured as follows:
    Section II describes related work. In section III we describe our previous work,
    in particular the models developed for DA scenarios. Section IV describes the
    specific area in which the trace was acquired, the measurement architecture, as
    well as the generation of time series. Next, the time series are analysed with
    respect to short and long term dependencies and heavy load periods (section V).
    In this context, we also point out the differences between FR and DA traffic.
    Section VI deals with the fitting of the parameters of the different traffic models
    to our traces. After that, we study the traffic generated by different models
    to analyse their impact (section VII). Finally, we conclude the paper and point
    out topics for future work (section VIII). SECTION II. Related Work Paul T. Brady
    analysed telephone voice conversations in the 1960s and discovered that on and
    off periods of voice are exponentially distributed ([1], [2]). Based on his work
    [2], the ITU-T standardised (ITU-T P.59–1993) a commonly accepted model for artificial
    conversational speech [3] where a voice channel is modelled by a two-state markov
    model (cf. figure 1) assuming one state as talk spurt (ON-state) and the other
    as silence (OFF-state). In analogy to Brady''s analysis the holding times in ON-and
    OFF-state are exponentially distributed. The analysis of group communication in
    land mobile radio systems began in the 1980s. The purpose was to derive models
    to be used in the design of the new trunked radio systems. The analyses of Hess
    ([4], [5]) characterise session length and interarrival times as exponentially
    distributed (similar to Brady cf. figure 1) and suggest models for peak load.
    He finally recommends to use the Erlang-C model. His results were confirmed by
    the Public Safety Advisory Committee [6]. Other studies (e.g. [7]) examine the
    behaviour of different talk groups to the system and suggest more complex models.
    However, the traffic is still modelled with exponentially distributed session
    length and interarrival times. Fig. 1. 2-state (On-/Off-Model) (semi-)markov model
    Show All Later studies ([8], [9], [10], [11]) show that modelling the channel
    holding and idle times as exponentially distributed is inaccurate. For channel
    holding times lognormal and for inter arrival time weibull or gamma distributions
    are closer to reality. Furthermore, correlations between calls with respect to
    short-and long-range dependencies have been examined. The call holding times show
    no correlation whereas interarrival times showed dependencies (cf. [10]). Nevertheless,
    the studies still imply a two state model as presented in figure 1 with different
    (non-exponential) state holding time distributions. Studies of the 1980s consider
    the traffic of a single channel (talk group) whereas newer studies consider the
    traffic of the complete trunked radio systems (multiple talk groups mixed). However,
    the lack of examining single channels results in less accuracy when modelling
    the traffic of one talk group. In [12] new traffic models are proposed that model
    single talk group push to talk traffic in disaster areas and consider conversational
    dependencies. These traffic models are described in detail in the following section.
    SECTION III. Traffic Models In this section we give a short description of our
    earlier work. In [12] voice traces from a large catastrophe manoeuvre were analysed.
    The time series were examined with respect to dependencies and heavy load periods.
    Examining dependencies of the call idle times due to conversational dependencies,
    a n-state (semi-)markov model was provided (see figure 2). A brief description
    is given in the following. After a conversation idle time Conv_IDLE a new conversation
    starts with at least one call with channel holding time Call_CHT. After this call
    there may be either a short idle time Call_IDLE (with probability p1 ) or a longer
    one Conv_IDLE (with probability q 1 =1− p 1 ). In case of a long idle time we
    return to the first state (Conv_IDLE). In case of a short idle time, the conversation
    contains another call with channel holding time Call_CHT. After this again there
    may be either a short idle time Call_IDLE (with probability P 2 ) or a longer
    one Conv_IDLE (with probability q 2 ) and so on (with probabilities p k and q
    k , respectively). Fig. 2. N-state (On-/Off-Model) (semi-)markov model Show All
    The transition probabilities p k and q k were determined from the measured conversations
    calculating conditional probabilities as follows: CO L k :={ ∅ {Conversations:
    CallCount ≥k} k≤0 k≥1 . CO L k :={ ∅ {Conversations: CallCount ≥k} k≤0 k≥1 . q
    k :=P{CallCount=k|CallCount≥k}= |CO E K | |CO L k |  p k :=1− q k View Source
    The probability for a conversation containing at least k calls is the product
    of the probabilities p 1 ,…, p k−1 , whereas exactly k calls is the product of
    the probabilities p 1 ,…, p k−1 , q k . Different state holding time distributions
    were obtained for call holding times, call idle times, and conversation idle times
    by fitting the distributions to the traces. For the call holding times and conversation
    idle time the best fit was achieved by a lognormal distribution. For the call
    idle times the best fit was achieved by the gamma distribution. Furthermore, the
    load of a channel was varying and heavy load periods were determined. The conversation
    idle times were found to be the characteristic parameter of the heavy load periods.
    Intuitively it is quite obvious: heavier load implies more conversations which
    implies smaller conversation idle times. Thus, heavy load periods should be considered
    when fitting the distribution for the conversation idle times. As the channel
    holding and call idle times are modelled identically for all calls due to similar
    distributions, a simpler 3-state model (see figure 3) was provided. After a call
    with call holding time Call_CHT (state in the middle) there may be either a short
    idle time or a longer one. The difference to the n-state model is that the count
    of short calls in a row is not modelled explicitly due to a memoryless property
    of this model. The probabilities p k and q k do not change for different k. After
    k short idle times it is as probable that a long one follows as it is after the
    first short idle time. In theory there is no maximum number of calls per conversation
    in the 3-state model in contrast to the n-state one. However, the probability
    for a larger number of calls per conversation is arbitrary small. Fig. 3. 3-state
    (semi-)markov model Show All Fig. 4. Number of calls over throwaway times Show
    All In visual, statistical and simulative evaluations both models resulted in
    realistic synthetic traffic for DA scenarios. In this paper, we address the question
    whether these models are also applicable for modelling (non-catastrophe) load
    on FR communication systems. SECTION IV. Measurement Architecture To obtain realistic
    time series of a public safety wireless communication system we performed traffic
    measurement on the analog German national radio system, called BOS-system (68–87.5
    MHz and 146–174 MHz). We measured the main FR channel (85.915 MHz) of the FR district
    of Bonn. The district contains an area of more than 140 km2 and more than 310,000
    residents. The channel is dispatched by the fire department of Bonn. The channel
    is used by about twelve ambulances and three fire brigades in parallel on average.
    Of course, during larger planned events (e.g. concerts or sport events) or catastrophes
    the number of users rises. In the BOS-system different talk groups are separated
    by different physical channels. Thus, all users of the district build one talk-group.
    We measured for more than six months (02.06.2006 to 06.12.2006). Our goal was
    to determine On-and Off-times for the channel. Based on short term fourier transformation
    (stft) we filtered out the relevant frequencies for human speech (100Hz − 7kHz)
    and summed up the intensities. When the sum was above a threshold, the channel
    was considered as being used (On-Time). We chose parameters such that a granularity
    of the resulting On-and Off-times of 10ms was achieved. A smaller value does not
    provide any benefit, because voice coders like G.729 [13] or the enhanced Mixed
    Excitation Linear Prediction (MELPe) [14] (for tactical environments) split the
    audio signal into frames of 10ms or 22.5ms, respectively. Thus, assuming such
    a vocoder to be used in a future digital system, more accurate On-and Off-Times
    have no impact on the traffic modelled. After this analysis there are still a
    lot of small false calls, that only comprise spurious noise. These false calls
    need to be discarded. As threshold value a throwaway time had to be found to discard
    calls smaller than it (cf. [1]). In our previous work [12] we performed a two
    stage method which yielded a value of 300ms. However, figure 4 shows the number
    of calls over throwaway times up to 5s. There is a significant decrease around
    1s. The reason for this are digital messages that are sent to reduce usage times
    for standard messages. Up to four short messages each 48bits long are send using
    frequency shift keying. Sending one block of four messages takes up to 1s to be
    transmitted (for further information see [15]). As these messages are no voice
    messages they need to be filtered out. After an empirical verification of the
    content of calls smaller 1s, we decided to set the throwaway time to 1s. Fig.
    5. Dependencies idle times – box plots for intervals over time Show All Finally,
    we base our analysis in the following section on 115,100 calls. We calculate idle
    and channel holding times and obtain the time series. SECTION V. Analysis of Time
    Series In this section we analyse the time series of the FR traffic obtained with
    respect to short-range dependencies, variation of load and long-range dependencies.
    Furthermore, we look for similarities of the FR time series to DA ones and also
    point out the differences. A. Short Range Dependencies For FR traffic we expect
    short range dependencies similar to the DA ones due to the conversational manner
    of the communication. If the communication follows a conversational manner there
    are many short idle times that are followed by a short one (calls in one conversation),
    short idle times that are followed by a long one (last call of the conversation),
    and long idle times that are followed by a short one (first call of the conversation).
    But long idle times followed by long ones are rare (single call conversations).
    Figure 5 shows a box plot for the idle time series obtained in the previous section.
    The samples x 1 , x 2 ,…, x n are regarded as points ( x i , x i+1 ) for i=1,2,…,n−1
    . The data of the x-axis x i ''s are pooled in intervals (of 1s in figure 5).
    The y-axis shows box plots for the intervals. The box plot shows median, quartiles,
    octiles, and extremes (for further details see [16]). The figure shows that both
    the boxes and the medians for the first intervals are much smaller when compared
    to later ones. Thus, many short idle times are followed by short ones which confirms
    our expectation of short range dependencies due to conversational manner of the
    communication. Fig. 6. Traffic intensity over time Show All To allow for an analysis
    of conversations, these conversation have to be identified in the trace files.
    In principle there are three possible approaches: speaker recognition, manual
    analysis, and time threshold based approach (cf. [12]). As speaker recognition
    is too complex and error-prone for noisy channels like ours and manual analysis
    is not possible for such a long trace, we decided to use the time threshold based
    approach. A new conversation is assumed to have started when the idle time is
    larger than a certain threshold. Inaccuracies may occur if the idle time in between
    two conversations is smaller than the threshold. In this case two conversation
    are regarded as one. However, this may especially be the case under heavy load.
    Even in this situations a kind of human backoff can be experienced before a new
    conversation is started in case the users are not to stressed up. The load on
    an FR channels (as we will see in section V-D) is lower than in catastrophe scenarios.
    Furthermore, the users of the FR channels are more professional and are less stressed
    than the ones in catastrophe situations. Thus, there are not too many inaccuracies
    to be expected. As threshold value we decided to use 3s, as it turned out to be
    a good choice during the analysis of DA traces in [12]. By grouping calls to conversations
    the following four time series result: call channel holding time: time one call
    lasts call idle time: time between two calls of a conversation conversation idle
    time: time between two conversations calls per conversation: number of calls per
    conversation Fig. 7. Correlation of traffic intensity and idle fraction Show All
    B. Variation of load Emergencies do not happen one after another with constant
    pause time in between. They also differ from one to another. Thus, the number
    of conversation is variable. Furthermore, as mentioned above, during larger events
    (e.g. concerts or sport events) or catastrophes the number of users and within
    this the number and frequency of conversation arises. Thus, there is a variation
    of load on the channel observed. As metric to examine the load, the traffic intensity
    may be used: T I [i;i+t) = time medium allocated [i;i+t) tim e [i;i+t] View Source
    It can be calculated for different interval sizes t. Figure 6 shows the traffic
    intensity over the time of four weeks (2,419,200s) for an interval size of t=1h
    . It can be seen that there is some variation. It is interesting that differences
    between day and night can be seen. As during night many people sleep the number
    of emergencies is smaller (cf. the extension in fig. 6). Thus, the number of missions
    and with it the traffic intensity on the communication channel is lower during
    the night. Nevertheless, the overall traffic intensity is quite small compared
    to the DA channels (cf. [12]). The time series that has the main influence on
    the traffic intensity is supposed to be the conversation idle time. To confirm
    this, we calculated the idle-fraction over time for the same month: I F [i;i+t)
    = ∑Conversation idle time s [i;i+t) tim e [i;i+t] View Source As visualising the
    idle fraction is more or less an inverse of figure 6, we prefer to show a correlation
    plot of traffic intensity to idle fraction. Figure 7 shows a strong negative correlation.
    Calculating a correlation coefficient results in − 0.9992194. This implies that
    the conversation idle times are the ones that excite the variation of load. Furthermore,
    it shows that the conversation idle time (distribution) is the one to modify when
    wanting to change the load of the generated traffic. C. Long-range dependencies
    In [10] signs for long-range dependence of interarrival times are observed in
    traces of trunked radio systems containing multiple talk groups aggregated. Long-range
    dependence intuitively means correlation between distant events in time. Self-similarity
    usually implies long-range dependence. A stochastic process X={X(t) } t∈R is called
    self-similar, if: ∀a>0:{X(at) } t∈R ≡{ a H Z(t) } t∈R View Source where ≡ denotes
    the equality of the finite-dimensional distributions (cf. [17]). The Hurst parameter
    H (0.5≤H≤1) is a measure for the degree of self-similarity. The larger H the larger
    the indication for self-similarity. Intuitively, self-similarity means that certain
    properties do not depend on the scaling in space or time (cf. e.g. [18]). Aggregating
    multiple on-off streams asymptotically can result in self-similar traffic (cf.
    [19]). However, the question remains whether there is also long-range dependence
    between the conversations of one talk group. To study self-similarity, we estimate
    the Hurst parameter H . There are different analytical methods to estimate H .
    We use three different methods to estimate H : The Variance-Time plot method relies
    on the slowly decaying variance of self-similar time series with rising aggregation
    level. The rescaled range (R/S) plot method is based on the fact that self-similar
    datasets show a rescaled range or R/S statistics growing according to the power-law
    with exponent H . The periodogram method estimates H by the slope of the frequency
    spectrum as frequency approaches zero. Further details can be found e.g. in [19].
    Figure 8 visualises these estimations. All estimated values for H are significantly
    larger than 1 2 and thus indicate self-similarity. A reason for this may be high
    variability caused by bursts of conversations. The amount and size of emergencies
    is varying over the time. Within this, the amount of active users and the amount
    of conversations varies as well. Thus, the long range dependencies of the conversation
    idle times are probably caused by the high variability of the emergencies. Note,
    that estimating long range dependencies as well as self-similarity is complicated
    and non-stationary and periodic time series may produce falsified results (cf.
    e.g. [20], [21]). We examined periodicity by calculating a spectrum using fourier
    transformation; but there were no significant signs of periodicity. Concerning
    stationarity the conversation idle times seem to contain non-stationary effects
    at different time-scales. Unfortunately, the sample size is no. 1arge enough to
    let us calculate Hurst parameters for disjoint intervals as e.g. done in [18]
    for Internet traffic. However, concerning simulations it makes only sense to consider
    long-range dependence, if a simulation run lasts long enough. Otherwise, the long
    range dependent effects would not have a significant impact. Typical simulation
    times for network simulation are significantly smaller than 60 minutes (3600s).
    Thus, complex models would not have an impact on the simulation. Therefore, we
    do not consider long-range dependence in the following section. Nevertheless,
    we consider long-range dependence as one important aspect and want to examine
    it in detail in the future. Fig. 8. Estimations of Hurst parameter for FR time
    series Show All Fig. 9. Comparison of distributions of FR and DA time series via
    cumulative distribution functions Show All D. First Responder vs. Disaster Area
    traffic In section V-A we showed that the FR time series show dependencies similar
    to DA time series. Thus, the approach using (semi-)markov models described in
    section III may be sufficient to model the traffic in FR networks. As a further
    step, it is interesting to compare the distribution of FR and DA time series.
    In the following, we study whether the distributions of FR and DA times series
    may be configured with the same or with different parameters. Figure 9 shows cumulative
    distribution functions for the different time series for FR as well as DA. For
    DA the time series of [12] are used for reference purposes. The channel holding
    time of the calls (figure 9(a)) for the FR is a little larger when compared to
    the DA ones. The reason for this is that the users in catastrophe situations are
    more stressed up. Furthermore, in FR networks detailed information (e.g. addresses)
    is given more often. Moreover, in DA networks it is impossible to send standard
    messages using frequency shift keying. Thus, even for short standard information
    voice calls have to be used. The call idle times (figure 9(b)) show a perfect
    similar distribution. Thus, similar parameters can be used for FR and DA distributions.
    Figure 9(c) shows significant differences of conversation idle times between FR
    and DA distributions. The load in catastrophe situation is higher than in FR networks.
    This fits to the results observed in section V-B compared to the ones in [12].
    The average traffic intensity of the FR channel is smaller than that of the DA
    channels. The average count of calls per conversation (figure 9(d)) differs slightly
    with two compared to one call per conversation. The conversations on the FR channel
    are shorter. A reason for this may be that the users are more professional and
    used to work together. Thus, they need less calls to exchange the same information.
    In general, there are significant differences for all distributions other than
    for the call idle times. However, the impact of the conversation idle time is
    by far the largest. The differences of the other distributions may only have little
    impact on the modelled traffic. Nevertheless, we will search for optimal distributions
    and parameter sets for all time series. SECTION VI. Fitting to Models As argued
    above, the 3-state and n-state-model may be used as they realise conversational
    dependencies. In this section we estimate optimal parameters for the 3-state and
    n-state-model. Furthermore, we also fit the standard 2-state model even if it
    does not realise conversational dependencies, as we will use it in the following
    section for reference purposes. For estimating optimal parameters we use the Maximum-Likelihood-Method.
    Having found the optimal parameters, the quality of the fitting to the empirical
    data was evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. We performed tests
    with four different distributions. The exponential distribution is the standard
    distribution used in the past (cf. section II). Recent studies show better fittings
    for lognormal, weibull and gamma distributions. Table I shows the results for
    the different time series obtained in the previous section. The first column shows
    the fittings for the call channel holding time that is used for all models. The
    second and third column show idle time fittings separated for calls and conversations
    for the n-state and 3-state model. The right column shows the (mixed) idle times
    as needed for the two state model. The best fittings for all time series except
    the conversation idle time were achieved by the lognormal distribution. For the
    conversation idle times the weibull distribution achieves a slightly better fit
    than the lognormal distribution. However, both fittings achieve a very small K-S
    distance. As the lognormal distribution showed better fittings for the conversation
    idle time in our previous work and the weibull distribution (with the parameters
    obtained) tends to produce slightly lower load due to larger idle times, we decided
    to prefer the lognormal distribution. TABLE I FITTING OF DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTIONS

    Please note, that due to the threshold based approach used for grouping calls
    to conversation, values smaller than three seconds do not exist. Therefore, we
    shifted the values by three seconds and fitted the distributions. Random variates
    produced by these distributions have to be reshifted (plus 3 seconds). Finally,
    we decided to use the lognormal distributions with parameters as shown in table
    I for all models and time series in the following section. Furthermore, we calculated
    the transition probabilities for the n-state model as described in section III
    (see results in table II). For the 3-state model we use the mean value over the
    first ten probabilities as means over more values are falsified by single outliers.
    SECTION VII. Evaluation In this section we provide visual and statistical evidence
    of the appropriateness of the models. The goal is to show differences between
    the models and compare the models to the original trace. For the evaluation we
    used the state holding time distributions and transition probabilities as described
    in the previous section. We generated one large trace of four weeks (2,419,200s
    = 28days) for each model and compare it to four weeks of the original trace. Figure
    10 shows 100 samples of idle times of each time series. The y-axis is limited
    to 6s to show details inside the conversations. Values larger than 3s are regarded
    as a new conversation. Figure 10(a) for the 2-state model looks denser than the
    trace in figure 10(d). Longer conversation with larger numbers of calls are seldom.
    The 3-state model (figure 10(b)) shows slightly better visual results. The size
    of the conversation visually fits to the trace. The n-state model (figure 10(c))
    shows the largest conversations. Compared to the trace the conversations seem
    to contain too many calls. After a first visual impression, we examined the count
    of calls per conversation. Table III shows the average count of calls and 95%
    confidence intervals over all conversation of the whole time series (28days).
    The number of calls per conversation produced by the 2-state model is significantly
    smaller; the mode does not consider conversational dependencies observed in section
    V-A. In contrast to this, the 3-state as well as the n-state model gain to model
    the dependencies. The amount of call per conversation is quite similar to the
    trace. However, the 3-state model tends to produce slightly longer conversations
    compared to the trace. TABLE III COUNT OF CALLS PER CONVERSATION Model average

    2.127673 0.036259 0.034291 trace 2.151705 0.016614 Finally, we wanted to perform
    further statistical evaluation based on traffic intensities. Therefore. we calculated
    traffic intensities for intervals of t={60s;900s=15min;3,600s=1h;21,600=6h} for
    the different traces. Table IV shows mean and coefficient of variation of the
    traffic intensities for the different models and time intervals. The table shows
    that even if the mean of the 2-state model is the closest to the trace, the variations
    over time are not modelled sufficiently. The 3-state model achieves better results.
    The n-state model tends to model larger average traffic intensity and larger variation.
    However, the 3-state and n-state model can be regarded as lower and upper bounds
    for the trace. The 3-state and n-state show benefit modelling FR traffic as they
    reflect the conversational dependencies. These have significant impact on the
    performance evaluation concerning delay and packet loss (cf. [12]). In network
    simulation of ad-hoc and mesh networks normally simulation times smaller than
    one hour (3600s) are used. Thus, more complex models would not have a significant
    impact on the results of these simulations. SECTION VIII. Conclusion and Future
    Work In this paper, we have analysed traffic that was measured over six months
    in a FR network. Based on this traffic, we calculated time series for single talk
    group push to talk traffic. The time series were analysed with respect to short-range
    and long-range dependencies as well as variation of load over the time. Furthermore,
    we have pointed out differences to traffic measured in a disaster area scenario.
    As the characteristics are similar, we adapted two models developed for disaster
    area traffic. We fitted standard distributions to the different models using the
    samples of our measurements. Lognormal distributions provided the best fit for
    all distributions. TABLE IV STATISTICS FOR TRAFFIC INTENSITY OVER DIFFERENT INTERVALS

    each time series) Show All Finally, we generated traffic streams for the different
    models. These streams were evaluated visually and statistically. The 2-state models
    shows larger differences to the measured data than 3-state and n-state models
    because the conversational correlations observed are not considered. Neither the
    3-state nor the n-state model consider long-range dependence or differences between
    days and nights. Nevertheless, the models should be used for simulative network
    performance analysis of voice communications in FR networks as they consider conversational
    correlations sufficiently. In the future, we want to investigate the aspects of
    long range dependencies in detail. Besides this, we plan to perform further measurements
    to analyse push to talk voice traffic in other scenarios (e.g. taxis, busses).
    Furthermore, we plan to examine functional relations between the parameters for
    the conversation idle time distribution and traffic intensity. Our goal is to
    adjust the traffic intensity of a scenario by adjusting the conversation idle
    time distribution. Additionally, we want to carry out a simulative performance
    analysis in ad-hoc and mesh networks e.g. of routing protocols. Authors Figures

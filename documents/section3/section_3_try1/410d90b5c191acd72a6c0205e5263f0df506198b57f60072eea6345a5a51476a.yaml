    The latest United Nations Climate Action Fast Facts highlights the alarming increase
    in greenhouse gas concentrations, reaching historical highs and projected to rise
    further [1]. In response to this challenge, the emergence of the Internet of Things
    (IoT)-enabled precision agriculture (PA) has gained prominence. IoT technologies
    allow for precise control and efficient resource utilization, providing viable
    solutions to reduce agriculture''s impact on climate change and pave the way toward
    agricultural sustainability. In the context of agricultural improvement, smart
    farming (SF), also known as PA, has evolved from relying solely on human knowledge
    and experience to incorporating science, technology, and domain-related data.
    Stein et al. (1997) [2] and Rossel et al. (1998) [3] were among the early proponents
    of SF-related ideas. Continuous improvements in tools, software, and hardware
    technologies are crucial for advancing agriculture. In recent years, there has
    been increasing interest in integrating artificial intelligence (AI), the IoT,
    information and communication technologies (ICT), and wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) into agriculture. These innovative technologies are being explored for
    their potential to facilitate the transition from conventional farming to precision
    agriculture. Conventional farming practices, previously reliant on manual labor
    and machinery, have undergone a digital and intelligent transformation. Taking
    a comprehensive perspective of the research domain, SF encompasses a wide range
    of topics, both horizontally and vertically, to propel advancements in the field
    and push boundaries. These research endeavors encompass a broad spectrum, including
    data analysis and its applications [4], intelligent control farming systems [5],
    effective farming management techniques [6], IoT-enabled farming solutions [7],
    agricultural supply chain optimization [8], ICT in agriculture [9], and numerous
    others. The research and applications in SF adhere to the basic agricultural IoT
    architecture. Fig. 1 illustrates various agricultural applications, including
    monitoring, precision irrigation, fertilization, and prediction services facilitated
    by a fundamental three-layer IoT conceptual framework. The perception layer includes
    agricultural sensing devices, actuators, and controllers for data collection and
    automation control. The network layer encompasses wireless communication technologies
    and data transmission protocols for interaction. The application layer involves
    data storage, computation, and data-driven applications and services for higher-level
    intelligence. IoT-based smart agriculture integrates knowledge and technologies
    from various disciplines, such as incorporating automated control, predictive
    modelling, and device communication and interaction in precision irrigation. Therefore,
    IoT smart agriculture requires combining expertise and technologies from different
    fields to enhance agricultural practices and achieve more efficient and sustainable
    outcomes. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    The interdisciplinary nature of IoT-based SF presents challenges in reviewing
    research across different thematic domains. As a result, review studies in this
    field predominantly approach the topic from the perspective of IoT architecture.
    These investigations summarize the diverse hardware and software technologies
    based on the layered structure and demonstrate their integration through case
    studies, showcasing how these technologies enable the development of SF applications
    and services. Other review studies on this domain with a narrow view focus on
    specific applications or technologies, as summarized in Table 1. Few reviews have
    classified the entire SF research domain and examined the research work within
    each corresponding subfield, which is important to identify the research gaps,
    drive innovation, and promote interdisciplinary collaboration. Table 1. Review

    revolutionized traditional empirical and manual-intensive agricultural practices.
    To this end, this review employs rigorous scientific mapping methodologies to
    attain a comprehensive understanding of the diverse facets of SF research domain.
    It highlights gaps and significant challenges, including energy efficiency, network
    performance, and security concerns, by integrating insights from perception, communication,
    big data, security, and blockchain technologies in IoT-driven agriculture. These
    obstacles hinder the feasible implementation of SF in large-scale agricultural
    settings. This review amalgamates highly cited and citation explosion research
    insights to outline prospective research directions. These include establishing
    energy models, constructing simulation frameworks, developing anomaly detection
    models, and incorporating software-defined networking (SDN) as promising avenues
    for addressing the current research gaps. The primary contribution of this review
    can be summarized as follows. • Conducting the scientific mapping method to position
    the IoT smart farming research domain. • Clustering the diverse subfields, studying
    highly cited and significant studies, and analyzing citation surge. • Examining
    the current state of IoT smart farming, addressing challenges, and exploring potential
    research directions. The rest of this review is organized as follows: Section
    2 introduces the IoT farming system application scenario, the limitations of existing
    reviews in this area, and the scientific mapping review method and tools. Section

    review. 2. Background Integrating IoT and big data concepts into traditional agriculture
    has led to significant advancements in research, providing abundant opportunities
    and challenges. Numerous studies have explored the theoretical foundations, technologies,
    tools, and frameworks, offering a roadmap for the progress and development of
    IoT-based agriculture practices. Maroli et al. [31] point out that smart farming
    has accumulated substantial research findings. However, conducting a comprehensive
    review of research across different subfields in this application-oriented interdisciplinary
    field poses a significant challenge. The fragmented nature of the research field
    exacerbates these issues, resulting in duplicated studies, as seen in the works
    of Cabarcas et al. [32] and Mageshkumar et al. [33]. A smart agriculture system
    that supports various agricultural applications and services, as depicted in Fig.
    3, exemplifies its interdisciplinary nature. The physical layer consists of numerous
    sensor nodes and controllers facilitating point-to-point and end-to-end information
    exchange through wireless communication technologies enabled by wireless sensor
    networks and ICT technologies. The edge layer involves data processing, real-time
    monitoring, decision-making, and control, incorporating various decision systems
    and predictive algorithms. The cloud layer encompasses abundant storage and computing
    devices to ensure the realization of agricultural big data. Download : Download

    system conceptual framework. Review studies have increasingly directed their attention
    towards these topics, aiming to provide an overview of the current research, identify
    gaps, and highlight potential directions for future exploration and investigation.
    Table 1 presents a curated collection of studies from SF review journals, organized
    according to their respective topics and types. However, some reviews tend to
    focus narrowly on specific topics, such as agricultural big data applications
    [11,12] or smart decision and management systems [16,17]. Others center around
    agricultural IoT architectures, offering detailed summaries of technologies and
    devices organized within a layered structure. These reviews fail to consider the
    thematic clustering patterns of research and the corresponding work conducted
    within these clusters in smart farming, disregarding the breadth of the research
    field. Scientific review analysis and critique emphasize the importance of utilizing
    the scientific method as the fundamental approach for examining textual evidence.
    Content analysis and bibliometric techniques have been acknowledged as established
    scientific sub-disciplines and are pivotal in evaluating research [34]. These
    methodologies encompass quantitative analyses of bibliometric data, including
    research networks based on key terms and reference citations. Garfield introduced
    bibliometrics in 1964, indicating that the methodology was not completely novel.
    However, it is worth noting that bibliometrics has gained significant popularity
    in recent years. As shown in Fig. 4, a noticeable upward trend can be observed
    when searching for bibliometric-based review work on the Web of Science (WoS).
    Bibliometrics has gained popularity due to advancements in AI and algorithm optimization,
    leading to the development of various tools such as VOSviewer, HistCite, CiteSpace,
    BibExcel, and Python. These tools facilitate quantitative analysis of bibliographic
    data, enabling people to evaluate research impact and identify trends. As a result,
    bibliometrics has become a widely accepted approach for conducting a review. Download

    Long-term trends in the usage of bibliometrics in review studies. 3. Research
    methodology There has been a substantial amount of published research in many
    fields of study, especially in some interdisciplinary disciplines, making it increasingly
    difficult to acquire the domain of knowledge over time. The knowledge domain denotes
    the accumulated information or knowledge associated with a particular research
    field. We intend to implement the knowledge domain mapping technique to gain a
    more in-depth and precise understanding of a specific research field. According
    to RM Shiffrin''s definition, knowledge domain mapping is a term used to describe
    a developed interdisciplinary science that aims to draw, mine, analyze, and classify
    processes. As the author also suggested in the paper [35], knowledge domain mapping
    seeks to comprehend disciplinary profiles, assess scientific frontiers, predict
    disruptive events, innovations, and research changes, and identify knowledge vectors.
    3.1. Theoretical basis The three fundamental networks are the co-occurrence network
    of keywords, the co-citation network, and the composite network of keywords and
    abstract. They are visually presented and are used to classify study areas and
    identify research road maps and trends over time. Examining co-occurrences generate
    a network of associations between words, highlighting their semantic similarities
    across different text segments, enabling readers to view the research domain from
    a more holistic perspective. Further explanation is needed for some crucial concepts.
    Betweenness centrality identifies significant nodes that can potentially drive
    paradigm shifts, such as nodes 16 and 10, highlighted in red Fig. 5. Various centrality
    metrics, also known as centrality indices or rankings, have been developed to
    evaluate the importance of nodes within a network [36]. The importance of a node
    is not solely determined by the number of its neighboring nodes but also by the
    significance of those nodes. Keyword burst and citation burst refer to sudden
    increases in the frequency of specific keywords or citations within a defined
    time. They assist in identifying the research roadmap and emerging research focus
    within the current research domain. Download : Download high-res image (250KB)

    Paper selection The literature review begins by locating research on IoT smart
    farming to provide a broader perspective and answer the questions posed earlier.
    The data for this review, focusing on the topic of ((\"smart farming\" OR \"precision
    agriculture\" OR \"smart agriculture\") AND (\"IoT\" OR \"Internet of Things\")),
    was obtained from the Web of Science (WoS) database. Specifically, we utilized
    the WOS core data set, searching for relevant work in June 2023. Referring to
    the search criteria process outlined in Fig. 6, a total of 1532 documents from
    the year 2010 to the year 2023 are valid for this research. The keyword network
    analysis relies on the keywords extracted from the topic search, including titles
    and abstracts. Further narrowing down to extract critical keywords, those terms
    with a higher occurrence rate will be the candidates for building the network.
    Then, 378 words that appeared more than 15 times in the research were chosen for
    this review study. Highly cited work and important research nodes are identified
    based on their citation counts and significance within the citation network. Analyzing
    citation bursts provides insights into the research interests and future research
    directions during specific periods. Download : Download high-res image (403KB)

    The review utilizes cluster analysis to identify subfields within research topics
    where the threshold selection for topic keywords could bias the clustering. A
    higher threshold excludes minor topics, while a lower threshold includes irrelevant
    ones, introducing subjectivity and potential errors. Furthermore, theme identification
    involves subjective judgment, leading to diverse categorizations based on key
    terms. This variability may bias study selection and interpretation in the analysis.
    In order to mitigate these limitations, forthcoming reviews could involve increased
    collaboration with domain experts to guide the selection of studies based on clustering
    themes. Additionally, the utilization of advanced language models can aid in the
    research selection process, reducing subjectivity and enhancing the overall objectivity
    and accuracy of the review. 4. Research themes visualization in smart farming
    Fig. 7 indicates the co-occurrence network of key terms, revealing three distinct
    research streams (clusters). The highly silhouetted and modular network indicates
    that the clustering results are apparent. Based on what is suggested by the keywords
    in each cluster, the three main research areas are \"crop-related issues\" (cluster
    A, red), \"network-related issues\" (cluster B, blue), and \"application- and
    security-related issues\" (cluster C, green). These clusters, which are not independent,
    are connected via the central research node, thus forming a complete picture of
    the IoT-based innovative agriculture research area. It highlights the interdisciplinary
    character of IoT-agriculture innovation research. Download : Download high-res

    topic or research field. Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10 indicate that the key thematic
    terms within an individual cluster belong to corresponding subfields in Fig. 7.

    and provides a broad overview of the entire research field from a horizontal and
    vertical perspective. Download : Download high-res image (379KB) Download : Download

    applications and security research. 4.1. Agricultural perception and optimization
    Crop and plant-related research issues are discussed as the first subfield, as
    referenced in Fig. 8. These topics cover crop and surrounding environmental parameters
    (\"temperature\" was the most frequent theme word at 13 %, \"water management\"
    at 11 %, and \"irrigation\" at 9 %). Hence, the primary objective of this study
    was to examine the key themes associated with each research group. Earlier work
    in this field focused on gathering crop-related parameters and using statistical
    and mathematical models to simulate plant responses to environmental changes rather
    than optimizing crop growth for improved yield and quality [37]. Regression analysis,
    as demonstrated by the studies of Sellam et al. [38] and Poudel et al. [39], plays
    a significant role in establishing correlations between multiple variables and
    exploring the factors that influence crop yield. However, it is important to note
    that these early research endeavors cannot be classified as smart systems since
    they did not rely on the sensed parameters for making early judgments and decisions.
    4.1.1. Monitoring system One of the main hubs linking in-cluster and outside of-cluster
    research subjects is the “monitoring system”, as depicted in Fig. 7. Monitoring
    systems are representative applications aimed at enhancing the overall efficacy
    of agriculture. These systems are utilized to monitor and collect agricultural
    and environmental parameters, which can be leveraged to train intelligent models
    for making farming predictions. Table 2 examines monitoring systems in IoT-SF
    and elaborates on their merits and limitations. Table 2. Monitoring system research.
    Research Primitives Merits and Limitations [40] • CC3200 single chip • Temperature,
    humidity, image sensors • Wi-Fi, GPRS • Serve as a basis for further research.
    • No specific methods for implementing. Accuracy and reliability of the system
    are unknown. [41] • Arduino board • Temperature, soil sensors • Wi-Fi, gateway
    • ThingSpeak platform • Threshold-based self-control algorithm • Cut down on the
    need for constant monitoring and manual intervention. • Restricted to areas without
    Wi-Fi connection. Manually updating systems to suit dynamic scenarios take time
    and expertise. [42] • UAVs, on-ground sensors • Flying trajectories design • In-suit
    data processing (consensus and symbolic aggregate approximation) • Less load and
    latency of monitoring-enabled tasks by integrating UAVs with on-ground WSNs. •
    Real-world implementation is needed to evaluate energy consumption and packet
    drop rates. [43] • Cooperating energy harvesting into agricultural sensors to
    execute monitoring tasks • Increase the lifespan of energy restricted IoT farming
    devices. • The efficiency and overall system performance are unknown. [44] • Sigfox
    LPWAN networks • ANN for temperature prediction • Sigfox-based IoT monitoring
    system for scalability. Tested in the commercial greenhouse for better practical
    generalization. • Poor performance in rural areas without network coverage. Subscription
    of Sigfox may limit use. The crop monitoring platform discussed in the work by
    Prathibha et al. [40] served as a foundational framework for future research.
    This platform enables system networking and incorporates two types of nodes designed
    to detect temperature and humidity data and capture images of crop growth. However,
    it should be noted that the system did not specify methods for implementation
    and go through systematic evaluation. A more advanced work, as presented in the
    study by Mondal and Rehena [41], focused on developing a monitoring system capable
    of real-time data transmission and analysis. The threshold-based self-control
    algorithm is proposed to reduce the need for manual intervention. Nonetheless,
    it would suffer from inadequate Wi-Fi coverage. Popescu et al. [42] introduced
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted monitoring solutions in response to the
    growing need for enhanced efficiency. The research further suggests optimizing
    the route planning of flying nodes to facilitate on-site data processing, mitigating
    network load and associated delays in agricultural tasks driven by monitoring.
    However, it is imperative to thoroughly assess the energy consumption of the constrained
    devices involved and the packet loss rate associated with the collaborative transmission
    of agricultural sensing data. As Elahi et al. [45] mentioned, ensuring power efficiency
    was crucial for IoT devices to enhance the effectiveness and prolong the operational
    duration of IoT-enabled systems. The research by Sadowski et al. [43] presented
    an agricultural monitoring system incorporating energy harvesting techniques.
    The primary objective was to prolong the system''s lifespan and offer insights
    for selecting appropriate wireless technologies. The study exclusively concentrated
    on assessing the energy consumption of different wireless technologies, lacking
    a holistic perspective on the system''s practical performance. Carlos et al. [44]
    presented a monitoring system based on LPWAN networks (Sigfox), aiming to enhance
    the scalability of monitoring systems in real scenarios, considering the properties
    of an extensive range of agricultural settings. The utilization of the system
    is somewhat restricted due to the need for extensive network coverage and the
    imposition of a subscription fee, which limits its usage. 4.1.2. Precision irrigation
    Other topic terms under this research cluster Fig. 8 are “irrigation” and “water
    management,” which are about water utilization. Water scarcity significantly threatens
    agricultural productivity and quality, impacting human survival and societal progress.
    The increasing demand for fresh water, primarily consumed by agriculture, exacerbates
    these challenges. Table 3 reviews the precision irrigation-related research and
    its benefits and gaps. Table 3. Precision irrigation research. Research Primitives
    Merits and Limitations [46] • Sensors and MCU • Wireless modules • Cloud-based
    server • ML-based data processing irrigation prediction algorithm • Fully autonomous
    irrigation using an insightful algorithm that considers sensor data and weather
    forecast criteria. • The proposed method relies on wireless communication, which
    can be disrupted in bigger crop fields without thorough investigation. [47] •
    Sensors and controllers • SWAMP platform integrating fog nodes, cloud, and smart
    algorithms • Hands-on guidance to build IoT-enabled irrigation system. • IoT Devices
    should be placed and evaluated efficiently to reduce energy consumption and investment
    costs, which is unknown. [48] • Sensors and pump motor • MCU and Arduino IDE •
    MQTT protocol • Computation of crop water requirement (Penman Method) • Develop
    a crop water requirement algorithm. Provide a solution for excessive irrigation.
    • Small-scale testing is not representative. Fixed thresholds are incompatible
    with agricultural systems'' dynamic nature. [49] • LSTM-based predictor • Irrigation
    scheduler • Irrigation planner • Considering the historical and current information
    to make irrigation prediction. • Without validation in real farming systems. Dynamism
    of agricultural systems could affect the accuracy of proposed method. [50] • LoRa
    nodes • Cloud platform and user interface • LSTM data fusion model to predict
    water demand • Energy efficient. Combine multiple data sources (data fusion) to
    make irrigation prediction. • Uncertain system performance for agricultural scenarios
    with multiple sensing nodes across a large physical layer. [51] • ZigBee nodes
    (sensors and actuators) • Edge and cloud server • SMPHA prediction algorithm •
    Updating the prediction algorithms to meet the dynamic changes. Offload the real-time
    tasks to the edge to minimize the latency and increase the system''s scalability.
    • The system performance including energy consumption, packets loss, response
    time are unknown. Goap et al. [46] proposed a smart irrigation management system
    adopting machine learning and open-source technologies. Despite leveraging IoT
    capabilities for efficient monitoring and control of irrigation processes, it
    is crucial to acknowledge that discrepancies may arise between the evaluation
    results obtained from small-scale pilot tests and their applicability to real-world
    scenarios. Additionally, the ability of machine learning to handle high-dimensional
    data is limited. The \"SWAMP\" solution, as outlined in Kamienski et al. [47],
    offered practical support for developing an IoT-enabled irrigation system. Nevertheless,
    it is essential to note that the impact of device placement and evaluation on
    energy consumption and investment costs remains uncertain. Further research is
    required to ascertain the implications of these factors on the system''s performance
    and overall feasibility. The research conducted by Rajaram et al. [48] focused
    on monitoring and analyzing data related to crop and environmental conditions
    to identify the optimal configuration for an automatic irrigation system using
    predefined thresholds. However, it is worth noting that the system was tested
    on a small scale, and the use of fixed controlling thresholds may prone inefficient
    when confronted with dynamic scenarios. Kashyap et al. [49] developed DLiSA, an
    intelligent irrigation system for precision agriculture that integrates deep learning
    neural networks and machine learning techniques, utilizing the Internet of Things
    (IoT) capabilities. The system aims to make irrigation predictions by considering
    both historical and current information. It should be emphasized that the proposed
    method has not been validated in real farming systems. The dynamic and ever-changing
    nature of agricultural environments introduces complexities that may influence
    the accuracy and reliability of the prediction model. Gong et al. [50] introduced
    an energy-efficient irrigation system that employs data fusion and long short-term
    memory (LSTM) techniques to integrate diverse data sources and enhance the precision
    of irrigation predictions. Nevertheless, the system''s performance and efficacy
    in agricultural environments with multiple distributed sensing nodes are still
    uncertain. The complexity and heterogeneity of these settings may impact the overall
    performance and efficiency of the system. Premkumar et al. [51] proposed an edge-based
    irrigation system that revolutionizes the decision-making process for watering
    schedules. The system dynamically adjusts its prediction algorithms to adapt to
    changing conditions, ensuring accurate and timely irrigation. It minimizes latency
    and improves scalability by offloading real-time tasks to the edge. It is important
    to note that the system''s energy usage, packet loss, and reaction time have not
    been determined and require further investigation. Rigorous evaluation and testing
    are necessary to assess the system''s efficiency and effectiveness in real-world
    applications. 4.1.3. IoT data-driven farming prediction In recent years, agriculture
    has shifted from a conventional approach to a data-driven mode powered by IoT
    technologies. This shift has led to agricultural and environmental data accumulation
    through intelligent monitoring and other innovative techniques. Thematic terms
    such as \"dataset\", \"data acquisition\", and \"real-time data\", depicted in
    Fig. 8, have emerged as prominent research areas in this domain, garnering a fair
    share of research interest. These nodes have advanced and interconnected research
    of \"forecasting\", \"machine learning models\", \"decision systems\", and other
    related topics in the agricultural domain. Table 4 provides an overview of forecasting
    studies in agriculture, highlighting their contributions and limitations. Table
    4. Data-driven smart farming prediction research. Research Primitives Merits and
    Limitations [52] • IoT devices for collecting farming data • Regression and classification
    models • SMOTE for augmenting data • SMOTE data augmentation improves frost detection.
    Thermodynamic information is validated to be useful for frost prediction. • The
    prediction model is evaluated using historical static data without in-site testing.
    Combining hardware, software algorithms, and analyzing performance as a whole
    to improve adaptability is lacking. [53] • Empirical mode decomposition (EMD)
    method • GRU sub-predictors • Capable of capturing nonlinear relationships among
    the heterogeneous sensing data. • The model should be integrated into IoT farming
    systems to evaluate its accuracy under real-life dynamic environment. [54] • Empirical
    mode decomposition (EMD) method • GRU sub-predictors • Capture the nonlinear and
    non-stationary patterns among the sensing data in an adaptive manner. • Models
    are evaluated using single historical data, so generalizability is not clear.
    [55] • LSTM crop yield prediction model • Genotype and weather parameters • Temporal
    attention and crop growing time-windows capture the time-series local dependency
    of farming data. • Local weather variations are not captured since weather conditions
    vary greatly over small distances. Diedrichs et al. [52] developed a prediction
    system for frost prevention in agriculture that considers thermodynamic conditions
    instead of relying solely on temperature and limited sensing data. Synthetic Minority
    Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) data augmentation improved frost detection. Still,
    with the intricate web of relationships and diverse components in the data, accurate
    prediction of future trends remains a complex task. In-site testing and evaluating
    of the overall system''s performance are needed for improved generalization and
    real-world applicability. The research [53,54] explored data decomposition into
    distinctive feature-based components inputted into a gated recurrent unit (GRU)
    network for prediction tasks. They proposed employing the Seasonal and Trend decomposition
    using Loess (STL) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) techniques respectively
    to capture the relationships within nonlinear and heterogeneous data. The adaptive
    nature of EMD enables it to effectively capture non-stationary patterns, offering
    advantages over STL. Both models are evaluated using single historical data, which
    raises issues regarding their generalizability. They need more testing to prove
    their efficacy in dynamic agricultural environments. Shook et al. [55] proposed
    an LSTM-based crop yield prediction model with a temporal attention mechanism,
    incorporating time-series local dependencies and focusing on crucial time steps
    in farming data. This approach enhances prediction accuracy by considering the
    temporal characteristics of the data. During the prognosis phase, the model inadequately
    accounts for localized weather variations, which is a crucial factor. Even within
    relatively small geographical areas, weather conditions exhibit a high degree
    of variability. 4.2. Network layer research in agricultural IoT Another research
    cluster focuses on network-related aspects of smart farming, particularly wireless
    sensor-related topics. This cluster explores subjects like wireless sensor networks
    (wsn), communication, performance, gateway, lora, iot network, scalability, and
    utilization, as shown in Fig. 9. Wang et al. [56] introduced a GPRS-based system
    for collecting agricultural data over long distances. Nevertheless, this approach
    faced drawbacks such as high traffic costs, infrastructure investment, and reduced
    effectiveness in rural areas. Wireless sensor networks emerged as essential components
    in IoT SF, enabling bidirectional data exchange. It facilitates more efficient
    data acquisition and communication in agriculture. Table 5 summarizes the work
    conducted under these thematic topics, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.
    Table 5. Network layer research in smart farming. Research Primitives Merits and
    Limitations [57] • Low power mesh networking • Bayesian Inference Approach (BIA)
    • Belief Propagation algorithm • Save energy and reduce the network load through
    constructing data to cut down on the amount of data that needs to be sent through
    the WSNs. The mesh networking is suitable for larger and dense monitoring scenarios.
    • Nonlinear correlations require more complicated construction models. Consider
    packet loss due to the system dynamism. [58] • IEEE 802.15.4-based communication
    • UAV and ground sensors • Introduce UAVs as flying relay nodes to assist transmit
    sensing data to the endpoint. The deployment of sensors in PA is highlighted.
    • Further work in terms of UAVs standard workflows and incorporating on-ground
    data transmission are needed. [59] • Plant backscatter sensor node • RF front-end
    for communication • Low-complexity Morse code communication • Lower power consumption
    and less complexity to implement. • Generalizability is not tested for the proposed
    system. Not support high data rates and spectral efficiency. [60] • LoRa radio
    module • Backscatter communication algorithm for long range and low-power communication
    • LoRa backscatter prototype with lower energy consumption is adopted to overcome
    the limitation of communication range • Communication overhead and latency in
    large-field settings. Point-to-point communication fails to adapt dense monitoring
    scenarios [61] • BIC-Hex architecture • Cross-layer-based hybrid particle Swarm
    wild horse optimizer (PSWHO) • Stable routing technique (CL-HPWSR) • Cross layer
    cluster head selection relief the common energy-hole problems. A robust routing
    protocol to minimize the overhead, latency, and PDR. • Without real-world testing.
    Lack adaptability to system topology changes and equipment breakdowns. Computational
    complexity and scalability are further concerns. Communication is essential in
    resource-constrained agricultural devices. Razafimandimby et al. [57] proposed
    to adopt the Bayesian Inference Approach (BIA) deployed at the edge gateway aims
    to save energy and reduce network load by constructing data to minimize the amount
    of data transmitted within WSNs. This approach works well in an agricultural environment
    with densely monitored mesh networks. Notably, the dynamic nature of the system
    may lead to packet loss, thus affecting reconstruction results, and novel data
    construction models are needed to capture the complex nonlinear relationships
    presented in heterogeneous agricultural data. Bacco et al. [58] suggested that
    PA in rural areas can benefit from using low-cost and easy-deploy aerial vehicles
    for transmitting sensing data and sending control commands. UAVs offer the potential
    to overcome drawbacks such as energy consumption, overload, and long-range transmission
    constraints in large crop fields. Nonetheless, there are currently no standardized
    workflows and processes for UAV-assisted applications. Further work is needed
    to reduce packet loss and incorporate on-ground data transmission. Daskalakis
    et al. [59] introduced the innovative use of cost-effective Morse code wireless
    technology in an IoT farming system. It aimed at lowering power consumption as
    well as the complexity of the implementation process. However, it is important
    to note that the generalizability of the proposed system has yet to be tested,
    and Morse code, while energy-efficient, does not support high data rates due to
    its low-bandwidth modulation. Konate et al. [60] further proposed a LoRa backscatter
    prototype that facilitates long-range communication with decreased energy consumption.
    In large-field dense monitoring environments, point-to-point communication may
    fail due to communication overhead, latency, and the dynamic nature of the systems.
    Kumar et al. [61] developed a communication solution that addresses energy efficiency
    and quality of service (QoS). It consists of a cross-layer cluster head selection
    mechanism to mitigate common energy-hole issues and a robust routing protocol
    to reduce overhead and latency and ensure a high packet delivery rate (PDR). Noting
    that the proposed solution did not undergo real-world testing raises concerns
    regarding its adaptability to changes in system topology and equipment failures.
    Furthermore, potential obstacles include the computational complexity and scalability
    of the solution. In an experimental investigation by Feng et al. [62], ZigBee
    emerged as a favorable choice for monitoring agriculture facilities due to its
    efficient time and energy requirements. NB-IoT and LoRa were identified as superior
    choices due to their extended coverage range to support large-scale farming. Singh
    et al. [63] and Klaina et al. [64] also suggested that LoRa is suitable for long-range
    transmissions over time and frequency-selective channels. It is worth noting that
    LoRa and NB-IoT require higher infrastructure investment compared to ZigBee. Despite
    having a shorter communication distance, ZigBee offers advantages in transmission
    rate and equipment input. Moreover, it supports mesh network topology, allowing
    for dense monitoring and broader coverage. 4.3. Applications and security research
    in smart farming The rapid advancement of agricultural technologies and the widespread
    adoption of automated monitoring and control systems have paved the way for the
    extensive implementation of agricultural IoT initiatives. Subject terms and their
    corresponding research shares offer valuable insights into the emergence of a
    distinct research cluster in SF, as illustrated in Fig. 10. This cluster encompasses
    various topics, including security (14 %), industry (13 %), computing (9 %), and
    blockchain (8 %). It explores a wide range of technologies and solutions. Notably,
    there is a growing emphasis on developing smart farming applications that harness
    the power of big data and artificial intelligence. Additionally, significant attention
    has been directed towards addressing security concerns within the agricultural
    sector, particularly concerning safeguarding the integrity and privacy of agricultural
    data. Moreover, noteworthy research has been conducted on industry blockchain
    and supply chain topics within this subfield. Collectively, these research areas
    aim to develop comprehensive solutions for real-world scenarios. 4.3.1. Computational
    architecture for smart agriculture The first group of research covered research
    topics related to \"computing\", \"iot devices\" and \"solutions\". The proliferation
    of IoT devices in support of IoT-based farming solutions has led to a substantial
    surge in data volume. This data growth necessitates efficient data storage and
    robust computing resources to effectively handle and process the influx of agricultural
    data [65,66]. Cloud computing and storage offer an optimal platform for a diverse
    range of applications within the agricultural sector, facilitating the realization
    of agricultural big data solutions. Table 6 compares related works in agricultural
    computing. Table 6. Agricultural computing architecture and big data. Research
    Primitives Merits and Limitations Computation [67] • Front-end (perception, control)
    • Gateway (duplex communication) • Back-end (database, algorithms, APIs) • Cloud-based
    concise referential IoT framework for smart farming. A conceptual cloud server
    with the necessary components is presented. • Limited preliminary results, and
    prototype lacks real-time decision-making benefits for large-scale farming scenarios.
    [68] • IoT devices with OM2M standard • Fog nodes with SaaS applications • Cloud
    server • A decentralized computing based creative IoT service platform facilitates
    agile and rapid computation. • Compatibility and security issues are of concern
    [69] • Flying edge nodes (agent environment) • Arduino test board • A flexible
    deployment scheme for rural areas with less communication infrastructures. • The
    computation and energy capacity are not adequately addressed, and the flying trajectory
    design for payload balancing is absent [70] • IoT sensors • Edge devices, fog
    nodes, cloud server • Mathematical modelling (MILP) • Heuristic algorithms for
    validation • The energy consumption of relevant IoT devices and technologies has
    been quantified to serve as a reference for future evaluations of practical implementation
    • Mathematical models developed to optimize computational requirements and energy
    consumption, but lack consideration of equipment deployment and real-world system
    performance Big data [71] • IoT data (Apple experimental demonstration station,
    China) • Granulation techniques • GA-SVM predictor • Employ dimension reduction
    techniques to mine valuable information from agricultural big data, thus reducing
    computation costs of IoT farming systems. • The lack of evaluation in a real-world
    cyber-physical farming environment restricts the generalizability of the proposed
    work. [72] • Physical layer IoT devices • XMPP platform • Moving average, 3D cluster
    algorithms • Integrate 3D agricultural big data analysis with empirical rules
    to optimize crop selection and decision-making. • Given the limited scale of testing,
    integrating data to reduce computational costs in densely monitored scenarios
    pose a challenge for big data analysis. [73] • Five-layer IoT agricultural structure
    • K-means big data mining algorithm • Propose a reference framework for agricultural
    IoT big data to provide efficient communication and extract information from agricultural
    data. • Sophisticated algorithms needed for high-dimensional agricultural big
    data analysis. Evaluation and optimization under specific agricultural applications
    are essential. In their study, Khattab et al. [67] introduced a cloud-based IoT
    framework for smart farming. This framework enables the collection and transmission
    of farming data to a cloud-based back-end for processing and analysis. They present
    a conceptual cloud server with the necessary components for implementing this
    framework. The proposed work has limited preliminary results, and the prototype
    necessitates augmented real-time decision-making capabilities to meet the demands
    of large-scale farming scenarios. Integrating fog and edge technologies into cloud
    computing is beneficial in reducing latency and minimizing data loss during transmission.
    Hsu et al. [68] leveraged a decentralized IoT platform that utilizes uniform IoT
    device standards for seamless and rapid deployment, aiming to bring processing
    capabilities closer to end-users and improve efficiency and performance. Ensuring
    the resolution of security concerns and evaluating compatibility with existing
    systems are significant in implementing such solutions. In the agricultural domain,
    a timely response to time-sensitive situations is crucial. The existing fixed
    IoT computing infrastructure may not be able to fulfil low latency requirements,
    extensive coverage, and flexible communication for efficient farming decision-making.
    To overcome these limitations, Uddin et al. [69] proposed utilizing flying nodes
    to enable a flexible computation and communication scheme. Nevertheless, the study
    needs a comprehensive discussion of the computation and energy capacity and a
    design for payload balancing during flying trajectories. According to Yousefpour
    et al. [74], edge and fog computing offered cost-effective and high-quality solutions
    for managing large data volumes while ensuring privacy preservation and timely
    data handling. In their research, Alharbi et al. [70] presented a hybrid computing
    framework that integrates edge, fog, and cloud-based technologies. They quantified
    the energy consumption of IoT devices and provided reference data for future implementations.
    Although mathematical models are developed to optimize computational requirements
    and energy consumption, the study should further consider equipment deployment
    and real-world system performance. 4.3.2. IoT agricultural big data applications
    Strategies and products related to big data, including applications or tools that
    leverage data to assist farmers in making informed decisions and improving their
    farming activities, fall into the second group of research topics within the agricultural
    application layer, as illustrated in Fig. 10. IoT gadgets and frameworks in agriculture
    have collected a lot of crop and environmental data, surpassing typical farming
    practices. According to Alfred et al. [75], the successful adoption of SF depends
    on the effective integration of big data analytics and IoT technologies. Moreover,
    the study by Lassoued et al. [76] emphasizes the transformative impact of agriculture,
    where the management, sharing, and utilization of agricultural big data contribute
    to more precise and informed decision-making processes in the agricultural sector.
    Table 6 reviews related works in agricultural big data. Extracting valuable information
    from large volumes of high-dimensional big data while minimizing computational
    costs is a significant challenge in improving agricultural decision-making. Ruan
    et al. [71] proposed a granular approach (GA-SVM) that breaks down big data in
    farming systems into smaller granules, effectively addressing dimensionality issues
    encountered by conventional mining algorithms. The absence of an assessment within
    an authentic cyber-physical farming environment restricts the applicability of
    the proposed approach to broader contexts. Furthermore, the challenge of making
    fast and on-site decision-making in the context of big data analysis requires
    further investigation. The study conducted by Tseng et al. [72] centered on applying
    3D big data analysis via an intelligent platform to gain insights into environmental
    farming factors. The research aims to optimize crop selection and decision-making
    processes by integrating 3D analysis with empirical rules. The limited testing
    scale and the challenge of integrating data to reduce computational costs in densely
    monitored scenarios pose challenges for big data analysis. Li et al. [73] proposed
    a reference layered framework for agricultural IoT big data analysis. The framework
    aims to facilitate efficient communication and extract valuable information from
    agricultural data. Specifically, the study focuses on modelling crop growth curves
    using an enhanced K-means algorithm that incorporates the selection of ideal data.
    This approach improves data processing efficiency and enables real-time data transfer.
    It emphasizes the need for sophisticated algorithms to handle the complexities
    of high-dimensional agricultural big data analysis. Furthermore, evaluating and
    optimizing these algorithms within specific agricultural applications are crucial
    for successful implementation. 4.3.3. Interoperability and security of IoT smart
    farming Fig. 7 cluster C comprises research topics such as security (14 %), interoperability
    (4 %), and privacy (3 %), which represent a considerable percentage of work in
    the field of IoT-enabled smart agriculture, as illustrated in Fig. 10. However,
    the achievement of interoperability, practicality, and security remains challenges
    in this domain due to the integration of diverse platforms and the generation
    of heterogeneous data. Developing practical solutions in these aspects is crucial
    for the successful implementation and widespread adoption of IoT technologies
    in the agricultural sector. Table 7 compares related works in interoperability
    and security. Table 7. Interoperability and security in smart farming. Research
    Primitives Merits and Limitations [77] • Information Management Adapter (IMA)
    • NGSIv2 data model • Introducing \"Data Interoperability Zone\" and \"Information
    Management Adapter\" for enhanced interaction among smart farming systems. • The
    NGSIv2 data model is limited by several data types. [78] • Data model • Standard
    interface and protocol • A standardized and open platform facilitates seamless
    data sharing among diverse devices and stakeholders. • The potential privacy and
    security implications associated with data sharing is not adequately addressed.
    [79] • Cross layer threat landscape is categorized. • Serve as a reference guide
    for farmers and developers, offering insights on implementing effective and secure
    approaches in IoT-based agricultural systems. • Insufficient provision of comprehensive
    solutions to address the associated security challenges. [80] • IEC 62443 security
    standard • THREATGET • Optimizing security measures by assessing the effectiveness
    of key security attributes to maximize the impact on security. • The energy and
    computational limitations of agricultural IoT devices pose challenges for compatibility
    with traditional security approaches. Kalatzis et al. [77] proposed the concept
    of a \"Data Interoperability Zone\" and an \"Information Management Adapter\"
    to facilitate improved interaction among smart farming systems to enhance data
    interoperability. The proposed study identifies limitations in the NGSIv2 data
    model, particularly in handling various data types, which could affect the overall
    interoperability of the system. Lopez et al. [78] designed and implemented an
    interoperable platform for SF that integrates heterogeneous sources of information
    using standard interfaces and protocols. This platform enables seamless data sharing
    among different devices and stakeholders in the agricultural ecosystem. Nevertheless,
    an exhaustive investigation should be conducted into the possible privacy and
    security ramifications of data sharing, aspects of utmost importance in IoT-enabled
    farming scenarios. Interoperability in smart farming systems introduces security
    concerns related to information interaction and farming operations, particularly
    in large-scale intelligent agricultural systems. Integrating diverse and heterogeneous
    devices within cyber-physical systems poses various security risks. The studies
    by Gupta et al. [81] and Vangala et al. [82] emphasized the importance of addressing
    cybersecurity concerns in the agricultural sector. Kariri et al. [79] conducted
    a comprehensive investigation of the threat landscape in IoT agriculture systems.
    It provides a valuable resource for developers, offering insights into developing
    and implementing effective and secure approaches in IoT-based agriculture. However,
    the study fails to provide comprehensive solutions to address the security challenges
    inherent in these systems. Shaaban et al. [80] conducted research to improve security
    measures within the IoT agriculture sector. They introduce a novel algorithm that
    assesses the effectiveness of principal security attributes, aiming to maximize
    the impact on security and mitigate potential threats. The energy and computational
    constraints of agricultural IoT devices pose a compatibility challenge regarding
    traditional security approaches. It is crucial to address these limitations in
    future research to ensure the effective implementation of secure IoT farming systems.
    4.3.4. Blockchain in agriculture The last group of thematic research topics encompasses
    the domains of industry and blockchain Fig. 10, accounting for 13 % and 8 % of
    the primary research share, respectively. Notable terms associated with this group
    include supply chain, privacy, and smart contracts. The agricultural sector is
    undergoing a profound transformation fueled by the integration of IoT technology
    to address the multifaceted challenges posed by Industry 4.0 [83]. Table 8 lists
    related works in the agricultural blockchain. Table 8. Blockchain-based solutions
    for smart farming. Research Primitives Merits and Limitations [84] • Trusted Trade
    Blockchain Network Cloud Platform (TTBNCP) • Two types of blockchain nodes (full
    functionalities, simplified verification) • Trustworthy verification and tamper-proof
    mechanisms are implemented to facilitate the integration of various stakeholders.
    • Insufficient computing resources at the edge or fog level hinder real-time task
    processing. [85] • Ethereum platform • Software framework for sharing among the
    IoT devices • No reliance on intermediaries and third-party services, resulting
    in cost savings, improved efficiency, and reduced trust issues. • High requirements
    for network stability. Limited computational resources hinder the deployment of
    large-scale agricultural applications. [86] • Agricultural network attacks prevention
    scheme • Private blockchain environment (dark web technology) • Mitigate DDoS
    attacks by implementing identity authentication mechanisms and ensuring secure
    data transmission. • The transparency and immutability of private blockchains
    are limited as they are controlled by a specific group of entities. [87] • Four
    layers distributed data sharing system (smart agriculture, smart contract, remote
    users, Interplanetary File System (IPFS)) • Propose a distributed data storage
    solution that enhances flexibility and scalability, while providing resilience
    against DoS attacks. • In densely monitored agricultural environments, novel data
    processing schemes are required to handle large volumes of redundant data. [88]
    • IoT devices at field level • Blockchain backbone • Smart contract • Implementing
    algorithms • Proposed a complete blockchain system framework to establish trust
    among stakeholders in pre-harvest and post-harvest stages of agriculture, incorporating
    implementation mechanisms. • Physical layer device malfunctions or anomalies could
    negatively impact the performance of the proposed system. Blockchain technology
    has revolutionized trust by facilitating transparent data sharing across networks
    [89]. In the agricultural domain, the availability of shared resources plays a
    crucial role in fostering sustainable farming practices. Ensuring food safety
    is a growing concern encompassing the production process, from planting to harvesting,
    processing, and distribution. Lin et al. [84] introduced a conceptual SF blockchain
    framework. It includes a trusted cloud platform that serves as the core component,
    facilitating the integration of various stakeholders through trustworthy verification
    and tamper-proof mechanisms. The limited computing resources at the edge or fog
    level impeded the real-time task processing capabilities. Grecuccio et al. [85]
    introduced a novel approach combining blockchain and IoT technologies to create
    trusted systems for tracking and monitoring food quality. Their proposed solution
    utilizes the Ethereum platform and a software framework for sharing among IoT
    devices. This innovative solution eliminates the need for intermediaries and third-party
    services by leveraging a decentralized blockchain framework, resulting in cost
    savings, improved efficiency, and reduced trust issues. Nevertheless, the proposed
    architecture demands high network stability, and the dynamic and volatile nature
    of farming systems with various IoT devices may impede the effectiveness of this
    framework. The limited computational resources at the edge also hinder the system''s
    scalability. Wu et al. [86] suggested an agricultural network attacks prevention
    scheme that includes authentication mechanisms, secure data transmission, and
    a private blockchain environment using dark web technology. Their approach effectively
    mitigates distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and addresses privacy and
    security risks in agricultural systems. Nonetheless, the utilization of private
    blockchains imposes constraints on transparency and immutability, given their
    governance by a select group of entities. A scalable data-sharing system for large-scale
    distributed IoT farming was proposed by Rahman et al. [87]. It separates data
    management and storage, using smart contract built on the blockchain to govern
    data-sharing permissions among stakeholders. The Interplanetary File System (IPFS)
    stores the physical farm data. This work enhances flexibility, scalability, and
    resilience against DoS attacks in SF systems. The central objective should be
    advancing proficient data processing and storage solutions to maximize system
    performance. It will significantly enhance the system''s scalability, maximizing
    its benefits in highly monitored agricultural settings. Pranto et al. [88] devised
    a holistic blockchain system framework to foster trust among stakeholders in agriculture''s
    pre-harvest and post-harvest phases. The framework leverages IoT devices to collect
    ground data, while smart contracts facilitate automatic and trustworthy interactions
    between different entities. It is crucial to consider that the performance of
    the proposed system may be affected by physical layer device malfunctions or anomalies.
    Hence, stakeholders must proactively address these concerns and ensure the system
    operates reliably and efficiently. 5. Top 10 cited research in smart farming Fig.
    11, entitled Top 10 Citations, visually illustrates the most frequently cited
    and influential research in IoT SF. Each color in the figure corresponds to a
    distinct research topic. Examining primary literature and associated citations
    allows a comprehensive understanding of the foundational knowledge and overall
    landscape. Ojha et al. [90] and Jawad et al. [91], highlighted in dark blue Fig.

    architectures. The former study provides a comprehensive overview of WSNs, discussing
    network architecture classification and communication standards. Expanding upon
    this groundwork, the subsequent investigation centers on energy-efficient strategies
    and energy-harvesting methodologies, accompanied by a comprehensive examination
    of wireless communication protocols. These two studies are pivotal in establishing
    the fundamental framework for on-site monitoring in IoT-driven smart agriculture.

    a significant volume of data. The second group of studies, highlighted in light
    blue Fig. 11, explores the applications of agricultural big data. Table 10 summarizes
    their novel insights and limitations. Table 10. Agricultural big data and networking
    architecture. Research Insight Limitations Future Directions Big data [92] A customized
    three-layer conceptual framework, incorporating essential components, is introduced
    for implementing IoT big data smart farming applications. Insufficient exploration
    of the specific agricultural big data applications with regards to the emerging
    hardware and software technologies. • Secure data sharing architecture • Data
    flow management • Integration of heterogeneous agricultural data [93] Offer a
    comprehensive overview, starting from the foundational IoT hardware and software
    components, progressing to. storage systems, agricultural IoT applications, and
    culminating in the top-level analysis of agricultural IoT big data. Lack of conclusion
    of the overall technical components and flowchart of implementing big data in
    agriculture. Networking [94] A hybrid network model is invented for larger network
    coverage in rural areas. A testbed-based case study is conducted to evaluate a
    set of networking performance. The network model proposed may not be suitable
    for dense monitoring scenarios, as the arrangement of physical layer IoT devices
    is insufficient. • Cooperating with flying fog nodes to enhance the agricultural
    IoT networking scalability • Approaches for securing IoT farming network are necessary.
    Wolfert et al. [92] proposed a three-layer conceptual framework for implementing
    IoT-enabled agricultural big data applications, leading to improved decision-making
    and efficiency across the industry. However, further exploration is needed to
    investigate specific agricultural big data applications concerning emerging hardware
    and software technologies. Elijah et al. [93] presented a theoretical basis for
    agricultural IoT system architecture and related technologies, covering essential
    IoT hardware and software components, storage, agricultural IoT applications,
    and a high-level analysis of agricultural big data. These two studies provide
    theoretical and framework guidance for achieving IoT-based agricultural big data.
    Additional research is needed to develop a coherent flowchart to successfully
    implement big data in the agriculture sector, with particular attention to data
    flow management, heterogeneous data integration, and security issues. Compared
    to the first group of studies, the subsequent group of research expands the scope
    and presents a more comprehensive framework to offer enhanced services. The third
    group of research, highlighted in orange Fig. 11, is dedicated to exploring IoT
    architecture and its associated aspects. Table 11 overviews of the top-cited studies
    conducted within this research theme. Table 11. Agricultural IoT architecture.
    Research Insight Limitations Future Directions [95] Present an overview of the
    fundamental three-layer framework in IoT, along with the technologies and applications
    implemented in the field of agriculture. Emphasize the security and interoperability
    challenges associated with IoT smart farming. Numerous IoT agricultural applications
    are presented, but the specific novel contributions of each work are not extensively
    discussed. • Full stack Standards for implementing IoT in agriculture • Devices
    deployment optimization for better performance of proposed farming systems • Large-scale
    empirical prototyping or simulation model for evaluation • Across-layer security
    and privacy concerns • Interoperability among heterogeneous agents [96] Develop
    a conceptual framework to facilitate rapid prototyping of IoT solutions in agriculture,
    empowering the implementation of innovative activities. The framework primarily
    focuses on a specific use case and may have limited generalization. The comprehensive
    analysis of security concerns is beyond the scope of this study. [97] A hybrid
    network model has been invented for larger network coverage in rural areas. A
    testbed-based case study is conducted to evaluate a set of networking performance.
    System performance, intelligent hardware deployment was not evaluated in the case
    studies, thus the scalability and generality of the systems remain unclear. [98]
    Present the applications of IoT technology in agriculture and discuss associated
    challenges. Review mainstream hardware, software technologies, and mobile applications.
    Provide an overview of UAV applications in agriculture Lack a comprehensive discussion
    of the interconnections between these proposed technologies, applications, and
    challenges. [99] Examine IoT communication technologies and their applications
    in agriculture. Identify a set of open issues and focus on evaluating the benefits
    of integrating IoT with traditional farming practices. Insufficient emphasis on
    IoT smart agriculture infrastructure, limited analysis and categorization of relevant
    research and applications. Tzounis et al. [95] examined the technical components
    employed in each layer of the three-layer IoT architecture. The study explicitly
    highlights the platform, hardware, sensing devices, and challenges to security
    and interoperability. Popovic et al. [96] conducted a case study on designing
    a private IoT platform. The study emphasizes platform architecture and the integration
    of components and technologies within the overall structure. It offers valuable
    perspectives into the key considerations and strategies for architecting an IoT
    platform for PA. Ray et al. [97] proposed a six-layer full-stack IoT conceptual
    farming framework. It investigates IoT technologies in agriculture, including
    hardware and software components, and presents real-world case studies such as
    intelligent irrigation and monitoring. This analysis provides valuable insights
    into the diverse range of IoT technologies used in agriculture and their practical
    implementation. Ayaz et al. [98] encompassed various agricultural IoT components
    and communication methods for agricultural applications. It discusses mainstream
    hardware, software technologies, and mobile applications while also providing
    an overview of UAV applications in agriculture. Khanna et al. [99] explored the
    utilization of IoT communication technologies in agriculture, with a particular
    focus on assessing the advantages of integrating IoT into conventional farming
    methods. The last highly cited study, highlighted in red Fig. 11, focuses on network
    architecture in rural farming areas. The proposed hybrid network architecture
    [94] combines WiLD and 6LoWPANs to extend network coverage in rural areas, as
    summarized in Table 10. This architecture is designed to support information collection
    and transmission in large-scale agricultural scenarios, and it has gained significant
    attention due to its relevance to real-world network requirements. However, it
    is worth emphasizing that the suggested network model may not be suitable for
    dense monitoring scenarios due to limitations in the arrangement of physical layer
    IoT devices. These investigations illuminate the transformative capacity of the
    IoT in the agricultural domain. They serve as foundational research, providing
    valuable insights and guidance for practical implementations, prototype designs,
    and related investigations in IoT SF. However, it is important to acknowledge
    that these studies primarily focus on fundamental aspects and may not cover topics
    such as IoT standards for agriculture, evaluation of large-scale scenarios, optimization
    of agricultural system performance, and security concerns. Future research should
    address these concerns to further advance the implementation of IoT in agricultural
    domain. 6. High-impact research in smart farming citation network Citation networks
    consist of citation nodes and their connected edges, and for network analysis,
    betweenness centrality is a crucial metric for determining the significance or
    influence of research nodes. Intermediary bridges facilitate communication between
    two network nodes that are not adjacent. According to Freeman (1979), the formation
    of the entire network requires intermediate members. Therefore, betweenness centrality
    is a metric for a set of indispensable citation nodes in the citation network
    that is interconnected and function as intermediaries for the entire domain (if
    a member is located on multiple shortest paths of other members, then that member
    is a core member and has greater betweenness centrality). In the citation network,
    if a research node attains a centrality score greater than 0.1 when we calculate
    it using the Eigenvector-based betweenness centrality algorithm, as shown in Fig.
    12, it represents its importance within the citation network. The five most significant
    nodes of mediation in the citation network are labelled from highest to lowest
    score as follows: [97] (0.2), [100] (0.18), [101] (0.17), [102] (0.14), and [92]
    (0.11). The centrality of a study in the citation network depends on its importance
    and the relevance of connected research. Influential citations within the broader
    research field directly impact the node''s centrality score. Evaluating a research''s
    influence and centrality involves considering its interconnectedness. Table 12
    overviews of five influential studies with high centrality scores and presents
    a comparative analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. Download : Download

    informed decisions regarding to the implementation of big data technologies. •
    The integration, management, and security measures associated with the integration
    of heterogeneous agricultural big data and relevant big data applications are
    beyond the scope of this study. Ray et al. [97] summarized the IoT conceptual
    framework, functional model, and application architecture in agriculture. It analyzes
    the IoT characteristics relevant to agriculture-specific applications and presents
    commonly used IoT technologies. However, the study overlooks scalability, security,
    and system performance issues in large-scale scenarios, focusing primarily on
    providing an overview of IoT farming applications with the necessary devices and
    wireless technologies. The research conducted by Harun et al. [100], Roopaei et
    al. [101], and Krishnan et al. [102] specifically pertained to traditional applications
    such as automatic irrigation systems. Their studies examine various aspects, including
    threshold warning-driven irrigation techniques, irrigation systems hosted on cloud
    platforms, and fuzzy logic-based irrigation control. Harun et al. [100] introduced
    an infrastructure for an automatic irrigation system, where sensors transmit automation
    commands guided by predefined thresholds, providing a foundational example of
    IoT SF applications. However, it is crucial to note that the prototype framework
    lacks a systematic evaluation to ensure its generalizability. Roopaei et al. [101]
    proposed a fog-based processing and cloud-based data synchronization architecture
    to address real-time processing and storage challenges. They also explored the
    integration of thermal imaging to optimize traditional ground sensor-based irrigation
    models. The work requires evaluation in dense monitoring scenarios, including
    energy efficiency, security, and networking considerations. Krishnan et al. [102]
    utilized a logical inference system to analyze data from various sensors and determine
    appropriate automatic irrigation actions. It provides a comprehensive standard
    flowchart for an irrigation system and conducted a case study to validate its
    effectiveness. It lacks a comprehensive analysis of the proposed system''s impact
    on crop yield and scalability in dense monitoring scenarios. The study conducted
    by Wolfert et al. [92] provided an overview of agricultural big data applications,
    challenges, and prospects. It offers valuable insights into the benefits of SF
    big data applications, assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding
    implementing big data technologies. However, it is important to note that the
    study needs to explore the integration, management, and security measures associated
    with heterogeneous agricultural big data and applications, as these aspects fall
    beyond the scope of the study. 7. Mapping research trajectories in smart farming
    In the dynamic process of scientific research, specific scientific studies often
    undergo a citation burst, wherein they experience a sudden and substantial increase
    in citations. These citation bursts signify the rapid surge in attention and interest
    devoted to a particular research domain or topic at a given time. Table 13 lists
    the top 18 research with strong citation bursts, but the subsequent discussions
    will be limited to the studies with the strongest burst among those that simultaneously
    began to burst. In addition, we will discuss the most recent burst research that
    reveals the current research trend. Table 13. Citation burst in smart farming

    2.67 The earliest citation boom in IoT precision agriculture research occurred
    between 2016 and 2019. Notably, studies by Gubbi et al. [103] and Al-Fuqaha et
    al. [106] comprehensively studied the fundamental concepts and enabling technologies
    of the Internet of Things (IoT), covering aspects such as architecture, devices,
    and protocols. These studies play a significant role in shaping the understanding
    and propelling the development of IoT in agricultural scenarios. While IoT technology
    has been around since 1994 (credited to Kevin Ashton, one of the founders of MIT''s
    Auto-ID Center, who coined the term Internet of Things), its adoption in the agricultural
    sector gained significant attention only about a decade ago. The citation burst
    in 2016 signifies a growing interest in utilizing IoT technology in the traditional
    agricultural industry to address agricultural challenges and enhance farming practices.
    Ojha et al. [90] experienced a significant citation burst between 2017 and 2020,
    indicating its considerable impact. The study primarily centers on wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) of smart farming systems. WSNs serve as the grounded infrastructure
    for data collection and communication, playing a crucial role in implementing
    IoT-based solutions. The citation burst indicates the research focus on nearfield
    agriculture-specific WSNs. It highlights the objective of designing a customized
    network architecture with suitable hardware and software technologies to meet
    the specific application requirements. Starting from 2017, the citation count
    of automated irrigation system by Gutierrez et al. [104] has shown a notable increase.
    The surge in this research topic highlights the shift of research focus towards
    the application as the theoretical frameworks, conceptual models, and technologies
    continue to evolve in agriculture sector. A notable focus of applied research,
    particularly in irrigation systems integrating monitoring and automated control,
    revolves around evaluating and refining theories, frameworks, and technologies
    through practical applications. The primary objective is to ensure their effectiveness
    in addressing agricultural challenges and enhancing agricultural practices. By
    incorporating real-world agricultural scenarios, stakeholders aim to validate
    and optimize these elements, achieving practical and impactful outcomes. As illustrated
    in Table 13, a cluster of research citations indicates a rising trend, highlighting
    the growing significance of the associated research topics. In the dynamic landscape
    of IoT smart agriculture, related applications and research efforts extend beyond
    the usability of technologies and architectures. It encompasses higher-order requirements
    such as efficient IoT farming system management, privacy and security considerations
    in agricultural systems, and system performance optimization. Saiz-Rubio & Rovira-Maz
    [105] offered a management loop that includes crop data acquisition, variable
    rate control, automation, agricultural big data, and decision-making. The citation
    burst in this area reflects the growing importance and popularity of research
    on managing and leveraging agricultural data and data-driven applications in the
    context of the expanding adoption and scale of smart farming. These studies offer
    crucial assurance for enhancing agricultural productivity and quality in a sustainable
    manner. The studies by Ferrag et al. [107] and Yang et al. [114] demonstrated
    a notable citation burst, which specifically survey authentication, confidentiality,
    non-repudiation, integrity, and access control aspects to provide valuable insights
    into the latest security and privacy hazard. Employing computing and energy-constrained
    devices pose challenges for traditional network methods like encryption and security
    authentication. The unique characteristics of the IoT farming systems, including
    dense monitoring requirements and a heterogeneous landscape, necessitate specialized
    security approaches to address compatibility issues. It indicates the increasing
    focus on security and privacy issues and the need for effective solutions. Liu
    et al. [113] and Torky et al. [115] have witnessed a citation burst, primarily
    focusing exploring blockchain technology to address security and privacy concerns
    in agriculture resulting from adopting IoT technologies and achieving interoperability.
    As smart agriculture continues to gain momentum, the advancement of agricultural
    big data heavily relies on facilitating data sharing and integration. Ensuring
    the security and privacy of data during the sharing process for stakeholders becomes
    increasingly crucial. The surge in citations signifies the growing research emphasis
    on utilizing blockchain technology in conjunction with the widespread implementation
    of IoT in agriculture. The research by Kim et al. [109] on UAVs in agriculture
    has experienced a surge in citations. It explores the application of UAVs for
    tasks like automated spraying, monitoring, and terrain mapping, introducing specialized
    UAV devices and communication methods for agricultural use. The increasing number
    of citations on this topic reflects the growing interest in using UAVs. This interest
    stems from the fact that UAVs can provide mobility and act as gateways or relay
    nodes, thereby enhancing data transmission and processing based on the traffic
    conditions of ground sensors. Overcoming the limitations of energy-constrained
    agricultural sensors, UAVs improve the system''s overall performance. 8. Discussion
    and future research directions 8.1. Discussion In the preceding sections, we critically
    investigate the interdisciplinary research domain of SF, exploring research subfield
    clustering, influential high citation studies, critical research in the citation
    network, and trends revealed by citation burst analysis. The extensive investigation
    of relevant research conducted under diverse thematic domains reveals an accumulation
    of research outcomes encompassing system conceptual models, network frameworks,
    automation control, computing architectures, security methods, and predictive
    decision-making applications. The complexities and specificities of the agricultural
    domain, such as large cultivated areas, harsh natural conditions, limited infrastructure
    in remote regions, energy and computation constraints, and the need for dense
    monitoring, have posed challenges in the widespread implementation of IoT SF prototypes
    in large real-life farming scenarios. Many of the studies reviewed in this work
    center on conceptual model development and small-scale prototype testing. However,
    these studies prioritize utilizing existing technologies to achieve agricultural
    intelligence, often overlooking efficacy, applicability, and scalability considerations.
    The unique characteristics of the agriculture sector call for tailored and innovative
    solutions to effectively address the diverse requirements and concerns and ensure
    its successful integration into real-world agricultural practices to achieve sustainability
    with minimal inputs and optimal outputs. Energy consumption: Wireless sensors
    and routing nodes form the near-field communication architecture, which collects
    and transmits agricultural parameters to facilitate data-driven agricultural activities.
    However, it is crucial to address the issue of battery-powered IoT devices, as
    their depletion can lead to system anomalies or paralysis, warranting further
    attention. The energy-efficient strategies in smart farming encompass energy harvesting
    [43], but weather conditions and device investment limit their effectiveness.
    Additionally, using low-power communication technologies [50,59] can lead to low
    data rates affecting real-time agricultural decision-making. Data reduction methods
    [57] are employed but may not be suitable for intensive monitoring scenarios.
    Moreover, routing protocols to alleviate energy holes [61] necessitate continuous
    computation and transformation of transmission paths based on nodes’ energy level,
    introducing challenges related to computational resources, energy consumption,
    and delays. Agricultural system network performance: Network performance metrics
    such as latency, data transmission hop count, and packet delivery rate are crucial
    in achieving real-timecontrol, precise decision-making, and network security.
    However, these network performance parameters are often overlooked due to the
    focus of IoT smart farming research on applications and the integration of existing
    technologies to achieve agricultural intelligence. Only a limited number of studies
    have explored the optimization of agricultural system latency by reducing network
    load by using flying nodes [42,58].Recent research citation burst [109] indicates
    a growing interest in investigating flying nodes as an effective method to optimize
    energy consumption and reduce latency. Some studies have proposed incorporating
    edge computing nodes to handle time-sensitive tasks [51]. Notably, there remains
    a need for further research that specifically emphasizes monitoring and enhancing
    parameters like data transmission hop count and packet delivery rate. In large-scale
    smart farming scenarios, the end-to-end data transmission hop count significantly
    impacts system security and data quality. The dynamic nature of the WSNs in smart
    farming leads to data losses that directly affect the effectiveness of data-driven
    agricultural applications. Security concerns: The IoT farming system consists
    of many energy and computation-constrained wireless devices, making traditional
    mature network and system security measures unsuitable for direct implementation
    in agricultural applications. The increasing citations indicate an increasing
    awareness of agricultural system security concerns. However, a substantial research
    gap remains, with only a few studies addressing security concerns. Shaaban et
    al. [80] proposed a range of traditional encryption algorithms, communication
    protocols, and access control methods; however, these face limitations due to
    device energy and computation constraints. Lin et al. [84] and Pranto et al. [88]
    introduced blockchain-based technologies to enhance the security of agricultural
    data. The growing number of related citations [107,114] indicate increasing concerns
    in addressing privacy and data security in agricultural systems. Nevertheless,
    blockchain technology mainly focuses on application-level data security and privacy,
    leaving notable research gaps in addressing network security issues in near-field
    WSNs of farming systems, such as data injection and tampering. 8.2. Future research
    directions Our extensive review of research in IoT smart farming shows that unresolved
    issues and challenges require further attention from the research communities.
    The promising directions are introduced. • Various energy-constrained devices,
    such as sensors and routing nodes, perform tasks related to sensing and interaction.
    Developing energy models for these devices can assist in assessing and optimizing
    the energy consumption of relevant IoT agricultural applications. • The simulation
    framework of agricultural systems integrates virtual agents representing relevant
    agricultural IoT devices, along with their configurations, such as field size,
    number of devices, and locations. Additionally, it encompasses the interaction
    mechanism among these devices. This framework enables the rapid prototyping of
    agricultural system conceptual models, including node deployment and communication
    setup, allowing for evaluating and optimizing network performance in simulated
    real-world scenarios. • Developing anomaly detection algorithms helps mitigate
    the risk of data tampering and injection caused by the energy and computational
    limitations of underlying network devices in IoT agricultural systems. As these
    devices might not support complex security measures, anomaly detection becomes
    essential in identifying and addressing potential data integrity issues. • SDN
    optimizes overall network performance by enhancing resource management and scheduling.
    It enables dynamic resource allocation, efficient traffic control, and adaptability
    to changing demands, improving smart farming system efficiency and effectiveness.
    9. Conclusion The increasing attention to adopting IoT technology to address challenges
    related to the overconsumption of non-renewable resources and climate change is
    crucial in promoting sustainable agricultural development. Through an extensive
    review of research in the field of IoT smart farming, the study classifies research
    into different thematic categories, explores highly cited foundational literature,
    examines critical nodes in citation networks, and analyses citation burst trends
    in relevant research topics. The primary goals of this review are to provide stakeholders
    and policymakers with a comprehensive understanding of the field, identify key
    research directions within each theme, and gain valuable insights from analyzing
    foundational literature and significant research nodes. Through the examination,
    the study aims to unveil the evolution of research interests and offer crucial
    theoretical and practical guidance for advancing the field further. Finally, based
    on an investigation of existing research, this review highlights several pending
    issues in energy consumption, network performance of agricultural systems, and
    security, and possible future research directions, including energy models of
    farming systems, simulation architectures, anomaly detection algorithms, and SDN.
    The review adopts cluster analysis to identify subfields within research topics.
    However, the threshold selection for topic keywords could introduce bias and errors.
    Subjective judgment in theme identification may lead to diverse categorizations
    and potential study selection bias. Future reviews adopting a similar approach
    could collaborate with more feedback from domain experts and use advanced language
    models to address these limitations for more objective and accurate results. Credit

    Keywords: UAV; IoT; satellite; Precision Agriculture; proximal sensing; remote
    sensing; challenges 1. Introduction Worldwide food production is a more sensitive
    issue than ever before. The global population is expected to reach 10 billion
    by 2050, adding an extra 2.4 billion to the global urban population, and increasing
    overall demand for food production by 70 percent [1]. At the same time, reduced
    rural population, degraded farmlands [2], climate change decreasing agricultural
    productivity [3], and food waste [4] make this requirement quite difficult to
    meet unless the agricultural productive model changes dramatically. To this end,
    Agriculture 4.0, or the fourth Agricultural Revolution, promises a technological
    revolution for enhanced agricultural productivity and increased eco-efficiency
    [5]. Driven by the wider Industry 4.0 paradigm shift, Agriculture 4.0 brings to
    the agricultural sector a number of mainstream technologies, including sensing
    infrastructures, big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and
    robotics [6]. It thus engages in a unifying model pertinent to different domains
    of human activity ([7,8]), recognizing cyberphysical systems and their components
    as a key element in this transition [9] and targeting an increase in the overall
    quality of life leading to Society 5.0 paradigm [10]. Sensing plays an important
    role in the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm shift. Obtaining the necessary information
    from the field may be achieved by exploiting different technological options that
    include ground-based sensors, or remote sensing techniques ([11,12]). The former
    are strongly associated with technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT)
    ([13,14]) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [15], as well as Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) [16]. The latter may be distinguished from airborne remote
    sensing utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and spaceborne remote sensing
    exploiting satellite data. The present work performs a systematic review related
    to the three aforementioned main technologies with reference to their application
    in agriculture. The main research questions (RQs) that the authors wish to answer
    in this work are the following: RQ1 What are the challenges of the three technologies
    that this work deals with? RQ2 How can these three technologies be used in a complementary
    way so as to facilitate the transition to Agriculture 4.0? The rest of the paper
    is structured as follows. An overview of the three aforementioned categories of
    sensing technologies is presented in Section 2. The methodology followed for the
    systematic review is showcased in Section 3. The outcome of the literature review
    performed is elaborated in Section 4 detailing the challenges and synergies found
    for the three technologies under investigation. Section 5 presents a discussion
    providing the paper’s view on the research questions formulated. Finally, Section
    6 presents conclusions and identifies potential future research directions. 2.
    Overview of Sensing Technologies 2.1. Ground-Based Sensing Ground or proximal
    sensors play a key role in Precision Agriculture (PA). Proximal sensing is defined
    as the use of field sensors to obtain signals from the analyzed feature (e.g.,
    climate, soil, or plant) when the sensor is in contact with or close to it (within
    a few meters) ([17,18]). Nowadays, there are many types of proximal sensors capable
    of monitoring multiple parameters related mainly to the plant water, nutritional,
    and health status [19]. Another classification includes the division into static
    proximal sensors, which remain stationary in the field, or mobile proximal sensors,
    mounted on vehicles or robots [20]. It is well known that climate is one of the
    main aspects determining plant growth and outputs [21]. This occurs because each
    plant is sensitive to certain growing conditions such as air temperature, relative
    humidity, wind, soil temperature, and light. Thus, it is crucial for farmers to
    understand the climatic conditions on their farms [22]. Hence, meteorological
    information may help the farmer make the most efficient use of natural resources
    to improve agricultural production. Among the most common proximal sensors are
    those that can assess climatic parameters. Usually, such sensors are mounted in
    small weather stations in the field, and a basic weather station usually consists
    of a temperature and humidity sensor, a wind speed sensor, a sensor that measures
    precipitation height, and one that can assess solar radiation information. Another
    category of ground-based sensors is soil-based sensors. New-generation proximal
    soil-based sensors are able to monitor real-time physical and chemical soil parameters,
    such as moisture, temperature, pH, soil nutrients, and pollutants, providing key
    information to optimize crop cycle management, combat biotic and abiotic stresses,
    and improve crop yields. One of the most common uses of such sensing is for irrigation
    management, through the capability of estimating the crop reference evapotranspiration
    (ETO), returning to the plant the full or partial (depending on the farm irrigation
    strategy) amount of water lost by evapotranspiration, using the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith
    equation recommended by the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) [23]. Weather observations and forecasts, coupled with physical observations,
    can help predict the development of the main pests and can be used to schedule
    control actions to prevent pest development. Thanks to such information, it is
    possible to change plant microclimate and influence the habitability for pests,
    for example, through pruning operations to reduce internal canopy humidity and
    reduce the probability of infection by plant pathogens. Integrated pest management
    has been a response to reduce the environmental impact of chemical pesticides
    [24]. For irrigation scheduling nowadays, there is a tendency to focus on plant-based
    sensors. Common and reliable sensors capable of continuously estimating plant
    water status include leaf turgor sensors, devices capable of assessing leaf turgor
    pressure, a parameter directly related to plant water status; sapflow sensors,
    capable of providing indications of the plant transpiration flows; trunk dendrometers,
    capable of monitoring trunk fluctuations over time, dependent on the plant hydration
    status; and Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) fruit gauges [25].
    The latter are low-cost devices that can continuously and very accurately monitor
    fruit development over the day, providing information about plant water and nutritional
    status during the fruit growth stage ([26,27]). Although plant-based sensors for
    monitoring plant water status are among the most common, there are other devices
    that are very useful for crop management. Foliar wetness sensors are devices installed
    inside the canopy to assess its moisture status, preventing the rise of pathogens
    and diseases [28]. Optical sensors, working in the visible/near-infrared band,
    can be useful for estimating the nutritional and health status of the plant ([29,30]).
    On the other hand, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology sensors can
    be used to assess and measure canopy shape and volume [31]. Last-generation sensors
    allow continuous data acquisition, greatly increasing the degree of information
    without increasing the farm workload. Moreover, these sensors can be used to create
    IoT networks for various applications [32]. IoT focuses primarily on providing
    many small, interconnected devices, mainly using WSN technology, that can work
    together with a common purpose [33]. A WSN has as a main target of offering sensing
    and monitoring capabilities utilizing wireless technologies to connect to sensing
    devices. In WSNs, data collection and transfer occur in four stages: collecting
    the data, processing the data, packaging the data, and transferring the data [34].
    With the help of WSN technologies, farmers can analyze weather conditions, water
    use, energy use, soil conditions, and plant morpho-physiological parameters collected
    from their farm feeding decision-support systems (DSSs) [35]. WSN has to fulfill
    requirements such as long range, low energy, and adequate data rate. Several technologies,
    including Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) [36], Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)
    [37], SigFox [38], and Long-Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M) [39], are arising
    as candidates in the upcoming transition to 5G communications [40]. In the context
    of this paper, and from this point on, we use the term IoT to collectively describe
    the different technologies associated with ground-based proximal sensing. 2.2.
    Remote Sensing Techniques UAVs were used in agriculture in 1997 for the first
    time. This technology was first used in Japan and South Korea, where mountainous
    terrain and relatively small family-owned farms required lower-cost and higher-precision
    spraying. Historically, the use of aerial application of pesticides was prohibited
    by the European Union, inhibiting the growth of UAV application in agriculture.
    Later use of UAVs was centered mainly around aerial imagery. Nowadays, UAVs are
    applied in PA to collect images of high quality, mounting adequate sensors to
    this end. Sensor choice is carried out carefully according to a number of parameters
    such as resolution, optical quality, weight, captured images, and price. UAVs
    may carry multiple types of sensors: RGB (red–green–blue), NIR (near-infrared),
    IR (infrared), multispectral (MS), and hyperspectral (HS) cameras. RGB and NIR
    bands are useful for collecting information about vegetation stress and chlorophyll
    content [41]. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors can also be used in environmental sciences
    for terrestrial scanning, obtaining information on crop height or canopy size
    [42]. Each type of sensor can be utilized for monitoring diverse parameters in
    vegetation. RGB is low in cost and useful for UAV applications of precision farming,
    such as the creation of orthomosaics, as they can capture images with high resolution.
    In addition, they are useful in different conditions (sunny and cloudy weather).
    But they cannot analyze many vegetation indices due to their limited spectral
    range. MS and HS sensors, compared to RGB, collect data in different spectral
    channels and acquire images with high quality that are useful for studying a multitude
    of physical and biological characteristics of plantations [43]. Therefore, MS
    and HS sensors are the most popular in PA, although they are expensive. Moreover,
    thermal sensors are used to collect temperature information. Their use proves
    to be optimal in irrigation-management applications [43]. The specific targeted
    application type is what dictates the adequate selection of sensors. For instance,
    MS sensors are suitable for the detection of diseases, offering many bands that
    can detect the sensitivity of symptoms. On the other hand, one RGB camera should
    be enough for data collection related to agricultural mapping. The most well-known
    applications of UAVs for PA, as found in the literature, include weed mapping
    and management [44], irrigation management [45], crop spraying [46], vegetation
    health monitoring and diseases detection [47], and vegetation growth monitoring
    and yield estimation [43]. UAVs acquire information that can be useful for the
    measurement of different parameters such as the crop height and the Leaf Area
    Index (LAI), allowing crop growth control in crops such as cotton, wheat, or sorghum.
    UAVs can be used to calculate the most common vegetative index to determine the
    diseased tissue, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which
    is useful for monitoring crop health and detecting diseases at an early stage,
    also mapping the size of the defect. In addition, a very important field of UAV
    application is water management, as precision irrigation techniques improve the
    efficiency of water use resources [43]. UAVs have rapidly evolved into a common
    tool to increase agricultural output and overall efficiency, decreasing expensive
    inputs of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. They can also indicate damages in
    crops that cannot be easily detected from the ground and be applicable in areas
    of big dimensions [48]. Finally, spaceborne remote sensing satellites equipped
    with digital RGB cameras and MS or HS sensors are nowadays among the most widely
    used technologies in monitoring field variability, which usually includes landscape
    monitoring, yield, field, soil and crop variability, or variability due to anomalous
    factors [49]. By measuring the reflectance of the light incident on soil and crops,
    they are used to assess their characteristics and behavior by acquiring information
    at different spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolutions. Similarly
    to UAV-based remote sensing, information acquired from satellites is usually expressed
    by indices, among which the NDVI index is one of the most widely used. Each index
    is calculated from values at visible and non-visible wavelengths: red, green,
    blue, near-infrared, red edge, and infrared bands are the most frequently used
    ([12,50]). Every satellite and sensor is characterized by different spatial and
    temporal resolutions. Temporal resolution is associated with the satellite itself
    and can be considered as the time the satellite takes to complete an orbit and
    revisit the same observation area. Sensors, instead, can have high spatial resolution
    and tend to have small footprints, or they have low spatial resolution and tend
    to have larger footprints. As Vanguard 2 and TIROS 1 were launched in 1959 and
    1960, respectively, and are used for assessing meteorological information, the
    history of satellites for agricultural use starts in 1972 with Landsat 1 (1972–1978),
    a satellite capturing multispectral data for earth-surface image acquisition.
    After that, a series of Landsat satellites (from 2 to 9) were launched. Used in
    many parts of the world, these satellites (Landsat-7, -8, and -9 are still active)
    provide high-quality images in order to classify land uses, monitor crop conditions,
    and estimate irrigation water requirements, resulting in more affordable imagery
    than the aerial photography once used to classify land use across large regions.
    Later, from the end of the 1990s to the 2010s, other satellites were launched,
    such as IKONOS (1999–2015), which provides 4 m spatial resolution images; Worldview-2
    (2009–present); and GeoEye-1 (2008–present), with a ≤2 m resolution; Sentinel-2A
    (2014–present) and -2B (2015–present), with a 10 to 60 m resolution; and other
    satellites constellations such as Pleiades-1A (2011–present) and -1B (2012–present),
    SkySat-1 (2013–present) and -2 (2014–present), or Superview-1 (2016–present),
    namely small satellites with compact, cheaper, and more replaceable sensors [51].
    The primary benefits of this type of technology use are widely documented in the
    literature and include reduced environmental impact, increased crop yield, enhanced
    product quality, and input savings ([52,53,54]). Despite the number and variety
    of satellite data being made available at various costs and for different purposes,
    there are certain challenges to using satellite imaging closely related to the
    purpose of the study. 3. Methodology The present review was conducted following
    the guidelines set by the Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) methodology [55]. The PRISMA statement consists
    of a checklist of 27 items recommended for reporting in systematic literature
    reviews. This checklist was designed to help reviewers report the purpose of the
    review, the methodology that was followed, and the outcomes of their research.
    This section provides answers to the PRISMA 2020 statement item checklist, giving
    a comprehensive illustration of the methodology followed in the present work.
    As the technology of sensors rapidly advances, a review of current literature
    in PA is needed to put into scope the available technologies, their competition,
    the cases that are most favorable for their application, and how to best utilize
    them in unison to maximize agricultural sustainability and profit for farmers.
    This review was conducted with the mindset of bringing to the fore the challenges
    of the three technologies that currently play a central role in the future of
    PA and sustainable development. To the knowledge of the authors, a systematic
    review with the scope of attempting to synthesize the literature for these three
    technologies has not been attempted before, testifying to the novelty of the current
    work. This study answers the two RQs that were mentioned in the introduction.
    According to the RQs, the following search query was formulated: TITLE-ABS-KEY
    (“Precision Agriculture” AND (((UAV OR Satellite) AND “Remote Sensing”) OR IoT))
    All results obtained from this query also had to fulfil the following criteria:
    Should be written in English, Should be published after 2017, Should be published
    in Q1 and Q2 journals. All studies that met the criteria proceeded to the first
    screening phase. During this phase, all six authors split the remaining papers
    between themselves and skimmed through the abstract and the main text for phrases
    mentioning challenges or synergies for the three technologies. At this phase,
    only phrases were sought. All works that survived this stage passed through a
    second screening phase, during which remaining works were split between two reviewers
    and carefully read through. The reviewers had to ascertain to what degree each
    study analysed the challenge or the synergy it mentioned. If the analysis of the
    challenge or synergy was profound enough, the work was finally admitted for inclusion.
    The aforementioned query and exclusion criteria were applied in the Scopus database
    on 6 October 2022. The explanation for the choice of this query was that the application
    of these three technologies in PA was sought for sensing purposes; therefore,
    “remote sensing” was added with an AND for UAVs and satellites to exclude other
    uses, e.g., spraying. Furthermore, the term “IoT” was regarded as more appropriate
    when paired with “Precision Agriculture” to provide a representative set of relevant
    works, and was preferred over terms such as “Wireless Sensor Networks” or “Ground
    Sensors”. The aforementioned query produced a result of 435 articles. Out of these,
    383 were articles published in Q1 and Q2 journals. These 383 articles were divided
    equally among the six authors for the first screening phase. Articles that had
    no mention of challenges, or synergy of technologies, were eliminated. The first
    screening phase eliminated a further 172 works. Therefore, 211 works made it to
    the second screening phase, during which 24 works were excluded, leading to a
    total of 187 articles. Looking through these 187 records, it was evident that
    synergies were underrepresented, as only 6 works mentioned a substantial synergy.
    Citation searching had to be performed to ensure that the contemporary literature
    on synergies was adequately represented. Citation searching added a further 18
    records, for a total of 205 records to be admitted for inclusion in the final
    review. Figure 1 presents a flowchart giving an overview of the screening phases
    and the steps followed for the systematic literature review. Figure 1. Systematic
    Literature Review Flowchart. During the second screening phase, all challenges
    found by the authors were added to a spreadsheet. Subsequently, these challenges
    were grouped together. These groups can be found in Table 1 and Table 2 for UAVs,
    Table 3 and Table 4 for satellites, and Table 5 and Table 6 for IoT. Papers that
    mentioned synergies where sparse among the body of results. These works are described
    in their own Section 4.4. Table 1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Technological
    Challenges for Applications in Agriculture. Table 2. UAV Peripheral Challenges
    for Applications in Agriculture. Table 3. Satellite Technological Challenges for
    Applications in Agriculture. Table 4. Satellite Peripheral Challenges for Applications
    in Agriculture. Table 5. Internet of Things (IoT) Technological Challenges for
    Applications in Agriculture. Table 6. IoT Peripheral Challenges for Applications
    in Agriculture. In order to give a sufficient definition of what a challenge is
    and what a synergy is, we refer to the following. A challenge is any type of impedance
    or problem that challenges the use of a particular technology in PA. For example,
    for UAVs, a challenge could be their short flight times, for satellites their
    lower resolution, and for ground sensors their inflexibility. Synergy is an idea
    that fuses together traits from two or more technologies to produce an effect
    that improves the use of both and augments each technology’s value overall. The
    high-resolution images acquired by UAV, combined with the wide coverage and high
    spectral resolution of satellite images, constitutes a good example of a synergy.
    Both challenges and synergies were sought in all examined papers, with the prerequisite
    that they were sufficiently analyzed in the review text. Therefore, it was much
    more probable to encounter UAV challenges in a UAV-centric paper than in an IoT-centric
    or a satellite-centric paper. To reduce bias, the two first authors double-checked
    the findings of each of the six authors during the second phase of deciding paper
    eligibility. Any paper that mentioned a well-analysed and evidence-supported phrase
    that met the challenge or synergy criteria was eligible for synthesis. During
    the second screening, a further 24 papers were excluded. After this step, the
    number of records was reduced to 187. Out of those papers, six of them discussed
    a synergy of the technologies. Citation searching was performed to identify more
    records mentioning synergies, which added another 18 records, for a total of 205.
    Synthesis of the results required that the phrases extracted from each paper described,
    in their core, the same basic challenge in order to be grouped with similar phrases
    from other papers. For example, papers mentioning UAV instability when carrying
    heavy equipment and UAV reduction in flight time due to heavy payloads were all
    grouped under the payload-limitation challenge because they describe the wider
    challenge that UAVs face when there is need to equip them with heavy payloads.
    As each challenge is further elaborated upon in the main text, the particular
    details of each phrase are not lost. The grouping helps to provide a summary of
    the challenge in a form that is quick and easy on the eye and captures how many
    works have mentioned it in the past. 4. Results This section presents the results
    for the synthesis of the challenges for each technology in three subsections and
    the results for synergies in the fourth subsection. 4.1. UAV Challenges This subsection
    provides the results of the categorization of challenges for UAV technology. Table
    2 presents the types of challenges for implementing UAV technology in agriculture
    that are peripherally related to the use of UAVs. The categories that were observed
    in this case were economic, social, and governmental challenges, as well as one
    miscellaneous challenge. Table 1 presents the type of challenges for implementing
    UAV technology in agriculture that are native to the UAV technology, and hence,
    occur according to the UAV system itself. The categories that were observed in
    this case were challenges concerning the sensors, the system security, the data
    processing, and the system hardware. Moreover, future research challenges for
    implementing UAV technology in agriculture are also investigated and included.
    Figure 2 presents these groups of challenges found in the literature that was
    examined. Figure 2. UAV Challenges Mentioned in the Literature. Most commercially
    available UAVs come out of the box with cheap RGB sensors that lack the precision
    and spectral range for PA applications (for example, for calculating NVDI) [58].
    It is necessary to equip UAVs with MS sensors, increasing the overall cost, and
    even then, cheaper MS sensors face saturation issues [59], especially since there
    are no standardized methods for their calibration [72]. The calibration of UAV
    sensors presents a challenge because camera position on a UAV might be slightly
    different for each flight [59], and differences in the orientation of the sensor
    result in different calibrations each time. This is especially true with HS sensors,
    as the slightest tilt has a negative impact in the sensor calibration [80]. With
    reference to HS sensors, although they have become more lightweight and cheaper,
    they are still a relatively expensive investment, and the processing of their
    output data remains extremely complex. Therefore, UAVs present a less cost-effective
    option for high spectral resolution when compared to satellites [129]. According
    to [71], another challenge for UAVs is their dependence on payload. Equipping
    the UAV with multiple sensors is not recommended, as it reduces flight time and
    affects its balance mid-flight ([81,86]). Therefore, careful choice must be made
    about which sensors to use and equip the platform with during each flight, resulting
    in the need for multiple flights when measurements from multiple sensors are required.
    All data generated as an outcome of the UAV trips need to be processed to be useful.
    Some issues arise during this stage. As sensors become better and spatial resolution
    increases, the volume of acquired data increases, and UAV use in PA is faced with
    extreme data bloat ([81,110,111]). Moreover, as mentioned earlier, data acquisition
    is not standardized, adding to the already considerable computing complexity of
    UAV images ([57,86]). On top of that, the UAV itself can do little to share the
    burden of data processing as its computing capabilities are very limited ([81,111]).
    When these ultra-high resolution data are used for machine learning (ML) training,
    it can take quite a while to complete ([72,106]), even though the final results
    are more trustworthy and useful than training the ML algorithms with satellite
    acquired images. Higher resolution is not always a panacea when it is employed
    for disease classification. The currently developed plant disease classification
    methods have maximum resolution thresholds, which, when surpassed, result in their
    algorithm underperforming. Nevertheless, the highest resolutions can be capitalized
    on in object recognition algorithms that perform disease analysis at the individual
    plant level [117]. Another issue is that if these data are to be given to some
    company or organization for processing, issues of data governance arise, as well
    as security of sensitive data ([64,72,82]). Furthermore, as the usage of UAVs
    in agriculture is still in an early stage [123], more research is needed to identify
    the costs and benefits of the implementation of this technology. For example,
    [125] recommended the actualization of more studies concerning the validation
    of low-cost sensors’ results in different conditions. Moreover, according to [71,82],
    there is a need for the development of fully autonomous UAVs. Ref. [79] also discussed
    the implementation of multiple coordinated UAVs in an individual field. Finally,
    the path optimization of UAVs, in order to monitor a whole field with adequate
    accuracy, is mentioned in [71,75]. UAVs’ application challenges exceed the purely
    technical aspects. Using a UAV for PA requires a large upfront investment from
    farmers ([118,127]), and even then, continuous use can be expensive as well [86].
    This high initial cost is a considerable risk, as remote sensing is not a standardized
    procedure for every type of crop and in every environment, and its performance
    can wildly vary depending on these parameters [86]. The need for skills and a
    proper way of handling UAVs ([58,66,132]) are further impeding factors. Knowledge
    of repair and maintenance is also a requirement [64]. Moreover, most governments
    require special licences for UAV use, and they limit certain aspects of flying,
    such as flying height ([71,93]), and flying over inhabited areas and beyond visual
    lines [88]. 4.2. Satellite Challenges The present subsection provides the results
    of the categorization of challenges for satellites. Table 4 presents the type
    of challenges for using satellites in agriculture, which are not oriented to the
    technology itself. The categories that were observed in this case were economic
    and social. Table 3 presents the challenges native to satellite technology. Of
    this type of challenges, the main categories that were identified were related
    to sensors, security, data processing, and the platform. In addition, some future
    research challenges are also mentioned and analyzed. Figure 3 presents these groups
    of challenges found in the literature that was examined. Figure 3. Satellite Challenges
    Mentioned in the Literature. An important drawback of satellite imagery is its
    lower spatial resolution compared to airborne images ([101,135]). Satellite images
    of medium or low spatial resolution are freely available but do not provide adequate
    data for a handful of different PA uses, such as disease monitoring, soil spectral
    measurement, wild weed identification, or applications that require individual
    plant identification through ML ([136,137,138]). Very-high-resolution (VHR) images
    from satellites are also available but incur a significant cost. Even then, VHR
    satellites have trouble in applications that require object identification in
    agricultural environments, as they provide less information than their airborne
    counterparts. Due to this lower spatial resolution, satellites are not optimal
    for heterogeneous environments, for example, for the size and distribution of
    most of the European olive grove systems or vineyards ([142,159]). Similarly to
    UAVs, satellites generate big data images. Their processing is a time-consuming
    and computationally intensive endeavour [144]. Processing these data under time
    constraints may affect the quality of the final result [148]. Storing and managing
    the sheer volumes of imagery is a considerable challenge on its own. Furthermore,
    satellite data, because of their low spatial and temporal resolution, are not
    great candidates for AI calibration purposes or training of ML algorithms [149].
    As with all big data applications, satellite imagery can also be leaked or be
    used by third parties for unknown purposes, so care must be taken ([72,142]).
    Another drawback of satellites is their susceptibility to cloudy weather. Depending
    on cloud coverage, a satellite may not be able to acquire images at all [151].
    The consensus in the literature is that cloud coverage reduces satellite temporal
    resolution ([83,149]). Disease monitoring in particular is highly dependent on
    high temporal resolution; thus, satellite use for this particular application
    is inappropriate [158]. Satellites as a platform have inherently low temporal
    resolution, as they cannot be used for imaging at will but rather at their particular
    revisit time, but if at that moment the cloud coverage is dense, the chance for
    image acquisition may be lost. While satellites bearing active sensors are a solution
    to cloud coverage, their spatial resolution is even lower, and hence they do not
    solve the disease-monitoring conundrum ([57,64]). The low temporal resolution
    of satellites is a problem not only for disease monitoring but for monitoring
    in general. Satellites are inflexible platforms without the ability to interchange
    sensors at will, and waiting for a satellite with a suitable sensor for the required
    measurement is another cause of low temporal resolution. When the highest spatial
    resolution is needed from VHR satellites, they may not be there to provide it
    ([64,83]), but a very small number of satellites are equipped with both MS and
    HS sensors [129]. With reference to future research challenges, there is a need
    to sufficiently integrate and connect satellites with different technologies and
    devices, as well as enhance their level of cooperation between one another [142].
    According to [121], there is also the need to perform more research for satellites
    on transforming image classification maps into application maps. Additionally,
    as the complexity of the usage of a satellite platform is a factor that hinders
    its adoption, the overall technology needs to become more approachable for farmers
    and be used as a DSS [155]. Concerning the satellite technology’s peripheral challenges
    for applications in agriculture, the cost of acquiring useful information from
    satellite imagery incorporates the costs of taking the images and processing them.
    Specialized companies gather the imagery from specific satellites and process
    them themselves before finally delivering the final product to the customer. Satellite
    data for PA have been in use for many years, more than UAVs, and the whole process
    is more streamlined. Still, the cost of the man-hours involved is high, particularly
    when data processing must be undertaken quickly [57]. All in all, access to everyone
    is still hindered due to the scientific and technological knowledge required to
    deploy an effective method that brings true and valuable results to farmers [131].
    4.3. IoT Challenges The present subsection provides the outcomes of the categorization
    of challenges for IoT technology. Table 6 presents the type of challenges for
    implementing IoT in agriculture that are not native to the technology itself.
    The categories that were identified from this case were mainly economic, social,
    and governmental. Table 5 presents the IoT-technology-oriented challenges. From
    this group of challenges, the main categories that were observed were related
    to sensors, security, networking, data processing, and future research challenges.
    Figure 4 presents these groups of challenges found in the literature that was
    examined. Figure 4. IoT Challenges Mentioned in the Literature. Each sensor in
    an IoT context comprises four parts: a sensing part, a computing part, a transmitting
    part, and a battery. The batteries are usually not rechargeable or changeable.
    Therefore, there is a pressing need for saving energy ([166,167,169,170]). Most
    of its energy is spent in transmitting sensed data back to the main station. Energy
    saving can be achieved by using operations with a low duty cycle, minimizing delays,
    or optimizing routing. Another challenge for IoT is the lack of reliable measurements
    for low-cost ground sensors [175]. For example, the measurement of soil moisture
    with ground sensors is challenging because the capacitive soil moisture sensors
    operate at low frequencies and are sensitive to the soil texture and salinity
    level [193]. The placement of sensors is another important challenge of incorporating
    IoT. Sensors have to be placed strategically to ensure maximum coverage and well-established
    communication between them ([91,175,192]). The difficulty of this task is proportional
    to the size of the field. As size increases, the placement of sensors becomes
    more difficult, and the cost of implementing a critical mass of sensors increases
    as well. This is known as the scalability problem ([168,172]). Harsh environmental
    conditions is another factor impeding ground sensors ([166,184]). Meteorological
    variables such as snow, fog, and solar radiance have an impact on both the sensor
    network and the planting [185]. The electrodes of low-cost sensors suffer deterioration
    quite quickly, and it is important to somehow ensure protection from adverse conditions
    [175]. Underground sensors constitute a solution to this problem, as meteorological
    phenomena do not affect them, and they do not impact the above-ground activities
    of machinery or animals, but at the cost of limited range due to interference
    by soil elements [191]. Another challenge for IoT is the need for sensor specialization,
    for each crop or disease in need of monitoring. They should be tailored to the
    needs of wildly different sectors in agriculture such as fruits, arable crops,
    or trees ([188,189,190]). Furthermore, all these sensors create electronic waste
    when they finally expire, and some of them contain harmful chemicals that are
    toxic to soils, crops, and stored grains [167]. Moving on, the architecture of
    the network is an important aspect of designing an IoT solution. Integrating data
    sources and distributed sensors is complicated [204]. IoT system design in PA
    is based on heterogeneous network topologies that lead to complex communications.
    IoT devices have to communicate and interact seamlessly through different platforms
    and infrastructures [168]. This is worsened by non-standardized data-communication
    protocols [166] and different IoT node synchronization [177], as communication
    protocols differ from crop to crop [175]. Another important aspect is the network
    layer itself. WiFi communications are not ideal for agricultural applications,
    which usually face extreme weather conditions and have insufficient power structure,
    particularly when devices are spread far over a field, and they work on non-rechargeable
    battery power [167]. On the other hand, cellular communication suffers in agriculture,
    as the operational area is far away from antennae of cellular networks, and thus
    the connectivity of 3G/4G is very low. Moreover, 4G cannot support ultra-low latency
    with high connectivity because it allows IP-based packet switching connectivity
    [171]. LoRaWAN has arisen as a replacement for WiFi/cellular networks in agricultural
    IoT. While it has low bandwidth, it boasts very low energy consumption and high
    connectivity across vast distances [175]. Its drawbacks are that its radio-based
    signals are affected by vegetation foliage ([175,185,186]). Another defect is
    its high latency [166], but this is not always a problem in agricultural application,
    except if a real-time approach is taken to field monitoring. From the point of
    view of the data processing challenge, reference is made to data bloat in [189].
    Existing cloud-base storage does not provide useful solutions to the problem of
    manipulating the different data patterns produced by the IoT [168]. The analysis
    of these data is another challenge. According to [188], it has to be simplified
    so that it can be easily understood by most farmers. Moreover, computational efficiency
    needs to increase on the agricultural domain, and it remains a challenge to come
    up with efficient alternatives to provide sufficient resources to IoT in rural
    environments [206]. IoT networks that use WiFi—or cellular—for their network infrastructure
    are more vulnerable to hacking attacks ([192,197]). A malicious party can infiltrate
    the network and cause a wide number of issues to the IoT network. Attacks can
    target various aspects such as the network itself, its nodes, the data it transmits,
    and the code by which nodes operate. The purpose of these attacks could be brute
    attempts to disrupt the network and cease its operation, or more subtle malicious
    attacks, such as data theft and faulty operation of sensors that lead to miscalculations
    and false measurements ([199,200,203]). Authentication, encryption, and securely
    generated passwords are required to prevent security compromise [168]. LoRaWAN,
    as it does not use the Internet and has already authentication and encryption
    systems built-in, has a higher degree of security. Furthermore, the data governance
    of IoT is another issue. Whoever processes the data extracted by the IoT has full
    access to sensitive information, and care must be taken about whom farmers entrust
    these data to [200]. Future research on agricultural IoT systems may focus on
    many different aspects. An important one is power management. Batteries of sensors
    that are self-rechargeable through solar power or other means would greatly enhance
    the capabilities of agricultural IoT ([166,190,201]). Research on an IoT capability
    to monitor crops in real time is another important characteristic of sensor networks
    that is constrained by the limited power resources [204]. Ground robots bearing
    moving sensors need improvement in guidance systems to achieve smooth navigation
    through a farming environment [212]. The technology’s approachability for farmers
    is another issue in need of improvement. The ergonomic design of sensors, so that
    they can be better integrated into the farming environment, and the facilitation
    of IoT device implementation in a “plug-and-play” manner are desirable improvements.
    Finally, there are numerous voices claiming that the 5G network could revolutionize
    the agricultural sector, but concerns have been raised regarding the absolute
    validity of those claims. To start with, there will be high infrastructure costs,
    because additional stations are needed due to 5G’s shorter range. The end users’
    device cost would be higher, as would service tariffs [171]. Moreover, there are
    doubts that 5G is an environmentally friendly technology, as widespread deployment
    would translate to higher use of computing devices and an increase in energy demand
    to power the computing devices, which would exacerbate climate change. It is also
    worth noting that certain reports have raised concerns about 5G’s high radiation
    [167]. When it comes to IoT peripheral challenges, the most commonly mentioned
    among the papers analysed was the high costs of implementation. According to [64],
    the measurement of ground-based parameters can be costly and time-consuming, as
    well as requiring large amounts of human resources. Furthermore, Ref. [166] described
    the business issue of implementing an IoT-based system with three categories,
    the setup cost, the running cost, and the upgrading cost. All of these categories
    can incur high costs for farmers, making the adoption of IoT in agriculture a
    dilemma. Besides economic challenges, there is also a lack of theoretical and
    practical knowledge about such systems [166], and there is always a problem with
    the farmers’ lack of awareness for implementing new technologies in their farms
    [192], or even hesitance of the farmers to use them [165]. Finally, as these technologies
    are still at the infant stage of development, there is also a lack of policies
    and regulations [218], as well as ownership and processing issues related to the
    generated data [166]. 4.4. Synergies Mentioned in the Literature Works that present
    substantial synergies between technologies are sparse. This subsection summarises
    the review findings. While data fusion between different sensors for agriculture
    has been explored in previous works [225,226], the particularities of fusing or
    combining sensory output originating from two or more sources as diverse as IoT,
    UAV, and satellites has not been touched upon adequately for agricultural purposes.
    Alvarez-Vanhard et al., 2021 [225] gives a thorough review of the literature from
    2021 and before, which mentions the synergical use of satellites and UAVs for
    agriculture, but it does not mention combinations of IoT and any of the two aforementioned
    technologies. The current work attempts to take the reasoning of [225] one step
    further by focusing on the particularities of each paper reviewed and dissecting
    the exact reasons that make the use of a synergy desirable. These reasons can
    be traced back to the challenges mentioned in Section 4.1–Section 4.3, as the
    complementary use of two or more technologies attempts to mitigate the limitations
    and challenges each technology faces on its own. Table 7 and Table 8 present the
    logic permeating each type of synergy encountered during the literature review
    by contrasting its complementary technological traits. Table 9, Table 10 and Table
    11, describe the use cases of synergies performed in relevant works and characterize
    them according to the particular synergy types as defined in Table 7 and Table
    8. Table 7. UAV and Satellite Synergy Types. Table 8. UAV/Satellite and IoT Synergy
    Types. Table 9. Synergies Part 1. Table 10. Synergies Part 2. Table 11. Synergies
    Part 3. Among UAV-Satellite papers, Type 3 and Type 5 synergies are the most common.
    Interestingly, only two papers have utilized the flexibility of the UAV, and only
    two papers have utilized its enhanced capacity to create 3D point clouds, while
    no work combining UAV and satellite requires the historical records of past satellite
    overpasses. Among IoT-UAV/Satellite works, Type 8 was the most common, utilizing
    the proximity of IoT measurements to clear up uncertainties in UAV/satellite remote
    sensing. Type 10 and Type 12 are the next most commonly mentioned synergies. Most
    Type 10 synergies utilise meteorological data in ML models to complement remote
    sensing predictions, while Type 12’s use of historical satellite data was quite
    common in contrast with UAV–Satellite papers. Type 9 and Type 11 are only encountered
    once, since real-time ground sensor monitoring is still in its infancy as a practice,
    and attempts to perform orthorectification through ground measurements are also
    scarce. Synergy Type 7 constitutes an exception, as it is commonly encountered
    across a very large number of scientific papers, which were not reviewed, as they
    were considered outside the scope of the current work. While synergical use can
    mitigate certain liabilities and provide solutions, there are some challenges
    that are shared by two of the technologies examined or even by all three. Therefore,
    such challenges continue to exist when a synergy is attempted. Data privacy is
    a prominent concern for all three technologies, which cannot be mitigated by combining
    them. Another shared challenge is the large data volumes, which become more cumbersome
    when we have data fused from different sources. This is coupled with the increase
    in processing time and costs. In fact, the fusion of data of different types (sensor
    data and images of different resolutions) creates further challenges to the goal
    of having them efficiently integrated. A further challenge of the complementary
    use of the aformentioned technologies is that farmers need to become acquainted
    with not just one but all the technologies that are being combined. Moreover,
    it should be mentioned that the lack of current research regarding actual synergies
    between the three technologies is both an important impeding factor towards a
    holistic paradigm involving all three and a challenge for future research and
    pilot projects. In fact, in our literature review, out of the 205 reviewed works,
    only 24 papers provided synergy use cases. Finally, the lack of standardization
    poses further challenges with reference to their complementary use. In fact, all
    use cases found by the authors miss any particular standardization procedure,
    which could be beneficial for the future of synergical use between technologies.
    5. Discussion The value of satellite imagery in PA greatly depends on the application
    it is required for, as well as the particularities of the crops and the field.
    Even VHR satellites such as World View-3 are not suitable for individual plant
    analysis. While they provide a 30 cm per pixel spatial resolution on RGB imagery,
    on MS imagery, their spatial resolution is about 1.24 m per pixel. Thus, while
    their RGB imagery resolution is good enough for distinguishing canopies, the same
    satellite MS spatial resolution is not enough to provide adequate data for further
    analysis of these canopies. Evidently, satellite use is limited in heterogeneous
    farms, meaning farms that provide imagery that combines many different textures,
    such as soil, plants, wild weeds, or farming structures. In contrast, satellites
    are more useful for crops that cover an area homogeneously, such as cereal crops.
    But even in these types of plantations, applications such as wild-weed identification
    and soil spectral analysis benefit the most from the highest possible spatial
    resolution. Therefore, UAVs have an edge in applications of this type or heterogeneous
    farms. Very-high-definition images from UAVs, on the other hand, may introduce
    data redundancy, which lowers the performance of the algorithms used to process
    the images [117]. Upscaling may be necessary to a resolution scale, which ensures
    optimal performance of the algorithm used, which is another impediment to the
    UAV standardization of procedures regarding PA. It is therefore necessary to know
    the optimal resolution scale for each use case, as different combinations of algorithms
    and crops require different optimal resolutions. An added benefit is that lower
    resolution requirements allow the UAVs to fly to a higher altitude, thus also
    reducing battery expenditure and the time needed for the image-gathering excursion
    [116]. It is less probable to obtain usable imagery during rainy weather with
    a satellite than it is with a UAV system ([57,74]), as cloud coverage greatly
    affects satellite image quality. It might even render satellite images unusable
    if the coverage is too dense. Diseases can evolve rapidly, requiring precise and
    strict monitoring to ensure results, and skipping a measurement because of cloud
    coverage might throw off the project completely. On the opposite end, UAVs, being
    able to fly at will and being unaffected by cloud coverage, have a much higher
    capability for frequent imaging. A satellite’s lower resolution does come with
    certain benefits. Wide coverage is a satellite’s inherent advantage, and, as there
    is no piloting involved, the homogeneity of data is guaranteed. In contrast, UAVs
    have to be piloted carefully, they have to be stable enough to follow their required
    trajectory, and they have to maintain the same height over crops. Covering the
    same area as a satellite requires more images, more time, an expert pilot, and
    more processing of the images to create the final mosaics. It is therefore evident
    that UAVs are optimal for small to medium farms, where they are not required to
    cover vast areas for image acquisition. Large farms are better served by satellite
    imagery, supposing that they are not very heterogeneous. UAVs, being highly modular
    platforms that come in all shapes and sizes while also being able to carry many
    different sensors, have abundant flexibility but at the cost of standardization.
    Sensor calibration is a process that is dependent on the equipment; therefore,
    each combination of UAV model and sensor requires its own calibration procedure.
    In contrast, satellites do not face such issues, as their calibration is a standardized
    procedure that has been taken care of by the platform operators. Therefore, the
    risk of obtaining unusable data due to calibration faults is higher in UAVs. Moreover,
    due to this lack of standardization, UAV images have a slightly higher processing
    complexity than satellite imagery. Still, by having a much higher temporal resolution
    and by being devices that can become part of a wider IoT network, UAVs can provide
    their data faster for processing and can even utilize edge computing if there
    is available on-field infrastructure. Nevertheless, UAVs require a large upfront
    investment, that includes the cost of buying the vehicle, as well as the cost
    of buying its sensory equipment. Following this considerable investment, the cost
    of using and maintaining the platform includes recharging costs, the cost of man
    hours for processing the images, the cost of man hours for piloting the platform,
    and any costs for repairs and spare parts. Satellites, on the other hand, do not
    require the large upfront investment, but high spatial resolution satellite images
    can only be acquired by paying a hefty price. A further cost is added due to the
    man hours and skills required to process the satellite data. Adding to the challenge
    of buying and setting up a UAV platform for remote sensing are the bureaucratic
    difficulties of acquiring a licence to fly it. In contrast, satellite data require
    almost no bureaucratic hurdle for their acquisition. The third PA technology analysed
    in this review is IoT. This may incorporate any type of sensor, from soil sensors
    that measure soil parameters, such as moisture, temperature, and the concentration
    of elements such as carbon and nitrogen, to sensors that measure water levels
    in crops for irrigation purposes, to MS sensors that measure vegetation indices.
    An IoT device can have any combination of sensors and can be adapted to the particularities
    of the farm under examination. IoT tends to be more expensive than UAVs or satellite
    data, but provides the most noise-free data out of the three technologies. Moreover,
    their capacity to capitalize on edge-computing puts them at the forefront of scientific
    research, as this allows real-time monitoring, which is an important future prospect
    for PA. Out of the three technologies analyzed, IoT is the only technology that
    has the capacity for continuous monitoring. Measurements from ground sensors are
    used as training and evaluation sets for ML algorithms for application in remote
    sensing, because their data are the most trustworthy source of measurement regarding
    soil moisture, concentrations of various elements in the soil, water plant status,
    and similar quantities that can be measured through physical contact or proximal
    sensing. The calculation of vegetation indices through ground remote sensors,
    on the other hand, is a more challenging endeavor. Ground remote sensing requires
    many sensors to be placed strategically across the field for maximum coverage,
    and even then, only homogeneous crop types can be measured safely. Image recognition
    of canopies or rows of vines in heterogeneous environments is very difficult or
    even impossible to achieve when using ground remote sensors because of the angle
    the images are taken from. IoT systems are susceptible to attacks by malicious
    third parties, as they always require a network infrastructure to operate. On
    the other hand, UAVs usually operate without becoming a part of a network. Thus,
    they are less susceptible to hacking. Satellites, as they are not operated by
    the farmer, cannot become victims of hacking attacks. Nevertheless, satellite
    data from a farmer’s field can still be used for nefarious purposes, similar to
    data extracted from IoT and UAVs. Satellites and UAVs are reusable assets, in
    contrast to cheap ground sensors. The environmental waste from an IoT system can
    be an important cause for concern. In particular, as the dimensions of the under-measurement
    field become larger, so does the number of sensors required to cover it. It can
    be safely assumed that, cost-wise and environmentally, IoT for large fields is
    not an optimal choice. Complementary use relies on capitalizing on the strengths
    of one technology while complementing its weaknesses with another technology.
    UAVs can be used to enhance the spatial resolution of satellite MS data on certain
    parts of a field in order to examine that part more carefully. UAVs are also sources
    of excellent training data for ML algorithms that will then be applied to satellite
    imagery. Similarly, IoT systems are great producers of training data, especially
    for the purposes of irrigation and the measurement of soil parameters. LiDAR and
    thermal sensors on the ground can be used to enhance remotely sensed imagery.
    UAVs and IoT can therefore provide precision when satellite information is not
    precise enough for the needed application. IoT and UAVs can act in synergy in
    a multitude of ways. The UAV can provide its remotely sensed data to complement
    data gathered by the ground nodes. A UAV can itself become another node in an
    IoT system so that its information can be processed in tandem with the information
    of the other nodes. UAVs can even help mitigate power expenditure in an IoT system,
    which is an important limitation, by serving as a carrier of data from sensors
    to the main station. 6. Conclusions This systematic review summarized the limitations
    of ground-based, space-borne, and airborne technologies for PA, as they are presented
    in recent literature. It also pinpointed and summarized works that provide useful
    synergies between these technologies. These studies, when paralleled with the
    limitations of each technology, enable certain conclusions to be drawn, which
    can be summed up in the following points: Satellite is the broadest of the three
    technologies, providing ample farm coverage and good image detail. Cost-wise,
    it is the least risky source of PA data out of the three technologies, but it
    is also the slowest to provide usable results. UAVs have great flexibility and
    the capability to provide very specific information, but they are costly when
    applied to large farms, while also requiring a risky upfront investment from farmers.
    Their ability to analyze crops in very fine detail allows them to deal with specialized
    problems such as diseases or wild weeds. Still, using them is far from a standardized
    procedure, and more research is needed to establish the UAVs as a definitive solution.
    IoT provides the most specific information, as it can be tailored to the particular
    crop and farm. Moreover, it takes the smallest amount of time for data processing
    and has the unique potential of constant field monitoring. Its high specialization
    comes at the cost of reduced flexibility and area coverage. The review process
    included reviewing 24 use cases of synergies in the domain of agriculture between
    the technologies in question. Open challenges setting the ground for future research
    include data privacy issues, large data volumes, data fusion, farmers’ acquaintance
    with the technology, and lack of standardization. Taking steps toward addressing
    such challenges could facilitate further synergies and help the agricultural domain
    advance toward the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm. As things stand, complementary use
    of the three technologies requires further research. The number of works that
    make an effort to combine them is far too small when compared with the number
    of works that have come out in PA recently. The future of agriculture relies on
    optimally using all the technological tools currently at our disposal. Author

    has rapidly boosted image and text data. Using image and text matching algorithms,
    computers can match images and texts based on semantic content. Methods use visual
    and textual object co-occurrence data and coarse-level relationships [ 1]. However,
    the fine-level connection between modalities fails without intramodal semantic
    inference. Scene graphs can model intramodal semantic linkages and capture visual–textual
    interactions, essential for interpreting scenes in images and text. One of the
    techniques used in text mining is latent semantic analysis (LSA). The goal of
    latent semantic analysis is to build a set of ideas connected to a collection
    of documents and the terms those documents contain. These concepts can then be
    utilized to investigate the relationships between the documents and the terms
    [ 2]. A matrix with word counts for each document is constructed from a massive
    text (rows represent unique words, and columns represent each document), and a
    mathematical technique known as singular value decomposition is used to reduce
    the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among the columns.
    This is done to make the matrix more manageable. Divergent thinking response sets
    have always been challenging to analyze because of their inherent open-mindedness
    regarding the number of ideas that may be stated and the number of concepts and
    words used to express each notion. It is well known from cross-disciplinary studies
    that LSA-the number of words can skew-based approaches in response [ 3]. Many
    recent studies have sought, without success, to use LSA to measure the semantic
    distance of answers demonstrating similar levels of divergent thinking. The current
    research contributes to applying LSA to a recent interdisciplinary field smart
    farming. The researchers have provided the 10 promising research areas in the
    smart farming field that need more attention. Farming provides essential needs
    and nutrition to people, a crucial component of an economy. As a result of advancements
    in innovation and science, the agricultural segment underwent another revolution.
    Through the use of automation systems in different exercises, information technology
    has expanded the potential of the agricultural sector [ 4]. As agricultural technology
    develops and advances, advancements like precision farming, GPS, sensor systems,
    and robotics have emerged. Various techniques are used to create automated systems,
    including digital image processing, machine vision, and computer vision. For example,
    using distributed and parallel computing in farming science can reduce computational
    time, leading to faster plant recognition [ 5]. As our population grows exponentially,
    great importance is placed on energy, biological resources, arable land, and water
    to sustain our bodies and nourish us. Since the global population consumes more
    food than farmers can produce, global grain inventories are at their lowest point
    in 30 years. Seventy percent of India’s people rely on farming for their livelihood
    [ 6]. Various crops are grown for high yields and quality fruits and vegetables.
    To cultivate these crops, highly sophisticated techniques are required. Agriculturists
    and other farming specialists have been using computers more frequently recently,
    which will have long-term effects on agricultural software [ 7]. Generally used
    in agribusiness, image analysis is a powerful technique for nondestructive research
    of agricultural products [ 8]. Images have influenced the development of digital
    image-capturing hardware and software. Digital image analysis’s ability to perform
    objective, nondestructive examination is its most significant advantage. There
    are technologies like infrared, ultraviolet, and near-infrared (NIR) that can
    process clear images or dark images for humans (NIR). A digital image is a 2D
    portrayal of a constrained set of digital values. The suitability of “f” for any
    pair of spatial coordinates (x, y) is known as the gray or intensity level of
    a given image at that point [ 9]. Here, x and y are coordinates in space, and
    f (x, y) is the image’s function. In a digital image, the amplitude and coordinates
    are finite and discrete. To process a digital image, a digital computer is required.
    Digital image processing consists of a small set of interconnected parts. There
    is a specific function and value for each part. These components are called pixels,
    images, or picture elements [ 10]. Many different computer algorithms are used
    to process digital images. There are several uses for image processing, including
    enhancing the visual appeal of images and getting them ready for measurement.
    Using satellites, aircraft, and remote sensing to capture images, digital image
    processing techniques were used for farming [ 11]. Computers were used to process
    and analyze these pictures. Because of recent technological breakthroughs in picture
    capture and data processing, imaging approaches have been created to solve various
    issues in the farming industry. Thermal imaging, fluorescence imaging, hyperspectral
    imaging, and photometric (RGB) feature-based imaging are only a few imaging modalities
    that have made substantial contributions [ 12]. Instead of just integrating information
    technology into farming, smart farming emphasizes creating and applying knowledge.
    Information technology should allow agricultural machinery and devices to collect
    and analyze data before making judgments or preparing them semiautomatically [
    13]. It is founded on developing big data technologies, the Internet of Things
    (IoT), satellite observation [ 14], connected data, and artificial intelligence
    (AI) at every stage of the farming supply chain [ 15]. The market for smart farming
    is expected to be worth $23.1 billion globally (including precision farming).
    They employed the Internet to connect various networked devices, such as sensors,
    drivers, and smart objects, to mobile devices [ 16]. Furthermore, IoT services
    share data with intelligent control and decision-making systems due to the widespread
    use of cloud-based remote data collecting. Such talents could offer the smart
    farming sector efficient output. The traditional farming method involves improving
    modernized cultivation while investigating an IoT region of interest in the agricultural
    industry [ 17]. Over the past 10 years, IoT development has provided many benefits
    in every area. Incorporating scalable software, hardware, cost-effective processes,
    autonomous systems, and intelligent decisions are made possible by the IoT [ 18].
    In the agriculture and agribusiness industry, managing vast amounts of data are
    crucial for numerous jobs [ 19]. During harvest season, specialists in vegetable
    trimming, for example, should be faced with a plethora of vegetables. Moreover,
    professionals who employ the increasingly popular organic farming method throughout
    the growing season must manage enormous quantities of fertilizer. Several new
    trends have emerged in recent years, including sensors and the IoT, machine learning
    and AI, robotics and automation, precision agriculture, and sustainable practices.
    With the help of sensors and the IoT, it is possible to collect and analyze data
    about the development of crops, the quality of the soil, the temperature, and
    several other significant factors. With machine learning and AI, it is possible
    to predict food yields, weather patterns, and other variables that affect the
    production of agricultural products. Robots can also perform other labor-intensive
    duties, such as weeding and harvesting. Precision agriculture utilizes technology
    to optimize each plant and field individually instead of treating them all similarly.
    Smart farming research prioritizes sustainability because it can potentially reduce
    the negative environmental impacts of agriculture hence based on these principles,
    our paper contributes to finding the latest trends in smart farming and describing
    the research constituents in this field. The researchers have provided 10 clusters
    based on the high-loading terms fetched from the bag of words. Smart farming is
    an emerging field in the current scenario as it brings a revolution in agriculture,
    and this field needs more attention to increase its impact. This study reviewed
    3,229 published studies on smart farming through LSA, used for semiautomated document
    categorization. Through this experiment, the author predicted ten current research
    areas on which future researchers and practitioners can work to make more impact
    on smart farming. This study also helps researchers to see which areas need more
    attention and provides a road map for future smart farming. 2. Literature Review
    Agriculture 4.0, the fourth agricultural revolution, is paving the way for a more
    sustainable, efficient, and environmentally conscious agricultural system through
    digital technologies [ 20]. Farmers have enhanced their practices and reduced
    their environmental impact due to new agricultural technologies [ 21]. Smart farming
    techniques have advanced in the past decade thanks to smart farming techniques,
    large-scale farming in open areas, farming in controlled conditions, and the rearing
    of dairy animals and poultry [ 22]. “Smart farming” offers more advantages than
    traditional agriculture since it uses cutting-edge technology, improved infrastructure,
    and data collected at every farming process. Implementing sufficient monitoring
    can enhance the quality of the product [ 23]. As one example of how this information
    could be used, imagine being able to predict the arrival of a new pest or illness
    thanks to the information gathered. Preserved data can help bolster farm labor
    force numbers, streamline operations, and reduce pesticide and fertilizer overuse.
    Even the sharing of specialized knowledge among experts in other fields is possible
    with this cutting-edge farming technique. When putting the smart farming approach
    into practice, the phase in which data are collected is a very crucial component
    of the process. Access to relevant database information is helpful when making
    decisions, planning agricultural operations, and allocating tasks [ 24]. However,
    gathering all of the information offered or provided on farms and putting it together
    is a challenging task that requires expertise and prior experience. Those who
    live through farming will have a difficult time with this. There are various approaches
    one can take to obtain information from a farm. Technology-based monitoring and
    development is the primary source of most information required for efficient farming
    [ 25]. A proposed research initiative suggests the implementation of a Smart Farming
    Oriented Big Data Architecture (SFOBA) as a means to enhance decision-making in
    the agricultural sector [ 26]. This approach aims to tackle technical and socioeconomic
    limitations by leveraging big data technologies and IoT. One more research work
    proposes a comprehensive farm architecture combining big data technologies, IoT
    components, and knowledge-based systems [ 27]. It addresses challenges in the
    agriculture industry, focusing on handling small files without impacting computation
    performance. In the same context, another research proposes an AI-based SFOBA
    for smart farming, combining big data technologies, IoT components, and knowledge-based
    systems [ 28]. The architecture ensures system durability and data modeling, transforming
    business needs into analytics. Within farming, the soil is seen as of the utmost
    significance. According to the findings of a study on artificial soil aeration
    conducted in the year 2020, it was discovered that soil aeration improves hypoxic
    conditions and offers advantages to the bacterial populations in the soil and
    the root morphology [ 29]. In a recent study that was carried out in the same
    area, researchers compared the effects of a micro/nanobubble aeration system and
    a subsurface artificial air layer aeration system on plant growth, fruit yield,
    irrigation water-use efficiency, and fruit quality in response to different treatment
    conditions. The studies were carried out under various circumstances [ 30]. In
    one more study, the researchers studied the effect of irrigation strategies on
    fruit yields of greenhouse tomatoes [ 31]. Microsprinkler irrigation, drip irrigation
    under plastic film, and microsprinkler irrigation under plastic film were the
    three methods of irrigation that the researchers looked at to determine how each
    affected the nutritional content of the soil. To circumvent these limitations,
    this study plans to do an systematic literature review (SLR) on the IoT in agriculture
    by mining the Scopus database for relevant articles. The primary goal of this
    research is to develop and deploy a semiautomated literature review that more
    reliably captures recent developments in the field. We undertook a semiautomated,
    quantitative study on the Scopus data thanks to LSA [ 32], a branch of natural
    language processing (NLP) [ 33]. The KNIME tool, used to develop the author’s
    semiautomatic analysis method, is freely available to any researcher [ 34]. This
    study’s assessment of IoT in agriculture is helpful because it summarizes the
    most important aspects and emerging trends in the field. This strategy has been
    used in numerous contexts before to portray growing tendencies and critical nodes
    in numerous areas of study [ 35– 38]. Recent innovations in IoT in farming have
    not been thoroughly studied, but the researchers believe this is due to a lack
    of empirical study. The PRISMA criteria (2009) provide the minimum requirements
    for a systematic review or meta-analysis report. Reporting on the search for examinations,
    screening those studies, eligibility, and inclusion in the study pool is necessary
    for quantitative analysis [ 39, 40]. New standards established for 2020 stipulated
    that SLRs must include checklists, in-depth explanations, and flowcharts [ 41].
    This study adheres to the new PRISMA principles to collect and analyze qualitative
    literature on IoT farming (2020). There are several ways to conduct SLRs, and
    bibliometric analysis is one of the methods in this field. In the direction of
    SLRs, researchers have done a bibliometric analysis on smart farms for the last
    10 years of data starting from 2012 [ 42]. This analysis looks at 489 publications
    that were published between 2012 and 2021. According to the research findings,
    there is a growing body of literature on IoT and agriculture. The most notable
    authors, prolific journals, and productive institutions are all part of the bibliometric
    study that includes the most referenced works. There are three distinct categories
    for collaboration maps. The researchers in 2021 have already conducted an analysis
    using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), another method for conducting this analysis
    [ 43]. The authors proposed several methods for mining patent databases in search
    of new and unfilled technologies applicable to smart farms. In addition, we propose
    employing network analysis to develop a technical road map for smart farms. In
    another recent study, researchers investigated the current research trends and
    knowledge structures for smart farms. The LDA topic modeling technique analyzed
    the themes covered in 104 academic publications from the Korea Citation Index
    related to smart farms. The evaluation of the keywords and their associations
    was carried out [ 44]. Another method is used for conducting semiautomatic literature
    reviews. As per the best of our knowledge and literature analysis, it is claimed
    that LSA techniques have not been applied to smart farming technology. In NLP,
    LSA is a technique that may be used to recognize and make meaning of a text through
    the use of term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) metrics (LSA)
    [ 45]. Putting words in a bag is a great way to extract and infer essential relationships.
    Bag of words (BOW) analysis is a powerful technique for analyzing massive amounts
    of text (BOW) [ 46, 47]. LSA is used by academics to systematically examine textual
    content and answer a predetermined research question [ 46]. Furthermore, it has
    been demonstrated that mathematical models can achieve the same results as the
    human mind while processing text [ 48– 50]. The fundamental purpose of this study
    is to foresee and uncover developing tendencies in the IoT in agriculture. Upon
    extensive review, it has been concluded that descriptive research is available
    in smart farming. The researchers have reviewed the field of smart farming by
    using the bibliometric technique, a manual and statistical approach applied to
    data to give overall bibliographic dimensions of the area. In recent studies,
    researchers have involved LDA techniques in various fields like blockchain technology
    (BCT) [ 51], smart cities [ 52], smart agriculture [ 53], and many more. However,
    the LSA techniques are still missing in the smart farming field, which has motivated
    the authors to explore the field of smart farming using LSA technology. In Table
    1, the authors provide a deep insight into existing and current research concepts,
    results, and technology used. Table 1  Analysis of existing and current research.
    While significant progress has been made in this field, some research gaps still
    need to be addressed. Some of the research gaps identified in the field of smart
    farming are as follows: (i) The IoT, AI, edge computing, cloud computing, blockchain,
    and other technologies are all part of smart farming. However, more study is required
    to determine the best ways to combine these tools to boost agricultural productivity
    using smart farming. (ii) Using intelligent devices for soil assessment is an
    emerging field of study that has attracted considerable interest recently. Several
    research gaps must be addressed, including standardization of protocols, calibration
    of smart devices, data validation, data integration from multiple sources, cost-effectiveness,
    user-friendliness, application of smart devices in various soil types and environments,
    and generalizability and utility. (iii) A more concise understanding of this concept
    is required for the security issue and data privacy in smart farming. Moreover,
    a closer look at the literature reveals several gaps and shortcomings in smart
    farming irrigation systems, sustainable smart farming, and climate-smart farming.
    In this article, we do a network analysis of the subject at hand using the Vosviewer
    program and display the resulting image. Following are the research questions
    that are addressed in this study. Research Question 1: Who are the most prominent
    experts in smart farming, and what are the most prominent countries, keywords,
    and publishing houses in this field? Research Question 2: How have IoT capabilities
    changed farming? Research Question 3: What have the most recent developments been,
    and where do you see smart farming headed? The graphical structure of the manuscript
    is represented in Figure 1.    Figure 1  Study design. 3. Methodology In this
    study, the corpus for the experiment is selected by following the PRISMA guidelines,
    which are depicted in Figures 2 and 3, representing the study’s recommended technique.    Figure
    2  Flow diagram of PRISMA guidelines considered for selecting corpus.    Figure
    3  Proposed methodology. 3.1. Selection of String The first step of a SLR is creating
    a string according to Kitchenham and Charters’ guidelines [ 60]. The string was
    constructed by applying Boolean AND/OR logic to the chosen topic and the keywords
    that were found to be relevant. The AND operator on a search query will only return
    articles containing the specified keywords. When you use an OR operator, you will
    get a list of articles with at least one of your chosen keywords. In this analysis,
    the phrases “Farming,” “IOT,” and “internet of things” are central. After applying
    every possible combination of keywords and Boolean operations, the final search
    string looks like as follows: (“IOT” OR “internet of things” OR “smart”) AND (“Farming”).
    3.2. Data Source Though several online libraries might be utilized to search for
    articles on IoT in farming, our investigation relied on Scopus, an extensive and
    trustworthy database [ 61]. Using the final search term, 4,305 results were retrieved
    from Scopus; 3,229 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the
    analysis. According to the author’s inclusion/exclusion criteria, only studies
    written in English were examined, and those without an abstract, year, or other
    essential details were disregarded. A subset of the collected corpus is shown
    in Figure 4; it consists of a few examples, each with a title, authors, year,
    publishing source, keywords, and abstract.    Figure 4  Corpus sample. 3.3. Tool
    This research used the text-mining capabilities of the open-source application
    KNIME [ 62]. There is a result, the learning curve, and Vosviewer, an open-source
    software application, is used for network analysis [ 63, 64]. Before text can
    be mined from it, it must be preprocessed using KMINE. Words in the document are
    stemmed, stop words are eliminated, and part of speech (POS) tags are added before
    processing begins (only in English) [ 61]. POS tagging generates a token of words
    in the source material (BOW). The LSA relies on words from the BOW dictionary.
    During the normalization process, KNIME’s case converter node is utilized to change
    the case of each document to either lower or upper case. The delicate nature of
    the topic calls for this case conversion to eliminate bias. For example, stop-words
    like is, am, are, etc., which individual has no meaning to be eliminated from
    a document [ 46]. When applied to LSA-based text mining, the stemming process
    helps reduce redundant information, making the operation more efficient [ 65].

    a meta-analysis and a network analysis to address the questions posed at the article’s
    outset. 4.1. Meta-Analysis Descriptive statistics on the pool of publications
    under consideration are the backbone of any meta-analysis. Corpus contains various
    information regarding the author, countries, source, publication year, etc., so
    the author provided information about the leading author, journals, countries,
    keywords, etc. 4.2. Leading Author from Corpus The top 10 most influential researchers
    in the IoT Farming field are ranked in Table 2 according to the number of documents
    and citations in the chosen corpus. Table 2  Leading author in smart farming.
    This concludes that the author Dr. Anupam Kumar from the “School of Public Policy
    at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,” has the most significant number
    of articles on IoT farming and has been cited 398 times. 4.3. Publications by
    Year Figure 6 shows that the first articles on “Internet of Things Farming” emerged
    in 1989. Similar to the yearly number of papers contributed, this trend has been
    rising steadily. As a result, it is possible to have as many as 983 publications
    in this area by 2021. This indicates that IoT in agriculture is a dynamic field
    of study. In addition, there has been an uptick in the number of inquiries I have
    received from people curious about beginning sustainable agricultural practices.    Figure
    6  Year-wise publication analysis. 4.4. Publications by Journals Figure 7 shows
    the 10 most-cited journals. About 2.13% of all papers were published in the “Journal
    Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,” which contains the most articles
    (69). As a result, the “Journal Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing”
    has an H-Index of 48 and an impact factor of 0.626.    Figure 7  Top 10 dominating
    journals in GHRM. 4.5. Leading Countries The most prolific publishing nations
    are displayed in Figure 8. Figure 9 displays the top 10 nations by document count
    and by the network connecting them, revealing that India has the most referenced
    research on the subject of IoT Farming, with a total of 11,718 citations for 1,689
    publications [ 66– 68].    Figure 8  Country-wise publication.    Figure 9  IoT
    farming interconnection of countries. Better agricultural opportunities may emerge
    as a result of such international cooperation. Scientists from different countries
    exchange ideas and techniques to improve farming. Keywords can also be analyzed
    via network theory to reveal where a field of study is headed. For some, this
    may also serve as a springboard for further investigation. Figure 10 depicts a
    keyword network analysis.    Figure 10  Keywords analysis. 5. Term Frequency-Inverse
    Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Constructing, from the corpus, a document word matrix
    that lists the absence/presence or frequency of specific terms within a particular
    document can greatly ease textual analysis. Incorporating this matrix into your
    search can help you find frequently used or widely spread expressions. The TF-IDF
    score is calculated for use in this context. Words with a high TF-IDF score were
    found in this study by calculating the TF-IDF score for each article in the corpus
    and looking at which ones had the most weight in comparison. One of the NLP techniques
    used to categorize and summarize text is the “term frequency-inverse document
    frequency” technique (TF-IDF) [ 69– 71]. The methodology is applied to the terms
    retrieved from the relevant corpus to determine how vital those terms are. The
    TF-IDF algorithm uses the frequency with which each term appears in a given document
    to calculate the weights of the terms retrieved from the corpus and included in
    BOW [ 47]. The occurrences of a term in a text are counted using the TF methodology,
    often known as the TF method. Then, the number of instances of the phrase in the
    document is divided by the total number of occurrences in the paper [ 72, 73].
    IDF is a valuable instrument for making this determination. See the following
    equations for the TF-IDF formula. For the corpus used in this study, the TF-IDF
    values were computed automatically using a KNIME workflow using Equations (1)
    and (2). The calculated values are shown in Table 3. Twenty of the most frequent
    terms in BOW were chosen for this study. Table 3  Calculated TF-IDF score for
    3,229 documents. The corpus includes 3,229 articles scraped from Scopus, and 18,804
    tokens were used to construct BOW’s vocabulary. Figure 11 displays the top 20
    most-used phrases from these 18,804 tokens visually.    Figure 11  Top 20 frequent
    terms. The author employed clustering to isolate five key latent subjects from
    the corpus, even though many recovered terms were likely redundant or noisy. The
    produced matrix comprises 18,804 terms by 3,229 columns, with the restriction
    that only the top 20 terms by 3,229 columns may be utilized to represent the data.
    Words with only one occurrence in the corpus populate the matrix. During the transformation,
    terms are given different amounts of weight based on their relative importance
    in the source document. There is a possibility of using the corpus’s TF-IDF scores
    to group-related documents together. 6. Predicting Recent Trends Using K-Means
    Clustering Articles in the Scopus database on IoT farming can be analyzed by grouping
    them, then assigning topics based on terms that load into these groups. After
    K words are extracted from the BOW corpus, they will be clustered using K-means
    to yield a topic solution. For example, Deerwester [ 74] recommends that, for
    a corpus of 3,229 documents, 10 subjects are a fair number of topics. The 10 optimal
    themes and their associated high-loading words are shown in Table 4, which was
    generated using KNIME. Their respective TF-IDF scores can now define each of these
    10 subjects/clusters. Graph coding has been used to represent each cluster to
    represent the K-mean clustering. The shapes used to represent clusters are represented
    in Table 5. Table 5  Cluster coding. Table 4  High-loading article based on cluster.
    During the experiment, authors calculated TF absolute, TF relative, IDF, and TF-IDF
    scores for the boag of words. Based on the TF-IDF score, K-mean clustering is
    applied to identify 10 different clusters. In Figure 12, K-Mean clustering is
    represented graphically.   (a)         (a)  (b)  (c)  (d)         Figure 12  Representation
    of K-mean clustering: (a) TF (abs) vs. TF (rel) values are represented; (b) clusters
    are represented against the TF score; (c) clusters are represented against the
    IDF score; (d) clusters are represented against the TF-IDF score. In Figure 12,
    four types of graphs are shown where in (a) TF (abs) vs. TF (rel) values are represented,
    in (b) clusters are represented against the TF score, in (c) clusters are represented
    against the IDF score, and in (d) clusters are represented against the TF-IDF
    score. These problem descriptions represent emerging tendencies in IoT farming,
    and they can guide future studies in this area. 6.1. Labeling the Clusters K-mean
    clustering can refine the recovered clusters in light of the TF-IDF score by identifying
    the highest-scoring cluster. Then, appropriate labels are assigned to the clusters
    after reviewing the terms included. The results are then sorted into categories
    according to their relative importance, with the former being considered current
    trends on the path of future study and the latter being identified as areas needing
    additional study. Finally, like high-loading items, their associated ratings can
    be grouped (Table 4). 7. Recent Trends and Future Direction in the Field of Smart
    Farming In the subject of smart farming, this is demonstrated by the topics and
    clusters retrieved using K-means clustering applied to TF-IDF scores. 7.1. Cluster
    I: IoT Ecosystem for Smart Farming The United Nations predicts that by 2050, the
    world’s population will have hit 10 billion [ 104]. This results in an ever-increasing
    need for goods and services provided by the Agricultural industry. However, food
    security has become the most pressing international issue due to the worldwide
    decline in arable land, the exhaustion of natural resources, and unexpected environmental
    challenges, including global warming, salinization, and flooding. Environmental
    monitoring applications using sensors to measure air, water, and soil quality
    are examples of how the IoT has significantly impacted the technological and economic
    domains [ 105]. While wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely utilized
    in agriculture, laying the groundwork for the advent of “smart farming,” the introduction
    of the IoT in agriculture as an improvement over WSNs has led to a proliferation
    of IoT-related applications in the industry. A few applications of drone technology
    in agriculture include unmanned aerial vehicle farming, farm monitoring, soil
    tracking and tracing analytical data and prediction, and many more [ 106]. However,
    co-op ecosystems have not fully adopted AI and Internet-connected items despite
    the rapid growth of technology. Consequently, an earlier study proposed AI-based
    applications and ontologies that would benefit the ecosystem of smart agriculture
    cooperatives [ 107]. This research also specifies the architecture of the cooperative
    ecosystem, as well as its components, interactions, and agreements, all of which
    are essential for successful collaboration. 7.2. Cluster II: IoT in Precision
    Farming One of the most well-known IoT in agriculture is precision farming. Tracking
    animals, vehicles, fields, and inventories with cutting-edge apps is a great way
    to improve farming precision and management [ 108]. Sensors collect data to determine
    the best farming strategy, allowing farmers to collect and analyze it in real
    time for more informed decisions. Precision farming relies heavily on irrigation,
    livestock, vehicle monitoring, and other techniques [ 109]. Precision farming
    is a technique that considers soil and environmental factors to maximize productivity.
    When the operating data of connected devices are tracked in real time, it is possible
    to see how much water and nutrients are available. Precision farming is based
    on data analysis; these data are captured through the sensors installed on the
    farms. As the data capturing techniques are changed, the traditional methods to
    manage the data are insufficient [ 110]. In a subset of the research study, authors
    addressed the YieldPredict framework, which provides farmers with information
    that can improve their crop yields through more informed decision-making and better
    agricultural planning [ 111]. This study merges preprocessed crop data such as
    soil parameters, area, production, and seasonal rainfall with an existing smart
    farm ontology. These characteristics were chosen because it is possible to gather
    data related to them. In contrast, obtaining information about remote sensing,
    crop genotypes, and vegetation index is more challenging. Traditional database
    management systems cannot store IoT sensor data. Smart farming requires cloud-based
    data storage and an end–to–end IoT platform. These strategies help execute higher-quality
    activities, according to experts. Sensors are the leading IoT data collectors.
    Using analytics tools, the data are reviewed and interpreted. Data analytics can
    analyze weather, livestock, and agricultural conditions [ 112]. The information
    uses additional technological advances, improving conclusions. IoT devices receive
    data from sensors to provide real-time agricultural monitoring. Predictive analytics
    helps you make better harvesting selections. Trend analysis helps farmers plan
    for weather and crop harvesting. Farmers have benefited from IoT since it has
    increased both the amount and quality of their harvests by allowing them to monitor
    better and maintain crop and soil health [ 113]. 7.3. Cluster III: Sustainable
    Smart Farming The domestication of animals and plants occurred a few thousand
    years ago, the use of crop rotations and other improvements in farming practices
    occurred a few hundred years ago, and the “green revolution” with systematic breeding
    and the widespread use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides occurred within
    the last few decades [ 114]. Some examples of major shifts in farming methods
    throughout history include the ones listed here. The growing adoption of ICT in
    farming could herald the beginning of a fourth agricultural revolution [ 115].
    Sustainable farming does more than preserve the planet’s natural resources; it
    also decreases or eliminates emissions of greenhouse gases, boosts soil health
    and fertility, and raises crop yields. At its core, sustainable farming is concerned
    with safeguarding and increasing the Earth’s capacity to produce food, reducing
    emissions, and increasing farm profitability to ensure the financial stability
    of farmers and their communities. Better IoT tools will allow for constant quality
    control and oversight in the farming industry [ 116]. Complex challenges have
    arisen due to a lack of research and development in smart sustainable farming;
    these include the management and operation of IoT/AI equipment, data exchange
    and management, interoperability, and the analysis and storage of massive data.
    7.4. Cluster IV: Security Challenges in Smart Farming The privacy and safety of
    data stored on devices is the most crucial consideration in smart farming. On
    the one hand, “smart farming” has opened up new horizons in the agricultural industry,
    while on the other, cyber-attacks are mushrooming like rabbits throughout the
    landscape. Due to the ease with which a denial-of-service (DoS) attack may be
    executed inside the precision agriculture ecosystem, there is the potential for
    significant repercussions, and a large-scale coordinated attack can destabilize
    national economies. In particular research, the researchers have demonstrated
    that a DoS attack has occurred in the smart farming ecosystem [ 117]. This attack
    can hinder the functionality of a smart farm by interfering with the placed sensors
    on the field. As a result of the proliferation of the IoT, there is a broad spectrum
    of vulnerabilities that can be taken advantage of by cybercriminals and other
    individuals with nefarious intentions (IoT) [ 116]. Even though enhancing utility
    and efficiency is one of the declared goals of the smart farm, there is a possibility
    that its users and specialists could be put in danger if the network is not adequately
    protected [ 118]. The layer-wise security challenges are discussed in Figure 13.
    The IoT is built on a four-tiered architecture. The first layer is the physical
    layer, the second is the edge layer, the third is the cloud layer, and the fourth
    is the communication layer [ 119].    Figure 13  IoT layer and corresponding security
    challenges. 7.5. Cluster V: Smart Irrigation Management System The agricultural
    industry overcame conventional irrigation’s shortcomings thanks to “smart” irrigation
    systems. The various advantages of smart irrigation systems and solutions have
    resulted in their widespread use [ 120]. Farming experts and farmers advocate
    for water-efficient irrigation practices. Smart irrigation is made possible by
    various soil moisture sensors and wireless communication technologies that allow
    for more accurate forecasting and planning in the face of unpredictable weather
    patterns [ 121]. To help conserve water worldwide, smart irrigation systems reduce
    water waste. Future smart irrigation systems will be able to regulate water consumption
    thanks to improvements in sensor technology [ 122]. Smart irrigation is used in
    community botanical gardens, municipal parks, and schoolyards. Smart irrigation
    has completely changed how farmers used to rely on the elements. As a result,
    irrigation practices are changing, and crop yields are rising thanks to new smart
    irrigation technologies [ 123]. Intelligent irrigation systems automatically adjust
    watering schedules and run times to meet the landscape’s needs. These measures
    have a significant impact on water efficiency in the field. The watering schedule
    of conventional irrigation controllers is based on a preprogramed schedule and
    timers [ 124]. On the other hand, smart irrigation controllers use sensors to
    track variables like humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and even the amount
    of water lost through evaporation to determine how much water to supply to individual
    plants. 7.6. Cluster VI: Blockchain-based Cyber-Solutions in Smart Farming Blockchain-based
    supply chain tracking can help prevent foodborne illness. It is a safe way to
    keep track of information that allows for intelligent farming and index-based
    crop insurance [ 125]. It can also reduce transaction costs, enhance farmers’
    market access, and generate more money. In farming and food, blockchain has limits
    despite its enormous potential benefits. By tracking where food cravings originated,
    establishing a trustworthy food supply chain, and fostering mutual trust between
    farmers and their customers, BCT in farming can facilitate the development of
    direct marketplaces for farmers [ 126]. The research in this domain includes precision
    farming, farm safety, agricultural commerce, and food distribution networks. The
    blockchain is maturing into a fully-fledged technology that can be integrated
    into all next-generation Internet intelligent applications. A blockchain’s “nodes”
    are distributed ledgers that ensure data integrity and sincerity [ 127]. Prohibited
    users cannot perform fraudulent transactions since the blockchain network is capable
    of smart contracts and consensus. Another aspect of introducing blockchain in
    smart farming can be a use case of the automatic trigger-based transaction system.
    Blockchain-based smart contracts automatically trigger payments when a condition
    is met without incurring exorbitant transaction fees [ 128]. Farmers may theoretically
    be compensated for their goods as soon as they are delivered without suffering
    significant financial losses. Many farmers have difficulty selling their products
    at a reasonable price. Intermediaries earn the most money with the least amount
    of effort. Smart contracts enable direct communication between farmers and retailers,
    removing the need for intermediaries. They would receive a higher price for their
    wares [ 129]. Farmers can increase their yield by employing big data, cyber-physical
    systems, AI, blockchain, and other technologies to monitor the activities and
    interactions on smart farms. Increasing technological integration increases the
    total number of potential attack vectors [ 130]. To prevent cyberattacks on the
    intelligent agriculture ecosystem, precautions must be taken. This research presents
    an ontology for smart farming that can encode the sensors and interactions unique
    to each farm. The authors constructed a smart farm environment using physical
    components, digital copies, and a representation graph. The dynamics of the relationships
    between the farm’s owner, workers, sensors, and vehicles are categorized and documented.
    7.7. Cluster VII: Climate-Smart Farming (CSF) The climate-smart farming method
    considers global warming and hunger in developing countries. Increasing agricultural
    output is one of CSF’s three goals, with the final goal of improving the food
    and financial security of the world’s poor (75% of whom live in rural areas and
    depend on Farming for their livelihood) [ 131]. The second objective is to reduce
    human vulnerability to climate-related threats like drought, pests, and illnesses.
    Third, increase your resilience to long-term pressures such as shorter seasons
    and climate change. The third phase is to reduce emissions per calorie or kilogram
    of food produced, slow deforestation in agricultural areas, and absorb atmospheric
    carbon dioxide. Despite its sustainable farming base, CSF is distinct from other
    farming methods. First, it addresses global warming [ 132]. Second, CSF evaluates
    the synergies and tradeoffs between productivity, flexibility, and mitigation
    as its second function. Third, CSF seeks additional financial opportunities to
    address the vacuum in investment. Future climate-smart agricultural research could
    lead to a system that uses fewer inputs thanks to the help of high-precision tools
    and approaches, that reduces nutrient loss to the environment by keeping soils
    in place in the fields rather than contributing to erosion, and that reduces and
    mitigates emissions from livestock while still providing enough food to feed a
    growing population [ 133]. 7.8. Cluster VIII: Livestock Precision in Smart Farming
    When it comes to monitoring livestock, smart farming refers to real-time monitoring
    of individual health, welfare, production/reproduction, and environmental influences
    [ 134]. Industry 4.0 relies significantly on innovative production techniques
    like precision livestock husbandry. Precision Livestock Husbandry hosted its first
    annual conference in 2003. It utilizes automated monitoring devices such as sensor
    cameras, microphones, Internet access, wireless communication networks, and other
    computer software programs [ 135]. It also assists farmers in enhancing decision
    management by keeping track of large animals “per animal” and detecting subtle
    but significant changes in behavioral patterns or unrelated parameters. Precision
    Livestock Husbandry aims to improve farm profitability, efficiency, and longevity
    by building a symbiotic relationship between crop and animal farming [ 136]. The
    livestock precision system comprises cameras, microphones, and other sensors for
    tracking animals and specialized computer software. The findings can be quantitative,
    qualitative, or concerned with sustainability issues [ 137]. Future research may
    develop a web-based system for collecting and analyzing the above data to aid
    livestock producers, consultants, and others in making management decisions that
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to the web-based framework, BCT can
    be included in the platform to facilitate the growth of cattle farming industry
    characteristics such as data security, privacy, sharing, tracking, and smart contracts
    [ 138]. 7.9. Cluster IX: Soil Assessment Using Smart Devices Monitoring soil conditions
    enables farmers to maximize yield, eliminate disease, and allocate scarce resources
    more effectively. Temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, hydrogen, oxygen,
    water volume, potential, and radiation are measured by networked sensors [ 139].
    IoT-device-integrated sensors transmit data to a distant server or cloud storage
    for further processing. These data can improve farming operations, identify trends,
    and modestly increase yields and quality [ 140]. Optimal crop growth, biotic and
    abiotic stress resilience, and agricultural products can be enhanced by analyzing
    real-time physical and chemical soil data, such as temperature, moisture, pH,
    and pollutants, utilizing sensors and plant wearables [ 141]. The agricultural
    soil sensors include temperature, moisture, organic matter, pH, insect/pest, and
    soil pollutant sensors. In addition, IoT-based sensors are put in the soil to
    monitor the quality of the ground and assess its appropriateness for various crops.
    This enhances the operation of the agricultural sector by providing the most significant
    possibilities for producing error-free products, resulting in an overall improvement
    [ 142]. Thanks to technological advancements, farmers can now access a complete
    package that analyses soil quality and offers various farming tactics. Precision
    Farming comprises several strategies that make it feasible to adopt intelligent
    measures to increase the overall efficiency of farming. Smart Greenhouse Farming
    is the future of soil evaluation utilizing intelligent instruments. Smart greenhouses
    use IoT to control agricultural production areas autonomously [ 143]. This reduces
    weather hurdles and predator danger, protecting crops at any cost. The autonomous
    feature of intelligent greenhouses provides farmers with real-time insights and
    increases efficiency. It has intelligent sensors, gateway communication, and an
    intuitive interface for monitoring irrigation, lighting, humidity, temperature,
    and crop activities. 7.10. Cluster X: Edge and Cloud Computing in Smart Farming
    Due to technological improvements, smaller and more precise sensors are becoming
    increasingly practical and utilized in several scenarios [ 144]. The rapid adoption
    of IoT and cloud computing has led to “smart” healthcare systems, cities, mobility,
    grid, homes, metering, etc. Farmers in India, China, and other developing nations
    depend primarily on their crops for survival and export. Farmers and the government
    would benefit from using IoT and cloud computing in farming since it would assist
    in controlling expenses, monitoring performance, and improving maintenance [ 145].
    As digital transformation continues, edge computing is becoming increasingly popular
    in many fields. Smart farming is now getting increasingly popular because of edge
    computing technology. In farming, edge computing is faster and more efficient
    than cloud infrastructure. Smart farming and computing at the network’s edge can
    help precision farming [ 146]. Edge computing allows farmers to improve how they
    run their businesses and make their operations more efficient, which in turn helps
    them cut costs. Much like its contemporaries in “Edge Computing,” cloud computing
    is a dynamic and rapidly expanding sector of the IT industry [ 147]. Technology
    has advanced thanks to the creation of cloud services, which enable on-demand
    access to resources, virtualization, and scalability. Utility computing, virtualization,
    and service-oriented architecture are all characteristics of cloud computing.
    IT services are available pay-as-you-go via Internet-based “Cloud” infrastructures.
    The evolution and administration of cloud computing on farms are the subjects
    of this investigation [ 148]. The potential of cloud computing in other fields,
    such as farming and medicine, is also highlighted. 8. Conclusion With IoT, farming
    has become data-driven, enabling timely, cost-effective, and ecologically sustainable
    farm management. Thus, developing countries whose GDP depends on farming must
    include IoT in farming. Developing nations lack the infrastructure for precision
    farming; hence, a methodological paradigm is needed to connect ground sensors
    to compute nodes cost-effectively, considering data processing limits and constraints.
    Crop yields are lowered by natural disasters, peasants, careless seed planting,
    erratic watering, and locust infestations. Farmers face significant challenges
    due to soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and increased food demand. Farmers often
    give up and accept less than they deserve when faced with difficulties of this
    nature. Farmers must adopt IoT to keep constant tabs on their crops and turn forth
    delicious food. In this work, the authors conducted a comprehensive literature
    review utilizing a data mining technique from NLP. They identified 10 distinct
    areas where smart farming and farming are currently progressing. Trends in these
    areas can help and guide the efforts of present and future researchers. Data Availability

  description: Climate change, land degradation, and limited land and water resources
    have challenged our ability to meet the food demand of a rapidly growing population.
    To tackle this challenge, modern agricultural systems are relying on new technologies
    like the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve agricultural productivity and resource
    use efficiency. Although IoT has gained considerable attention in the last few
    years, the key concepts of IoT and their applicability across different domains
    of agriculture are still new to many researchers, practitioners, managers, and
    policymakers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the use of different
    IoT platforms, wireless sensor networks, and other associated technologies like
    remote sensing, cloud computing, and big data analytics in digital agriculture.
    The review also explores the use of communication technologies, microcontrollers,
    and machine learning in smart irrigation and decision support systems. The necessity
    of interoperability (data transfer and communication without human interference)
    among devices is discussed in detail with regard to facilitating and exchanging
    agricultural data more effectively. The discussion also includes opportunities
    and challenges in standardizing IoT; developing energy-efficient and affordable
    technologies; and improving data collection, transfer, storage, processing, security,
    anonymity, and privacy. This paper further calls for collaborative research in
    sensor and communication technologies in the agricultural sector.

    The global food system is currently under pressure due to rising population, economic
    growth, land degradation, and increased demand for animal-based products (Keating
    et al., 2014; Lal, 2013). For example, global food production needs to be increased
    by about 70% to ensure food security for an estimated world population of more
    than 9.7 billion people in 2050 (Cole et al., 2018; FAO, 2017). Further, climate
    change is projected to affect global food production and efforts to increase food
    productivity. Notably, crop production across the globe has already experienced
    negative effects from warming temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns,
    and increased extreme weather events (IPCC, 2022; Paudel et al., 2014). This will
    likely be exacerbated by climate change in the future (Hasegawa et al., 2021;
    Lobell et al., 2008; Rosenzweig & Parry, 1994). As such, researchers, scientists,
    policymakers, and organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO) call for a radical transformation in global agricultural
    and food systems. Therefore, improved technologies that aim at enhancing production
    and supply-chain efficiencies under a resource-constrained environment are crucial
    to ensuring food security in the face of climate change (FAO, 2017). One such
    technology is the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently shown the potential
    to provide solutions to several challenges associated with increased agricultural
    productivity under climatic changes and variability (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer Uses of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture (Source:
    Salam, 2022, used with permission). Although there is no single definition of
    IoT, it could be broadly described as a system of devices, software programs,
    sensors, and other technologies that are either connected or are able to become
    connected via the Internet to exchange information and data (Borgia, 2014). The
    first application of IoT is believed to be an information-sharing network used
    by US defense sectors in 1969, then called the Advanced Research Projects Agency
    Network. The chronological timeline detailing the evolution process of various
    technologies within IoT since 1969 is summarized in Table 1 (Balas et al., 2019).
    In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of common
    devices that might be considered to be a part of the IoT framework, including
    cell phones, televisions, thermostats, vehicles, refrigerators, home lighting
    systems, and smart watches among many others. Such IoT infrastructure is projected
    to substantially impact the global economy, with more than 100 billion connections
    (Huawei Technologies Co., 2015) and a financial impact of more than $11 trillion
    by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). Their impact is largely apparent in the agricultural
    sector, which currently contributes up to 60% of the national gross domestic product
    in many countries (The World Bank, 2019). TABLE 1. Chronological evolution of
    the technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Year Evolution Reference

    (SAVI) program Simi et al. (2013) 2010 IoT was used for surveillance, security,
    and transportation applications Jyothi and Vardhan (2016) 2015 IoT was used for
    locating people and objects Sharma and Lohan (2019) 2020 IoT was used for monitoring
    and controlling distant objects such as water levels in tanks in crop fields Rajalakshmi
    and Mahalakshmi (2016) The use of IoT in agriculture emerged due to advancements
    in data science, remote sensing, and computer technologies, and the need for optimizing
    decisions regarding agricultural management practices (King, 2017). Specifically,
    IoT use in precision and smart agriculture is notable with applications in data-informed,
    site-specific, and real-time management and decision-making. International Society
    of Precision Agriculture defines precision agriculture as “a management strategy
    that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual data and
    combines it with other information to support management decisions according to
    estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality,
    profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.” Smart agriculture
    refers to farming using softwares, sensors, automation, and data technologies.
    Digital agriculture seeks to utilize data from precision farming and the power
    of Artificial Intelligence. Digital agricultural technologies and the use of IoT
    are illustrated in Figure 1. Development of pilot research farms is already underway
    in several countries to determine the feasibility of IoT-informed decision-making
    for improving the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production. Some
    examples include the Accelerating Precision Agriculture to Decision Agriculture
    (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang et al., 2017) and SmartAgriHubs (Chatzikostas
    et al., 2019) and SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos et al., 2012) in Europe. Yet, the adaptation
    of IoT technology in the agricultural sector is still in its infancy (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). IoT enables us to gather information from enclosed proximity to
    the physical location using fog computing, edge computing, communication protocols,
    and sensor technologies. They show potential in improving decision-making and
    productivity in various stages of agricultural production. Examples include the
    use of wireless in-field sensors in improving the measurement of soil moisture
    and permittivity (Salam, 2020; Bogena et al., 2010), autonomous precision irrigation
    systems (Dong et al., 2013), and identification and tracking of livestock animals
    (Trotter et al., 2010). Satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and new remote
    sensing approaches (e.g., PlanetLab) are increasingly used in IoT. For example,
    UAVs have been used for plant height estimation (Anthony et al., 2014; Herwitz
    et al., 2004), biomass estimation (Sinha et al., 2015), crop yield prediction
    (Ashapure et al., 2020; Panday et al., 2020), detection of weeds (De Castro et
    al., 2017), soil nitrogen management (Ballester et al., 2017), crop disease detection
    (Sugiura et al., 2016), and estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) (Hunt et al.,
    2008). Despite the growing interest of the agricultural research community in
    integrating IoT-enabled devices into production, to date, such technologies are
    not widely adopted by producers due to concerns associated with cost and return
    on investment (Narwane et al., 2022; Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). More specifically,
    there is a need to understand the benefits and utilities of IoT from different
    perspectives (users, developers, and researchers) to fully utilize its potential
    to improve crop production under limited resources and climate change. Therefore,
    in this paper, we review existing literature and discuss the concepts, applications,
    potential challenges, and opportunities associated with IoT with a specific focus
    on its application in digital agriculture. First, we provide the concepts and
    technical details of different components of IoT, followed by its applications
    in digital agriculture, and associated challenges and opportunities. Overall,
    this review is expected to provide useful insights into how IoT could be integrated
    into the smart agriculture framework for improving crop productivity and food
    security in the face of climatic change and variability. Core Ideas Different
    platforms, sensors, and structures of IoT in digital agriculture were reviewed.
    The application of IoT in data management, interoperability, and precision farming
    was reviewed. Potential of IoT to improve agricultural quality and productivity
    was highlighted. Challenges and opportunities of IoT in digital agriculture were
    discussed. 2 COMPONENTS OF THE IOT The key components of the IoT include IoT platforms,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the IoT structure. An IoT platform can be
    defined as an on-premises software suite or a cloud service (IoT platform as a
    service [PaaS]) that monitors and may manage and control different kinds of endpoints,
    generally through apps installed on the platform. Similarly, WSN refers to an
    infrastructure-less wireless network that is installed ad hoc in a large number
    of wireless sensors to monitor system, physical, or environmental factors. The
    structure of IoT largely consists of devices, network structure, and cloud technology
    that allow IoT devices to communicate with each other. These components are discussed
    separately below. 2.1 IoT platforms IoT platforms provide proprietary or open-source
    suite for controlling devices and data in IoT system. Various IoT platforms, both
    proprietary and open source, are currently available to handle data from diverse
    sources using different devices. They serve functions like ingestion, filtering,
    aggregation, storing, and computation of data (Jayaraman et al., 2016). These
    platforms support specific microcontrollers, transceivers, data and extension
    memory, and programming. Some select platforms in agriculture are available from
    Tzounis et al. (2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 2.1.1 FarmBot FarmBot
    is an open-source precision agricultural project platform that consists of a farming
    machine, software, and a repository for farming data. The three main components
    of FarmBot include mechanisms for seed planting, a nutrient delivery system, and
    a universal tool mounting system. FarmBot is generally used in urban farming for
    monitoring plant growth parameters and predicting a suitable harvest date at a
    future point in time (Nugraha et al., 2020). FarmBot can plant seeds with a regular
    watering schedule and can be remotely accessed with ease from Internet-connected
    devices (Murdyantoro et al., 2019). It takes the location of each plant into account
    to facilitate essential nutrients and water application for optimal plant growth
    based on feedback from the online database of records from various agricultural
    fields. The main purpose of FarmBot technology is to optimize the quality and
    quantity of agricultural produce and to enhance resource efficiency. Arduino,
    an open-source hardware and software company, which manufactures microcontrollers,
    is used to control the FarmBot and is connected to the Internet using a Raspberry
    Pi 3 board. A decision support system (DSS) has been implemented to help in data-driven
    design, access to the open repository, and real-time control of the parameters.
    An Android application can be designed to monitor the stepper motor location to
    carry out different farm operations, plant seeds using the vacuum pump in the
    field, and capture images. 2.1.2 Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost
    computer chip capable of being used with a computer monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
    The basic structure of a Raspberry Pi includes random access memory (RAM), a processor,
    USB ports, general purpose input/output pins, an Ethernet port, a full HDMI port,
    a camera interface, a display interface, and a micro SD card slot (Balamurugan
    et al., 2017). The Raspberry Pi has been used in a wide variety of applications
    in agricultural systems. The growing availability of Raspberry Pi with high processing
    capacity has enabled many remote sensing tasks in agriculture, including crop
    imaging, determination of soil fertility, crop yield estimation, and spraying
    of fertilizers (Mathe et al., 2022). Flores et al. (2016) utilized a Raspberry
    Pi as a local server to display the relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture,
    soil electrical conductivity, and soil pH through the use of a graphical user
    interface. Kamath et al. (2019) used a Raspberry Pi to monitor weeds in paddy
    crops and Bluetooth 4.0 to send data to remote base station using visual sensor
    nodes. These sensor readings were then processed using machine learning models
    (e.g., support vector machines and random forests) to distinguish weeds from paddy
    crops using shape features. 2.1.3 IRIS Mote An IRIS Mote (Crossbow) is a computing
    system consisting of a microcomputer plus one or more sensors that are connected
    wirelessly via a radio link. The IRIS Mote has one of the highest communication
    ranges (close to 500 m) using a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 wireless module. It also
    includes an Intel XScale processor, 8 KB of RAM, 512 KB of flash memory, and a
    transmission rate of 250 kbps. The expansion connector has eight channel analog
    inputs. The IRIS Mote handles task scheduling and input/output processing (Liu
    et al., 2015) using an open-source TinyOS operating system based on an ATMega1281
    low-power microcontroller (Sivagami et al., 2010). The transmission current of
    IRIS Mote is 10–17 mA, whereas the receiver current is 16 mA. The indoor communication
    range of the device is greater than 300 m, and the outdoor communication range
    is greater than 50 m (Narayanan et al., 2016). The underground communication range
    is reduced to less than 30 m due to interference in radio frequency communication.
    The IRIS Mote is used in small agricultural fields to monitor climatic and hydrologic
    parameters like rain, sunlight, humidity, and temperature of a system. 2.1.4 Zolertia
    The Zolertia Z1 Mote (Zolertia S.L., Barcelona, Spain) is a platform designed
    for WSNs. It is compatible with TinyOS, OpenWSN, and RIOT OS. It supports analog
    and digital sensors and includes an MSP432 microcontroller, 8 KB of RAM, and 92
    KB of flash memory. It can operate in the temperature range of −25 to −85°C. It
    is designed to work in the range of 0.3–3.6 V, powered by two 1.5 V AA standard
    batteries (Zolertia, 2010). Agricultural use of Zolertia has previously been reported
    in greenhouse-based tomato farming, where the attenuation of radio waves in the
    2.4 GHz freeband was measured using a received signal strength indicator (Cama-Pinto
    et al., 2021). Zolertia Z1 Mote has also been used in determining agro-climatic
    variables like temperature and soil moisture in cassava (Manihot spp.) production
    (Caicedo-Ortiz et al., 2018). 2.1.5 Node MicroController Unit Node MicroController
    Unit (NodeMCU) is an open-source IoT platform with an ESP8266 microcontroller
    and Wi-Fi system on chip (SoC) from Expressif Systems, and hardware, which runs
    on an ESP-12 module. This firmware runs on Lua scripting language (Vanaja et al.,
    2018). It functions the same way as a Raspberry Pi in the case of agricultural
    applications and may be connected to various sensors for real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture, relative humidity, and air temperature. In one study, NodeMCU
    was used to monitor the environmental conditions of indoor greenhouses (Wan et
    al., 2019). A cloud-based platform has been used to store the environmental sensor
    readings and has been used for automatic irrigation systems for controlling agriculture
    pumps and remote monitoring systems resulting in increased economic benefits (Bentabet,
    2020). 2.1.6 Intel Galileo/Edison The Intel Galileo (Intel) board is based on
    Intel architecture (Intel Quark SoC X1000, 400 MHz processor) and is designed
    to have powerful functionalities with minimum power consumption. This allows users
    to apply shields compatible with Intel Galileo and extend the functionality of
    the board. It comprises two levels—legacy controlled blocks and microbuses. The
    legacy-controlled blocks are used for specific functions using dedicated channels.
    It has a dedicated point-to-point connection to connect to standard modules like
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and SIM card modules for cell phones. The issues of these boards
    within agriculture are similar to that of the Raspberry Pi (Silpa et al., 2018).
    These boards are used in a house environment monitoring system, which helps in
    producing high-quality crops with minimal labor costs (Ajith et al., 2020). Some
    other applications are observed in the monitoring of soil pH and nutrients of
    cultivated crops (Sakthisudhan et al., 2019). 2.2 Wireless sensor network WSN
    is an important component of IoT, and its use in the agricultural sector has been
    widely discussed (Mahbub, 2020; Sanjeevi et al., 2020). A WSN is a wireless network
    consisting of spatially distributed sensors and sensor nodes to monitor physical
    or environmental conditions and transfer data to a base station. These systems
    are often inexpensive, scalable, and consist of mobile nodes (Kiani & Seyyedabbasi,
    2018). Briefly, the WSN system consists of two major components, sensor nodes
    and sink nodes (base station) (Kocakulak & Butun, 2017). The sensor node consists
    of a power unit, a sensing unit, and a computing unit. These nodes may be placed
    inside or outside an agricultural field to continuously feed data to the base
    station. Depending on the ad hoc system configuration or network type, the sensor
    node could behave as a data originator or router. Sensor nodes can collect real-time
    physical or environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, or motion
    time and produce sensory data (Pottie, 1998; Senouci & Mellouk, 2016). At the
    same time, the sink node collects sensor data and communicates with the end user
    via a direct connection. This connection between the sensor and sink nodes is
    established via the Internet, satellite, or any wireless link, and the data is
    accessed through an app or end-user interface. 2.3 IoT structure IoT structure
    is a system that helps in connecting objects to the Internet through information-sensing
    equipment to establish data exchange and communication and to monitor and manage
    digital systems (Ye et al., 2014). To achieve such functions, IoT uses the perception,
    network, and application layers, as well as the security strategy for each layer,
    as a part of its framework (Gou et al., 2013). The IoT structural hierarchy is
    shown in Figure 2 (Zhong et al., 2015), but more generalized structural components
    are discussed in sub-sections below. Different layers within the hierarchy are
    crucial to address issues like computational loss, poor access control, data leaks,
    malware risks, and cyberattacks (apriorit.com/dev-blog). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Hierarchy of the Internet of Things (IoT) structure. 2.3.1 The perception
    layer The perception layer is the foundation of IoT and is the interface between
    the physical world and the digital world. This layer functions as “nerve endings”
    collecting measured signals and transporting those signals to the rest of the
    system (Yang et al., 2012). It uses radio frequency identification technology,
    barcode technology, sensor, and positioning technology to complete information
    collection and helps in controlling the perception by the actuators. The main
    security issues in a perception layer are related to information collection and
    transmission as most sensors have a simple structure and processor and do not
    have complex security protection capabilities (Zhao & Ge, 2013). 2.3.2 The network
    layer The network layer is generally composed of two layers—the network access
    layer and the network transmission layer. The access layer consists of a base
    station node and a gateway. Current methods of network access are Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc,
    Mesh, and Zigbee. The network transmission layer is responsible for the transmission
    and exchange of information, including satellite, mobile, and optical fiber communication
    networks. It is analogous to a person''s nervous system and brain, which are used
    to transmit and cope with the information from the perception layer. The most
    common security issues in a network layer occur when a number of malicious nodes
    send data at the same time, which may lead to a denial of service attack (Bello
    et al., 2017). 2.3.3 The application layer The application layer is generally
    composed of two layers—the application support layer and the application presentation
    layer. The support layer is responsible for data storage, information processing,
    and the exchange of information. The presentation layer is used for processing
    data from the application support layer. It uses technology with multimedia, virtual
    reality, and human–computer interfaces to connect the IoT and the user. The main
    security issues concerning the application layer may include data access permission,
    identity authentication, data protection and recovery, big data handling, and
    software vulnerabilities, among others (Karagiannis et al., 2015). 3 APPLICATIONS
    OF IOT IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE Digital agriculture is directly linked with IoT.
    Indeed, IoT offers multiple applications in the production, circulation, and modernization
    of farming businesses (Chen & Jin, 2012; Ozdogan et al., 2017). The term “digital
    agriculture” refers to the on-farm and off-farm uses and applications of data
    based on location, weather, energy use, or other factor using sensors, machines,
    or satellites to monitor animals, plants, or soil (Klerkx et al., 2019). It integrates
    concepts from precision and smart farming. The basic framework (Tang et al., 2002)
    of digital agriculture includes: Agricultural databases that include information
    about farmlands, climatic conditions, and socioeconomic background that relates
    agricultural activities to the human society. Real-time monitoring and updating
    of information in the database about meteorology, vegetation, and soil information
    on and under the ground using in situ and satellite-based sensors. A network transmission
    and processing system to analyze collected information, make decisions, and transfer
    signals in controlling the functions of agricultural machinery. The actuation
    framework that includes digitized sowing and harvesting devices enabled with Geographic
    Information System and Global Position Satellite systems. Different crop, soil,
    and weather sensors are increasingly used in monitoring plant growth, diseases,
    pests, yield, weather variables (temperature, humidity, rain, air, etc.), and
    soil physical–chemical and hydraulic properties (Acharya et al., 2017; Sehgal
    et al., 2005). Sensors are used in real-time monitoring and reporting of agricultural
    parameters in the value chain, cloud computing, and integration of these processes
    with advanced technologies like UAVs and satellites to enable highly efficient,
    qualitative, profitable, and environmentally sound agricultural decision-making.
    Sensor-based data is also utilized in formulating predictive models to forecast
    crop yield (Supit et al., 2012). Some applications of IoT systems in digital agriculture
    are discussed as follows. 3.1 UAVs in digital agriculture Traditionally, satellites
    have been used to detect spectral responses from plants and soil (Dematte et al.,
    2018). However, satellite data is often of coarse resolution that is not applicable
    for canopy and plot scale applications and is not available regularly due to cloud
    cover and sensor property. UAVs provide a noninvasive and cost-effective approach
    to collect data at a much finer scale at the desired time scale. UAVs are defined
    as “a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft,
    its associated remote pilot station(s), the required command and control links,
    and any other system elements as may be required, at any point during flight operation”
    (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO). UAV-derived images can be processed
    to monitor and predict plant growth parameters, disease and pest incidence, yield,
    and different soil physical and hydraulic properties. Nowadays, smart technologies
    have been built into UAVs by integrating open-source technology, autonomous programs,
    smart sensors, and payloads (Puri et al., 2017). Different hyperspectral, multispectral,
    and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can be mounted to the UAVs for
    near real-time monitoring of vegetation conditions, extraction of soil and vegetation
    indices (Ni et al., 2018), and predicting LAI. For example, multispectral sensors
    are increasingly used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index,
    normalized difference red-edge index, leaf water content index, soil-adjusted
    vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, tile drainage, and plant water status
    by capturing the reflectance including those in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave
    regions of the electromagnetic radiation (Tables 2 and 3). TABLE 2. Different
    sensors used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their advantages and disadvantages
    (Modified from Acharya et al., 2021). Sensors Advantages Disadvantages Red/green/blue
    (RGB) Portable, common, relatively inexpensive, provide high-quality RGB images
    for ortho-imagery and digital surface model, easy to integrate with different
    platforms Wider bandwidth and lower spectral resolution lack geometric and radiometric
    calibration Multispectral Multiple wavelengths allow geometric reconstruction
    and radiometric calibration Relatively costly, image processing relatively complex
    compared to RGB, radiometric, and atmospheric corrections may be required, limited
    compatibility to UAVs Hyperspectral High spectral resolution data across various
    wavelengths of the visible and near infrared spectrum Higher cost than multispectral,
    low signal-to-noise ratio, limited compatibility with standard UAVs and flight
    control software packages, radiometric and atmospheric corrections may be required
    Microwave High spatial resolution, useful under low visibility weather conditions
    (e.g., cloud cover) Sensitive to surface roughness Thermal Sense a wide range
    of temperatures, relatively cheaper Thermally sensitive, vignetting effects, low
    spatial resolution, radiometric corrections required, sensitive to change in surface
    roughness LiDAR Generates dense cloud points, high-quality data, direct geometric
    measurements Higher cost, limited compatibility with UAVs, requires ground filtering
    corrections TABLE 3. Selected vegetative indices and their application in agriculture

    near-infrared; R, red. There are several types of UAV systems used for agricultural
    applications (Table 4; Acharya et al., 2021). Two widely used UAVs include fixed-wing
    and rotary-wing UAVs (Dileep et al., 2020). Fixed-wing UAVs use airplane-like
    wings to generate lift and to move forward. Some of their properties include lower
    cost, higher endurance, and greater flight speed as compared to rotary-wing UAVs.
    Contrastingly, rotary-wing UAVs use rotor blades and are characterized by vertical
    takeoff and landing capacity, lower flight altitude, and lower flight speed. UAVs
    may be used for mid-season crop health monitoring of vegetative indices using
    near-infrared and other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot be
    sensed by the human eye (Table 3; Cancela et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2020; Veroustraete,
    2015). Pathak et al. (2020) reported the use of UAVs in spraying herbicides on
    up to 20–40 ha per day and to further eradicate farmers’ direct contact with poisonous
    chemicals and hazardous operational conditions. UAVs can be used to generate variable-rate
    application maps from the images to determine the strength of nutrient uptake
    in a single field. This has the potential to further minimize fertilizer costs
    and optimize crop yield (Kulbacki et al., 2018). UAV-based LiDAR systems and software
    have shown potential in stitching together thousands of high-quality aerial photographs
    to develop 3D maps for monitoring soil erosion and developing conservation strategies
    (Acharya et al., 2021). More recently, new types of aerial imagery and satellite
    (e.g., PlanetLab) have shown tremendous potential in monitoring crops, making
    informed decisions, and increasing yield (Cai et al., 2019). TABLE 4. Applications
    of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the agricultural domain (adapted and modified
    from Puri et al., 2017). Agricultural UAVs Usage Honeycomb AgDrone system, Wilsonville,

    cloud-based advanced mapping software and Agribotix imaging for high-resolution
    aerial imaging and field and crop monitoring 3.2 Cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems The main purpose of cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems is to provide tools to software developers to develop
    a variety of cloud-based services to monitor plant growth parameters and predict
    crop yield (Kaloxylos et al., 2012). This infrastructure consists of data collection,
    statistical analysis, and the creation of commands to control farming equipment.
    In a practical setup, data is generally transferred from a local farm management
    system to the cloud repository associated with the monitoring service in order
    to keep track of the farm activities. The data is subsequently analyzed by an
    expert online system such as an e-agriculturist, and outputs are made directly
    available to the farmers. An ICT system has three major components (Patil et al.,
    2012). The first is an information collection layer, which consists of a sensor-based
    climatic and agricultural dataset. Data may include but is not limited to air
    temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, atmospheric gas concentrations;
    names, models, and prices of agricultural products; operating status of agricultural
    equipment, and locations of agricultural products. The second layer is the transport
    or network layer, which is responsible for transmitting and processing data received
    from the sensor layer above. Finally, the application layer analyzes and processes
    information to cultivate digital awareness. One of the leading examples of a cloud-based
    ICT system is GeoFarmer (Eitzinger et al., 2019). GeoFarmer consists of a modular
    design, which is interoperable through an application programming interface. It
    follows open access standards regarding existing tools and technologies and the
    system is designed and developed in accordance with user needs. Further, the entire
    process and lessons learned in the development process are documented. Similar
    software architecture has been defined in FIWARE, an open-source platform for
    a smart digital future, which focuses on agricultural sensors with reprogrammable
    firmware and a set of interfaces already embedded in the General Packet Radio
    Service board. Cloud-based systems have been applied to monitor pesticide use
    and safety in vegetable crops (Qian et al., 2018). Interfaces of such systems
    consist of guidelines for pesticide purchasing and application, optimal harvest
    time estimation, and a feedback system formulation to monitor the health of vegetables.
    A mobile-based cloud architecture was implemented through AgroMobile (Prasad et
    al., 2013), which enhances smart agricultural practices with the help of image
    processing techniques, image visualization, and cloud-based data processing. A
    similar precision agriculture technique using cloud computing has been proposed
    in enhancing the capacity for special education leadership for aggregate farming
    in the cloud (Castillejo et al., 2020) to increase efficiency and productivity
    and reduce labor costs. Other applications include quality control in greenhouse
    production, and monitoring soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature in
    agricultural plots. 3.3 Big data in agriculture Big data refers to datasets that
    are too large to be analyzed by traditional data processing software and applications.
    The integration of big data technologies and best farming practices has the potential
    to facilitate improved crop production, plant protection, postharvest analysis,
    and environmental conservation. The major applications of big data in different
    topologies of digital agriculture are available from Sarker et al. (2019) and
    are briefly discussed here. The first application of big data is in precision
    agriculture. Thus, data collected using sensor-enabled hardware and software tools
    is used for assessing, controlling, and improving crop management, crop performance,
    and environmental quality. The second application is prescription agriculture,
    where big data is used to prescribe agronomic practices for optimizing yield.
    The third application is in enterprise agriculture, which includes the agribusiness
    platform and links field data to inventory, logistics, machinery, and profit.
    Finally, the fourth application is in automated agriculture, where farm data and
    environmental data are used to automate agriculture through robotic technologies.
    The data lifecycle in agriculture consists of data generation, warehousing, cleaning,
    annotation, and processing to optimize or improve agricultural production while
    maintaining the quality of the environment (Chaterji et al., 2020). In the following
    section, we briefly describe each of these steps. Data generation may involve
    the use of site-specific or public data. Site-specific datasets, such as soil
    nutrient composition and fertilizer usage, are generally privately held. Examples
    of public data may include topographic or soil textural information of a location.
    Data warehousing allows the data to be integrated from multiple sources and then
    restructured for improved performance. Data annotation is a data labeling technique
    that translates an encoded value to raw data. Because classical WSNs have limitations
    in interpreting and understanding the context of raw sensor data, annotation is
    highly recommended for end-user applications (Khan et al., 2015). On the other
    hand, getting rid of the corrupt or inaccurate values from the tables is a very
    important step in processing and helps to eradicate outliers from the dataset.
    Finally, processing imagery data results in more useful formats, which is largely
    accomplished by using a variety of analysis techniques such as Artificial Intelligence.
    Despite the considerable importance of big data in modernizing agriculture, a
    dearth of publicly available, high-quality datasets remains a formidable challenge
    to farming using alternate techniques. A combination of machine learning and IoT
    may be crucial in filling those gaps and in designing interactive wireless sensor–actuator
    networks for the commercial application of alternative farming systems (e.g.,
    Aquaponics) (Dhal et al., 2022a, 2022b; Dhal, Jungbluth, et al., 2022). 3.4 Digital
    twins in agriculture Digital twins generally refer to a digital replica of real-world
    entities mirroring their behavior and states over the entire lifetime in a virtual
    world. It is generally a standardization of real-world variables and can be used
    irrespective of place, time, and human observation (Botín-Sanabria et al., 2022).
    A digital twin in agriculture has been described as a multi-physical, multi-scale,
    and probabilistic simulation model of complex production. It uses a combination
    of in situ sensors and physical models to mirror physical life. Information from
    sensors and satellite data is taken as input to design digital twins (Verdouw
    et al., 2021) and is utilized in reproducing historical statistics and predicting
    future values. The process involves data integration, Artificial Intelligence,
    and machine learning. Digital twins show potential for aiding in planning and
    managing soil operations, irrigation, robotics, and farm machineries (Nasirahmadi
    & Hensel, 2022). WSNs in farmlands and cloud servers that run machine learning
    algorithms can detect plant diseases, weed clusters, and nutrient deficiencies
    (Angin et al., 2020). Indeed, significant progress has been made in using digital
    twins in the field of arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture,
    and livestock rearing (Howard et al., 2020; Verdouw et al., 2017). For example,
    digital twins have been designed to monitor the health of cows (Bos taurus) and
    pigs (Sus domesticus), model firmness and loss of vitamin content in mango (Mangifera
    indica), identify diseases and pests in olives (Olea europaea) and other crops,
    assist in fleet management and tracking machinery, and identify pesticide exposure
    in bees (Apis mellifera) (Pylianidis et al., 2021). These applications of the
    digital twins within the agricultural sector have been observed in seven major
    fields: real-time monitoring of data, energy consumption analysis, system failure
    analysis and prediction, optimization of resources, behavioral analysis, technological
    integration, and virtual maintenance (Angin et al., 2020). More recently, the
    concept of digital twins has been applied in postharvest management by categorizing
    simulations into three stages: input, throughput, and output (Dyck et al., 2022).
    This enables monitoring of moisture and temperature of grain to ensure safe storage
    and movement within the elevator. Further, a sensor network could be used in storage
    to ensure the optimal quality of grains. 4 ADVANTAGES OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE
    The demand for agricultural products will increase as the global population grows
    and as climate change occurs (Bradshaw & Brook, 2014). IoT shows the potential
    to lower the impact of these challenges while meeting this demand for agricultural
    products. Indeed, IoT offers a potential solution to increase agricultural efficiency
    and productivity while saving time, labor, and money. Because of the cost and
    time effectiveness of IoT systems, the use and installation of IoT devices in
    the agricultural industry are increasing by nearly 20% annually and are expected
    to reach 225 million devices by 2024 (Elijah et al., 2018). In addition, the expansion
    of cellular service and 5G connectivity introduced by satellite and cellular network
    companies in rural areas have boosted the use of IoT in recent years (Di et al.,
    2019; Chen et al., 2022). The advancement of IoT connectivity to personal and
    portable electronic items, such as cell phones, iPads, and tablets, along with
    the introduction of advanced WSNs and machine learning facilitates real-time data
    retrieval, processing, and decision-making. The advantages of IoT in agriculture
    include interoperability, wide advantages of WSN, and data management using cloud
    and fog computing. In the following section, we discuss these advantages in detail.
    4.1 Interoperability The data collected through WSNs and sensor nodes is made
    available using apps, equipment, and products to communicate and process them
    in a way that does not require any involvement from end users, which is called
    interoperability (Tzounis et al., 2017). In other words, interoperability is the
    data communication approach that allows using different information systems to
    transfer and comprehend information. The interoperability process consists of
    two methods. The first method makes the data available through a local area network
    or a wide area network. The second method shares the data via software or hardware
    between different systems and machines. In the utilization of IoT, interoperability
    plays a vital role in facilitating and exchanging effectively organized data between
    information systems. Interoperability provides multiple benefits, such as system
    adaptability, better productivity, data unity, improved data protection, fewer
    errors, and lower data acquisition costs. The interoperability functionality includes
    three approaches, which include syntactical, structural, and semantical approaches
    (Aydin & Aydin, 2020). Syntactic interoperability allows the use of two or more
    systems simultaneously to communicate and share data even if the interface or
    language is not the same. Structural interoperability defines the standard data
    exchange format from one system to another to understand the information clearly.
    Moreover, semantic interoperability allows connecting two or more systems and
    sharing data between them in a meaningful way. 4.2 Smart irrigation and decision
    support The use of sensors and communication technologies, microcontrollers, and
    actuators has the potential to improve water use efficiency, reduce the cost of
    irrigation, and increase crop productivity (Abbasi et al., 2019). For example,
    UAVs are increasingly used in monitoring plant water use efficiency, which provides
    a base to select plant varieties for breeding and crop improvement, particularly
    in water-limited systems. Soil moisture sensors using capacitance or frequency
    domain technology are able to continuously monitor soil moisture in determining
    irrigation rate and time. Farmers may use mobile phones or wireless personal digital
    assistants to remotely control data loggers and monitor and analyze moisture for
    irrigation scheduling and automation. The applications of different machine learning
    algorithms in developing irrigation support systems are shown in Table 5. The
    irrigation DSS allows a weekly schedule to meet the irrigation water needs of
    a plantation based on inputs to a data-driven model. Some automated and smart
    irrigation systems using WSN, the Internet, cloud computing, and optimization
    tools are discussed in Krishnan et al. (2020) and Ramachandran et al. (2018),
    among others. TABLE 5. Application of machine learning techniques as decision
    support systems in Internet of Things (IoT)-based agricultural applications. Application
    of IoT in irrigation decision support, input, and salient features Reference Input
    variables: Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, dew point, vapor

    (decision support system [DSS]-based and soil-moisture based) have been proposed
    to improve cotton yield and water productivity Chen et al. (2020) Irrigation scheduling
    has been formulated using Fuzzy logic methods Giusti and Marsili-Libelli (2015)
    Output variable: Irrigation schedules Machine learning model: Linear regression,
    random forest regression and support vector regression Torres-Sanchez et al. (2020)
    4.3 Smart greenhouse One application of WSNs includes the conversion of a traditional
    greenhouse into a “smart greenhouse” (Kodali et al., 2016). The sensors automatically
    adjust the greenhouse climatic conditions, such as air pressure, relative humidity,
    air temperature, and light conditions, according to a particular set of instructions.
    The real-time greenhouse environment may be monitored via email and SMS alerts
    on mobile phones. For example, the installation of soil moisture sensors in the
    greenhouse activates an irrigation system only when the soil is dry. Recently,
    the use of solar-powered IoT sensors (Hou & Gao, 2010) has made building smart
    greenhouses an inexpensive and popular choice. 4.4 Data management With an increase
    in the application of IoT in multiple sectors and high-performance computing trends,
    the conventional database system has failed to meet the need and demand for massive
    sensor-derived data storage. In this regard, cloud base and fogging data storage
    in IoT platforms play a vital role in managing, transferring, and analyzing data
    into meaningful information using analytical tools. Cloud and fog computing have
    their characteristics to process data burdens and preferences, but they supplement
    each other. Using predictive analytics, a farmer could better predict weather
    conditions, maintain crop quality, and enhance soil fertility to formulate better
    plans and decisions related to crop harvesting and enhance crop quality and productivity.
    4.4.1 Cloud computing Cloud-based data management provides an option for computing
    resources on a pay-per-use basis. It is an extension of cluster and grid computing
    that collects resources at one central place and utilizes them for high-performance
    computing employing wireless connections (Qian et al., 2009; Armburst et al.,
    2020; Dillon et al., 2010). Such a computing system could be divided into two
    parts: front end and backend. The front end consists of client devices, such as
    computers, cell phones, tablets, and iPads, whereas the backend consists of data
    storage and processing located far away from the client. Cloud computing architecture
    provides three types of services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
    PaaS, and Software as a Service (SaaS) (Dempsey & Kelliher, 2018; Jagli et al.,
    2018; Laghari et al., 2016). IaaS platform is a remote data center that provides
    the right to change or configure storage capacity, processing power, and networking
    to their needs. PaaS provides a development platform for an application developer
    to create, test, and launch an application. SaaS deals with ready-made software
    tailored to various business needs and customer services. Cloud technology is
    also used to deliver mobile applications and is called mobile cloud computing
    (MCC). This method handles the information and relocates the storage from mobile
    devices to intense and centralized computing platforms situated in the cloud (Huang,
    2011). MCC takes the pressure off mobile devices by harnessing the power of cloud
    infrastructure. Many cloud service providers are compatible with Windows or Linux
    operating systems, such as Amazon Web Service, Server Space (ITGLOBAL), Microsoft
    Azure (Microsoft Corporation), Google Cloud Platform (Google LLC), IBM Cloud Services
    (International Business Machines Corporation), Adobe Creative Cloud (Adobe Inc),
    and Dropbox (Dropbox Inc). 4.4.2 Fog computing The motivation behind fog computing
    is the need for real-time computing. It is an extension of cloud computing that
    consists of multiple edge nodes directly connected to the physical device. As
    the nodes are physically much closer to the device, it seems more advanced and
    provides better performance than cloud computing for handling user requests and
    emerging standards (Atlam et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017). Fog computing can
    include cloudlets, a small-scale and robust data center located at the edge of
    the network system to perform computation without sending it to a distant server.
    Thus, fog computing acts as an intermediary between computing hardware and a remote
    server, controls the information being sent to the server, and processes it locally.
    It supports heterogeneous devices to provide greater interoperability than cloud
    computing. However, the security and privacy concerns in Fog computing are big
    issues due to the prevalence of wireless networks from a business point of view
    compared to cloud computing and deserve further research (Khan et al., 2017).
    Because of attacks, such as jamming attacks, and sniffer attacks, numerous organizations
    are focusing on considerable research on the security issue of Fog computing,
    including Cisco, Microsoft Corporation, ARM Holding Plc, and Dell Inc. Farmers
    benefit from cloud and fog data management by registering into the system application.
    The application is often designed to store farmers’ details, agronomic marketing
    details, agronomic vendors, and agricultural service providers, such as fertilizer,
    pesticides, seed, and equipment, and information on the government''s scheme.
    Indeed, cloud and fog data management systems have both advantages and disadvantages
    (Table 6), which largely determine the choice of using one over another. TABLE
    6. Pros and cons of cloud and fog computing in Internet of Things (IoT). Cloud
    for IoT Fog for IoT Pros Cons Pros Cons Improved performance between IoT sensors
    and data processing system High latency because of the distance between client
    devices and data processing centers Low latency because users are geographically
    closer to Fog to get an instant response A more complicated system in data processing
    and storage/decentralized computing Storage capacity can be scalable to store
    and share enormous amounts of data Downtime due to interruption in network and
    multiple connected channels No issues with bandwidth and connection because multiple
    interconnected channels are involved in sending the data Additional expense requires
    routers, hubs, and gateways Virtual processing capabilities on demand via remote
    data center Security and privacy could be limited because thousands of gigabytes
    of data are being transferred simultaneously High security because numerous nodes
    are involved in the complex distribution system Potential for cyberattacks, such
    as jamming and sniffer due to the extension of network''s edge Reduced cost because
    of lower licensing fees than the cost of equipment and maintenance Rescheduling
    of failure management is slow Power efficiency and improved user experiences because
    each node runs efficiently and provides instant response to the users Limited
    scalability—because it cannot be scalable as the cloud 5 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
    OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE Data-driven agricultural practices are largely focused
    on precision, predictive, smarter, and efficient farming practices with minimal
    use of resources and enhanced agricultural automation (Ayaz et al., 2019; Patil
    et al., 2012). Therefore, the usage of IoT in agriculture is inevitable with the
    increasing demand for food, land, and changes in climatic conditions. However,
    IoT in agriculture presents several challenges. These challenges and opportunities
    are observed at different levels of data handling and analysis: Collection, data
    transmission, processing and storage, and the application of the data inferred
    (i.e., inference drawn from available data without much expense of resources;
    Tzounis et al., 2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 5.1 Data collection
    Different IoT sensors are typically designed for a particular agriculture practice
    (Dholu & Ghodinde, 2018). The use of such sensors in different locations and climates
    is often challenging and may require either modification in design or further
    calibration. An ideal sensor should be user-friendly, efficient, robust, and able
    to withstand variable weather conditions. Although experts in the field can set
    up, install, and connect equipment, the application of data by farmers on day-to-day
    basis demands skills and training. The collection of real-time data is increasingly
    important in precision farming and requires an active Internet connection, which
    further presents a major challenge in IoT applications in underdeveloped countries
    and rural areas in the United States (Federal Communications Commission, 2020).
    Although IoT has been widely used in the field of precision agriculture, only
    proprietary solutions are currently being implemented, which creates difficulties
    with device compatibility and connectivity. There is a pressing need to discover
    other approaches that employ interoperable hardware built on open standards and
    platforms. Lower priced alternatives to expensive proprietary solutions can be
    found in the form of many already available products that are built on open hardware,
    at least in part (Stočes et al., 2016). Scaling up the use of integrated IoT technologies
    beyond early adopters is important, especially by making existing solutions easier
    to use and more affordable, thereby improving their selection and use by farmers
    and food companies. Therefore, business models that work for small companies and
    systematic analysis of associated costs and benefits may be necessary. More effort
    is necessary in improving the utilization of IoT technologies in a wide range
    of climates, crops, and soils. Efforts could be centered on the development of
    IoT devices for harsh environments (open air, dirt, dust, moisture, animal manure,
    cold storage, hot cleaning treatments, etc.) and for natural objects (plants,
    animals, square meters of soil, perishable food products), which have limited
    ways to embed IoT devices in the objects themselves. This is especially true for
    devices that use new technologies because there has already been a lot of progress
    in adapting more mature technologies (Verdouw et al., 2017). Indeed, IoT includes
    a large variety of heterogeneous devices; therefore, it is challenging to achieve
    high levels of compatibility among devices if they employ dissimilar standards
    and protocols. In order to overcome such obstacles, standard IoT protocols ought
    to be designed (Abbasi et al., 2019). There are several challenges associated
    with UAV deployments in the agricultural sector, including limited flight durations
    (<1 h), small coverage area, high costs, large amounts of imagery data resulting
    from flights, and geometric and radiometric correction issues. Further, UAVs could
    interfere with civilian aircraft and generate safety issues. There are often stringent
    national laws issued by aviation authorities in each country regarding flying
    UAVs. Typically, the only permission granted is for educational or experimental
    purposes. In the United States, the maximum flight altitude is 120 m above ground
    level, and UAVs are not permitted to fly at night. Finally, processing large volumes
    of imagery data requires special skills, time, and software, often demanding the
    use of machine learning, communication technologies, and data repositories. 5.2
    Data transmission, storage, and processing IoT systems must communicate, store,
    and process the data they have acquired. Data transmission is made feasible with
    adequate connectivity. Many parts of the world, including the United States, have
    poor or no broadband and Internet connection. A significant obstacle to IoT applications
    is the access to internet. Presence of agricultural fields in distinct locations
    limits Internet use and other connectivity (Antony et al., 2020). The data collected
    from one agricultural landscape is often not applicable in other areas. Although
    proper storage and security of the collected data are important, the cost of storage
    and further analysis and processing of stored data to develop an inference for
    its application in the fields remains challenging. New technologies, such as Starlink
    (https://www.starlink.com), free TV band/channels, and other communication channels,
    could be exploited to substitute Internet at remote locations. Further, it is
    important to consider human factors when sharing and communicating information
    between farms, regions, and enterprises. 5.3 Data security Security of routing
    protocols is a major challenge in WSNs. Privacy issues in WSNs are either data-oriented
    or context-oriented. The former is largely associated with handling, preserving,
    and integrity of datasets. The latter deals with contextual information like location
    and time (Abbasi et al., 2019). Indeed, data security, anonymity, and privacy
    present both formidable challenges and opportunities to coordinate data transfer,
    availability, and usability securely for both small and large stakeholders. Agricultural
    data can be difficult to mine because of its volume, noise, gaps, and heterogeneity.
    This, however, provides opportunities for data imputation, standardization of
    IoT, integration of multiple domains, and collaborative research in sensor and
    communication technologies (Abbasi et al., 2019; Verdouw et al., 2017). There
    are opportunities for developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through
    new sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remotely sensing vehicles,
    communication technologies, and deep learning methods. 5.4 Application of the
    inferred data IoT provides a foundation for smart logistics, intelligent transportation,
    and affordable agricultural application to address climatic challenges, improve
    resource utilization and efficiency, and increased productivity (Chen & Jin, 2012).
    However, challenges remain in efficient data transmission systems and adaptation
    of outputs by farmers. Indeed, farmers must be technology savvy to understand
    and utilize information. Certain changes may be necessary at farmers’ fields,
    which may incur additional expenses for data collection or processing. Rural farmers
    are often hesitant to adopt new technology. The use of IoT in agriculture is challenging
    due to the complexity of agricultural fields and farming operations. Research
    in IoT is often constrained by short-term funding; thus, limiting data collection
    processes. Antony et al. (2020) reported that 2 to 3 years of funding in the agriculture
    sector is relatively ineffective as plants’ cropping cycle may vary with weather
    conditions. However, the need to feed the growing population has bestowed opportunities
    in utilizing recent advances in IoT (Mahanta et al., 2022) in greenhouse farming,
    vertical farming, hydroponic, and plant phenotyping. Nevertheless, we see a plethora
    of opportunities to utilize WSNs, digital twins, machine learning, and cloud computing
    in soil and crop monitoring, irrigation scheduling, water quality analysis, plant
    breeding, weed control, disease, and pest identification, pesticide spray, reuse
    and recycling of wastes, and livestock management. 6 CONCLUSION This paper reviewed
    the application of different IoT platforms, WSNs, and technologies like UAVs,
    cloud computing, and big data analytics in agricultural production systems and
    value chains, such as crop monitoring, irrigation support, weed and pest control,
    fertilizer application, and soil health assessment. The literature, in general,
    indicates the use of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and machine learning
    in automated and smart irrigation systems and agricultural decision support. Different
    red, green, and blue, hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR sensors could be
    mounted on UAVs for improved agricultural monitoring and forecasting to enable
    highly efficient, qualitative, and profitable farm products. Big data, data mining,
    and real-time analysis show promise to support and improve precision, prescription,
    enterprise, and automated agriculture. Cloud and fog data storage in IoT platforms,
    however, appear to be crucial in managing, transferring, and analyzing big agricultural
    data. This review also reveals opportunities in improving data security, anonymity,
    and usability, and developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through new
    sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remote vehicles, communication
    technologies, and deep learning methods. Overall, IoT can improve production levels,
    cost-effectiveness, product quality, safety, and traceability through innovation,
    automation, and control while advancing the much-needed digital transformation
    of the agricultural sector in the face of climate change. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

    1. Introduction Internet of things (IoT) is a network of physical devices together
    with network components and data analytics tools. The building blocks of IoT such
    as sensors, network tools and software systems are all interconnected to enable
    them to collect, exchange and process data. Due to the recent technological developments,
    the widespread usage of IoT systems is on the rise. According to the predictions
    made by Cisco, there will be 75 billion devices connected to the internet by 2025
    [1]. IoT has a great potential to revolutionize the businesses and society in
    terms of various aspects. For example, different applications of IoT are capable
    of efficiency increments, improvement in the quality of life, and achieving a
    better management. Countless physical devices and objects are mentioned as “Smart”
    devices (e.g., appliances, trash cans, water meters, vending machines). Such devices
    involve contemporary features that are accomplished by utilizing location-based
    technologies and exchanging data with each other ubiquitously. The utilization
    of IoT enables the governments to develop and deploy intelligent technical solutions,
    such as smart transportation systems [2], smart parking [3], smart homes and buildings
    [4], and smart bridges [5]. It is possible to implement IoT based systems in the
    agricultural sector as well. Some examples of these systems are real-time farm
    monitoring, weather prediction and water conservation. Like all of the IoT applications,
    these use cases require sensors, data collection and data processing, which allow
    them to be called examples of “Smart Agriculture (SA)”. Agriculture plays a critical
    role in the growth of the economies of countries and also for the human species
    because it allows production of the main sources of food. It also holds an important
    place in the development of human civilization. According to the United Nation
    Food and Agriculture Organization, 70% more food is needed to feed the additional
    2.3 billion people across the globe by 2050 [6]. Due to the increased demand for
    food, additional effort is put into increasing the efficiency of food production.
    Employing the emerging technologies and techniques in the field of agriculture
    can be considered as one strategy to achieve this. A generic farm monitoring IoT
    system involves deployment of different types of sensors such as environmental
    and soil sensors. Processing of the data collected by IoT sensors like CO2, rain,
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture [7], and plant health information [8] may
    help in developing strategies to achieve improvement in productivity as well as
    economic profit. After being collected, these data are then sent to cloud servers
    through gateways by means of the communication protocol used in the system (Fig.
    1). Download : Download high-res image (441KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. End to end data flow in a smart farm. One of the problems that the farming
    sector is facing today is climate change which results in inefficiencies in the
    weather forecast [9]. As a result, it becomes difficult for farmers to make strategic
    decisions for preventing damages due to uncertain weather changes. It is possible
    to make any emergent decision by using the IoT weather predictive models. In this
    way, farmers can make predictions on the rainfall and control pesticide waste.
    Hence, advanced irrigation and fertigation systems considering environmental parameters
    can be built. It is possible to optimize irrigation water in farms through IoT
    systems. Using the sensors involved in such systems, various data are collected
    and they are stored in a cloud database for generating predictive models. Such
    models may be utilized to forecast weather conditions or water needs of the plants.
    As a result, the risk of throwing excess water to the plants is reduced. This
    brings about reductions in water costs as well as water-related issues. When the
    wireless communication protocols suitable for SA systems are considered, they
    are expected to allow for convenient data transmission between the components
    of the system. As a result, it becomes possible to collect a large amount of data
    from a variety of sensors. These data can then be processed to improve efficiency
    in different aspects such as water saving by means of irrigation optimization
    or yield maximization through fertilizer optimization. The appropriateness of
    a protocol to an SA system may be evaluated considering different parameters such
    as range, power consumption, data transmission rate, and cost, which are provided
    as the most important parameters for wireless communications [10]. Each of these
    protocols have some advantages and disadvantages over others. Therefore, selecting
    the most suitable protocol for a particular SA system is an intensive task. Considering
    the necessities in SA applications, usage of low power wide area network (LPWAN)
    communication protocols is becoming more widespread. The design of LPWAN protocols
    allows for a high number of low-power devices to be distributed over very large
    areas and establish a reliable connection between them. Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN), Sigfox, and Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) can be considered
    as the leading LPWAN technologies [11]. On the other hand, there are some widely
    used non-LPWAN protocols that are Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) and ZigBee. Obviously,
    the wireless link between the components is important and inherent feature of
    SA systems. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the capabilities and the properties
    of the available wireless communication protocols at the design stage of the SA
    systems to fulfill their application-specific requirements. One example may be
    the sensors distributed uniformly over the entire farm. Providing power to these
    sensors and collecting data from them may be an issue especially when the farm
    spans over large areas. The power consumption associated with the communication
    protocol in such sensors is expected to be low while allowing for wireless data
    transmission to remote locations. As can be understood from this example, there
    may be various types of issues related with the SA application and the available
    protocols. Hence, it is essential to evaluate the features of the protocols together
    with the SA system requirements. LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee may
    be considered as key protocols for SA systems because these are either recently
    developed or widely used protocols in SA applications. Also, they require different
    infrastructures and hardware for different level of budgets. Hence, these protocols
    may fulfill the needs of SA systems for various applications. Even though there
    are some other LPWAN protocols (such as MIoTy, NB-Fi, and Weightless) that are
    mentioned in the IoT literature, there no application examples of them in SA domain
    [12,13]. As a result, only these five protocols are involved within the scope
    of this study. As for the SA applications, it was found out that there are six
    major application types commonly mentioned in the relevant literature. These application
    types are water saving, weather forecasting, soil condition monitoring, fertilizer
    optimization, crop disease and pest management, and energy harvesting. Therefore,
    the suitability of the protocols for these application domains is discussed. In
    the next section, existing review studies about SA mentioned, their limitations
    are highlighted, and contributions of this study are provided. That section is
    useful for understanding how this review differs from the existing ones and fills
    the gap in the literature. Since the paper focuses on smart agriculture applications,
    the general architecture of SA systems is introduced in Section 3. The commonly
    used layers in the literature are explained with a focus on the network layer.
    One of the aims of this study is to introduce the features of some wireless communication
    protocols within the context of SA applications. Therefore, in Section 4, such
    information is provided to accomplish this aim. This information involves comparing
    the significant properties of the protocols. Also, some inconsistencies in various
    sources are highlighted. Next in Section 5, requirements of the SA applications
    have been introduced together with some use cases. We believe that clear understanding
    of application-specific requirements and protocol-specific features, which are
    given in Sections 4 and 5, is critical at the design stage of the SA systems.
    So with this study, we also aim to provide an insight for the points to consider
    when designing an SA system. In Section 6, current challenges and limitations
    are provided within the scope of the paper. The future trends are highlighted
    in Section 7 to provide an idea on what protocols may be more common than others.
    We believe that understanding the leading protocol provides useful insight for
    future applications. Finally, the paper is concluded with Section 8. 2. Related
    works 2.1. Literature review and motivation The wireless communication protocols
    are integral and important part of SA applications. This can be verified by the
    fact that they are discussed in some of the relevant review papers. For example,
    LoRaWAN and its potential for smart farming were discussed earlier by Citoni et
    al. [14]. It was stated that LoRaWAN is the most appropriate protocol for IoT
    as it satisfies three main metrics that are energy efficiency, coverage, and scalability.
    In that paper, the focus is given to the features and applications of LoRaWAN.
    Besides, limitations and research challenges of this protocol is provided and
    the associated low data transmission rate is underlined. In another work surveying
    IoT systems about arable farming, four of these key protocols (ZigBee, LoRaWAN,
    Wi-Fi and Sigfox) are said to be relatively common [15]. In that work, the related
    IoT systems are described using three layers: device layer, network layer and
    application layer. Challenges associated with each of these layers are given separately.
    Latency, data rate, wireless link quality and communication range are some of
    the given challenges about the network layer. However, comparison of these protocols
    and their applications are not provided explicitly in the paper. In addition,
    there are numerous review papers involve various applications of IoT in different
    fields of agriculture [[16], [17], [18]]. Yet, they do not explicitly mention
    the communication protocols in these applications. Furthermore, in some other
    previous surveys, properties of the IoT protocols are provided together with their
    example applications [14,15]. However, the inconsistent technical information
    given in different works are underlined in none of the previous review papers.
    Besides, the classification of SA studies based on both their application area
    and the utilized communication protocols are not discussed in detail yet. In addition,
    many aspects of smart farming have been discussed by Farooq et al. [19]. For example,
    topics like cloud computing, big data storage, security issues, farm management
    as well as IoT protocols for SA are covered. The SA application domains were collected
    under three different topics as livestock monitoring, precision farming, and greenhouse
    monitoring. Each topic involves different applications such as weather monitoring,
    pest and crop disease monitoring, irrigation monitoring, and water management.
    Even though the scope of the paper is very wide, the information provided about
    the protocols is quite limited, and their limitations and advantages are not discussed
    for specific application domains. Sinha and Dhanalakshmi made a thorough discussion
    about the important components of IoT in SA including new technologies, data analytics,
    and security issues [20]. The study involves sections about numerous application
    domains like management of water, nutrient, waste, soil, and irrigation. The importance
    of the wireless technologies has been mentioned in the paper, but there is no
    dedicated explanation for the wireless communication protocols for the application
    domains. One survey paper where the reason for inconsistent information in the
    protocol specifications mentioned was written by Foubert and Mitton [10]. In that
    study, they propose a direct selection guide among the long-range wireless protocols
    after introducing their respective properties. The long-range protocols have been
    evaluated under two main categories as mobile band-based and ISM band-based. Even
    though an application example about of agriculture has been demonstrated in the
    paper, the main theme of the paper is not focused on various agricultural applications.
    In addition to research papers, there are numerous whitepapers in which current
    state analysis and future forecasts about smart agriculture market are made. In
    particular, the estimated worth of the SA market for 2021 is reported to be USD
    12.9 billion, and this amount is projected to increase up to USD 20.8 billion
    in 2026 [21]. It has been highlighted that the factors like world population growth
    and loss of arable lands increase the necessity of efficient usage of energy resources
    as well as the technology-supported agricultural production [22]. As a result,
    it is possible to conclude that utilization of energy efficient technologies is
    critical for sustainability of food production in a contemporary way. Besides,
    development of agricultural systems concerning the energy efficiency is important
    for fighting against the serious issues like climate change and global warming.
    In a very recent whitepaper, importance of digital technologies for agriculture
    has been exhaustively presented [23]. According to the whitepaper, the position
    of wireless sensors and networks in agricultural applications is very critical
    and their use is becoming more widespread together with IoT technology. The energy
    consumption issue of wireless sensors has been mentioned and the importance of
    research activities about it is underlined. The increasing number of the SA systems
    and research papers in this field are obvious results of ever increasing human
    population in the world. Due to the large amount of studies published in the domain
    of SA for various applications, it is critical to categorize and analyze the most
    recent publications in this field. In addition, since the data transfer between
    the components of an SA system is commonly accomplished via wireless links, wireless
    communication protocols are important elements of SA systems. Hence, determination
    of most common protocols for specific applications is necessary for making predictions
    on the potential future directions of the related research in SA domain. The protocols
    used in the wireless links are the major factors that affect the overall energy
    efficiency of the system because there is a continuous communication among the
    system components. Thus, evaluation of an SA system in terms of its energy consumption
    requires careful consideration of the wireless communication protocol used within
    the system. Therefore, an exhaustive comparison among the features of the widely
    used wireless communication protocols is necessary for fulfilling the requirements
    of a particular SA systems at the design stage. The motivation of this review
    study is to help the researchers recognize the prospective problems due to the
    limitations of the protocols and their application-specific advantages. 2.2. Research
    gaps and contributions Despite the presence of various review papers about different
    aspects of SA systems, one can confidently claim that there is not a dedicated
    study discussing the features of different wireless communication protocols for
    specific SA applications. In particular, the existing studies either do not mention
    the possible applications of the protocols by comparing them or involve only limited
    number of protocols (See Section 2.1). In this paper, we surveyed a comprehensive
    characterization of these key protocols and discussed their benefits for the future
    SA applications. To find the related papers, year-based search activities were
    performed in three platforms, namely, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar.
    Analysis of annual distribution of the available papers is a common method that
    can be seen in some other review studies [17,24]. The used search terms consisted
    of the name of the protocol together with “smart agriculture” keyword. The related
    search results were inspected manually. There were two main reasons for this manual
    inspection. i) Obviously, the search results contained papers from broad range
    of applications. However, the scope of this study is limited to six major application
    areas (see Section 1). Manual inspection of the search results was required to
    filter out those studies that were not about one of the six application areas.
    ii) In addition, it was observed that the results were not provided in detail
    in some of the conference proceedings. Therefore, such studies were not considered
    as complete work and hence excluded from the survey. Furthermore, the review papers
    within the search results were used as alternative source for finding more studies
    of application scenarios. In other words, the appropriate references given in
    these review papers were explicitly reviewed before being added to the survey.
    We also represent a set of attributes to objectively compare different kinds of
    protocols. Many papers involving an SA application have been carefully investigated
    and it has been found out that some protocols are more common. Therefore, we explored
    the applications in which these protocols are used and categorized them in terms
    of the following key points: • Properties of the protocols used (operating frequency,
    data rate, range, power consumption, security, cost, limitations) • Purpose of
    the application Thus, the main contributions of the paper are the following: 1)When
    a communication protocol is considered, it is expected to find similar technical
    specifications in different resources. However, in the existing studies where
    one of the five communication protocols is used, it was observed that there is
    some inconsistent information about the protocols. This is an undesired situation
    since it may cause confusion at the design stage of SA systems. When the related
    review papers are investigated, no discussion about such inconsistencies have
    been encountered. Therefore, we consider this absence as a research gap, and in
    this study, highlight the inconsistent information found in the literature. This
    is accomplished by collecting most of the features and the corresponding technical
    specifications together and presented in an organized way. For this purpose, two
    tables (Tables 1 and 2) have been generated in Section 4. We believe that these
    tables facilitate the comparison of the technical specifications of these protocols
    and allows for reaching the protocol-specific features in a convenient way. In
    addition, the possible reasons for encountering such inconsistencies are discussed.
    Together with these discussions, the tables may guide the possible researchers
    for selecting the protocol appropriately and allow for reaching the particular
    study for the design details. Table 1. Key Features of Wireless Communication

    the key points above, the appropriateness of a particular protocol to a particular
    SA application is discussed. For this purpose, features offered by the communication
    protocols have been explained (See Section 4) and the requirements for the SA
    applications are provided (See Section 5). 3)The open issues, challenges, and
    future technological trends have been evaluated within the scope of wireless communication
    protocols in SA. In particular, issues related with financial cost, security in
    SA systems, quality of the communication, and hardware optimization are mentioned.
    In addition, promising and popular technologies requiring effective usage of the
    communication protocols are listed as the trending topics such as aerial systems,
    cellular communication, big data analytics, and energy harvesting. 4)To highlight
    the leading protocol and the SA application area, year-based analysis of the existing
    studies has been performed. To achieve this, the papers in the literature are
    categorized considering their application area, the network protocols used and
    the year of publication. For each of the categories, rates of changes in the number
    of publications are calculated. Such an analysis allows for understanding the
    most common protocol as well as the SA application area together with generating
    future projections. 3. The architecture of smart agriculture The IoT systems,
    in general, have architectures based on different layers. However, there is not
    a standard list of layers that is admitted by all the researchers [81]. The differences
    in the various sources are possibly because of the different necessities in the
    applications as well as the naming conventions preferred by the authors. For example,
    a smart city application may have several layers like physical, network, database,
    virtualization, data analytics, cognition, sensing, middleware, and application
    layers [[82], [83], [84]]. Similarly, in papers related to SA, different layers
    are mentioned. However, we decide to include those layers that are common in majority
    of the previous work [[85], [86], [87]]. These layers are the perception layer,
    network layer and application layer and they are detailed in the following subsections
    (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (369KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Layers of a generic smart agriculture system. 3.1. Perception layer
    This is the layer where the real-world integration is performed by collecting
    application-specific data through the sensors. It is constructed of physical objects
    (i.e. sensors and actuators) that can take physical quantities (temperature, humidity,
    wind speed and direction, solar radiation, air quality, etc.), process, store
    and transmit the data, and transform the data into digital control signals. The
    specifications of the hardware involved in this layer need to be determined according
    to the requirements of the application. For example, parameters like sensitivity,
    operating range and resolution of the sensors should be carefully inspected to
    decide if they are suitable for the intended measurement. 3.2. Network layer This
    layer is considered as two different layers namely, the network (or gateway) layer
    and the transport (or transmission) layer by some authors [[88], [89], [90], [91]].
    On the other hand, it is considered as one single layer in some sources [15,19,[25],
    [56], [92], [93], [94]]. This layer makes the connection between the perception
    and application layers. This is the layer where the digital data collected from
    the physical environment is sent to the network gateway for storing them in a
    cloud or a local database. In SA applications, it beneficial to transmit the data
    wirelessly because the distance between the perception layer nodes and the network
    layer receiver is possibly very high. Besides, a wireless link will enable convenient
    and flexible location of the sensor in the field. For these purposes, the wireless
    data transfer between the sensors and the gateway is accomplished through various
    protocols such as LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee. 3.3. Application
    layer It is the layer enabling the user interaction. The data collected at the
    perception layer is made available for the end-user at the application layer.
    This layer provides services by means of a set of IoT protocols (MQTT, XMPP, CoAP,
    RESTFUL, AMQP, etc.) for communicating with the database. This data is visualized
    for user information and possible user intervention. This layer is important for
    distant monitoring of the system related data (real-time or historical) and performing
    required actions remotely. Besides, these tasks requiring access to system data
    should involve authorization control which is accomplished in the application
    layer as well. 4. Wireless communication protocols in smart agriculture Based
    on the range of coverage, the wireless communication protocols can be grouped
    under two main categories as long-range and short-range protocols. Usage of these
    protocols can be determined by considering the conditions and requirements of
    the system [[63], [95], [96]]. Long-range network protocols are capable of transmitting
    data from one device to another over vast distances and some examples are LoRaWAN
    [63], Sigfox [97], and NB-IoT [98]. These protocols are used within SA systems
    that require to connect devices in very large fields. On the other hand, short-range
    network protocols such as Wi-Fi [98] and ZigBee [99] allow data to be transferred
    over shorter distances, and are more appropriate for smaller scaled SA systems.
    Visual comparison of these protocols in terms of range, data rate and energy consumption
    are given in Fig. 3 and they are detailed by describing their technical specifications
    in the following sub-sections. Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Comparison of the wireless communication protocols.
    The power consumption levels are color-coded as shown by the legend on the top
    right side. There exist numerous features of these protocols some of which are
    more significant than others in terms of IoT requirements. For instance, SA applications
    should be able to handle adequate data transfer rate, also have a large range
    of coverage because of the high number of sensors spread over the entire field.
    Besides, it is not practical to provide line power to all of the sensors individually.
    Therefore, the sensors may be powered by batteries and a high replacement interval
    for the batteries is desired. As a result, the total power consumption is another
    key parameter for sensors, which is affected by the power requirement level of
    the communication protocol used. The operating frequency of a protocol is a parameter
    that directly affects the other parameters like data rate, coverage, and energy
    consumption. For example, a high operating frequency is likely to cause more power
    consumption while allowing for a higher data rate. Like most of the systems connected
    to the internet, SA systems are vulnerable to possible cyber-attacks. Hence, ensuring
    the security of the system at all layers is an important issue. The properties
    like power consumption, transmission rate, and coverage are mentioned as the important
    requirements of an IoT communication protocol in the literature [14,96,100]. Considering
    these key features, two different tables are created by collecting information
    from various sources to compare these protocols. The more significant properties
    involving the key features are collected in Table 1 and the other properties that
    are less commonly mentioned in the literature are given in Table 2. As can be
    seen in Tables 1 and 2, different values for some properties of the protocols
    are specified in different sources. For example, the specified range for ZigBee
    changes from 10 m to 120 m according to information collected from different sources
    [14,15,[26], [27], [31], [32], [33], [34]]. Similarly, in eight different sources,
    the minimum and maximum data rates for Sigfox are given in the range between 10
    bps and 1000 bps [15,25,[46], [48], [52], [53], [54], [55]]. The reason for such
    inconsistent information may originate from various causes. For instance, the
    specifications of the hardware used for taking the measurements affect the result.
    Also, the conditions of the medium (like humidity percentage) where the measurements
    are taken have some influence on the observations. Furthermore, licensed frequency
    bands for particular communication protocols in some countries may be different.
    Therefore, even though all other conditions are suitable for achieving a high
    data transmission range, it may be limited by constitutions of Information and
    Communication Technologies (ICT). However, the origin of such inconsistent information
    is mentioned in none of the references in Tables 1 and 2. In a typical SA system,
    large number of sensors are involved and they are expected to communicate with
    the gateway from a distant location. Thus, a higher data rate is needed. In the
    short-range protocols, a solution to achieve larger coverage area is to add more
    network nodes to the system, however it increases the network complexity as well
    as the deployment cost [101]. Among the long-range protocols, Sigfox has the largest
    range but its data rate is about 1/250 times of NB-IoT and 1/50 times of LoRaWAN
    which makes it an improper solution for SA systems. By its second largest range,
    LoRaWAN has a data rate of about 1/5 times smaller than NB-IoT. However, in terms
    of power consumption and cost, LoRaWAN is superior to NB-IoT. 4.1. ZigBee ZigBee
    is a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) communication protocol based on the
    802.15.4 standard. It was developed by ZigBee Alliance and its two major properties
    are being low cost and consuming low power, which make them suitable for home
    automation and networking [102]. ZigBee offers reliability, cost-effectiveness,
    security, low power consumption, 16-bit/64-bit addressing mode, and supports star,
    peer to peer, and cluster tree topologies. It has recently attracted the interest
    of the research community due to such important features and for the deployment
    of wireless sensor networks (WSN) [103]. The usefulness of ZigBee protocol for
    SA was shown in the numerous and diverse applications mentioned in the earlier
    works. In particular, low-power WSN topologies consisting of multiple sensors
    as end-nodes and a router for transmitting the data over larger distances may
    be equipped with ZigBee [19]. For instance, ZigBee-based WSN architectures exist
    for monitoring the temperature of soil and humidity as well as classifying the
    content of the soil moisture using deep learning methods [104]. Since the ZigBee
    hardware is widely available in the market, it is commonly utilized for quick
    prototyping by being attached to microcontroller boards [105] and single board
    computers [106]. Despite its common usage in SA, one major drawback of ZigBee
    is reported to be not having sleep-mode operation [107]. This situation may cause
    inefficient power consumption, which is a key factor for IoT applications. However,
    transition between active and sleep modes can be achieved by appropriate programming
    and hardware. One example can be monitoring of a greenhouse using ZigBee transceiver
    modules where power consumption analysis are performed for two different durations
    of sleep period [108]. Another example usage may be a ZigBee network with mesh
    topology developed for water saving [109]. In that work, the collected soil parameters
    are effectively transmitted to a distance of 75 m where an aggregation node exists
    for processing of the received data. In the context of SA, the main challenge
    with using ZigBee may be the inefficient power consumption and the low range and
    data rate features. Therefore, utilization of this protocol is not appropriate
    when the agricultural land is very large and the distance between the sensor nodes
    is high. Instead, ZigBee is more suitable for small scaled experimental trial
    areas. 4.2. Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is one of the earliest and most commonly used wireless
    technologies with the particularly IEEE 802.11 standard being released in 1997
    [110,111]. It has been recognized as the most promising alternative to the Global
    Positioning System (GPS) for indoor context-aware and location-based services.
    It is mainly used in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) through the use of the
    2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands. Its transmission range may be up to 1 km and
    the minimum data rate is 150 kb/s. As Wi-Fi is commonly available in many indoor
    and outdoor locations, it is considered as the first option for various IoT applications
    of SA like data collection and cloud connection [112] and condition prediction
    by means of data mining [113]. It may also be used together with other protocols
    in an SA system. For example, in a hybrid monitoring architecture for SA environment,
    ZigBee is used in the channels requiring low data transmission while Wi-Fi is
    utilized for the tasks like surveillance video streaming [114]. Nevertheless,
    the power consumption level of Wi-Fi is high for several IoT systems. Therefore,
    utilization of Wi-Fi may not be feasible in all SA systems because the power requirement
    for Wi-Fi is difficult to be satisfied in outdoor locations. To overcome this
    shortcoming, there are studies in which external power is provided through in-field
    photovoltaic solar panels [115]. The appropriateness of solar panel usage was
    shown by constructing a tree-structured WSN where the collected soil and environmental
    data at end nodes are transmitted to central fertigation unit. In addition, the
    power consumed by the nodes was reduced by adjusting the timing configuration
    of the data acquisition and transmission intervals. One alternative scenario in
    which Wi-Fi is utilized can be a smart irrigation system based on soil moisture
    measurements and weather forecasting [116]. This application architecture involves
    establishment of a Wi-Fi link between the sensors in the field and a UAV that
    is used as a water-spraying agent in the system. The weather forecast information
    was fetched from an open weather API and this information was combined with the
    sensor data for spraying water to the field. Even though Wi-Fi protocol is old
    and mature technology, the major limitation is its high-power consumption. Therefore,
    it becomes almost impossible to use this protocol when the hardware cannot be
    connected to main power line. Even though there are some efforts in using solar
    panels, this brings about the installation and maintenance costs. 4.3. Sigfox
    Sigfox is a wireless communication technology that uses ultra-narrowband cellular
    networks therefore it is capable of performing transmission with low data rate.
    The cellular infrastructure allows Sigfox to be used in rural areas thereby making
    it appropriate for IoT and M2M systems [117]. One of the early usages of the Sigfox
    network was a system for localizing livestock in mountain grassland during the
    summer season [118,119]. With the help of Sigfox end-to-end communication, it
    can be possible to divide into various layers namely end layer, backbone layer
    and sensing layer and allow them to interact with each other to provide the application
    services for SA [120]. For example, monitor silo and tank levels, measure the
    temperature of grain stocks, protect remote farmhouses and outbuildings, secure
    gates and deter livestock thieves, optimize colony health with remotely monitored
    beehives, monitor food temperatures along the entire cold chain [121]. A water
    quality monitoring system can be provided as an example application of Sigfox
    in SA [122]. The architecture of this system takes advantage of two key properties
    of Sigfox that are operation with low duty cycle and using ultra narrow band.
    Since the first property results in low power consumption, the system is equipped
    with a solar panel for charging a Li-Po battery thus yielding an off-grid monitoring
    system. Furthermore, bidirectional control mechanism and improved security are
    mentioned as two important features of Sigfox for the monitoring system. The main
    advantage of Sigfox for being deployed in various SA applications is reported
    to be possessing no requirement for additional facilities as well as having high
    coverage in majority of EU countries. In an irrigation management system developed
    recently, both Sigfox and LoRaWAN were used [123]. The system architecture was
    designed for vertical communication to the cloud, meaning that sensors only communicate
    with a local gateway (i.e. do not communicate with each other). The local communication
    was accomplished via LoRaWAN while the collected data at the local gateway is
    transmitted to a cloud server through Sigfox. Despite its very low power consumption
    feature, Sigfox has low data transmission speed. In addition, it uses unlicensed
    ISM band frequencies which is prone to signal inferences and unreliable data transfer
    [10]. This situation may not be suitable for the agricultural applications where
    efficient data transfer is critical. For example, an irrigation control application
    based on continuous monitoring of soil moisture should be obtaining the relevant
    information on time, otherwise over-or under-irrigation situations may be encountered.
    4.4. Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) NB-IoT is considered as the latest radio access
    technology that emerges from Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to enable
    support for IoT devices. NB-IoT provides a number of suitable deployment options
    with a massive coverage range. It coexists with Global System for Mobile Communications
    (GSM) and long-term evolution (LTE) under licensed frequency bands 900 MHz [62]
    and it holds a frequency bandwidth of 200 kHz [79]. It offers long battery life,
    excessive coverage area, low cost and high network security [124]. Two successful
    application examples of NB-IoT in SA can be given as livestock tracking and monitoring
    of environmental parameters in a greenhouse [125]. The architecture of the livestock
    tracker system enables instant reporting of the livestock location together with
    the system parameters such as the battery level. The location information, which
    can be determined via mobile networks or satellite systems, may also be useful
    geo-fencing applications. In the greenhouse monitoring system, the architecture
    contains many sensors to collect and monitor detailed data such as water pH level,
    light intensity and energy consumption. The system can run on batteries and features
    a two-way communication scheme for enabling firmware and software upgrade. The
    properties that make NB-IoT a suitable protocol for various SA systems may be
    extensible coverage, half-duplex communication, flexible power consumption based
    on the mode of operation, and improved security. One other example SA architecture
    in which NB-IoT is utilized can be monitoring of a paddy storage [126]. The humidity
    information in the paddy bags was measured by pin sensors and this information
    is transmitted to a gateway using NB-IoT protocol. It was shown that a 10,000
    mAh lithium polymer battery was able to run the system for 48 h. Even though NB-IoT
    offers higher data rate than Sigfox and LoRaWAN, it uses licensed frequency bands
    which brings about subscription costs to the related system. Another source of
    cost for such a system may be the requirement of hardware upgrade when there is
    an existing LTE infrastructure [10]. In the context of smart agriculture, this
    may be a limitation when the reserved investment costs are not high enough to
    afford these costs. 4.5. Long-Range wireless area network (LoRaWAN) LoRaWAN refers
    to a network layer protocol created by the LoRa Alliance and runs on LoRa chips.
    It uses the advantages of LoRa modulation to create networks, and it is focused
    on the IoT paradigm. LoRaWAN uses a star topology where the nodes, collect the
    sensor data and send it to the gateways. The gateways convert these data to a
    form that can be transferred via internet protocol (IP) and then forward it to
    a remote application server through the Internet. It has been specifically designed
    for IoT applications to connect a huge number of sensors, and appliances over
    a network spanning large areas. The LoRaWAN architecture can be divided into two
    parts as front-end and back-end [95,127]. Gateway elements and end-node devices
    constitute the front-end part. On the other hand, the critical tasks like security
    assurance, data storage and query scheduling are performed by the network servers
    that are involved in the back-end part [128]. LoRaWAN is widely used in smart
    city applications because such applications require wide network coverage; however,
    its usage in other social aspects is getting more widespread. The investments
    for LoRaWAN infrastructure by governments and private operators started to be
    realized in the last four years in different countries [129]. LoRaWAN is commonly
    utilized in variety of SA application areas including weather forecasting [130],
    irrigation control and farm monitoring [14]. One notable feature of LoRaWAN is
    low power consumption, which makes it an ideal choice for SA systems. In the presence
    of solar-based energy harvesting capability, it was experimentally shown that
    the estimated battery lifetime of a LoRaWAN unit may be six times of a Wi-Fi unit
    and two times of a ZigBee unit [33]. An IoT architecture having dynamic number
    of layers for different application and computation scenarios was proposed earlier
    [131]. This dynamic structure was shown to be appropriate for various smart systems
    including SA. Experiments with different scales of SA were performed and it was
    reported that a message traffic of 1500 messages/minute can be handled by LoRaWAN
    protocol. In another LoRaWAN-based SA architecture, a middleware layer exists
    at the center and this layer improves scalability of the system by allowing various
    modules be attached to it [132]. Ease of deployment and modularity features of
    LoRaWAN were provided as the leading reasons for using this protocol. Reliable
    data transmission was observed during the field experiments performed for three
    months. Like Sigfox, LoRaWAN uses unlicensed bands and has the same security issues.
    In addition, it is known that LoRaWAN has a poor performance when direct line
    of sight is not available between the transmitting and receiving modules [10].
    This situation may be a major drawback for those SA systems deployed in rural
    areas with uneven terrains. 5. Wireless communication protocols used in various
    smart agriculture applications The developing nations have majority of their Gross
    Domestic Product (GDP) dependent on agriculture [133]. Agricultural activity extends
    from crop cultivation (farming), timber to livestock rearing for domestic consumption
    or economic purposes as raw materials to other activities. It is expected that
    there will be a vast food crisis in the near future because the estimated world
    population for 2050 is 9.7 billion [134]. To overcome this situation, investments
    in the development and deployment of IoT systems particularly in farm automation
    and SA have been increased. Even though there is a diverse range of applications
    of IoT in agriculture, the most common ones may be listed as follows: 1) Automated
    irrigation systems for saving water and time [135,136]. 2) Collection of environmental
    data for weather condition forecasting [137]. 3) Soil condition monitoring for
    yield maximization [[138], [139], [140]]. 4) Crop monitoring to reduce costs [141].
    5) Pest management for preventing diseases [142,143]. 6) Utilization of renewable
    energy sources for cost minimization and sustainability [144,145]. There are numerous
    research activities in each of these fields and in the following subsections,
    the related works are collected according to their area of applications. The relevant
    references in which the utilized communication protocol is explicitly provided
    are summarized in Table 3. It should also be noted that only the studies published
    since 2015 are included in Table III. Table 3. Wireless Communication Protocols

    efficiency of food production requires precise amount of irrigation in agriculture;
    however, the increment in the need for water eventually results in the relevant
    risk of its scarceness. It is also known that 70% of the freshwater in the world
    is required for irrigation of agricultural plants [384,385]. Therefore, efficient
    usage of the water resources is a critical task. To avoid decrements in the yield
    amount due to water stress, the farmers generally tend to apply extra water. Obviously,
    this situation will have a negative impact on the productivity while consuming
    extra water and energy than needed. Besides, over-irrigation may cause some water-related
    diseases as well. Thus, in turn, SA makes it possible to use optimal amount of
    water, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation. Simultaneous accomplishment of
    three key properties that are increasing crop yield, decreasing costs, and maintaining
    environmental sustainability has been the focus of the project “smart water management
    platform” (SWAMP). Development and performance assessment for hands-on applications
    of precision irrigation within this project were performed in four pilot areas
    in three different countries namely, Brazil, Italy and Spain [386]. FIWARE, an
    EU-funded IoT project in which solution libraries for smart applications [387]
    and precision irrigation [388], forms the basis of SWAMP project. It also has
    some common features with alternative smart agriculture initiatives such as “Flexible
    and Precise Irrigation Platform to Improve Farm Scale Water Productivity” (FIGARO)
    project [389] that aims at improving water efficiency while minimizing costs through
    a smart irrigation management platform. In order to outline the challenges and
    constraints of deployment of such IoT based large-scale pilots, Brewster et al.
    discuss several issues including technological and connectivity problems. They
    indicate that LPWAN technologies (such as LoRaWAN and SigFox) may be useful to
    overcome the issues related to coverage [390]. The majority of the studies collect
    and utilize environmental and weather related data such as temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and water level [234]. Among the studies concerning water savings,
    Andre et al. developed an irrigation system to optimize the irrigation timings
    [235]. This system is based on WSN for real-time collection of environmental data
    and LoRaWAN is suggested as the suitable protocol for the system. Another way
    to save irrigation water is to apply water locally to the required parts of the
    fields. A rule-based method is developed by Masaba et al. in which the dry parts
    of the field are determined via temperature, humidity and soil moisture readings
    [391]. This system utilizes BLE technology to establish connection between the
    sensor nodes at locations with no internet connection. Noha Kamal et al. design
    an IoT based water quality monitoring system for continuously measuring some parameters
    such as pH, turbidity, and temperature of River Nile [173]. The system is said
    to be suitable for deployment in irrigation canals of River Nile for optimal irrigation.
    Besides, the cloud connection of the system is established using Wi-Fi and extension
    for GSM protocols are suggested as future work. As an example application of livestock
    management, Tanumihardja et al. designed a monitoring system for observing water
    level in troughs. The system employs a WSN that uses LoRaWAN as the wireless communication
    protocol [236]. It allows cattlemen to monitor their trough ubiquitously via mobile
    devices. A Raspberry Pi single board computer was used as a gateway to send the
    data to the server. Since the potential users of the system (i.e. the cattlemen)
    have possibly minimal familiarity with technological devices, it is designed to
    be self-configuring. To achieve low power consumption and remote access requirements,
    ATMega-based microcontrollers are in the sensor nodes that contain float switch
    sensors to measure the water level. 5.2. Weather forecasting and data analytics
    Measuring and monitoring the weather-related parameters is an important task in
    agriculture since sunlight and rainwater are critical for photosynthesis and hydration
    of the plants. Hence, plant growth highly depends on the weather conditions. The
    unpredictable weather is one of the causes of the problems encountered by the
    farmers that eventually results in reduction of production and profit. Thanks
    to novel data analytics methods, it is possible to perform weather forecast by
    using historical weather data. As a result, it becomes possible for the farmers
    to get prepared for various unwanted cases such as pesticide poisoning or irrigation
    just before the rain. For example, if the measured soil moisture is at a level
    which an irrigation activity is required and a rainfall is expected in a short
    time period, then the farmer may choose not to initialize the irrigation. One
    reason for performing weather forecasting or soil condition prediction is to achieve
    water savings. Various smart irrigation frameworks are developed by means of soil
    moisture [392] or soil water requirement [146] prediction to manage the irrigation
    scheduling. Fraga et al. described a smart irrigation system that addresses limitations
    of urban areas such as not having direct access to the internet or electric grid
    [130]. They propose an architecture based on LoRaWAN to make communication with
    sensors and fog nodes. Eventually, optimal irrigation schedule and weather forecasting
    tasks are accomplished. Predicting a future value generally requires utilization
    of some machine learning methods [278]. Braga et al. make use of gradient boosting,
    random forest and deep learning to forecast evapotranspiration, a measure of water
    loss from the plant [393]. Another method based on support vector regression and
    k-means clustering is developed for prediction of soil moisture changes as a response
    to the weather conditions [289]. Even though the majority of the studies about
    forecasting uses LoRaWAN, there are other works based on the other communication
    protocols such as ZigBee [394], BLE [395], and Sigfox [396]. 5.3. Monitoring of
    soil moisture, mineral and pH levels The plants need water as a vital resource
    to live, grow, and reproduce. The water requirement of the different plant species
    may vary from one another. One common way to identify the water requirement of
    a particular plant is attachment of a sensor for measuring the soil moisture and
    the water content in the neighboring area [[397], [398], [399], [400]]. Such a
    measurement enables the farmer be informed about the water content and hence be
    able to determine if an intervention is necessary. In addition, actuators (e.g.
    solenoid valves) can be automatically controlled by programming electronic hardware
    to which the sensors are connected [243]. If a low humidity level is detected
    by the moisture sensor, this data is processed and sent to the solenoid module
    as a control signal to provide the necessary water automatically. Potential of
    hydrogen (pH) is a measure affected by the amount of different minerals present
    in the soil. Some examples of these minerals are nitrogen, potassium, calcium,
    iron, and sulfur where nitrogen and potassium being important minerals for the
    growth of the plant [401]. The pH level changes between 1 and 14 where increment
    in pH value indicates transition from high acidity to high alkalinity. The range
    of pH between 5.5 and 7.5 is said to be optimum for most plants for a proper growth
    [402]. ZigBee is one of the commonly utilized protocols particularly in the systems
    involving soil moisture sensing [403] and environmental data together with pH
    levels [297]. However, LoRaWAN is used in a WSN irrigation system in conjunction
    with aerial image processing where data transfer over longer distances is required.
    The system is intended for monitoring of agricultural parameters in cacao crops
    by providing information about weather, ground conditions, and water flow and
    pressure through a mobile application [330]. Monitoring of soil characteristics
    including pH level and data transfer over short distances via Bluetooth is another
    alternative solution for such applications [404]. 5.4. Fertilizer optimization
    Fertilizer can be defined as the substance containing key nutrients for plant
    growth. These nutrients may be important for particular parts of the plants. For
    example, nitrogen contributes to leaves; phosphorus is critical for root, flowers
    and fruit; and potassium is important for water movement through the stems [405].
    Any lack or abundance of nutrients may lead to serious undesired effects on the
    plants. Therefore, applying correct type of fertilizers in optimal amounts is
    important since their uncontrolled usage may cause imbalance in soil nutrient
    levels. This situation may also contribute to climate change by triggering deforestation
    [120,406]. Nevertheless, an efficient fertilization practice requires determination
    of missing nutrients, fertilizer amount to be applied, and appropriate place for
    fertilization [407]. Satisfaction of these requirements needs to be done carefully
    and for this purpose, special fertilization methods using IoT have been proposed
    in the recent years. The latest IoT applications for fertilization systems aim
    at automatic prediction of the areas with lack of nutrients in the fields [310].
    Such a system allows for optimal usage of fertilizer resources by offering the
    possibility of consuming the fertilizer only on the required locations in the
    field. This optimization can be further improved by combining the fertilization
    process with the irrigation system [151,[408], [409], [410]]. Utilization of other
    technologies is possible in the fertilization systems. In particular, images collected
    through UAVs or remote sensing are useful for calculation of the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) that reflects important measures like crop health, vegetation
    amount and nutrients in the soil [29,411,412]. Hence, they allow for location-based
    determination of fertilizer requirements. Recently, NB-IoT protocol for smart
    fertigation is utilized in a tomato greenhouse [227]. The related system design
    involves integration of irrigation and fertilization. The required amount of fertigation
    is automatically determined according to instantaneous greenhouse data. Eventually,
    yield increment, as well as water and fertilizer usage improvement, are achieved.
    In a relatively older work, several issues such as irrigation, fertilization and
    management are addressed particularly in citrus cultivation. The related project
    is based on measurement of citrus soil moisture and nutrients using ZigBee to
    develop a system in which fertilization and irrigation are automated and integrated
    [88]. 5.5. Crop disease and pest management Like inappropriate amount of water
    or nutrients in the soil, pests are one of the other factors having impact on
    the crop yield quantity and quality. In particular, pests may cause diseases and
    hence, prevent the plant from a healthy and productive lifecycle. Therefore, timely
    detection of the threats caused by the pests is important for minimizing the crop
    loss. This detection process can be accomplished by IoT systems in which the data
    collected by the sensors is processed appropriately for pest detection. One successful
    application can be provided as usage of satellite imagery [413] or UAV systems
    [414] for determining the location-based health status of the crops in the large
    fields. Additionally, smart traps successful applications of IoT-based pest management
    because they are capable of capturing, counting and identifying the insects automatically
    [415,416]. Optimal usage of insecticides is another important issue under this
    topic because their inappropriate usage may not provide complete prevention or
    may be harmful to the plant while killing the pests. In an earlier work, a disease
    and pest prediction system, which aims to warn the farmer when there is a risk
    of pest attack, was developed [417]. This system was tested by collecting numerous
    environmental data in an orchard and it can be helpful for applying appropriate
    amounts of insecticides on time. An infection prediction method is developed as
    a part of an integrated smart farm management system [355]. The system involves
    a network framework in which a reliable communication between the IoT devices
    is ensured through LoRaWAN protocol. The prediction algorithm is tested on strawberry
    cultivation as a part of the system for estimating the occurrence frequency of
    pests infecting crops. In another work developed for pest prevention in potato
    plants, climate data collected through low-cost sensors placed inside the farms
    is processed to generate a decision support system [347]. ZigBee protocol is used
    by the sensors for wireless communication within the system. Furthermore, an early
    monitoring and control system against epidemic diseases in potato and tomato crops
    is proposed [418]. Such kind of system provides environmental monitoring data
    that maintain the growth of crops and predicts the conditions that lead to epidemic
    disease appearance. Since a typical agricultural area is very wide, the developers
    preferred to use cellular services due to its relatively long-range and robust
    wireless communication links. The system is proven to be efficient in optimizing
    the total amount of applied chemicals and improving the quality of crops. On the
    other hand, image-based disease detection systems exist. In one of such works,
    the detection system utilizes image compression methods to decrease the total
    data sent to the cloud. The detection algorithm is based on segmentation methods
    together with support vector machines (SVM). The hardware part of the system involves
    Raspberry Pi as the single board computer, and the built-in Wi-Fi module is used
    to establish the cloud connection [351]. 5.6. Energy harvesting IoT devices and
    sensors are intended to work in distant areas where the line power is not readily
    available most of the time. This case is true for particularly SA systems. Besides,
    usage of batteries is not feasible because regular replacement or recharging of
    the batteries are required. Therefore, alternative methods for supplying power
    to such components need to be clearly defined. Some of the methods for providing
    power to IoT hardware include extracting energy from environment through specific
    circuitry. These methods utilize various aspects such as vibration [419], thermal
    energy [420], radio frequency [421], and solar energy [422]. Even though the majority
    of the previous studies on energy harvesting in SA systems are related with solar
    energy [190,423,424], some other works based on radio frequency are present [425].
    Among the systems that utilize solar energy, LoRaWAN and ZigBee are the commonly
    used protocols. A prototype device including a solar panel is designed and manufactured
    in order to collect and transmit data in a SA system [378]. The device uses LoRaWAN
    protocol for communicating with other components in the farming system. This work
    investigates the limitations of LoRaWAN and determines some network parameters
    like data rate and latency. In another work, sensor nodes are powered with solar
    energy to take measurements from the environment and ZigBee protocol is used for
    communication between the nodes [145]. The performance of the solar-powered sensor
    node is compared with a non-solar one. It is shown that utilization of solar power
    increases the battery lifetime. Solar energy is also used for battery charging
    purposes in SA systems to use that energy at a later time when the available energy
    is limited [361]. Lifetime of a WSN is maximized by addressing the related issues
    such as unstable energy harvesting and low panel conversion efficiency. Validation
    of the system is performed via a simulation environment in which 20 sensor nodes
    are placed and their communication is established with ZigBee protocol. The simulation
    results show that the lifetime of the sensor node as well as network throughput
    increases with the system. 6. Open issues and challenges Deployment of SA systems
    with various scales are facing with various challenges that need to be overcome
    for efficient utilization of the technology in the future systems. Regardless
    of the raise that IoT has achieved over the last few years, various theoretical
    and practical challenges restrict its proper management and performance. These
    challenges are given in detail in the remaining part of this section. 6.1. Cost
    Some of the cost issues can be specific for SA while others are related with general
    IoT systems. For example, sensors and gateways in an SA system may be expected
    to operate in harsh outdoor conditions in general. This situation will bring about
    extra concerns and costs about their manufacturing. In particular, some electronic
    equipment may require being water and dust resistant by fulfilling standards like
    IP68. Other than the manufacturing costs, IoT components such as sensors, gateways
    and base station infrastructure may constitute majority of the hardware cost related
    with communication systems. This specific communication hardware is expected to
    meet the system requirements which directly affects the cost. In order to preserve
    the reliable operation of the SA system over longer durations, maintenance must
    be performed on a regular basis. Therefore, the maintenance costs need to be considered
    during the feasibility studies before the deployment. Besides, one other source
    of operational costs may be the necessity of subscriptions. For example, NB-IoT
    protocol operates at licensed cellular frequency bands. This necessitates usage
    of service provider infrastructure and dedicated hardware both of which increase
    the deployment and operational costs. However, other protocols operating at unlicensed
    frequency bands do not have such drawbacks about the cost. One final source of
    the cost may be due to the large amount of data generated. Obviously, collection,
    transmission, and storage of the system data in a reliable way is critical for
    efficient operation of SA systems. Furthermore, processing the data for making
    smart decisions to increase the yield requires usage of server computers with
    high computational power. Most of the times, this is accomplished by a paid subscription
    to a cloud server provider. The type of the subscription needs to be decided concerning
    the communication protocol used by the IoT system in the farm. The reason for
    such a concern is the maximum data rate offered by the protocols are different
    and at the same time, allowed download/upload limits depend on the type of the
    subscription. As a result, these limits should be consistent between the protocol
    and the subscription to ensure an effective and reliable data transfer. 6.2. System
    security The gaps in the security system may cause several consequences like permanent
    loss of data and modification of data so that its reliability becomes debatable.
    On the other hand, unauthorized access to the secure data can result in privacy
    issues and eventually yield a reduced confidence in the customers. As a result,
    SA companies may be financially affected by the lack of security in their cyber
    systems. In addition, one other serious threat may be the access of the third
    parties to the in-field physical devices. The device control being captured by
    the attackers may cause loss of the crops or plants if inappropriate treatment
    of necessary elements are applied in an uncontrolled way [[426], [427], [428]].
    One major factor that increase the vulnerability of an SA system is having hardware
    components with limited computation and memory features. Therefore, it becomes
    infeasible to run complex attack-prevention algorithms as well as cryptographic
    algorithms on these devices [29]. There are different criteria that can be used
    for classification of vulnerabilities and risks in an IoT system, or more specifically
    in an SA system. One strategy for categorization of the treats may be considering
    the security issues in each of the layers of an SA system. Since the devices and
    protocols used in each layer is different, it is obvious that vulnerabilities
    associated with these layers require specific attention [429]. On the other hand,
    issues and limitations related with software and hardware of the IoT components
    may be source of the vulnerabilities [430]. In particular, the source of the vulnerability
    may be originating from the encryption standard used by the wireless communication
    protocol as well. For example, old version of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) security
    standard is a well-known source of vulnerability. In a ZigBee network, the attacks
    may be targeting different layers of the communication. Adding malicious contents
    by eavesdropping on the radio channel or overwriting the memories of the nodes
    by adding a malicious node to the network can be given as two possible threats
    in a ZigBee network [431]. On the other hand, LPWAN technologies are reported
    to be vulnerable to threats like packet forging and replay attacks [432]. These
    issues are known to be originating from message integrity code (MIC) or sequence
    number (SN) protected by message authentication code (MAC) being short, which
    may eventually result in denial of service (DoS) or message injection. In general,
    overall vulnerability of IoT systems is caused by the lack of compliance with
    the security standards or security recommendations made by the official authorities.
    It should also be underlined that the responsible behavior of all entities in
    production and supply chain is required for a complete security assurance in IoT
    systems. Unethical behavior of any entity (e.g. a non-standard manufacturing for
    cost saving) may hurt the security [433,434]. The risk of being cyber-attacked
    increases together with the level of vulnerability. Nowadays, the cyber-attack
    incidents are progressing in the agriculture sector due to excessive usage of
    digital devices that are continuously connected to the internet. The consequences
    of cyber-attacks in agricultural sector may cause human-related or financial problems.
    Some of the many examples can be given as disruption of delivery, snatching of
    private data such as confidential formulations and demographic information of
    the employees [435]. One strategy to enhance cybersecurity and mitigate the risks
    in SA is to utilize blockchain technology which allows shared control of a distributed
    ledger in a decentralized network [436]. The blockchain applications may be useful
    in an SA ecosystem by means of recording and tracking of the entire food production
    process [437]. By securing the details of the production steps such as breeding,
    fertilizing, processing, transporting, and warehousing, it becomes possible to
    provide confidence, ensure compliance with standards and resolve the possible
    problems. 6.3. Communication quality Ensuring an uninterrupted communication in
    an SA system is important because sensor data should be collected consistently
    for a reliable smart decision system. Besides, status of the in-field actuators
    need to be checked and monitored continuously to prevent undesired situations.
    For example, monitoring of the status of a solenoid valve is important for preventing
    flood or over-irrigation situations. There are various factors affecting the quality
    of wireless communication in SA applications as the components are expected to
    operate under outdoor conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the hardware
    from being damaged by the weather events like rainfall and wind. Even though the
    protection unit increases the deployment cost of the system, this will not only
    reduce the maintenance costs but also contribute to the quality of the communication
    in longer times. One other factor constituting a risk for communication quality
    is interference, which can be defined as distortion of a useful signal by some
    other signal. Therefore, an ambient containing numerous different signals simultaneously
    is prone to interference. In a smart farm equipped with many wireless sensor nodes
    as well as gateways, the possibility of interference is high and this situation
    is an obvious challenge for a reliable communication. The risk of interference
    is higher for the protocols using unlicensed frequency bands such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Sigfox, and LoRaWAN. On the other hand, the protocols like 5G and NB-IoT that
    use cellular networks with licensed frequency spectrum have lower possibility
    of interference. However, utilization of these systems require extra costs for
    hardware infrastructure and subscription [52]. 6.4. System design and hardware
    optimization Any redundant hardware will increase the investment as well as the
    maintenance costs in a system, eventually yielding profit decrement in the agricultural
    sector. Therefore, it takes a careful design process to determine the number and
    type of the sensors together with the gateways in an SA system. The system design
    and the protocol to be used are mutually affected by the parameters like the distance
    between sensors, total data transmission rate over the wireless links, and the
    power consumption at the sensor nodes. Obviously, this is a complicated optimization
    problem where many constraints should be taken into consideration. 7. Future Trends
    In the SA systems, collective utilization of various technologies is emerging.
    This situation is observable in the recent publications about SA and IoT. In the
    following subsections, the expected future trends in SA applications are elaborated
    by mentioning the technologies for data collection, data processing, and data
    transmission. 7.1. Aerial systems and satellite communications The sky-level observation
    of the agricultural fields has been made possible by the developments in the aerial
    technology. Since such observations allow for larger areas of the field to be
    inspectable simultaneously, various contemporary applications utilizing aerial
    systems have emerged in the last decade. While the earlier efforts in this domain
    focused on simple tasks like remote monitoring and observation [438,439], later
    applications involve more sensitive measurements such as crop yield mapping [440],
    pest management [441], vegetation index calculation [442]. The agricultural data
    collected at high altitudes primarily contain the images or videos of the field
    as well as the GPS-based coordinate information. These images may be regular RGB,
    thermal, infrared, multispectral, or hyperspectral images depending on the type
    of the application. Therefore, processing of these data in a collaborative manner
    to perform a specific task can be considered as a promising research area. The
    aerial data collection from the fields may be performed through different means
    among which UAVs [24,443] and airships [444] are common. These vehicles may be
    operated either manually by a remote control or automatically by loading specific
    missions to the vehicle. In both cases, wireless data transmission between the
    vehicle and the ground station or the satellite systems may be required. In the
    manual operation, the control signals are received from the remote control used
    by an operator. This means that the vehicle needs to be inside the coverage region
    of the remote control during the entire operation. Whereas in the autonomous operation
    mode, the location of the vehicle is typically controlled by the GPS signals which
    require an active communication with the related satellites. Therefore, it can
    be understood that a wireless link to a reference device is crucial for a reliable
    operation of the aerial vehicles. The features like controlling the vehicle over
    vast distances or maintaining a safe flight in case of an interruption in the
    GPS signal can be considered as important future applications under this topic.
    Besides, it was recently reported that a multi-UAV system may be more efficient
    than a single UAV in accomplishing multiple tasks [445]. Therefore, a real-time
    wireless communication between the UAVs should be established and maintained to
    ensure a high degree of coordination in the system. Since the UAVs are expected
    to move in a collaborative manner, an ad-hoc networking architecture is expected
    to be developed for such systems. Despite some recently proposed ad-hoc architectures
    for routing data packets among the UAVs, design of multi-UAV communication systems
    is very critical for future applications. Satellite imagery can be considered
    as another solution for agricultural monitoring and data collection. The availability
    of very high resolution (VHR) and near-infrared (NIR) images make it possible
    to improve agricultural practice through weed and pest detection, yield calculation
    and irrigation planning [[446], [447], [448]]. Even though this technology does
    not require a vehicle to fly over the field, the access to a satellite may require
    a higher overall budget. Advantages of aerial systems are unquestionable in the
    challenging environmental conditions of SA practices. With their properties like
    easy operation and high mobility, aerial systems can contribute to high-quality
    data collection, system scalability, and eventually increments in profit. 7.2.
    Fifth generation cellular communications With the emergence of fifth generation
    (5 G) cellular communication technology, it has now become possible to provide
    fast and reliable internet connection to components of SA systems. As a result,
    smart farm requirements like large amount of data exchange, low energy consumption
    and, wide coverage can be satisfied by utilization of 5G. It is also worth mentioning
    that the existing cellular network availability in rural regions is very limited.
    This problem is addressed by deploying 5 G infrastructure in the rural areas and
    hence, performing labor-intensive tasks like planting, harvesting, fertilization
    and irrigation with minimal manual intervention [449]. Accomplishment of such
    tasks requires usage of 5 G remote sensors allowing seamless data transfer which
    enables continuous monitoring, data collection and control [450]. As the future
    applications of 5 G in SA increase, the volume and variety of agricultural data
    will increase which eventually push research activities on big data analytics
    methods. Besides, the possibility of connecting the individual farms will allow
    for efficient usage of resources by managing the smart farms in a collaborative
    manner. Another impact can be the reduction in the need for human labor force
    because accurate crop inspections can be performed through 5 G supported systems.
    One area of wireless communication commonly mentioned together with 5 G technology
    is machine-type communications (MTC) in which the data transmission between the
    sensors and IoT appliances is performed with no human intervention. Provided that
    the system is initially designed for MTC requirements then 5 G may be a suitable
    solution as it allows for reliable communication in remote areas which is usually
    the case in SA [451,452]. Besides, MTC can be used suitably with Sigfox [453]
    and NB-IoT [454], which are known to be suitable LPWAN protocols in SA. 7.3. Big
    data analytics, cloud and edge computing Enhancement of crop quality and quantity
    requires continuous collection of in-field data and monitoring of the plant status.
    Therefore, from the initial sowing and cultivation phase until reaching to the
    final consumer, various types of data are collected in the domain of SA. As a
    result, the total amount of data with various types becomes very large. Descriptive
    data such as chemical attributes of the soil, satellite imagery reflecting the
    physical characteristics of the farming area, aerial images collected using UAVs,
    and structured data from IoT sensors are some examples of these data [455]. This
    type of data is typically named as big data, which requires specific hardware
    and methodologies for being processed. The clustering and classification methods
    as well as rule based learning methods are some of the strategies useful in processing
    of big data [456]. Particularly, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector
    machines (SVM), discriminant analysis and decision trees are reported to be useful
    methods for this purpose [457,458]. However, these algorithms cannot be executed
    on regular computers. Due to the large amount of data, this processing should
    be performed on distant cloud computers having suitable hardware to handle the
    big agricultural data [459]. This situation can be considered as another pushing
    factor for the emergence of fast and reliable communications protocols being used
    in SA because transmission of the big data to the cloud computers is infeasible
    with slow internet technologies with small coverage. The concept of edge computing
    is worth discussion at this point because it mainly aims at reduction in the total
    amount of transmitted data to the cloud. In other words, it becomes possible to
    save bandwidth by reducing the network traffic. This is accomplished by pre-processing
    the collected agricultural data at local edge devices before being transmitted
    to the distant cloud computers. The pre-processing computation performed at edge
    devices, namely edge computing, outputs the required data for the cloud computing.
    Therefore, only the data necessary for cloud computing is transmitted through
    the network. The steps of edge computing may involve different data compression
    or dimensionality reduction methods to decrease the amount of data. Since the
    computational load of edge computing is not as high as cloud computing, the edge
    devices may be hardware with limited computational capabilities such as single
    board computers or microcontroller boards. Edge computing has high potential for
    contributing SA in various domains such as increased crop production, farm security,
    and food supply chain. However, services based on edge and cloud computing are
    not mature enough for being adopted in SA [460]. 7.4. Infrastructure for LPWAN
    technologies The LPWAN protocols operating at licensed frequencies require installation
    of relevant infrastructure for being used actively. In addition to their main
    features like low power consumption and having wide range, they offer more reliable
    data transfer, which is a critical feature for SA systems. Among them, NB-IoT
    can be noted as an emerging technology as the investments made by industry as
    well as interest from the academia to NB-IoT are on the rise [120]. As a result,
    increments in the studies for widening the coverage of LPWAN protocols are expected
    in the near future. On the other hand, the major limitations of short-range protocols
    such as power consumption and coverage are the issues addressed by LPWAN technologies.
    LoRaWAN protocol contributes to LPWAN technologies by providing additional advantages
    such as scalability and security for SA systems [461]. Since the required infrastructure
    for LoRaWAN is relatively simpler than NB-IoT, the related hardware is easier
    to install and use. 7.5. Efficiency in energy harvesting and consumption Since
    the majority of SA components are required to operate in remote areas, most of
    the time, it is neither possible nor feasible to provide on-grid power to all
    elements of an SA system. The efforts for finding a solution to this situation
    have concentrated on two main topics that are (i) minimization of power consumption
    in IoT devices, and (ii) energy harvesting from environmental conditions. Low
    power consumption can be achieved by optimizing the circuit design of the sensors
    for application-specific purposes. In addition, frequency and duration of sleep
    mode operation may be adjusted for efficient energy consumption. Furthermore,
    development of dedicated communication protocols consuming reduced power during
    data transmission is another topic that may be important for future applications.
    However, in general, such protocols achieve reduction in power consumption at
    a burden of smaller overhead thereby resulting in a decreased security and reliability.
    On the other hand, utilization of renewable energy sources, particularly solar
    energy, is expected to be more widespread because they provide off-gird energy
    to the system. One limitation of photovoltaic systems may be the lack of energy
    generation during nighttime and cloudy weather. Therefore, advancements in the
    energy storage technology, as well as the smart gird systems for efficient utilization
    of energy in a collaborative manner, may be expected in the future. 7.6. Protocols
    and application areas In the current state of SA applications, most of the studies
    are small scaled examples that contain testing of different communication protocols
    and IoT hardware. Thus, it is necessary to deploy large-scaled systems to be able
    to evaluate the usefulness and generate feedback information for future development
    of practical SA systems [390]. The fast-evolving technological aspects have an
    impact on changing our daily habits by making various possibilities to emerge
    during the years while causing some others to lose their importance and popularity.
    A similar situation is true for the application areas and the utilized communication
    protocols in SA systems. To support this statement, various distributions of the
    papers in Table 3 are investigated. These distributions are generated by categorizing
    the papers according to their publication year in addition to the area of application
    and the utilized communication protocol. As a result, it became possible to understand
    which communication protocol and which application area are emerging in the recent
    years. In other words, these distributions allow for highlighting not only the
    most common application areas and protocols but also how their domination change
    over the years. Thus, it becomes possible to generate a future perspective using
    the current trends in SA. For this purpose, two pie charts and two 3D bar graphs
    are generated. Specifically, the charts in Figs. 4 and 5 show the percentage of
    papers utilizing the specified protocols and their application areas, respectively.
    More detailed year-based distributions, which are useful for understanding the
    trends, are provided by the bar graphs in Figs. 6 and 7. Download : Download high-res

    to application areas. It is clear from Fig. 4 that Wi-Fi is the mostly used protocol
    and it is followed by LoRaWAN and ZigBee. Majority of the studies use these protocols
    whereas the percentages of the other two protocols (Sigfox and NB-IoT) are about
    1/10 times of these dominating ones. Besides, more than 60% of the studies in
    the literature are about either water saving or soil condition monitoring. The
    next popular application area is energy harvesting, yet its percentage is around
    half of soil condition monitoring as can be seen in Fig. 5. The annual distribution
    of total number of studies has an increasing trend (Figs. 6 and 7). When the protocol-specific
    distribution in Fig. 6 is inspected, it may be seen that ZigBee is present in
    all years, and Wi-Fi and LoRaWAN are absent in only one of the years. However,
    total number of usages for ZigBee and Wi-Fi decrease in 2018 and 2019. On the
    other hand, LoRaWAN can be seen as an emerging protocol as its usage increased
    in the last five years. Other LPWAN protocols, Sigfox and NB-IoT, appear only
    in recent years with a very limited number of usages. The application-specific
    distribution in Fig. 7 shows that number of soil condition monitoring applications
    increases until 2018 but it starts to decrease in 2019. Nevertheless, the other
    widely used application, water saving has an increasing trend since 2015. Besides,
    energy harvesting applications are present since 2016 and its rate has increased
    in the last three years. In addition to analyzing number of papers, it is also
    useful to compare the percentages of papers according to recent years. In Fig.
    8, annual rates of the protocols are provided while the rates are given for the
    application areas in Fig. 9. It is obvious that domination of ZigBee and Wi-Fi
    is affected by the emergence of LPWAN technologies in 2018 and 2019. In particular,
    usage of LoRaWAN is on the rise as it has about 30% of share in the last four
    years. On the other hand, the rate of studies about water saving and soil condition
    monitoring has the highest values in the recent years. However, share of water
    saving slightly decreased after 2017 as a result of increments in investments
    for efficient usage of energy resources. Download : Download high-res image (251KB)

    the papers. According to these distributions, it may be concluded that LoRaWAN
    is the promising protocol for SA and the applications for economic usage of resources
    (i.e. water saving and energy harvesting) are on the rise. These inferences are
    consistent with the ultimate goal of efficient usage of world resources. In addition,
    Wi-Fi still stands as a popular short-range protocol due to its common availability.
    8. Conclusion In this paper, utilization of five different wireless communication
    protocols in various smart agriculture applications has been surveyed. The benefits
    offered by these protocols for six different application areas are highlighted
    and example case studies in these areas are provided. The focus of the study has
    been given to those protocols that are commonly used in IoT systems for wireless
    communication. The application-specific suitability of the protocols is discussed
    considering the requirements of the applications together with the features of
    the protocols. Besides, the future trends related to these protocols are underlined
    by accounting the possible requirements in the future and investigating the number
    of annual publications about various smart agriculture applications utilizing
    a protocol within the scope of this paper. The open issues and challenges are
    discussed to understand the limitations that prevent the SA systems from being
    deployed and used commonly. The system security and costs are the two leading
    factors of this situation. In addition, educated farmers having more familiarity
    with IoT and are more comfortable with digital technology are necessary for expedited
    adoption. The future of the wireless communication protocols in SA has been evaluated
    by considering the leading recent technologies used in different applications.
    Aerial systems, satellite communications, 5G networks, and cloud computing are
    some examples of the technologies shaping the future opportunities and necessities
    in SA applications. Furthermore, it is underlined that infrastructure installation
    for LPWAN protocols is expected to be more common to ensure more secure data transfer
    over longer distances. There is a large number of publications in the literature
    mentioning the technical specifications of the protocols involved in this paper.
    The technical data in different sources are expected to be similar; however, some
    of the information provided in these publications are inconsistent. The circumstances
    in which the technical data is measured and the hardware used for deployment may
    be the source of the differences in these data. Nevertheless, such details are
    not given in the previously published papers. Considering the major advantage
    (the long-range communication capability) of NB-IoT, Sigfox, and LoRaWAN, they
    are appropriate for large-scale commercial smart farms. Since it is neither practical
    nor feasible to provide line power to all devices in such farms, the next concern
    should be the power consumption. Due to the relatively high-power requirement
    of NB-IoT, the other two protocols may be considered as more appropriate for smart
    agriculture applications. In addition, the low latency benefit of NB-IoT is not
    a high-priority requirement for smart agriculture. On the other hand, the low
    data transfer rate of Sigfox makes it unsuitable for large fields involving a
    high number of sensors. At this point it may be underlined that, in general, there
    is a correlation between the energy consumption and data transmission speed of
    a protocol. In other words, when the data should be transferred at a higher rate,
    the appropriate protocol is expected to consume more energy. Development of new
    protocols for improving this situation may be a topic that can be a valuable future
    technology. In order to reveal and underline the trending protocol in SA, year-based
    distribution of the published papers within the scope of this study has been observed.
    The papers obtained through the search strategy explained in Section 2.2 were
    categorized according to the application areas and the communication protocols.
    As a result of this categorization step, Table 3 has been generated to see the
    annual distributions of the studies. These year-based distributions are presented
    and discussed in Section 7.6, and visualized in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7,
    Fig. 8 - 9. According to the analysis results, LoRaWAN has the highest number
    of uses in all of the smart agriculture application areas among LPWAN protocols.
    When the advantage of being an open standard is combined with other benefits like
    low power consumption, long-range and sufficient data transfer rate, LoRaWAN may
    be the optimal solution for most cases. Even though the widespread usage of LPWAN
    technologies is increasing in recent years, short-range communication protocols
    are still commonly used in research projects, prototyping and small fields. These
    protocols provide higher data rates in general while requiring relatively high
    power. Despite the drawback of their high-power consumption, the required hardware
    for these protocols can easily be accessed on the market. This ease of accessibility
    makes them the first choice for rapid prototyping and development. Declaration

    of Things5G6GSecuritySmart logistics MSC 00-0199-00 1. Introduction It is evident
    that delivering essential services that are crucial to our way of life, such as
    electricity, communications, transport, banking, etc., we are now more reliant
    on smart sensor technology or Internet of Things (IoT) technology [[1], [2], [3]].
    Critical infrastructure is becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent,
    resulting in efficiency improvements and cost savings. Automation in transport
    and logistics is not a new phenomenon. With the rapid pace it is growing and with
    Industry 4.0, we call it smart transportation and logistics [4,5]. In particular,
    smart logistics makes supply chains more effective and efficient at each step.
    Smart logistics enhances the way organizations transport goods, handle inventory
    and mobility assets, restock stock, and manage the retail experience by bringing
    end-to-end visibility and using connected devices in the supply chain and intelligent
    asset tracking technologies. Sensor-driven asset tracking technologies, for example,
    can provide insight at each stage of shipment, tracking moisture, heat, and vibration
    to provide businesses with real-time visibility as a product moves through the
    supply chain [6]. As per the Australian Industry Standard report, “the Transport
    and Logistics industry in Australia has an estimated annual revenue of $96.65
    billion, adding $39.95 billion to the Australian economy in 2017” [7]. The key
    driving force behind this is IoT-based smart network deployment in the supply
    chain (transportation and logistics sector). For the global logistics industry,
    it is forecasted that up to USD 2.5 trillion of additional value will be generated
    by the IoT by 2025. Although the significant growth of this sector has been seen,
    at the same time, this has pushed researchers to identify novel promising innovations
    across (a) IoT security environments and (b) effective resource utilization in
    order to enhance network security and transparency as well as to make resource
    utilization strategies effective for the supply chain systems. Security perspectives.
    On the one hand, we have seen a tremendous growth in IoT sensor-based supply chain
    networks, but on the other hand, we have seen many adverse scenarios that urge
    us to rethink the design of sensor-enabled autonomous supply chain networks. Recent
    events, such as compromises of the Australian parliamentary network, university
    networks, and major business entities; natural disasters; and the effects of COVID-19,
    show that threats to the operation of Australia''s critical infrastructure entities
    remain serious. Key supply chain businesses transporting groceries and medical
    supplies have also been targeted [8,9]. Now, to strengthen the supply chain networks,
    it is expected that the future smart supply chain will consists of key features
    such as sustainability, traceability, and high levels of safety and effectiveness.
    To integrate these features into smart logistics, researchers note that blockchain
    technology is a promising approach. Using blockchain, the supply chain would get
    rid of the manual process and paperwork mandated by the authorities. Blockchain
    technology in the smart logistics industry would track the location of cargo,
    shipping containers, and trucks in any part of the world. It would further enable
    the sharing of data among businesses, governments, and other stakeholders in a
    secure environment. The blockchain-based platform will offer potential as well
    as add predictability and visibility to the supply chain process, creating a new
    business model. Resource utilization perspectives. With the exponential growth
    of IoT-based smart logistic networks, the demand for wireless capacity will continue
    to be skyrocketed [10], and the emergence of the Internet of Everything (IoE)
    in smart systems, connecting millions of people and billions of IoT nodes, demands
    ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) [11]. To this end, researchers
    argue that 6G will be a better platform to connect things to things [12] and machines
    to machines for ultra-low latency communications [13]. It is arguable that why
    not we could be using 5G. Towards the concern, we have highlighted key reasons
    for the integration of a smart supply chain with 6G in the following section.
    We have mentioned that there are certain limitations of 5G that have been reported,
    which would not fully make 5G compatible or suitable with future smart cities
    or smart networks. Motivated by this, we observe that there is an urgent need
    to study the concepts of blockchain and 6G in this sector (as shown in Fig. 1).
    The key issues, such as security and resource utilization, need further investigation.
    In this chapter, we have comprehensively provided a synthesis of the existing
    literature and provided our opinions to address these key issues. Our contributions
    are as below. 1. We are among the early ones to critically evaluate the needs
    of the integration of blockchain and 6G in the smart logistics sector. 2. We have
    comprehensively discussed the security and resource utilization issues in this
    sector. Given this, we have mentioned a few open issues. A high-level view of
    addressing these issues is also presented. In the following sections, Section
    2 comprehensively discusses the need for integration of 6G and blockchain in the
    smart logistics domain. Section 3 highlights the closely related work in this
    area. A high-level view of the smart logistics sector with Blockchain is discussed
    in Section 4. Various novel use case scenarios of smart logistics are discussed
    in Section 5. Following this, the open issues are highlighted in Section 6, and
    finally, in Section 7, we have summarized this paper. Download : Download high-res

    to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistics Because of the above brief discussion
    of “security perspectives” and “resource utilization issues” of smart logistics,
    we now present the concepts of integrating blockchain and 6G in smart logistics
    in more detail. Blockchain technology is an incorruptible, tamper-proof, democratized,
    and decentralized system that records an economic transaction. Transactions added
    to blockchain are time-stamped, so tracing the transactions and products becomes
    easy. The decentralized nature of blockchain provides high resilience to cyber
    attacks and vulnerabilities. Blockchain enables the sharing of information using
    a “distributed ledger” that can be accessed by members participating in blockchain
    but cannot be updated by individuals without approval from the group. This disruptive
    technology is being explored among different sectors from the government to intellectual
    property, financial transactions, transportation, healthcare, election security,
    energy, education, etc. However, the logistics industry is the biggest killer
    application. This is because the logistics and freight are highly sophisticated
    and involve multiple stakeholders and processes with different interests. It is
    estimated that over the period of 2021–2028, the blockchain technology in the
    logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound
    annual growth rate of 62.4% [14]. Reasons for this rapid growth are that the world''s
    logistics industry is becoming complex and needs interaction and exchange of information
    between various stakeholders, such as manufacturers, freight forwarders, warehouses,
    land transportation providers, government, retailers, ocean carriers, multiple
    ports, banks, and end-users. With many third-party intermediaries, multiple data
    exchange and complexity can potentially lead to unclear visibility, increased
    cyber attacks, and instability of the system. Blockchain has the potential to
    provide opportunities and benefits for every participant and process in the supply
    chain and logistics. It allows the organization to trace and track the product''s
    transaction from origin to the destination of the goods along the whole supply
    chain. Information and data stored in the blockchain are permanent and unalterable,
    hence, the network becomes more trustful and secure. Therefore, blockchain has
    the potential to develop communities of trust, provenance, collaboration, and
    consensus across supply chains. It is also estimated that by 2023, due to a lack
    of strong use cases, 90% of blockchain-based logistics initiatives will suffer
    “Blockchain fatigue” [15]. The reason for the “Blockchain fatigue” is that most
    of the blockchain projects have remained in the pilot stage due to the lack of
    standards, the convergence of technology immaturity, the issue of scalability
    and interoperability, the overly ambitious scope, and the misunderstanding of
    how technology could help the supply chain management and logistics industry.
    Stakeholders, organizations, and industries are trying to understand the capabilities
    of blockchain in logistics, how it can benefit their business, and what problems
    it can solve. Tactile Internet for smart logistics. The Tactile Internet is an
    emerging technology that is described as a communication infrastructure that combines
    low latency and high reliability. It is considered a leap forward compared to
    the mobile Internet and the IoT and will revolutionize practically every aspect
    of society [16,17]. When the Tactile Internet is introduced into the smart logistics
    and supply chain, it will innovate the existing communication and interaction
    across diverse supply chain entities, promoting the intelligent process of smart
    logistics and end-user quality of experience (QoE) by taking advantage of haptic
    information and haptic-related applications [17]. Autonomous driving, vehicle
    platooning, remote driving, aerial drones, virtually connected railway systems,
    and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are among the main applications of the Tactile
    Internet in intelligent mobility systems. Self-driving capabilities in future
    wireless networks will require vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I) communication systems [18]. Future Tactile Internet systems must meet the
    stringent latency, reliability, and stability control restrictions imposed by
    those, as mentioned earlier, autonomous, intelligent, and cooperative mobility
    systems. Any data processing phase, including data collection, information filtering,
    data fusion, representation, modeling, processing, and interpretation, might pose
    a security vulnerability in IoT systems, including the Tactile Internet. The main
    security concerns may include terminal security, data processing, data transmission,
    and management security. Compared to conventional scenarios, privacy loss in wireless
    IoT systems is more likely to occur because of many factors, including a higher
    level of interaction with smart devices and sensors, location-based services,
    and a low awareness level on the user-side, necessitating the development of novel
    privacy-preserving mechanisms [18]. Due to the huge scale and spread nature of
    IoT networks, safeguarding the privacy of IoT data flowing through the network
    and data fusion with privacy preservation are important concerns. To protect the
    underlying personal information in the future beyond 5G networks supporting Tactile
    Internet applications, it is critical to create appropriate access control and
    encryption mechanisms. Blockchain technology has the potential to achieve privacy-preserving
    capabilities in future wireless systems, as it consists of a number of blocks
    regarded as secure, public, and verified [19]. 6G concept in the smart logistics
    sector. Researchers argue that 5G will be a better platform to connect things
    to things and machines to machines for ultra-low latency communications. However,
    there are certain limitations of 5G that have been reported that would not fully
    make 5G compatible or suitable with future smart cities or smart networks. A few
    of them are below. 1. The unprecedented proliferation of extended reality (XR)
    services such as: encompassing augmented, mixed, and virtual reality (AR/MR/VR),
    flying vehicles, brain-computer interfaces, connected autonomous systems, etc.,
    will deteriorate the fundamental aim of 5G to support short-packet, sensing-based
    URLLC services. To successfully operate IoE services such as XR and connected
    autonomous systems, future generation wireless networks must be able to support
    high reliability, low latency, and high data rates for heterogeneous devices across
    uplink and downlink [11]. 2. We have seen the involvement of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) in almost every sector, including the wireless domain, driven by recent breakthroughs
    in reinforcement learning and deep learning. The automaton with AI support, big
    data, the growth of smart devices, etc. It is reported that 6G use cases for AI
    can autonomously sustain high Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and manage resources,
    functions, and network control. AI-enabled 6G provides “collective network intelligence”
    where the network intelligence is brought down at the edge level [20]. This makes
    the 6G networks self-sustain rather than self-organized networks such as 5G. 3.
    Recently, a new network concept, i.e., 3D networking, is emerging. This is because
    of the integration of ground and airborne networks. 3D servers, 3D base stations,
    3D network planning and design, etc., are very different from 2D networks. Therefore,
    6G can promisingly provide new network optimizations for ultra-high mobility management,
    routing, and resource management in a 3D context [21]. 4. A recent report by Smart
    Cities Press mentioned that by 2030, the IoT connections will cross approximately
    125 billion. And to accommodate such a growing number of nodes, the network providers
    need the power of 6G [22]. The end of smartphone eras to smart wearable sensors,
    connecting robots to autonomous systems, the revolution of sensor-based smart
    environments, smart logistics, etc., have all fueled the fire to rethink the limitations
    of 5G and to start working towards 6G. Comparative analysis between 5G and 6G.
    The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has forecasted that by the end
    of 2030, the number of mobile subscriptions worldwide will reach 17.1 billion,
    which was previously 5.32 billion in 2010, and the global mobile traffic volume
    will increase by 670 times in 2030 compared to 2010. The global use of Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) subscriptions will also increase exponentially. It is estimated that M2M
    subscriptions worldwide will increase 455 times in 2030 (which is 97 billion M2M
    subscriptions) compared to 2010 (0.213 billion M2M subscriptions) and smartphone
    subscriptions will increase by 7 times in 2030 compared to 2010 [23]. It is also
    expected that by the end of 2030, the global mobile traffic volume will increase
    80 times and the traffic volume per subscription will increase 48 times compared
    to mobile traffic in 2020 (as shown in Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image

    mobile connectivity (a) traffic volume and (b) traffic volume per subscription
    from 2020–2030 [23]. Owing to the limitation of service geographical area coverage,
    the exponential growth of mobile connectivity and M2M connectivity in the future,
    radio spectrum, and operation cost, the 5G network will reach its limit by the
    2030 and cannot achieve anytime and anywhere high-reliability, ubiquitous wireless
    communication service globally, and high-quality services, particularly in coping
    with the upcoming trillion-level connections of IoE devices in remote areas [24,25].
    It is expected that 6G will overcome the shortcomings and limitations of the current
    5G technology by developing a space-air-ground-sea network, removing conventional
    cell structures, communicating at a higher frequency, higher performance networking,
    and improved Quality of Service (QoS), and will add capabilities of computing
    and Integrated AI for powerful analysis, optimizing, learning, and intelligent
    recognition abilities [[25], [26], [27]]. In Table 1 we have provided the comparison
    between 5G and 6G networks [24,28]. It is expected that 6G connectivity will support
    a speed of 1 Tbps and therefore extend the performance (increase capacity and
    latency) of the 5G network [29]. With zero latency, a data rate of 1 Tbps, and
    bandwidth up to 3 THz, 6G (or 6th generation) technology empowered by AI to re-shape
    the wireless evolution from “connecting things” to “connecting intelligence” will
    be characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in multiple facets [30]. 6G
    will further provide high-energy performance, energy-efficient communications,
    environmental intelligence, human-centric networks, etc. Table 1. Comparison between

    Smart city components Separate Integrated Satellite integration No Yes From the
    above literature, it is evident that the concept of automation is already embedded
    in our lives. Particularly in the smart logistics domain, IoTs are helping in
    different directions, such as: tracking and remote monitoring of manufacturing
    assets, video surveillance/streaming of manufacturing assets and processes, real-time
    remote control of robotics, remote site safety/security, etc. In the world of
    “smart”, there are still many challenges due to the unprecedented growth of sensors.
    Thus, the need for 6G over 5G is evident [31]. 3. Related works and other key
    reasons In this section, we primarily focus on the literature related to the smart
    logistics sector. The aim is to encourage the reader in this direction to emphasize
    the significant importance, impact, and horizon of this sector in today''s smart
    lives. We have provided a brief overview of blockchain initiatives in the smart
    logistics industry. And we have also shed some light on 5G and 6G initiatives
    in this domain. It is estimated that the global smart city technology revenue
    will reach USD 1.7 trillion by 2028, IoT will reach USD 1.1 trillion by 2022 and
    globally IoT connected devices will almost triple from 8.74 billion in 2020 to
    more than 25.4 billion in 2030 (as shown in Fig. 3), mobility (the largest segment
    of the global smart city) will reach more than USD 115 billion by 2019, and energy
    and smart building (second largest smart city segment) will reach the amount to
    USD 206 billion and 183 billion, respectively, by 2025 [32]. The reason for this
    rapid growth in global smart city technology is urbanization, and it is estimated
    that the number of people living in the city will increase from 54% to 66% (i.e.,
    increase of 2.5 billion people) by 2050 [33,34]. People''s living conditions have
    been impacted because of the complex systems to deal with an increase in the number
    of urban traffic management, food supplies, water supplies, local waste disposal,
    etc. [35]. The solution to this problem is the “smart city”, which comprises investment
    in human and social capital, ICT infrastructure, high-quality life, sustainable
    economic growth, and political efficiency powered by disruptive technologies with
    strategic management of natural resources through participatory government [35,36].

    Fig. 3. The forecasted growth of global IoT connected devices over the decade
    [32]. When smart city infrastructure is combined with the energy Internet, big
    data, and IoT, it provides effective intelligent solutions in government affairs,
    the environment, logistics, etc. [37]. Wei et al. [16] proposed a QoE-driven Tactile
    Internet architecture for smart cities that consists of five layers: sensing layer,
    transmission layer, storage layer, computing layer, and application layer. Furthermore,
    the approaches supported at each tier of this architecture adhere to low latency,
    high user experience quality, and high-reliability requirements [16]. However,
    it may face many challenges, such as maintenance of equipment, high operating
    costs, user privacy, leakage of information, poor security of IoT, denial of services,
    upgrade difficulty, energy consumption, etc. [37]. Blockchain in the IoT smart
    city domain can help to alleviate privacy concerns. As a simple and secured infrastructure
    is provided by the blockchain to directly transfer (or communicate) the information
    (such as data, money, or a piece of property, etc.) between the two devices with
    a time-stamped contractual handshake (smart contract), this distributed ledger
    technology has many benefits for the distributed IoT [38]. The convergence of
    blockchain and IoT combined with other technologies, such as AI and SDN (hybrid
    architecture), will open unlimited possibilities for smart city initiatives, involving
    various aspects of life, businesses, and industries (security, fleet management,
    manufacturing technologies, electricity, precision agriculture, supply chain,
    autonomous decisions, energy industry, smart logistics, smart building, smart
    grid) [39,40]. Not only will companies and their customers will benefit from the
    transparency and fast track of transactions, but the entire ecosystem (smart city)
    will also be strengthened because of automated trusted services. Some of the possible
    use cases of blockchain technology in smart cities are universal ID cards, green
    energy, interoperability for smart devices, smart retail and logistics, smart
    mobility and energy, urban planning, land property and housing management, pollution
    management, key-less signature interface, prioritizing local commerce, etc. [41].
    Furthermore, the decentralized nature of blockchain technology will not only eliminate
    the single point of failure but also help to authenticate, authorize, and audit
    data generated by devices [40]. The technology can also be used for identification
    purposes (such as tax data, voting, proof of citizenship, etc.) in a smart city.
    Using the distributed ledger technology also ensures the elimination of paperwork,
    hence managing and reducing pollution and local waste [42]. Another challenge
    is that the current city infrastructure faces a limited amount of information/data
    sharing capabilities. 4G (or LTE) broadband communication does not have the bandwidth,
    capacity, or latency to carry out the transaction of information required to drive
    automation. This issue can be overcome by adapting the 5G and 6G technologies.
    3.1. Theoretical analysis Oughton and Frias [43] analyzed the potential cost,
    coverage, and rollout implications of 5G infrastructure in Britain, explored by
    extrapolating 4G network (4G LTE and LTE-Advanced) network from the duration of
    2020–2030 for effective policy formulation. They investigated how poor connectivity
    has impacted certain locations in the UK for society and businesses and how much
    near-ubiquitous coverage is essential for economic development. To calculate the
    cost model for a non-virtualized 5G infrastructure, the Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)
    is defined as Eq. (1) for the rollout for each geotype of each year (i) of the
    study period of 2020–2030. (1) where represents the total CAPEX costs of all assets
    such as (upgrade of macrocell), (deployment of greenfield small cell), (fiber
    backhaul), and (cost of the core upgrade). OPEX (Operational Expenditure) and
    the recurrent OPEX (e.g., the maintenance cost of investment assets, backhaul
    of small cells, etc) have been excluded from the above value. In Ref. [44], Wisely
    et al. estimated that the cost of dense urban (in central London) deployment of
    the eMBB scenario of 5G network for a 100 Mbps everywhere network will be approximately
    4–5 times more than that of the cost of deploying LTE. To evaluate network performance,
    networks were dimensional to calculate the minimum number of base stations for
    each exploratory plot. The probability distribution of the Signal to Noise and
    Interference Ratio (SINR) was calculated within each cell size and then converted
    into an average spectral efficiency (bps/Hz) for the cell based on the potential
    spectral efficiency for each SINR value (as shown in Eq. (2)). (2) Here, ISD stands
    for “Inter-Site Distance” (using the existing sites), and ηISD represents the
    average spectral efficiency in a cell. Then, the average cell throughput (in Mbps)
    was calculated as follows: (3) where the is calculated according to the bandwidth
    (BW) in each carrier frequency and the factor 3 accounts for three-sector cells.
    Overall, in Ref. [43], it was found that by 2027, 90% of the population will be
    covered by the 5G network; however, due to the exponential increase in costs,
    it is unlikely to reach the final 10% coverage. 3.2. 6G deployment initiatives
    The deployment of 5G technology has already commenced globally. To sustain the
    upcoming competition for the future demand of wireless networks, researchers have
    begun to conceptualize the 6G generation, aiming to lay the foundations for the
    stratification of the communications services for the 2030s [45]. China launched
    the world''s first 6G satellite “Tianyan-5” into orbit on November 6, 2020. This
    remote sensing satellite was jointly developed by China University of Electronic
    Science and Technology, Beijing WeinaXingkong Technology, and Chengdu Guoxing
    Aerospace Technology with the aim of a 6G test for improved latency speed and
    signal strength with the purpose of monitoring real-time climatic change developments
    [46]. The sixth generation is envisioned as an ultra-dense heterogeneous automation
    network architecture comprising non-terrestrial (for example, drones, planes,
    and satellites) and terrestrial infrastructures (cellular networks) that would
    integrate ground, air, underwater, and space networks to provide ubiquitous wireless
    connectivity [5]. 6G infrastructure will involve technologies such as very large-scale
    antenna arrays (MIMO and supermassive (SM) multiple-input), Orbital Angular Momentum
    (OAM) multiplexing, blockchain-based sharing, laser and visible-light communication
    (VLC), holographic beamforming (HBF), quantum computing, molecular communications,
    collective/pervasive AI, and the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things [5,24]. As 6G aims
    to provide large coverage of urban and remote areas, it is beneficial in the implementation
    of smart city infrastructure, providing real-time information and connecting all
    the sub-ecosystems (economy, living, governance, education, people, environment,
    mobility, businesses, buildings, etc.). This infrastructure will generate heaps
    of sensitive information, and hence, full security is needed to provide the trusted
    service. In Ref. [47], the authors investigated how 6G can provide holistic management
    of C4 (communication, computation, caching, and control) resources for a single
    system incorporating 3D coverage. As the 6G network is still a concept and research
    work, upcoming security and privacy threats are unknown. In addition to the loss
    of control over devices, breach of information security, or loss of money can
    also cause the loss of property or even endanger physical safety [48]. Some other
    challenges in 6G are massive system connectivity, high data consumption in future
    tenants, security needs with scalability, and device resource restrictions [49].
    There are some publications [49,[50], [51], [52]] that have presented the role
    of blockchain technology in 6G networks to overcome the above challenges, such
    as intelligent service, innovative air-interface design, authentication, accountability,
    elevated security and privacy, resource management, and autonomous networks. Some
    of the possible use cases of blockchain in 6G are smart health, smart logistics,
    agriculture, industry 4.0, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, pervasive connectivity,
    seamless environment monitoring, trustworthy and decentralized 6G communication
    infrastructure (spectrum sharing and extreme edge), UAV, etc. [49,53]. In some
    of the other existing literature on blockchain in logistics, the work mainly focuses
    on improving traceability, transaction trust, disintermediation, and visibility.
    Table 2 summarizes the existing literature review on blockchain-enabled logistics.
    In 2018, Maouchi et al. highlighted the importance of transparency, traceability,
    and decentralization features in the supply chain [54]. Hackius and Petersen [55]
    represented four use cases of blockchain application in logistics and supply chain
    management. The four use cases proposed by the authors are to ease paperwork processing
    in ocean freight, identify counterfeit products, facilitate origin tracking, and
    operate the IoT. Bocek et al. [56] proposed an idea of how blockchain technology
    is important in the pharmaceutical industry, from tracing and tracking the product
    to managing data. The authors presented the pharmaceutical supply chain and described
    how smart blockchain and IoT can be used to speed up logistics activities and
    remove third-party interference while reducing operational costs. Polim et al.
    discussed the problem that occurs between grocery store retailers and logistics
    providers due to the information asymmetry in a grocery supply chain [57]. Table

    Chang et al. [59] discussed the challenges and opportunities of blockchain technology
    in cross-border trade and global supply chain with leading pilot initiatives by
    Walmart, the port of Antwerp, IBM, Accenture, the Blockchain in Transport Alliance
    (BiTA), etc. The trend of blockchain and 6G in smart logistics is rising [60].
    In this work, Kamilaris et al. investigated the impact of blockchain, particularly
    in the agriculture and food supply chain. They have comprehensively presented
    the existing ongoing projects and initiatives. Following this, they have shed
    light on potential challenges. Meanwhile, there are some experiments going on
    in blockchain-enabled smart logistics and cities (Table 3). For example, for smart
    IoT, Ali et al. [63] developed a blockchain-based behavioral verification system.
    For external devices that want to join the smart home network, the system demonstrated
    a level of confidence. To protect IoT devices from harmful attacks, blockchain
    was implemented in the IoT behavior controller system to store, track, and identify
    IoT devices. Again, Lee et al. [64] developed a blockchain-based smart home architecture
    to address the shortcomings of the present centralized smart home network and
    to protect the smart gateway from future threats. They used the Ethereum blockchain
    to ensure that the data from smart homes were validated and kept private. In another
    paper, Nadeem et al. [65] presented a blockchain-based vehicular distributed Ad-hoc
    system to keep vehicle drivers'' personal lives private while providing on-demand
    and low-cost access. To overcome the challenges associated with the system''s
    storage, processing, and broadband bandwidth limits, the three interconnected
    components are termed vehicle Cloud, roadside Cloud, and central Cloud which constitute
    a Cloud hierarchical architecture. The shared Cloud network connects cars and
    service providers securely via a blockchain-regulated peer-to-peer (P2P) network
    that can withstand cyberattacks and address bottlenecks in the automotive sector.
    Gao et al. [66] proposed a vehicular network that incorporated blockchain, Software
    Defined Networking (SDN), and fog computing. In the suggested method, the blockchain
    created a trust model by deciding which messages to send from the source vehicle
    based on information gathered from peers. For carpooling services, Li et al. [67]
    developed a blockchain-assisted vehicular fog computing system. The act of sharing
    a single vehicle with one or more passengers traveling in the same direction is
    known as carpooling. In such a system, malicious users or drivers can falsely
    report their locations. The authors used conditional privacy, one-to-many proximity
    matching, destination matching, and data audibility in the carpooling system to
    protect passenger privacy and security. In their study, Rathore et al. [68] offered
    a decentralized security architecture based on SDN paired with blockchain technology
    for IoT networks in the smart city that relies on the three main technologies
    of SDN, blockchain, and Fog as well as mobile edge computing to detect attacks
    in the smart city. Table 3. List of blockchain-based smart logistics experiments.

    Mininet, Amazon EC2, Ethereum Bridge, Truffle development suite From this comprehensive
    discussion, it is evident that we need Blockchain and 6G in future networking
    for smart cities or smart logistics domains. In the following section, we have
    comprehensively discussed the blockchain for smart logistics use cases. 4. Smart
    logistics with blockchain Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger technology
    where the ledger of a transaction is distributed among all participating members
    in the network, over which successfully validated transactions are recorded chronologically,
    which takes the form of “blocks”. Transactions contained within blocks could be
    value transactions, e.g., transport data, details of events in logistics, or automated
    actions. Before adding any new information (block), members participating in the
    blockchain-based logistic network come to an agreement or consensus, and then
    validated information (block) is added to the chain and then broadcast across
    the blockchain network, as shown in Fig. 4. The block is rejected if no consensus
    on the validity of the block is reached. This “mutualization of data” is possible
    because of cryptographic techniques that make certain identical copies and permissions
    are established to access stored data in a blockchain-based system [61]. Authentication
    of transactions is achieved by a “consensus mechanism”, which allows members to
    collaborate with each other of no particular trust. Unlike the traditional method
    used by the supply chain, which is controlled by central authorities, a blockchain-based
    system relies on a P2P network that is controlled by no individual, group of people,
    or central authorities. Smart contracts are self-executable computer codes that
    can be used as legal contracts when certain conditions and logic are met, which
    can also be used to automate the process, which further reduces costs and time.
    Hence, the blockchain benefits for 6G networks for smart applications can be elevated
    security features, intelligent resource management, and scalability. In logistics,
    blockchain ensures immutability, over-the-board transparency, provenance, asset
    management, finality, and a single version of truth. Download : Download high-res
    image (347KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. The proposed high-level
    system model. Another interesting feature blockchain can provide to the logistics
    is to efficiently administer the import and export licenses. Storing the licenses
    would save the organizations to avoid the trouble of losing them and would allow
    customs authorities to easily check the validity and authenticity of the permits.
    With the help of smart contracts, automatically invalid permits will be canceled
    upon expiration of their validity period, which could avoid a situation like when
    the Department of Agriculture in the Philippines canceled all permits of import
    on meat products in 2016, after having found that old permits were being recycled
    to smuggle imports. Therefore, blockchain can promisingly help to verify the license,
    fight fraud, and smuggling cases. Furthermore, there have also been some government
    initiatives across the world in terms of logistics and supply chains; for example,
    the government of India has begun to embrace blockchain technology as a means
    of streamlining operations and services. Its most recent experiment was in the
    domain of domestic trade. The country''s Finance Ministry''s Central Board of
    Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) began a trial electronic freight and cargo tracking
    system project based on blockchain technology on October 15, 2021. This aims to
    ensure secure container documentation and GPS-based tracking [73]. The experiment
    is being carried out at the Tughlakabad Import Commissionerate''s Inland Container
    Depot (ICD), which accounts for around 20% of the overall tax receipts under Delhi
    Customs. After an assessment of costs, time savings, and compliance, the project
    may be expanded across India if this test run is successful [73]. Another example
    is the Australian Border Force (ABF), Singapore Customs, and the Infocomm Media
    Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA), as well as industry participants, which
    have conducted a blockchain trial to demonstrate that trade documentation may
    be issued and confirmed digitally across two independent systems [74]. The blockchain
    trial was launched as part of the Australia-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement,
    which aims to simplify cross-border trade and lower transaction costs between
    the two countries. This is one of the first cross-border document interoperability
    collaborations involving numerous government entities from two nations [74]. The
    European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) also aims to develop a trusted, secure,
    and resilient European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) that meets the
    highest standards in terms of privacy, cyber security, interoperability, and policy
    implementation using blockchain and distributed ledger technologies [75]. In the
    USA, food and drug inspection employ blockchain to address the problem of lack
    of openness and security in health data processing [75]. The Food Standards Agency
    in the UK is utilizing blockchain to track the circulation of meat to improve
    food traceability [75]. In the following literature, some key and critical use
    case scenarios are discussed. 5. Smart logistics use cases In this section, we
    have highlighted critical supply chain or smart logistic scenarios where blockchain
    and 6G can play a potential role. 5.1. Single digital window Australia is currently
    planning to create a “single digital window” through which all Australia''s international
    trade information and documents can be exchanged by multiple stakeholders and
    government agencies. A “single digital window”, also known as a “single window
    system”, is a facility that enables traders and businesses to submit the reports,
    documentation, and licenses for exportation, importation, or transit of products
    to the authorized agencies through a single entry point. Establishing such a system
    will accelerate and simplify border procedures, information flow, and formalities
    between government and trade, saving time and money. As a technology choice, blockchain
    has the potential to upgrade the existing “single digital” system. Blockchain
    would streamline trade finance, customs application, insurance, etc., reduce delays
    resulting from physical paperwork movement, reduce the documentation process,
    and reduce processing times and costs. Moving along the supply chain will also
    enhance the provenance, immutability, and visibility of sensitive documents and
    goods in a secure environment. In May 2018, the Singapore International Chamber
    of Commerce (SICC) partnered with vCargo Cloud, a Singapore-based provider of
    cross-border trade facilitation solutions, and initiated the world''s first blockchain-based
    platform for electronic certificates of origin (eCOs) to increase efficiency and
    prevent fraud [76]. The certificates of origin are the international trade documents
    authorized by the government or other empowered organizations in a specific country
    to certify that the goods and packages in a particular shipment have been successfully
    obtained, manufactured, and processed. This blockchain-enabled platform attempts
    to revolutionize the way trade-related documents are handled by storing information
    about trade transactions on a tamper-proof distributed ledger system that can
    be authenticated and accessible by the platform''s many involved parties. QR codes
    are used on this platform, allowing eCOs to be scanned with smartphones and then
    printed. To avoid unauthorized duplicates, the number of printouts is limited.
    Hence, increasing the efficiency and lowering the cost of eCOs verification. This
    helps to establish self-certification through the ASEAN (Association of Southeast
    Asian Nations) single window for providing a robust legal framework, reducing
    manual paperwork, and accelerating freight clearance across all 10 member countries.
    5.2. Cross-sector domain application A cross-sector application involves parties
    from various other sectors, and cooperation is often not an obvious choice between
    these sectors. There are opportunities for innovative approaches that require
    business collaboration in one or more sectors. We are starting to see some cross-sector
    innovation from transport networks to connecting utilities to water companies
    working with energy providers and telecommunications partnerships with electricity
    providers. For any international trade, different processes are required and implemented
    in sequence. Blockchain can simultaneously implement these processes so that the
    involved parties do not have to wait for each other. Furthermore, blockchain could
    coordinate processes in decentralized networks of businesses and governments.
    Logistics and energy are the two best examples of cross-sector applications, which
    can be efficiently improved with the help of blockchain. Logistics comprises small
    to large enterprises and organizations. On average, in transporting sea containers,
    30 parties are involved, and to ensure that a container is reached its destined
    location, a total of 200 times data are exchanged between these parties. The efficiency
    can be improved in this process with the help of blockchain technology. Apart
    from improving the efficiency and speed of exchanging information between these
    parties, blockchain also has the potential to monitor the operation''s progress
    in real-time, reduce the risk of fraud, easy data verification, and shorten the
    cash cycle [77]. The same applies to the energy sector, which involves producers
    and purchasers of energy. The problem for the energy sector is that it is challenging
    to make maximum use of sustainable energy resources, Because of that, wind farms
    and solar energy applications are being closed down because grid operators are
    not able to use all stored power. Because of these inefficiencies, North America
    and Europe are facing a loss of billions of dollars. With the help of blockchain,
    organizations would coordinate the supply and demand of energy. The port of Rotterdam
    with the BlockLab team is currently piloting the “cross-sector domain” blockchain
    platform to facilitate the running of its electrical grid and logistics operations.
    Rotterdam is using blockchain technology to enhance its competitive position as
    a logistics hub, and SmartPort is also one of the main drivers behind it. Blockchain
    can securely track the location and ownership of cargo shipments, and with the
    help of “smart contract” it can also automate trade processes. Moreover, blockchain
    would facilitate smart and decentralized grids for the energy transition. The
    port of Rotterdam is also developing another blockchain application with the BlockLab
    and S&P Global Platts for trading price incentives to maximize sustainable energy
    consumption. 5.3. V2V communication V2V communication is simply a wireless technology
    that lets vehicles within a few hundred meters broadcast their steering-wheel
    position, speed, brake status, and other data to other vehicles. In logistics,
    V2V communication allows multiple freight vehicles to form communication or platoons
    and also improves safety and fuel efficiency. Some organizations are now connecting
    freight vehicles, such as trucks, using direct V2V communications; this enables
    the rear vehicle to react to the front vehicle''s actions immediately. These vehicles
    accelerate and brake together by electronically coupling the trucks, and are able
    to operate safely at a closer distance. This technology is inserted into a whole
    fleet of trucks that are taking part in shipping products where the front truck
    is in full control of the rear truck, which is known as truck platooning. Blockchain
    is ideally suited in this case, as it is decentralized in nature. For example,
    in a free-flow traffic situation, Chen et al. [29] suggested a platoon-driving
    approach for autonomous cars in their paper. This approach enables successful
    path-matching vehicles to be grouped into platoons and guided by the platoon head.
    In addition, a platoon head selection method is implemented to offer vehicles
    an incentive to serve as platoon heads and to keep platoons dynamically updated.
    Following that, a smart contract is used to enable blockchain-based payment between
    the platoon head and platoon members, preventing false and malicious payments.
    Also, V2V communication enables logistics and freight companies to store and validate
    the data efficiently. The stored and validated data used on the blockchain can
    further help logistics companies and trade to streamline their operations across
    the world effectively. Blockchain makes the whole process more efficient, improves
    traffic situations and also reduces fuel usage. TNO, TKI Dinalog, Rotterdam Port
    Authority, logistics companies, truck companies, and the government are developing
    a prototype for truck platooning for better trading and shipping. Moreover, using
    blockchain as a technology will lead truck platooning towards autonomous shipping.
    5.4. Ocean freight, air freight and road freight The global shipping industry
    carries out about 90% of world trade. More than 50,000 merchant ships are involved
    globally, with world fleets registered across 150 countries, transporting every
    kind of cargo, and it is regulated by over a million seafarers [78]. Digitalizing
    ocean shipping will pave a way for the development of worldwide digital networks
    that will offer better visibility to all stakeholders and will help shippers track
    freight across carriers. Distributed ledger technology could potentially reduce
    the time and cost required for processing documentation for ocean freight shipments.
    To unveil the potential in ocean freight, the ZIM ocean carrier service has joined
    the TradeLens, which is the joint venture between IBM and Maersk for a blockchain-based
    digital shipping service. It uses a blockchain-based platform for the single version
    of truth between all stakeholders without compromising confidentiality and privacy
    to enable trust between multiple parties, from carriers to the freight forwarder,
    provides certainty through real-time access to shipping documents and information,
    and moreover improves the business model. Maersk also reported that by using the
    TradeLens platform, the transaction time was reduced by 40% and the cost was reduced
    by thousands of dollars. In LogChain, an Israeli-based blockchain start-up has
    successfully established its full cycle of international maritime shipment from
    Belgium to Israel, shipping beverages. LogChain handles the whole supply chain
    transition, including letters of credit and electronic bills of lading. Furthermore,
    it was reported that LogChain has reduced the time approximately by two weeks
    of documentation and shipment cost by 7% to 9%. In 2018, Maersk also collaborated
    with EY and Guardtime to launch the world''s first distributed ledger technology
    platform for transferring marine insurance named “Insurwave” and now commercially
    used by AP Moller-Maersk, XL Catlin, Willis Towers Watson, and MS Amlin. Air freight
    involves many stakeholders along the entire supply chain, such as air cargo costing,
    billing, etc., which use manpower-intensive, manual paperwork and are prone to
    error processes. In Singapore at the International Air Transport Association World
    Cargo Symposium, a blockchain-based air cargo billing, costing, and reconciliation
    system was launched by Cargo Community Network (CCN) partnered with Microsoft
    for promoting air cargo billing processes, real-time revenue recognition, and
    accelerating billing reconciliation to enhance the efficiency of cargo agents,
    airlines, and freight forwarders [79]. With Microsoft''s Azure blockchain technology
    and built-in smart contract, freight forwarders and airlines can now update their
    compute charges and shipments in real-time, and stakeholders are able to retrieve
    real-time information like shipment details from the freight status update, flight
    manifest, and airway bill. These not only shorten the billing cycle from weeks
    to a few hours but also enable visibility and accountability and reduce discrepancies
    across the entire supply chain. Internationally, 85% of road freight goods are
    carried over a distance of 150 km, and 8 billion tonnes of goods are transacted
    per year. To facilitate trade across Asia, Singapore''s CrimsonLogic launched
    the region''s first cross-border permissioned blockchain network named Global
    eTrade Services Open Trade Blockchain (GeTS′ OTB), which is aligned with the Southern
    Transport Corridor and China''s Belt Road Initiative to improve security, efficiency,
    and transparency. GeTS′ OTB enhances the transparency and trust between shippers,
    customers, and freight-forwarders and the security of trust-related documents
    such as eCOs and invoices. GeTS′ OTB has already attracted partners like Suzhou
    Cross-E-commerce, China-ASEAN information Harbour, IBM, Korea Trade Network, TIFFA
    EDI services, PT-EDI Indonesia, commodities Intelligence Centre, and Trade-Van
    Information services (Taipei, China). GeTS'' OTB has conducted more than 13 million
    transactions, increased productivity by 1.5 times, improved speed by 60%, and
    recorded more than USD 400 billion of Gross Merchandised Value (GMV) in the first
    half of 2018. 5.5. Traceable luxurious goods With significant benefits in sight,
    it is estimated that blockchain technology in the global supply chain market is
    expected to grow by approximately USD 666.61 million by 2024. The global supply
    chain network is massive and complex. Keeping track of the transaction history
    along the entire supply chain from source to destination is a challenging process.
    If all these transactions and stakeholders are recorded on the blockchain, the
    information would be added only once through the consensus of other members in
    the network. This means data in the network become permanent and information can
    be easily shared among the actors participating in the network, which help them
    to keep track of products and goods. Businesses and organizations can use this
    recorded information and documents to provide evidence of the legitimacy and authenticity
    of products such as luxury goods like diamonds, fine arts, or pharmaceutical products.
    Hence, this emerging technology is a useful innovation for precious goods, as
    it provides a secure environment. For example, established in 2015, Everledger
    is the blockchain platform for asset tracking companies and supply chains to store
    records of valuable assets like diamonds and art. It tracks diamonds from the
    mine to the gem cutter, through manufacturers and distributors to the retailer,
    and finally to the buyers or consumers. It has replaced the paper certification
    process with a blockchain ledger. The raw material is assigned a serial number,
    and every information and measurement of a diamond is entered into the digital
    ledger, throughout the material''s transformation and every time the material
    changes its place. Data entered in a blockchain system for each step of the process
    are permanent and also extremely secure. Since 2015, Everledger has provided transparency
    and provenance to more than 2 million diamonds, and approximately recorded 100,000
    diamonds a month. As Everledger stores digital certificates of the diamond on
    the blockchain, network participants such as merchants, banks, and insurers can
    verify the legitimacy of an asset (well in this case, a diamond). Now, a legit
    person will buy a diamond, insure it, and register it on the Everledger. Next,
    this person loses the diamond that he/she reports as stolen. After that, the insurance
    company reimburses her for the loss. Finally, the thief who stole the asset will
    try to sell the stolen diamond to some jeweller. This jeweller will ask Everledger
    for confirmation and learn that it''s a stolen diamond. The stolen diamond is
    reported to the insurance company, which takes control of it. Although some key
    subdomains of smart logistics and supply chains are discussed where blockchain
    can potentially help, we identify critical issues that need to be addressed before
    blockchain''s deployment in these areas. 6. Open issues Blockchain has the potential
    to disrupt every area of logistics, creating new business models through improving
    operational efficiency, but there are three prime challenges to blockchain implementation
    in smart logistics has been identified. These challenges need to be overcome before
    blockchain can reach widespread adoption. Interoperability: Processes in international
    and cross-border trade are not tightly synchronized as logistics will involve
    numerous blockchain-based platforms for different technical uses from finance
    to logistics with different algorithms. Currently, no standard exists to allow
    interaction between these platforms. The issue of interoperability raises two
    questions: 1. how will various blockchain-based platforms in smart logistics interact
    with each other? and 2. how will information exchanged between involving parties
    be understood by them? These issues can be addressed by introducing gateways to
    the blockchain network connecting different areas of logistics. Now, a blockchain
    gateway refers to a computer system in a blockchain network that facilitates the
    flow of virtual assets into and out of the blockchain network [80]. A gateway,
    as a node in the blockchain network, has read/write access to the blockchain''s
    shared ledger and can participate in the blockchain''s consensus mechanism. When
    communicating with its blockchain, a gateway is said to be facing interiorly,
    and when dealing with a remote peer gateway belonging to a separate or different
    blockchain network, it is said to be facing exteriorly [81]. Two peer gateways
    execute a gateway protocol that implements the essential processes for moving
    a virtual asset from one blockchain to another through the mediation of the gateways.
    By definition, a gateway belongs to only one blockchain network, and it must be
    traceable and authenticable to entities in that blockchain network when looking
    inward. A gateway must have at least one blockchain transaction signing a public/private
    key pair for interior interactions. While interacting with external peer gateways,
    a gateway must have a gateway identity public/private key-pair when facing exteriorly.
    Peer gateways can identify and authenticate the gateway using this key pair. For
    example, Accenture introduces the “interoperability nodes” that connect the targeted
    blockchain system to enable synchronization. To all in-scope distributed ledger
    technology systems, an interoperability node is provided with the appropriate
    identity and access control capabilities [82]. Fig. 5 describes the interoperability
    node connecting the freight blockchain system and manufacturer blockchain system
    in logistics. Download : Download high-res image (257KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. The interoperability node connecting the freight blockchain system.
    There are several prerequisites for a gateway protocol in terms of security, such
    as the gateway identification key-pair used to engage with other peer gateways
    externally must be distinct from the transaction signing key-pair used for its
    ledger internally. Secondly, all communications between gateways must take place
    via a secure channel, which must be established using standard secure channel
    establishment protocols like IPsec, SSL/TLS, and so on [81]. Furthermore, during
    the transportation of an asset, a crash of one gateway (or both) must not result
    in the loss or leaking of asset or entity information (e.g., originator and beneficiary
    identities). A gateway must always be placed in a safe state via the gateway recovery
    mechanism [81]. Scalability: Regardless of the current size of the blockchain,
    transaction rate, and trade''s expanding demand, blockchain in logistics systems
    will undergo the problem of scalability. Across the supply chain, many transactions
    process simultaneously, and these transactions create numerous events, such as
    sensor reading, shipment tracking, route creation, invoice delivery, customs clearance,
    stock inbound, freight transition, order creation, payments, advance shipping
    notice, etc. Although some events that occurred are not relevant, they still need
    to be tackled so that the overall system can handle the throughput throughout
    the cycle, proportioning the resources among the stakeholders'' involvement level
    in the supply chain. There is also a problem of high energy consumption and computing
    power in some large-scale logistics transactions, which further leads to high
    latency. This problem of scalability can be solved by an overlay network, which
    is a computer virtual network that is built on another physical network with the
    ability to self-organize [83]. Tunneling is the essential concept of overlay networks;
    for example, packets in the network are collected and encapsulated before being
    routed to their actual destination. An overlay network is a common type of network
    that is used to distribute key value stores and exchange topology between agents
    like Zookeeper, Etcd, and Consul. Extended virtual network IDs are also introduced
    by such protocols; for example, the VXLAN Network ID (VNI) is 24-bit long, and
    the Virtual eXtensible LAN (VXLAN) supports over 16 million virtual networks [84].
    In Ref. [67], the authors proposed Intelligent Transportation Security (ITS) with
    a blockchain overlay network to solve the issue of security and scalability. This
    architecture consists of three layers: the ITS network infrastructure layer, the
    cloud computing and service provisioning layer, and the blockchain overlay layer
    [67]. First, RSUs (Road Side Units), 4G and 5G cellular network base stations,
    and Internet gateways and routers comprise the ITS network infrastructure layer.
    This layer also includes vehicles that interact with an ITS network. Second, the
    service provisioning layer is composed of servers from ITS operators and third-party
    service providers, such as those providing cloud computing and services. Now,
    this blockchain overlay layer (a virtual network) is made up of some vehicles
    that want to join blockchain and employ security-related services, as well as
    nodes from the ITS infrastructure and service provisioning layer. In logistics,
    an overlay network can be used to distribute the key-value stores to exchange
    the data on blockchain topology between stakeholders such as manufacturers, freight,
    producers, etc. Fig. 6 describes an overlay virtual network for the manufacturer
    and freight network. An overlay network with a blockchain-based platform will
    provide the trade with a proper network and will carry out preventive action by
    recreating a proper network if a node in blockchain fails to form for any specific
    reason. One issue here is that the physical network and the virtual network are
    two separate entities with separate management policies, control points, and provisioning.
    We need a management system that adapts and controls overlay network behavior
    so that specific demands of users are met as well as those of service providers.

    Fig. 6. Overlay network for blockchain. Another scalability issue for the blockchain-enabled
    5G and 6G networks is that the 5G and 6G networks'' targeted end-to-end latency
    for payload and carried data is 10 ms and sub 1 ms, respectively. This requirement
    implies that configuration and setup transactions at a very high throughput rate
    [85], while current public blockchain networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum)
    can handle only 10–14 Transactions per Second (TPS), and private blockchains can
    transact up to 3000 to 20,000 TPS [86]. Therefore, an upgrade of the blockchain
    architecture, an increase in block size, and sharding techniques are being researched
    to enhance the capacity to co-op with the future demand [85]. Nonetheless, blockchain
    is a better option for the complex transactions initiated by the next-generation
    wireless systems [87]. In the future, there will be demand for massive connectivity
    in 6G technology which will initiate network resource management, such as spectrum
    sharing, power distribution, and computational resource distribution, as the major
    issue [88]. This issue can be tackled by using blockchain technology in the 6G
    network by integrating smart contracts between operators and users, which will
    enable the network to manage resource utilization, energy trading, monitoring,
    and sharing efficiently [89,90]. In the same way, energy management and spectrum
    management problems can be solved by blockchain. However, scalability will remain
    an open challenge for researchers. The convergence of technologies: To build trust
    and collaboration between businesses and stakeholders in logistics, blockchain
    technology is likely to be used with the IoT, and AI. Though the convergence of
    these technologies will speed up and improve time-consuming and sophisticated
    processes of shipping and freight, there is a chance that cyber attackers will
    find human or computer vulnerabilities in any of these layers of technology as
    an incentive for their own malicious benefits. To tackle the security issue in
    such a case, Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology can be handy (Fig. 7).
    Blockchain-enabled software defining networking will support real-time application
    performance, and all data can be analyzed with the SDN controller [91]. Hence,
    any kind of malicious data or file injected by cyber attackers can be filtered
    out and prevented from network crashes. The main role of using SDN with blockchain
    is to deploy protection for the entire network from security threats and mitigate
    network attacks such as DDoS/DoS attacks, cache poising/ARP spoofing, and other
    network attacks [92]. Additionally, to provide further protection to the blockchain
    system, it can utilize SDN functionalities by implementing a firewall for blockchain-based
    applications by filtering out network traffic [92]. The SDN can communicate with
    the nodes in the blockchain, which it guards to determine if the origin of the
    traffic is legitimate or not, and the packets from the illegitimate source are
    intercepted, protecting the blockchain from being harmed. Download : Download

    network in smart logistics. SDN: software defined networking. Real-time data acquisition,
    data processing and data analytics. The data collected by IoT sensors are processed
    locally or at the data center level to perform real-time tasks such as anomaly
    detection, detection of operational faults in sensors, etc. for the global monitoring
    and managing of the transportation system. Since smart devices are integrated
    and deployed in multi-technology environments such as IEEE 802.11, LTE-V, or 5G,
    the flow optimization for multi-RAT connections and context-aware resource allocation
    subject to high-rate, low-latency, and high-reliability requirements are critical
    challenges in smart network performance. Thus, efficient resource allocation techniques
    have to be conceived to meet next-generation networking requirements. Safety and
    security: Although blockchain offers numerous benefits to the logistics sector,
    it also poses a number of concerns for their safety, security, reliability, and
    privacy due to its heavy reliance on its characteristics. Furthermore, because
    blockchain applications will be connected with other stakeholders and supply chain
    entities, this connectivity must be secure [5]. Malicious attacks or illegal access
    to such networks could have negative repercussions for the sector''s operations
    and infrastructure, as well as its stakeholders and customers [93]. Despite the
    fact that blockchain can withstand major security threats such as selfish mining,
    Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Sybil, ransomware attacks, etc., the existing
    blockchain has some security gaps. For example, if more than half of the blockchain
    systems have control over computing resources, they can change consensus mechanisms
    and prevent new transactions from being approved for illicit reasons, which is
    referred to as the 51% attack [94]. Message hijacking and DDoS attacks are still
    possible using blockchain technology, and these attacks are the most common on
    blockchain networks [62]. DDoS attackers try to take down the network''s mining
    process, as well as e-wallets, cryptocurrency exchanges, and other financial services
    [93]. On a network of blockchains, DDoS attacks are impossible to carry out. A
    Sybil attack occurs when an attacker impersonates a significant number of people
    at the same time [95]. Selfish mining is a bitcoin mining approach in which a
    group of miners work together to boost their profits. Another important issue
    highlighted in Ref. [62] regarding implementing a blockchain-based solution for
    the supply chain is the privacy of manufacturers and suppliers. Any supply chain
    participant or stakeholder with access to the shared blockchain could be a rival
    of the manufacturers and suppliers, gaining unauthorized information from the
    blockchain. Furthermore, smart logistics components are vulnerable to cyber attacks
    due to the integration of 6G or 5G technologies into the smart logistics sector.
    Since the devices are cheap and easy to temper with, and their growing number
    in dense networks puts tremendous pressure on security applications. Therefore,
    we emphasize that the convention security application cannot be directly applicable
    in 6G; thus, we need to investigate more reliable secure platforms for secure
    and efficient communications. Hence, providing an adequate level of cyber security
    has become an issue of vital importance that must be addressed in smart logistics.
    If not addressed, the cyber-attack can compromise the whole operation of a smart
    logistic network, which eventually may inflict enormous damage that cannot be
    tolerated by the industry. In next-generation networks, we emphasize that autonomous
    methods to detect cyber-attacks in 6G-enabled smart logistic networks must be
    studied. And recent blockchain studies can promisingly help us to address this
    issue. 7. Conclusions This paper explores the different aspects of blockchain-enabled
    next-generation smart logistic networks. Existing literature on blockchain technology
    in smart cities and smart logistics is analyzed. We have highlighted motivational
    examples to show the necessity of integrating 6G and blockchain in smart cities
    and smart logistic networks. Comparative analysis between 5G and 6G technology
    is highlighted to examine why the 6G network will be compatible with the smart
    network. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from
    the security and resource management context. In this paper, we have also introduced
    five use cases with real-world initiatives where blockchain technology can be
    used in smart logistics. These use cases are single digital window, cross-sector
    domain application, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, freight, and traceable luxurious
    goods. Later, some key challenges of using blockchain in smart logistics were
    identified, such as interoperability, scalability, the convergence of technologies,
    real-time data acquisition, and security, and possible solutions for these concerns
    were explored. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they
    have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
    have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. References [1] A.

    viewPrecision agriculture 1. Introduction Agriculture is the world''s most prominent
    source of food [1]. The rapid increase in the world''s population is going to
    yield an enormous demand for food in the near future. Additionally, agriculture
    is the world''s largest consumer of water, with a constantly rising demand. This
    causes challenges, which include pollution, scarce resources, arable land limitations,
    and crises related to weather conditions, and raises the need for innovative and
    sustainable agricultural solutions [2,1,3]. Such solutions include smart agriculture
    [4] and precision agriculture concepts [5,6] in which the former refers to using
    cutting-edge technologies in farm management systems to improve productivity and
    sustainability [7] while the latter is about using technologies to ensure that
    agricultural resources, such as soil and seeds, get exactly what they need for
    optimum health and productivity. The smart global agriculture market is expected
    to reach $15.3 billion by the end of 2025 [8]. New technologies and innovations,
    including the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, machine learning, artificial
    intelligence (AI), data analytics, computing technologies, and big data, all play
    a vital role in its development [5,9,10,11,12]. As one of the most promising enablers,
    the IoT is considered a paradigm shift in the advancement of the smart agriculture
    field [2], and it is predicted to blur the borders between the physical and the
    virtual world. This is done by equipping things (i.e., devices, machines, objects)
    with processing power and connecting them in a way that enables them to communicate
    and exchange information without the need for human involvement [13,14]. In agricultural
    use cases, the IoT integrates hardware and software, such as sensors, drones,
    actuators, smart vehicles, big data analytics, cloud computing, and AI. This yields
    an enormous amount of heterogeneous data, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, the amount of rainfall, leaf wetness, temperature, soil electric conductivity
    (EC) and PH level, luminance salinity, climate, solar radiation, pest movement,
    and human activities as well as pictures and videos taken by drones [2,5,10].
    The data can be transmitted by wireless sensor networks (WSNs), stored and analyzed
    through cloud computing and sophisticated analytic methods. In this regard, computing
    technologies, AI, and machine learning come together to provide insightful information
    and enhanced decision-making, and the data flow in and out of the system is facilitated
    through the IoT [5,15]. Additionally, the IoT can give farmers system access from
    remote places via tablets or smartphones [16]. Consequently, numerous benefits
    have been identified for using the IoT and related technologies in agriculture:
    authentication and traceability of food [17], frost protection, improvements in
    greenhouse systems, fertilization [[18], [19]], irrigation, water consumption
    [20,21], optimal conditions for vegetables and animals, resource usage efficiency,
    agriculture supply chain efficiency and transparency, production optimization
    due to market conditions, cost minimization, profit maximization [3], and food
    safety and quality [22]. The abovementioned challenges and the IoT''s transformative
    potential have attracted substantial scholarly attention. Consequently, the number
    of publications has increased rapidly over the past years, which accentuates the
    need for studies that condense the existing body of knowledge and derive future
    research areas. Although several researchers have investigated related topics,
    a systematic and comprehensive approach is still missing. In the existing literature,
    we found systematic reviews related to the IoT and agriculture in which the authors
    investigated topics such as the IoT''s role in food supply chain and food safety
    [22,23], food quality management [24], irrigation approaches [20], protected agriculture
    [25], ZigBee Smart Agriculture [26], and IoT applications in agriculture [18].
    However, to the best of our knowledge, no recent study has used a bibliometric
    analysis to comprehensively investigate the complete interplay between the IoT
    and agriculture. Additionally, it is unclear which agricultural resources are
    impacted the most by the introduction of the IoT. To fill these gaps, our study
    is based on a structured literature review [27] and is guided by the following
    research questions: 1 What are the publication dynamics in agricultural IoT research
    (i.e., top journals, countries, papers)? 2 What are the most important topics
    in agricultural IoT research? 3 Which agricultural resources are impacted by the
    IoT? The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly synthesizes
    past literature reviews on the IoT and agriculture. Section 3 outlines the methodology,
    and in Section 4, we present the main findings, including descriptive statistics
    pertaining to leading journals, countries, papers, keyword co-occurrence and cluster
    analysis, treemap analysis, and an identification of trending topics. In Section
    5, we outline the impact of the IoT on numerous agricultural resources and summarize
    emerging future research themes. The discussion in Section 6 sheds some light
    on how the IoT is currently deployed in agriculture and highlights potential changes
    and trending topics. We conclude the paper in Section 7 with some limitations
    and an outlook on future research. 2. Literature reviews on the IOT and agriculture
    Several research studies have discussed agricultural IoT applications. The studies
    listed in Table 1 predominately applied traditional literature reviews (LR) or
    systematic literature reviews (SLR) to synthesize the IoT literature and derive
    novel insights. Numerous dimensions of deploying the IoT in the agricultural sector
    have been investigated, varying from evaluating the status of IoT applications
    in farming activities [20] and exploring IoT architectures for food control [23],
    to examining the fusion of IoT and agriculture UAVs in smart farming [28,29].
    For example, Tzounis et al. [3] conduct a review of recent IoT technologies in
    the agricultural sector with a focus on their value-generating potential for future
    farmers and the barriers inhibiting a wide-scale implementation. They find that
    the IoT can optimize production by moving farmlands and greenhouses from a precision
    to a micro-precision model of agricultural production, thereby enabling optimal
    growing conditions for agricultural resources, including seeds and livestock.

    Shi et al. [25] summarize the state-of-the-art of IoT applications in protected
    agriculture and describe the system design and key technologies that contribute
    to this mode of modern agriculture. The authors find that the IoT has a significant
    impact on three main fields of protected agriculture; namely, plant management,
    animal farming, and agri-food supply chain traceability. In this regard, several
    challenges still lie ahead, including reliability, expansibility, universality,
    endurance and intelligence level, operational issues, and cost. Friha et al. [1]
    carry out a comprehensive review of emerging technologies for IoT-based agriculture.
    Their findings indicate that key enabling technologies for agriculture involve
    UAVs, SDN (Software-Defined Network) and NVF (Network Function Virtualization)
    technologies, cloud and fog computing, and middleware platforms. They classified
    IoT applications for smart agriculture into seven groups: smart water management;
    smart monitoring; agrochemical applications; disease management; smart harvesting;
    supply chain management; and intelligent agricultural practices. Based on 167
    papers, Villa-Henriksen et al. [44] analyze the state-of-the-art of IoT applications
    in arable farming, where several challenges, such as spatial data, highly dynamic
    environments, and task complexity, need to be overcome. According to the authors,
    the IoT facilitates monitoring of agricultural resources (e.g., soil, water, crops),
    documentation and traceability, forecasting, and controlling. In a recent study,
    Zhang et al. [48] review the applications of wearable IoT in precision livestock
    farming, highlighting the importance of the accurate perception of information,
    biocompatibility of wearable IoT, and sustainability monitoring in IoT-enabled
    precision livestock farming. The authors conclude that the majority of wearable
    IoT devices are widely applicable to humans due to their ability to generate accurate,
    dynamic, and sustainable signals. However, in the farming context, IoT wearables
    are rarely customized or applied for precision livestock farming. Since its emergence,
    farmers and agri-food businesses have been scrutinizing the IoT as a game-changing
    agricultural technology. Acknowledging its strengths in addressing several smart
    farming requirements, several reviews have been carried out to better grasp the
    development of IoT and its value-generating capabilities in this sector. For instance,
    Tao et al. [47] summarize the insights from 94 articles and find that IoT agricultural
    systems are applied in fields as varied as irrigation management, soil management,
    precision agriculture, and smart farming. However, these benefits may not be fully
    realized because of concerns pertaining to cost (e.g., hardware cost), system
    adaptability (e.g., environmental variations), data quality (e.g., data reliability),
    and devices suitability (e.g., device standardization). When it comes to bibliometrics,
    a few studies have endeavored to review and examine IoT applications in agriculture.
    For example, Jusoh et al. [20] review the current status of IoT applications in
    irrigation practices and highlight future research directions, leading countries,
    and productive researchers. According to the study findings, the IoT literature
    has witnessed an exponential increase in the number of publications since 2016,
    with the dominance of India and China in this research area. In the same vein,
    Hu et al. [30] provide a bibliometric analysis of operational management in IoT-based
    agriculture, using 112 selected publications. Analyzing co-occurring keywords,
    the authors find that the IoT literature revolves around wireless positioning,
    intelligent irrigation systems, quality monitoring of agricultural products, big
    data, intelligent greenhouse monitoring systems, and remote sensing. From the
    perspective of food safety, Bouzembrak et al. [22] review 48 studies to examine
    the relationships between authors, countries, and content. Through the analysis
    of bibliometric networks, the authors find that IoT applications in food safety
    are still in an early stage. They also point out the dominance of Chinese universities
    in the IoT literature; the current focus on food traceability and monitoring of
    food safety and quality; the prevalent use of sensors in temperature, humidity,
    and location monitoring; and an increasing reliance on internet, radio frequency
    identification (RFID), and WSN. Lastly, Ben-Daya et al. [24] conduct a systematic
    literature review and bibliometric analysis of 144 articles identified on Scopus
    to study the potential, challenges, and roles of the IoT and related enabling
    technologies, such as blockchain on food supply chain quality management. Although
    several reviews have been conducted to synthesize the literature about the use
    of the IoT in agriculture, the use of traditional LRs or SLRs is not always the
    best option because they tend to be subjective, labor-intensive, and ineffective
    for analyzing larger bodies of literature [49]. In contrast, existing studies
    that apply bibliometric methods to examine the IoT are scarce and analyze a relatively
    small sample of papers [22], addressing only a specific activity in agriculture
    [20] or employing bibliometric techniques that differ from the ones in our study
    [24,30]. In this paper, we therefore conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis
    of the existing IoT literature in agriculture and use our findings to derive a
    comprehensive research agenda, with the goal of inspiring scholars and practitioners.
    3. Methodology A bibliometric analysis is a structured approach to grasp the dynamics
    of a specific knowledge domain by applying various tools [50,51,52,53]. In our
    study, we followed existing best practices to carry out a reliable and comprehensive
    bibliometric analysis [54, 55, 56, 57] on the impact of the IoT on agriculture.
    As a starting point, we used an authoritative and reliable academic database,
    the Web of Science (WoS), which provides standardized and high-quality publication
    information [58,59,60,61,62]. Fig. 1 shows our research process and the search
    string we used. We did not restrict the time span and the types of publications
    included. For the analysis of results, we used the visualization software VOSviewer
    [63,64]; for text mining and quantitative analyses, we used the web-based data
    analysis framework Biblioshiny [65]. We identified trends, dynamics, and future
    research directions and, finally, we compiled the available information to describe
    those agricultural resources that are mostly impacted by the IoT. Download : Download

    4. Results from the bibliometric analysis Out of 897 extracted papers, 70 had
    missing data (e.g., abstracts, keywords) leading to a final selection of 827 papers
    from 2948 authors (see Table 2); 4.95% (41) of those were single-authored papers.
    The authors provided a total of 2752 keywords, and 1158 were Keywords Plus. While
    the former regularly describe specific applications or their potential, KeyWords
    Plus include words and phrases that can be found in the references of an article
    but not the article itself, and they help to examine the knowledge structure of
    academic fields [66]. The collaboration index was 3.7. This indicator was suggested
    [67] to provide a single measure for fractional productivity on the basis of Price
    and Beaver''s [68] work. According to this index, a near-zero value denotes the
    dominance of single-authored publications. Table 2. Information regarding data

    the most important journals according to the number of papers published on the
    IoT and agriculture. Sensors leads the list, with a total of 103 articles, followed
    by IEEE Access and Computers and Electronics in Agriculture. In general, journals
    dedicated to information technology and agriculture dominate the list, and no
    journals from fields such as business, management, social sciences, and operations
    research were ranked in the top 20. This indicates that the most important outlets
    focus on IoT applications in agriculture from a technical perspective; this also
    implies a need for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary knowledge that embodies
    the IoT''s multi-faceted characteristics and its societal and business implications.

    papers Table 5 lists the most influential papers, including the authors, titles,
    sources, total citations (TC), and the average citations per year (ACY). The most-cited
    papers investigate the agricultural impact of the IoT in combination with topics
    such as big data analytics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and WSNs. A strong
    focus is placed on the role of the IoT to increase the quantity and quality of
    agricultural produce, maximize operational efficiencies, and foster sustainability.
    According to the ACY, the top three cited articles are publications from Wolfert
    et al. [69], Motlagh et al. [70], and Kamble et al. [71]. Wolfert et al. [69]
    investigate the state-of-the-art of big data applications in smart farming and
    highlight the importance of the IoT for automating farm operations, strengthening
    decision-making capabilities, and supporting precision agriculture. Motlagh et
    al. [70] examine the potential of UAVs for advancing the IoT vision, and they
    find that the data collection capability of the technology is suitable for vegetation
    science, environmental monitoring, forestry, remote sensing, and water area detection.
    Kamble et al. [71] analyze data-driven sustainable agriculture supply chains by
    reviewing 84 journal articles. The authors argue that the IoT facilitates the
    collection and sharing of information in real time and augments sustainability
    through enhanced communication, integration, and cooperation between entities
    of the agri-food supply chain. Finally, we observe again that IoT research is
    mostly published in computer science and engineering journals. Table 5. Most-cited

    6 shows the most popular keywords, either provided by authors (left side) or identified
    by an algorithm (KeyWords Plus on the right side) [85,86]. Taken together, they
    provide researchers with in-depth insights into an article''s content and overarching
    trends in a study domain. Since the keywords used in the search query were “IoT,”
    “agriculture,” and “farming,” it is evident that they were highly ranked among
    the authors’ keywords, followed by “WSN,” “PA (precision agriculture),” “smart
    agriculture,” and “sensor.” The presence of complementary technologies, such as
    “cloud computing,” “ML (machine learning),” “big data,” “AI,” “blockchain,” “UAV,”
    “deep learning,” and communication technologies (“LoRa” and “LPWA”) underscore
    their importance for enabling IoT-based agricultural practices and developing
    precision agriculture. Precision agriculture promises to leverage the power of
    the IoT to drive the next revolution in agriculture, optimize operational efficiencies,
    increase automation, and achieve high crop yields. Besides, “security” and “irrigation”
    have been among the top authors’ keywords. Data security is also of critical importance
    as IoT networks can be subject to attacks that threaten the security of the circulation
    of agricultural products [87] and endanger the authentication, access control,
    and privacy of the stakeholders in the agricultural sector [45]. Table 6. Top

    like “system,” “management,” “design,” “model,” and “architecture” can be found
    in the top 20. These keywords reinforce the need to use cutting-edge technologies.
    Furthermore, KeyWords Plus, such as “management,” “system,” and “model,” reveal
    the relevance of taking social science perspectives to fully grasp the economic
    impact. Also, “security” and “challenges” in IoT-based agricultural development
    are vital research themes, attracting significant attention. 4.5.1. Treemap dynamics
    To finalize the keywords’ analysis, the abstracts’ keywords are also extracted.
    Fig. 3 illustrates the treemap based on keywords dynamics, considering only the
    abstracts. The sizes of rectangles denote their frequency. On the left side, we
    can see that “IoT,” “data,” “system,” “agriculture,” “smart,” “internet,” and
    “agricultural” are the most popular keywords. Abstract keywords frequently describe
    a paper''s content in more depth as compared with authors’ keywords. These include
    important terms related to the IoT, such as “sensor,” “devices,” “monitoring,”
    “network,” and “wireless.” Relevant terms related to farming and agricultural
    resources include “irrigation,” “production,” “crop,” “food,” “water,” “energy,”
    and “soil.” The abovementioned Keywords Plus, consisting of “management,” “model,”
    “systems,” “control,” “performance,” “development,” and “quality,” bolster the
    need for incorporating the IoT in agriculture to improve performance, increase
    efficiency, and address sustainability challenges, such as water and energy consumption.

    Fig. 3. Treemap based on abstracts. 4.6. Trending topics Fig. 4 illustrates emerging
    topics at the nexus of the IoT and agriculture, portrays research hotspots, and
    detects trends based on a log frequency. The composition of topics in the IoT
    reveals that RFID, environmental monitoring, remote monitoring, and GPS were popular
    topics a couple of years ago. The focus then shifted toward the integration of
    low-cost, low-power, and wireless standard-based network protocols and networking
    paradigms to streamline communications and establish a holistic view of all connected
    devices in smart farming and agriculture. Emerging topics, such as Zigbee and
    SDN (Software-defined networks), appear among others that build the foundation
    for precision agriculture applications (e.g., irrigation supervision, fertilizer
    control, water quality management). These emerging technologies offer agile and
    dynamic solutions that respond to the special requirements of IoT-based agriculture
    applications, such as scalability, network reliability, monitoring of network
    services, and manageability of smart agriculture networks. In 2020, a strong focus
    was placed on technologies, such as AI, machine learning, blockchain, big data,
    cloud computing, and sensors. The combination of these technologies accelerates
    the shift toward precision agriculture, which triggers the necessary tools to
    maximize production, eliminate waste, and improve the overall quality of agricultural
    products. Download : Download high-res image (316KB) Download : Download full-size

    co-occurrence analysis to cluster the dynamics between the IoT and agriculture.
    This relational bibliometric tool enables researchers to identify knowledge divergence
    and research foci in a knowledge domain [53]. To implement the method, all the
    papers that we identified above were analyzed. The authors’ keywords (unit of
    analysis) were extracted, reviewed, and refined if necessary. For example, we
    replaced full-length keywords with abbreviations (e.g., “Internet of Things” with
    “IoT”). Then, we imported the data into VOSviewer. The network was generated by
    conducting density-based spatial clustering, using the full counting method [88].
    The minimum frequency of keyword occurrences was set at four (Table 7), and a
    network with five clusters, each with different colors, was generated (see Fig.
    5). Each node in the figure represents a keyword. The node''s size reflects the
    keyword''s co-occurrence frequency, and the density is illustrated by the closeness
    of the nodes. Table 7. Keyword clustering parameters. Type of analysis Keyword

    network. The most significant cluster (red) revolves around the core role of the
    IoT in agriculture. With the emergence of the IoT, a paradigm shift has become
    evident, leading to the advent of precision agriculture. The IoT represents a
    major driver of precision agriculture that integrates several technologies, including
    WSN, to improve operational efficiencies and productivity in the agricultural
    sector [2]. WSNs consist of numerous sensors that transmit data through a wireless
    network based on communication technologies, such as LoRa (Long Range communication),
    LPWA (Low Power Wide Area network), and LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Networks)
    [21,89]. As a highly popular and preferred technology for IoT systems, LoRa is
    a representative network of LPWAs that supports the development of secure, scalable,
    and efficient networks, with high node capacity, battery longevity, and interference
    immunity. In agriculture, LoRa wireless plays a key role in monitoring soil conditions,
    air temperature and humidity, and light intensity in greenhouses by capturing
    data from LoRa nodes and forming a star network topology that enables efficient
    wireless communication over very long distances and with scalability [72]. Moreover,
    crop information and meteorological data can be obtained from an IoT via LoRaWAN
    networks and leveraged to make smarter irrigation decisions, environmental monitoring
    [90], and highly customizable farming management [91]. The green cluster illustrates
    blockchain technology''s role in agriculture. Researchers in this cluster study
    the improvements that blockchain-based IoT systems can bring in cyber-physical
    systems, peer-to-peer agriculture, and the food supply chain. These contributions
    include improvements in security, privacy, transparency, traceability, scalability,
    and monitoring capabilities [33, 11]. With the immutable and decentralized nature
    of blockchain technology, all the stakeholders in the agricultural sector can
    participate in a transparent, open network and exchange data without the need
    for a central authority [92]. Furthermore, in the era of industry 4.0, blockchain
    technology can help to achieve the sustainability goals of the agri-food supply
    chain [93,94,95]. The blue cluster is an assemblage of various technological enablers
    that support the implementation of smart farming. The development and deployment
    of emergent and cutting-edge technologies in smart agriculture have attracted
    significant attention from scholars [5]. These technologies include cloud computing,
    AI techniques (e.g., ML, deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN)),
    big data, fog computing, edge computing, and decision support systems (DSS). An
    IoT platform that integrates computing and other technologies is therefore a promising
    solution to achieve a complete information system. In this regard, the enhancement
    in IoT devices and data storage and analysis capabilities is an urgent issue that
    needs to be addressed. Similarly, there is a need for more powerful and efficient
    computing systems [96]. Cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing, and their
    combinations have attracted scholars’ attention [97,98,96,99]. For instance, cloud
    computing can be used to store large amounts of data concerning agricultural production,
    automate control of agriculture processes, support large-scale and affordable
    computing systems, and enable agricultural experts to make accurate and evidence-based
    judgements [25]. With the help of fog computing, it is feasible to design creative
    IoT agriculture platforms that allow large-area data collection and analysis,
    integrate limited network information resources, and automate agricultural monitoring
    [100]. Farmers can take advantage of the capabilities of fog computing to tackle
    the problems inherent in conventional centralized cloud servers, including high
    communication latencies and the inability to ensure scalability, interoperability,
    location awareness, real-time interactions, and large bandwidth. Edge computing
    is another promising technology that recently captured scholars’ interest [101]
    due to its ability to tackle cloud server load challenges caused by large area
    coverage and to monitor agricultural devices, such as irrigation and variable-rate
    fertilizer equipment, and ensure their proper functioning and maintenance. As
    a result, the fusion of the IoT and computing technologies can level up agricultural
    production efficiency, cost effectiveness, and sustainability by devising wise
    water management, smart irrigation systems, and precision irrigation [102,103].
    In the era of agriculture 4.0, farms need to be more intelligent. Smart farming
    that encompasses interconnected sensors, machines, and other technologies will
    produce more and more data (big data) that need to be analyzed to provide better
    decision support and predictions [104]. In this regard, AI and machine learning
    are useful in agriculture to predict crop yield, soil properties, irrigation requirements
    and weather, disease detection, and market estimations [24]. Furthermore, deep
    learning is also expected to power the IoT, with the goal of improving efficiency
    and increasing information quality related to crop yield, soil health, and disease
    resistance. Combining this data-hungry technology with the IoT also serves to
    analyze and extract valuable knowledge from the massive amounts of data collected
    from various IoT nodes, thereby easing several agriculture tasks, such as crop
    yield estimation, weather prediction, pest identification, and obstacle detection.
    Harnessing new technologies alongside the IoT moves conventional agriculture to
    a data-driven and learning system, which is bound to change and continually improve
    [15]. The yellow cluster on the upper right is about the role of drones or UAVs
    in agriculture. With Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and other
    technologies’ further development, drones are increasingly put to use in the military,
    smart cities, and industry—and agriculture is no exception [105]. So far, using
    drones as a remote device to monitor crops has been the main application area
    [106]. Drones’ data transmission through wireless sensor networks and big data
    analytics is vital to capitalize on this technology. Drones can supply a wide
    variety of agricultural resources, such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides
    [107]. Furthermore, farm analysis, time saving, higher production, integration
    with cameras, and GIS mapping are among the benefits of utilizing drones in precision
    farming and the agricultural supply chain [105]. Finally, the last cluster, shown
    in purple on the lower left, highlights the role of industry 4.0 and agriculture
    4.0. Industry 4.0 depends on the real-time connection of physical and digital
    systems along with emerging technologies to change the way work is done and managed
    [108]. In industry 4.0, the IoT has the potential to bring auspicious transformational
    solutions to existing agricultural systems and hasten the pace of IoT penetration
    in agriculture 4.0. With the support of agriculture 4.0, farmers are equipped
    with sufficient tools to control operational processes, reduce costs, and establish
    food traceability systems that are able to reinforce the supervision of agricultural
    products and food safety. 4.8. The IOT and agricultural resources In this section,
    we draw on the RBV and analyze the impact of the IoT on agricultural resources.
    According to Barney [109], the RBV posits that a firm''s competitive positioning
    is determined by its unique resources, capabilities, and the relationships among
    them. From a RBV perspective, resources can be conceptualized as a firm''s processes,
    capabilities, and assets. Several scholars argue that the RBV is useful in identifying
    those factors that determine the competitive advantage of businesses [110,111].
    Based on the insights derived from the bibliometric analysis (i.e., keywords,
    trending topics, and cluster analysis), we identified ten agricultural resources
    that are strongly impacted by the introduction of the IoT. These include seeds
    [112,113], soil [114,115,116,117], water [118,119,120,121], fertilizers [122,123,124],
    pesticides [125], energy [126,127,128,129], livestock [69], human resources [130,131,132],
    and technological infrastructure [133,134]. Since the RBV also includes intangible
    assets [135], we also consider business relations as a critical resource [136]
    that can be significantly impacted by IoT implementation (see Fig. 6). For each
    resource, we outline several insights in the following sections and then further
    develop them into research propositions. Download : Download high-res image (222KB)

    resources. 4.9. Key resources 4.9.1. Seeds In agriculture, seeds are of vital
    importance for product quality and safety. The characteristics and growth rate
    of seeds are key parameters for crop growth [137]. To ensure optimized seeds,
    farmers can use the IoT to manage crops at a micro scale [138]. As such, the sensors
    used in agricultural activities can be placed throughout the fields to control
    the humidity and temperature of the surrounding air, thereby providing real-time
    data on the environmental conditions that are influencing seeds and plants. With
    the use of the IoT, farmers can access a wide variety of information related to
    phytosanitary conditions and seedling production measures, which impact the quality
    and safety of crops [139]. According to [139], IoT platforms provide access to
    information associated with quality, safety, and the process of seedling to be
    used in a crop. Moreover, the IoT accelerates the pace toward precision agriculture,
    allowing farms to optimize yields and minimize the use of seeds [138]. Precision
    agriculture using the IoT is expected to facilitate the analysis of weather changes
    to assist farmers in understanding ongoing weather patterns and their impact on
    crops [140]. Relying on the IoT, it is possible to identify whether a climate
    is adequate for the growth of crops and select seeds that will bring a high yield
    given a specific climate type. Combined with vision-based technologies, IoT sensors
    are helpful to determine the distance and depth for sowing seeds. In this regard,
    Santhi et al. [141] develop Agribot, a sensor and vision-based autonomous robot,
    to sow seeds with the help of global and local maps generated from GPS and a personal
    computer for the on-board vision system. Shadrin et al. [142] develop a smart
    agriculture IoT system to monitor crops, using the test case of controlling seed
    germination. Based on the combination of low-power wireless sensor nodes and AI,
    it is possible to gather data throughout the different stages of germinated seeds.
    In the same vein, Ammad Uddin et al. [143] propose a system for crop monitoring
    from the phase of seed germination to harvest. The benefits of such a system include
    optimization of crop quality and quantity, efficient use of resources, and resistance
    to harsh weather. The application of the IoT for the traceability of seeds is
    conducive to more effective agricultural practices, appropriate land use, and
    a high quality of produce. For example, [139] design an IoT-based greenhouse traceability
    system for the tracking and recordkeeping of seedlings and other agricultural
    products in the germination and growth periods. The authors argue that the implementation
    of this system not only helps to enhance the mode of agricultural production but
    also to establish high-quality standards and commercial value. Therefore, with
    the support of the IoT, farmers can develop a variety of high-quality seeds and
    maximize their profitability by effectively adapting to the weather circumstances.
    Accordingly, this leads to the following hypotheses for future investigations:
    - The use of the IoT positively impacts the quality of seeds. - The use of the
    IoT positively impacts the productivity of seeds. - Soil Soil represents a vital
    non-renewable resource in agriculture, and its sustainability is imperative. As
    soil is threatened by erosion and degradation, there is an opportunity to use
    the IoT for the protection of this critical resource. For instance, the IoT has
    paved the way for productive practices to cultivate soil thanks to the use of
    low-cost sensors, actuators, and affordable internet-based communication technologies
    [144]. IoT devices can aid in capturing the pH levels of soils and the rate of
    Nitrogen depletion in the form of time-series data and exchange it among interested
    researchers and agriculturists for further analysis [83]. Standard chemical soil
    analyses, which are costly and time consuming, can be substituted by IoT sensors
    that record the macro and micronutrients, salinity, and pH levels of the soil
    [145]. Several studies have already examined the role of the IoT to facilitate
    soil management. Jayaraman et al. [83] propose an IoT-based platform called SmartFarmNet
    to automate the capture of soil data, automatically correlate such data, and remove
    invalid data from the perspective of evaluating crop performance. Goap et al.
    [146] use real-time sensing of soil characteristics (e.g., moisture, temperature)
    in combination with weather predictions to develop a fully autonomous irrigation
    system. Likewise, Rawal [147] presents an IoT-based irrigation system to monitor
    soil, adjust the working of water sprinklers to moisture levels, and automate
    the irrigation process. The IoT is envisioned to offer in-situ monitoring capabilities
    (e.g., temperature, soil moisture, salinity) and interconnect with available field
    equipment (e.g., seeders, irrigation systems, harvesters) to enable full-field
    autonomy and more efficient agricultural production systems [148]. Relying on
    data from underground IoT sensors, farmers maintain real-time information about
    soil, thereby making more effective decisions. Furthermore, the IoT allows the
    reduction of detrimental environmental impacts due to its ability to provide instant
    reaction to alert events, including soil erosion. Therefore, the use of the IoT
    in agriculture eases the analysis of soil conditions and other related measures,
    optimizes production efficiencies, and enhances the predictive capabilities of
    farmers to avoid the risk of damaged soil and wasted harvest. On the basis of
    these arguments, we suggest the following hypotheses: - The use of the IoT positively
    impacts the properties of soil. - The use of the IoT promotes the sustainable
    management of soil. - Water Water constitutes a crucial resource for agriculture,
    and the promotion of water stewardship is vital. The IoT emerges as the opportune
    solution for smart water management applications due to the limited integration
    of existing technologies [102]. The deployment of the IoT can benefit several
    applications in agricultural landscape, including irrigation, because the technology
    can help farmers to optimize water usage [146], addressing the problem of water
    scarcity. Developing an IoT-based irrigation scheduling and decision support system
    is expected to provide increased control over farmland water requirements [149].
    Furthermore, the integration of the IoT can conserve water resources thanks to
    the capability of the technology to precisely monitor soil and environmental conditions,
    which are then used for anticipating timely water needs. In this context, Bu and
    Wang [150] propose a system that combines several technologies, such as the IoT,
    AI, and cloud computing, to increase agricultural production by making intelligent
    decisions in real time, such as identifying the amount of water required for optimizing
    crop growth. Such a system is compelling for farmers to create precision water
    applications based on the conditions of single plots in a field and, to an even
    greater extent, at the single plant level. As a result, the IoT can reduce water
    use across a wide variety of agricultural activities and improve water quality
    by sensing chemicals, temperature, pH, moisture, turbidity, dissolved oxygen,
    and conductivity [77]. Overall, the IoT urges for the development of proper water
    management by measuring the exact amount of water needed for irrigation and by
    avoiding excessive water consumption. Therefore, we formulate the following hypotheses
    for testing in future studies: - The IoT can help to use water more efficiently.
    - The Iot can help to improve the quality of water. - Fertilizers Fertilizers
    are considered key resources in agriculture to enhance crop growth, yield, and
    food quality. The excessive and inefficient use of fertilizers for agricultural
    production can bring about economic losses and high water and nutrient wastage,
    thereby resulting in environmental degradation [151]. As a result, it is essential
    to ensure the timely and adequate use of fertilizers to increase crop productivity
    and reduce environmental impacts. The incorporation of the IoT in agriculture
    can achieve efficient and effective fertilizer management and help farmers to
    better control the usage of fertilizers, improve crop quality, and minimize farming
    costs [80]. The deployment of IoT sensors across farms enables farmers to gain
    insightful information related to the amount of fertilizers used. For example,
    Pahuja et al. [152] develop an online climate monitoring system in greenhouses
    to monitor fertilization, irrigation, and climate. The proposed system uses a
    WSN to collect and extract insights from the analysis of sensed data. Farooq et
    al. [45] argue that the IoT can identify contaminated soil and protect the field
    from over-fertilization and crop losses. Ayaz et al. [145] also note that novel
    IoT-based fertilizing methods are used as an aid to estimate the spatial patterns
    of nutrient needs with higher precision and minimum labor efforts. Such accuracy
    and precision can enhance fertilizer efficiency while minimizing the negative
    side effects on the environment. In addition, IoT-based fertilization systems
    are more efficient than classic methods in terms of savings in water resources
    and the amount of fertilizers [153] because the technology can automatically monitor
    soil nutrients and alert farmers about the quantity of fertilizer to be applied
    during the cultivation of land. Therefore, the use of the IoT for fertilization
    helps farmers to optimize fertilizing efficiency, positively impacts the propagation
    of seeds, and reduces pollution caused by the use of chemical fertilizers to the
    soil [154]. Summarizing these discussions, the following hypotheses are proposed
    for future testing: - The IoT positively impacts the timing and efficiency of
    fertilizers. - The IoT reduces negative environmental impacts of fertilizers in
    agriculture. - Pesticides Pesticides are a necessary resource in agriculture to
    avoid pests and disease, reduce bacterial damage, and improve crop yields and
    production quality [155,125]. However, the excessive use of pesticides can lead
    to severe health and environmental damage (e.g., soil acidification, pollution
    of surface water) as well as cost increase and money loss due to wasted labor
    resources or soil acidification [156,157]. In conventional agriculture, the problem
    intensifies because the early detection of pests is nearly impossible. In other
    words, when farmers become aware of pests, high amounts of pesticides are needed.
    Hence, negative consequences will be severe for farmers [155]. Incorporating cutting-edge
    technologies, such as the IoT, can help farmers reduce these adverse effects,
    decrease costs, and participate in more eco-friendly farming. For example, the
    IoT can be used to achieve near-zero consumption of pesticides in greenhouse use
    cases [158]. Wu [159] develops an intelligent agricultural system based on the
    IoT to integrate the monitoring data of soil, sunlight, temperature, and information
    from the Central Weather Bureau and inform farmers of the precise amount of pesticides
    necessary for disease control. In addition, Li et al. [160] develop an intelligent
    platform for strawberry planting management based on the IoT. They report a decrease
    in pesticide usage by 61.67% and in pesticide costs by 32.48%. Chen et al. [155]
    combine AI techniques and the IoT for pest prediction and identification. Their
    experimental results depict 90% percent accuracy in pest identification. This
    precise and early identification leads to the accurate utilization of pesticides
    in terms of time and place. As a result, the use of the IoT in agriculture is
    expected to reduce the damage to soil and the environment. To summarize, IoT implications
    in pesticides management involve pest detection, pesticides’ economics, and environmental
    consequences. We formulate the following hypotheses to be tested in future works:
    - The IoT makes pest detection more efficient. - The IoT positively impacts the
    timing, efficiency, and overall economics of pesticide application. - The IoT
    reduces the environmental impact of pesticides in agriculture. - Energy Energy
    is a crucial resource for all economic sectors, including agriculture [126]. Energy
    management has gained momentum due to its essential role in economic development
    and human well-being. Population growth and the increase in food demand are among
    the factors that lead to increased energy consumption. National resources are
    regularly limited and intensive energy consumption causes severe health and environmental
    problems. Consequently, sustainable solutions are needed to cope with the increasing
    energy demand, and several initiatives in energy management strive to address
    these challenges [161,162,129]. The IoT can integrate various parts of the energy
    chain, including supply, transmission and distribution, and demand. It can foster
    sustainable energy management by improving energy efficiency, promoting the use
    of renewable energy, and decreasing the environmental impact of energy use [163,164].
    In the context of agriculture, IoT sensors can monitor temperature and humidity
    as well as soil moisture and optimize energy consumption based on weather conditions
    and advanced data analytics. In addition, the IoT provides monitoring capabilities
    of crops, soil, and pests. Based on the data collected from IoT devices, energy
    resources can be used effectively and early detection of emergencies is possible
    [2,1]. Energy consumption in agriculture can be divided into direct (e.g., the
    energy usage for irrigation) and indirect (e.g., the energy usage for fertilizer
    or pesticide production of the farm) use cases [129]. For direct energy consumption,
    Benyezza et al. [165] develop a zoning irrigation system based on the IoT. Their
    real-environment experimentation shows a significant decrease in energy and water
    consumption. For the indirect use case, it is found that the IoT can decrease
    energy consumption by reducing the required amount of fertilizers and pesticides
    for cultivation. Moreover, it can reduce waste and maximize crop yields, resulting
    in lower energy consumption for a certain amount of crops [1]. Overall, the IoT
    and the quantum of data produced by IoT devices contribute to more sustainable
    energy management [166,167,168,169]. Thus, we suggest the following hypotheses:
    - The IoT positively impacts energy efficiency in agriculture. - The IoT facilitates
    the incorporation of renewable energy resources. - The IoT facilitates sustainable
    and green energy management. - Livestock With the progressive decline of the family-style
    farming approach in the recent decade, livestock management has steadily become
    intensive and intelligent. The incorporation of ICT to overcome the issues and
    shortcomings of traditional livestock management, boost the productivity of livestock,
    and leverage modernization is of vital significance to achieving stable, sustainable
    development [48]. With the emergence of IoT technologies, farmers would be able
    to maintain improved device communications, automate farm operations, and only
    control and act on activities requiring a higher level of intelligence [69]. Moreover,
    the implementation of the IoT is expected to support traceability systems for
    livestock products since the technology enables producers, consumers, and regulators
    to request and track information related to livestock breeding, processing, and
    transportation, thereby assuring animal food safety and supporting the quality
    management system of animal food [170]. A key advantage of the IoT is also its
    ability to automate communication between agricultural equipment and sensors used
    on the farm. According to Astill et al. [32], this capability leads to automating
    several tasks. For instance, small quantities of feed could transmit an automatic
    order to feed suppliers or elevated levels of ammonia gas and humidity detected
    by environmental sensors can transmit a warning to farmers to increase the ventilate
    rate. Ojo et al. [171] highlight that the IoT can be used to develop a localization
    system that enables real-time livestock location monitoring. Chaudhry et al. [172]
    note that farmers can use the IoT to detect skin temperature and pulse rate of
    animals, which provides enormous insight into animal health and its prediction.
    Finally, Zhang et al. [173] argue that the embedding of the IoT in livestock management
    allows optimal animal feeding and nutrient usage through which improved environmental
    protection, production efficiency, and high-quality products can be achieved.
    To sum up, the following hypotheses can be tested in future studies: - The IoT
    positively impacts livestock production systems. - The IoT contributes to animal
    welfare. - The IoT reduces the negative environmental impact of livestock management.
    - Human resources The critical role of human resources in firms’ success is undeniable.
    Several researchers have outlined the vital importance of human resources management
    in achieving competitive advantage and superior performance [174,175,176]. The
    IoT can bring enormous opportunities to human resources in agriculture, and it
    has the potential to equip farmers with significant monitoring and control capabilities.
    For example, IoT use cases include bee swarm [177], dairy cattle and crops status
    [178], environmental indexes, like soil moisture, humidity, and temperature [179,180],
    field indexes [181], and pest monitoring and control [155]. The IoT can also provide
    farmers with prediction and decision support capabilities. Emergency prediction
    (e.g., extreme weather conditions, diseases) is vital information that the IoT
    enables in agriculture [2]. Additionally, potential crop malfunctions and related
    solutions [182] as well as expert systems for evaluating agricultural land suitability
    [183] are examples of the enabling role of the IoT in prediction capabilities.
    Furthermore, automation is one of the IoT''s major contributions. Successful large-scale
    farm management needs a massive amount of information, analysis, operational works,
    supervision, and knowledge. The IoT can automate all these tasks, thus providing
    farmers significant time, work, and cost savings [184]. With the support of IoT
    capabilities and automation, farmers can better engage in the planning stage,
    make more informed and timely decisions, and concentrate on more strategic tasks.
    Moreover, the IoT and its enabling technologies can contribute to workforce health
    and safety, for instance, by using IoT-based robots or UAVs for unhealthy and
    unsafe operations [185]. As a result, the IoT can lead to increased job satisfaction
    and engagement. The IoT also reduces the need for the workforce and can bring
    substantial cost savings [101]. This is intriguing, specifically in developed
    countries in which workforces are scarce. Briefly, the IoT can contribute to developing
    more skilled workers, who are hard to find in developing countries [1]. Based
    on the previous discussions, we highlight the following hypotheses: - The IoT
    positively impacts human resource efficiency in agriculture. - The IoT positively
    impacts human resource safety, health, and job satisfaction. - Technology infrastructure
    Technology is a crucial resource in organizations. Economic development, national
    competitiveness, industrial growth, and firms’ competitive advantages largely
    depend on technological advances [133,134]. Technological infrastructures in agricultural
    development can be divided into four stages. These revolutions include human and
    animal resources in agriculture 1.0; mechanization and powered machinery in agriculture
    2.0; computer, internet, and high-speed development in agriculture 3.0; and the
    IoT and other cutting-edge technologies in agriculture 4.0 [1]. The IoT represents
    one of the most promising technologies that will hugely impact and transform business
    routines and value creation even more than it has already [186]. The IoT can provide
    significant benefits for several areas of smart agriculture, including automation,
    monitoring, water management, agrochemicals, disease detection, harvesting, and
    supply chain management among others [1]. The IoT constitutes a significant driver
    of smart farming [187]. Its utilization is considered a paradigm shift due to
    its enabling role in near real-time integration of multiple technologies that
    otherwise should act in isolation or communicate with high costs. With the assistance
    of the IoT, WSNs, UAVs, sensors, geospatial technologies, AI-related technologies,
    computing technologies, end-user applications, and robotics can interconnect and
    exchange data and information [2,5,10,3]. For example, the IoT can provide massive
    amounts of data for data analytics, computing technologies, and AI-related technologies,
    such as machine learning and deep learning in real-time, with high efficiency,
    thereby resulting in improvements in extracting knowledge from the data, monitoring,
    decision-making, and supply chain management [2,1,3]. Besides, the IoT can make
    traditional machinery smart and connected [188]. The IoT can be combined with
    blockchain technology in a way that enables IoT data to be stored, analyzed, transferred,
    and exchanged in a secure, transparent network supported by blockchain and its
    privacy-preserving property [33,11]. As a result, the IoT is transforming the
    infrastructures of agriculture into a more intelligent and data-driven sector
    in which technologies can interact, make decisions, and perform automatically,
    with high efficiency and efficacy [145]. Several scholars have developed IoT-based
    systems that integrate various technologies in precision and smart agriculture
    [189,190,191]. The following hypotheses are extracted from the abovementioned
    discussions: - The IoT positively impacts other technologies’ efficiency in agriculture.
    - The IoT increases communication efficiency between agriculture technologies.
    - Business relations Firms'' relationships with their customers, supply chain
    members, and other key stakeholders are among key resources and success factors.
    Firms should meet their stakeholders’ demands to gain legitimacy and remain competitive.
    Improvements in stakeholders'' relationships can facilitate resource acquisition,
    resource and information sharing, regulatory relationships, and strategic alliances
    [192]. The IoT can contribute to stakeholders’ relationships in several ways,
    including integrating supply chain processes, streamlining cooperation, improving
    transparency and tractability, enhancing agility and adaptability, and boosting
    sustainability objectives, such as health and well-being, lower environmental
    impacts, and reduced waste and energy consumption [193,194,195,196]. In the agricultural
    sector, all the supply chain members can easily coordinate and collaborate in
    an IoT-enabled ecosystem. IoT devices provide real-time data of different parts
    of the agri-food supply chain from farm to market. With the help of IoT data and
    analytic capabilities, supply chain members improve their adaptability and agility
    and achieve time savings [194]. Furthermore, with the help of RFID and WSN, transparency
    and traceability of the food supply chain can be ameliorated dramatically [194,81].
    In relation to these capabilities, blockchain technology is a great step forward.
    As such, any supply chain partner in an open and distributed blockchain and IoT-based
    supply chain can check the originality and changes to a product from the beginning.
    Consequently, agriculture stakeholders can be assured of the quality, safety,
    and environmental impacts of products. The IoT can also be substantiated by blockchain
    and smart contracts because they can further improve trust, regulation, and automation
    of supply chain relationships [197,195,198,199,200]. By way of illustration, Awan
    et al. [161] develop a futuristic model that integrates agriculture and food supply
    chain through the IoT and blockchain. Caro et al. [201] use blockchain and the
    IoT to design a decentralized agri-food supply chain management solution. Finally,
    the IoT can foster agri-food sustainability, which nurtures business relations
    and the perceived sense of trust, transparency, and fairness in business transactions.
    To summarize, we formulate the following hypotheses for future examination: -
    The IoT positively impacts business relations in agriculture. - The IoT positively
    impacts supply chain collaboration in agriculture. 4.10. Future research themes
    In Table 8, we put forth an agenda for future research to assist scholars and
    practitioners in understanding and further examining the interplay between the
    IoT and agriculture. The suggested agenda summarizes the transformative potential
    and impact of the IoT in agriculture and advance this research field by highlighting

    Discussion In this study, we investigate the impact of the IoT on agriculture
    and its enabling role for speeding up the transition to precision agriculture.
    Complementing previous review studies on the IoT and agriculture [24,3], our findings
    are based on a large sample of documents published in the last decade. The upcoming
    sections provide an in-depth discussion of the progress in the IoT and agriculture
    and summarize the current state as well as major challenges and trending topics.
    5.1. IoT deployment in agriculture Our review reveals several insights into the
    role of the IoT to support agricultural systems and increase the efficiency of
    their operations [2,97,6,3]. We identified the most-cited papers, which illustrate
    that IoT applications are making great strides toward developing a more sustainable
    agriculture and fulfilling the requirements of precision agriculture. IoT technologies
    attracted increased attention and gained momentum because of their ability to
    support farmers in understanding plant health conditions, resource use, and climate
    circumstances, all of which would be difficult to capture otherwise. Another promising
    approach consists in harnessing wireless networks, blockchain, UAVs, AI techniques,
    and big data analytics to increase the automation of field activities, optimize
    crop yields, improve food quality and safety, reduce energy consumption, and cultivate
    sustainability [24,2,6,3]. Consequently, these technologies offer solutions to
    assist farmers in decision-making [2], create an informed and adaptable rural
    community [77], minimize human intervention [217], enhance predictive capabilities
    [195], reduce pesticide use [222], and improve agri-food traceability [223]. By
    analyzing the keyword dynamics, we found that “IoT,” “WSN,” “PA,” “Smart Agriculture,”
    “Sensor,” “Cloud Computing,” “ML,” and “Big Data” are among the common technologies
    currently explored in the context of agriculture. WSN are key enablers for smart
    agriculture, thanks to their ability to capture, monitor, and analyze the data
    from agriculture [224]. As such, WSN technology integrates IoT sensors to foster
    cooperation, thereby measuring and controlling real-time soil and weather information
    [61], electrical conductivity, automated irrigation, air humidity, irradiation,
    frost protection, and wind speed [[225], [226], [227], [228]]. Cloud computing,
    machine learning, and big data are also key enablers for implementing smarter,
    more efficient, and sustainable agriculture, benefitting agri-food producers and
    consumers. Other themes include “UAV,” “Deep Learning,” “Security,” “ANN,” and
    “Irrigation.” Finally, the analysis of keywords mentioned in the papers’ abstracts
    underscores the importance of \"data,\" \"monitoring,\" \"control,\" \"management,\"
    \"energy,\" \"irrigation,\" \"water,\" and \"security.\" Apart from mirroring
    the profundity and progress of digital transformations, these themes illustrate
    that IoT implementations in agriculture are soaring rapidly. Currently, studies
    are lacking that investigate the fusion of the IoT and other embryonic technologies,
    such as 5 G telecommunications, 3D printing, augmented and virtual reality, vertical
    farms, and bioinformatics in the sustainable establishment of agri-food systems.
    Combining these technologies allows farmers to operate more efficiently and creatively;
    however, both positive and negative impacts need to be investigated in more detail.
    Consequently, our study results unlock and highlight the urgent need for additional
    research that examines how responsible use of the IoT can reshape farming practices
    and policies to realize sustainable and inclusive agriculture supply chains [[229],
    [230], [231]]. 5.2. IoT challenges in agriculture The investigation of the IoT
    in agriculture also uncovers several social problems, such as the lack of necessary
    technical skills and capabilities [[195], [232]], the technological divide between
    large and small-scale farms [[233], [234]], and soaring unemployment [235]. In
    an IoT ecosystem, most of the work is carried out by fully automated and autonomous
    devices, thus reducing the need for human interference and causing job losses
    in the long run. Therefore, the substitution of workforces with IoT technologies
    can cause a critical decline in employment numbers. The second challenge is related
    to the technical limitations of the IoT, such as lack of connectivity, network
    bandwidth and latency, power supply, response time, battery efficiency, incompatibility
    of IoT systems with current farm operations, heterogeneity of data and devices,
    and interoperability [[3], [44], [45], [69], [144], [219], [222]]. The third challenge
    includes privacy and ethical issues, including the absence of privacy protections
    in agricultural systems [33], lack of accountability [[236], [237]], and regulatory
    measures associated with data processing and analysis [54]. The widespread use
    of the IoT therefore necessitates an urgent debate, including topics such as ethical
    dimensions, transparency, inclusiveness, and fairness [[75], [238], [239], [240],
    [241]]. The fourth challenge concerns the organizational barriers to IoT deployment,
    such as reluctance to adopt IoT technologies [242,243], share farm data [75],
    bureaucratic processes and paperwork [[92], [244],44], and culture [[78], [245]].
    In addition, the adoption of IoT technologies and processes alters existing organizational
    structures and requires new skills, talents, knowledge, and costs [71,195,108,[81],
    [246], [247]]. 5.3. Trending topics in the IOT and agriculture When it comes to
    the trending topics at the intersection of the IoT and agriculture, we can see
    that RFID, GPS, remote monitoring, Zigbee, and SDN have recently gained popularity.
    Additionally, emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, AI, machine learning,
    big data, and blockchain, are crucial for digitalization of agriculture and smart
    farming [82,69]. Further interesting areas include yield prediction, irrigation,
    livestock monitoring, plant and animal disease detection, waste reduction, field
    productivity, climate forecasting, pest control, automation, efficient farming
    operations, effective land use, wise water and energy consumption, soil fruitfulness,
    visibility and transparency, automation, efficient traceability, and enhanced
    competitiveness. 6. Research implications 6.1. Theoretical implications To provide
    a foundation for further theorization, Table 9 features research gaps, key theories,
    and suggested methodologies that investigate the interplay of the IoT and agriculture.

    Practical implications Several managerial implications can be derived from the
    bibliometric analysis in this study. First, our findings may assist practitioners
    in determining which technological solutions they can leverage to facilitate IoT
    implementations. Second, we developed a framework that can be used by practitioners
    to better understand IoT application areas, the impact of the technology on agriculture,
    and the challenges that may arise during IoT adoption. When implementing IoT in
    farming activities, we highlight the potential contribution of the IoT to achieve
    sustainability in regards to soil, water, energy, workforce, traceability, and
    business relationships. Third, practitioners need to consider the technical and
    socioeconomic feasibility of incorporating the IoT into agriculture while reiterating
    the resulting ethical and social consequences. Fourth, the RBV framework enhances
    practitioners’ understanding of how the IoT can improve the efficiency of vital
    resources and their interconnections as well as their impact on firms’ competitiveness
    (cost and differentiation advantages) and sustainability goals. Finally, the RBV
    framework facilitates practitioners’ endeavors to achieve superior sustainable
    performance by providing several examples for each resource. 7. Conclusions, limitations,
    and future research In this paper, we carry out a bibliometric analysis to investigate
    the interplay between the IoT and agriculture. We evaluate publications from the
    previous decade, answering three overarching research questions that pertain to
    the publication dynamics in the field, the most important research topics, and,
    finally, the identification of those agricultural resources that are impacted
    by the IoT. In terms of academic output, we observed that IoT research in agriculture
    has significantly increased in the last three years, with most research being
    published in journals dedicated to computer science and engineering. Furthermore,
    supplementary topics, such as WSN, sensors, cloud computing, machine learning,
    AI, blockchain, UAVs, and deep learning, are identified as important technologies
    that can benefit farmers in the near future. We also notice a recent focus on
    AI techniques, big data, and blockchain as trending topics in smart and precision
    agriculture. The integration of the IoT with cyber-physical systems, augmented
    reality, virtual reality, additive manufacturing, and bioinformatics has received
    insufficient scholarly attention so far. As a result, future studies need to investigate
    how the IoT can complement other emerging technologies’ ability to sustainably
    manage soil, water, energy, crops, and animals. In addition, we discuss various
    challenges of IoT implementations in agriculture. Our review has some limitations.
    This study carried out a keyword search query against a single academic database,
    namely, the Web of Science (WoS). Consequently, relevant papers not indexed in
    the WoS have been neglected. Accordingly, future studies can use multiple data
    sources (e.g., Scopus, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar), include supplementary keywords,
    and conduct additional analyses to gain additional findings (e.g., main path analysis,
    meta-analysis). The future of the IoT is entwined with the design of efficient
    and sustainable agricultural systems. Consequently, the directions for future
    research identified here should encourage scholars to pursue rigorous research
    on the IoT and agriculture and explore hitherto neglected areas. We suggest numerous
    research directions and recommend that practitioners and agriculture stakeholders
    investigate the IoT''s impact on their performance. We recommend an integrative
    perspective for evaluating the impact of the IoT on agricultural sustainability.
    The benefits of the IoT can only be reaped if practitioners surmount existing
    challenges of IoT adoption in the agricultural sector. In this respect, we have
    identified several challenges that need to be overcome, most importantly issues
    related to unemployment, privacy and security, and ethics. In summary, our study
    bridges the gap between theory and practice pertaining to IoT applications in
    agriculture. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have

  description: Agriculture has become more industrialized and intensive due to the
    rising demand for food in quality and quantity. Agricultural modernization will
    be made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT), a technology with a great promise
    for revolutionizing the industry. Agricultural products will be in high demand
    by 2050 due to a 30% increase in the global population, so there is a need to
    devise new mechanisms for agriculture, and smart agriculture is one of those mechanisms;
    however, smart agriculture needs to be explored further to realize its potential
    fully. So, to explore the potential of this field, the researchers have used a
    corpus that is extracted from the Scopus database from the year 2008 to the year
    2022 and applied the LDA technique. A corpus of 4309 articles was selected from
    the Scopus database to apply the latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) model to predict
    research areas for smart agriculture. Using IoT technology, farmers and producers
    may better manage their resources, such as fertilizer consumption and the number
    of trips made by farm vehicles, while minimizing waste and maximizing productivity,
    including water, electricity, and other inputs. This data-driven experimental
    study identifies smart agriculture research trends by implementing a topic modeling
    technique previously used in smart agriculture. The authors have created seventeen
    research themes in smart agriculture based on the LDA topic modeling. This analysis
    suggests that the indicated areas are in the growth phase and require further
    research and exploration.

    1. Introduction Digital technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) are reshaping
    agriculture. When it comes to farming, what is IoT? The IoT connects “dumb” devices.
    IoT is all about data [ 1]. Data is becoming a valuable resource for our world.
    Farmers may become more intelligent and safe by using data from gadgets to adapt
    to changing conditions more readily and farm more efficiently [ 2]. To free up
    resources, farmers can use the ability to monitor agricultural conditions and
    infrastructure from afar [ 3]. Many sectors and industries have adopted IoT to
    reduce errors and improve performance in manufacturing, energy, health care, and
    communication [ 1]. Farm devices can collect and deliver data remotely to their
    owners using IoT. Farmers can save time and money using IoT to keep tabs on-farm
    operations and efficiency, make more informed decisions about boosting productivity,
    and respond more quickly to changing conditions. In this case, it is putting data
    ahead of the farmer’s intuition [ 2]. A trough’s water supply, the amount of fertilizer
    to use on a crop, and which ewe to check when lambing are all things a farmer
    could know about. Smart agriculture is necessary since 70% of the farming time
    is spent monitoring and analyzing crop status rather than performing actual field
    labor [ 3]. Given the industry’s size, it needs various technology and precise
    solutions to ensure sustainability while reducing environmental damage. Sensors
    and communication technologies have provided farmers with a remote sight of their
    fields, allowing them to watch what is happening without leaving home. Wireless
    sensors make monitoring crops in real-time with greater precision and, more importantly,
    detecting the early stages of undesirable conditions easier [ 4]. This is why
    “smart agriculture uses innovative equipment and kits from seeding to crop harvesting,
    storage, and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to
    its accurate monitoring capabilities and prompts reporting using a variety of
    sensors. Various autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and
    satellites supplement agriculture equipment [ 5]. Sensors can be instantly deployed,
    started collecting data, and made available for further online study. By enabling
    precise data collection at each area, sensor technology allows crop and site-specific
    agriculture”. IoT and its apps are only scratching the surface of what they can
    do and have yet to impact people’s lives significantly, and everyone can see this.
    However, given the recent rise in IoT technology in agricultural applications,
    we can expect it to play a significant role. Figure 1 summarizes the key factors
    driving agricultural technology.    Figure 1  Technology’s key drivers in the
    agriculture industry. There are reasonable efforts to emphasize the importance
    of IoT in agriculture; most published work [ 6] focuses solely on applications.
    However, in light of the most recent facts and data, most current publications
    either give little insight or place a limited emphasis on diverse IoT-based designs,
    prototypes, advanced approaches, IoT for food quality, and other future issues.
    The current state of IoT-based agriculture research is examined in this paper.
    Farmers are either delaying or refusing to change their traditional techniques,
    which might further depress India’s GDP. Recently skilled migrants from all across
    India who returned to their homelands during the COVID-19 pandemic selected farming
    as a profession and had no plans to return. These migrants may move closer to
    smart agricultural systems since it takes less time to persuade them to use them
    than traditional farmers. (i) Remote monitoring of agricultural infrastructure
    and conditions can save farmers time and labor by reducing the frequency of on-site
    field inspections (ii) Farmers benefit from data analysis (iii) Gaining insights
    from real-time data throughout a value chain allows farmers to respond faster
    to market requests (iv) The food manufacturing process should improve efficiency
    to lower food waste, speed up the time to market, and improve traceability. This
    will allow us to demonstrate to our consumers that our food is safe and sustainable
    (v) Research, development, and adaptation to new technologies ensure continued
    productivity and innovation The first objective of this study is to do a meta-analysis
    of the collected corpus. The second objective is to forecast the present research
    areas and trends as 2, 5, and 10 topics, as highlighted in Table 1. The third
    objective is to examine in-depth the current research trends to assist future
    researchers in determining the correct research directions in the field of smart
    agriculture. Table 1  Topic labels and high-loading research articles. 2. Review
    of Literature IoT is revolutionizing agriculture by bringing together various
    approaches, such as accuracy and conservative farming, to help farmers overcome
    obstacles in the field. Jayaraman et al. [ 7] discussed using IoT, cloud computing,
    mobile computing, and smart agriculture to develop a “phononet” system, an open
    system of wireless sensors that share information and communicate. For many years,
    devices presently labeled as IoT have been deployed in agriculture. The Bosch
    technology corporation provides IoT-based data management strategies to monitor
    agricultural yield and diseases [ 8]. A platform based on IoT developed by Intel
    helps agricultural solutions operate more efficiently by improving the interoperability
    of services [ 9]. As part of the MIT Media Lab Open Agriculture Initiative, Google
    has shared its vision for a more sustainable food system [ 10]. For efficient
    seed planting, “sensors and vision-based technology” help determine the distance
    and depth. An autonomous robot named Agribot is being developed to sow seeds using
    sensors and a vision-based [ 11]. Technology and economic sustainability go hand
    in hand. A study was conducted in Pakistan to determine the commercial viability
    of a proposed crop insurance plan and assess the demand for crop insurance in
    various flood-prone rural districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province [ 12]. Additional
    research revealed that farm households in the study area faced several barriers
    to adapting to climate variability, including a lack of labor, an insecure land
    tenure system, a lack of market access, poverty, a lack of governmental support,
    a lack of access to assets, a lack of water sources, a lack of credit sources,
    and a lack of knowledge and information [ 13]. One study found a link between
    poverty reduction and natural and social capital for sustainable livelihood. The
    research provides empirical and quantitative evidence on poverty alleviation,
    and the conclusions will improve agricultural households’ sustainability [ 14].
    A study also uses natural and agricultural resources in Northwestern Pakistan
    to create a livelihood vulnerability index (LVI), LVI-IPCC, and livelihood effect
    index [ 15]. Further, several noncontact sensing methods for determining the seed
    flow rate are proposed in [ 16], “where the sensors were equipped with LEDs, infrared,
    visible light, laser-LED, and a radiation reception element”. The output voltage
    fluctuates depending on how the seeds move through the sensor and band of light
    rays and how the shades fall on the reception parts [ 17]. Therefore, the seed
    flow rate is calculated based on the signal information about the passing seeds.
    Researchers offer an expert system for evaluating the viability of agricultural
    land in a 2019 study by combining sensor networks with artificial intelligence
    systems such as neural networks and multilayer perceptron [ 18]. The proposed
    method is intended to assist farmers in categorizing agricultural land for cultivation
    into the most suitable, suitable, somewhat suitable, and unsuitable categories.
    In a recent study, researchers used citrus fruits data labeled by a domain expert
    with four severity levels (high, medium, low, and healthy) to train a deep neural
    network (DNN) model to detect disease by severity [ 19]. The model has a 98% likelihood
    of predicting low severity and a 98% chance of predicting high seriousness. In
    a subsequent study, the author takes advantage of blockchain’s potential benefits,
    combines it with SDN, and provides justification for worries about energy consumption
    and security [ 20]. In the most recent survey, authors applied the same blockchain
    technology integration technology to different platforms. LDA was used to anticipate
    blockchain research trends. The researchers have predicted 17 scientific trends
    that deserve more attention. According to the literature, LDA approaches anticipate
    smart agriculture research trends [ 21]. The researcher created a novel routing
    protocol for IoT networks with a cluster topology using a blockchain-based architecture
    for the SDN controller. The research concepts of the existing state of the art
    and its differentiation from the current state are represented in Table 2. Table
    2  Existing and current research differentiation. 3. Topic Modeling Data mining
    is an emerging field to extract data from unstructured formats. Topic modeling
    is a powerful technique in text mining in natural language processing to explore
    the relationship between the data and collected documents [ 22]. This technique
    is used by various researchers in their native fields, like medical, semantic
    analysis [ 23], and engineering [ 24], to conclude the relationship between the
    documents and topics. Techniques like latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), nonnegative
    matrix factorization (NMF), latent semantic analysis (LSA), parallel latent Dirichlet
    allocation (PLDA), and Pachinko allocation model (PAM) were used in the topic
    modeling; among all, LDA is intensively used by researchers. The topic modeling
    technique is similar to the dimensionality reduction technique used for numerical
    data. A bag of words (BOW) is created from the dictionary of words, and topic
    modeling extracts the required features from this BOW. The words contained in
    the corpus are viewed as a significant feature in NLP. NLP considers each word
    as a feature to train the model. This technique helps us find the right content
    instead of analyzing the accurate data. LDA is used to attain a relationship among
    the documents in the collected dataset, and results are represented statistically
    and graphically. To develop LDA, variational exception maximization (VEM) algorithm
    [ 25] is used to estimate the similarities from the corpus. Usually, the top few
    words are picked up from the BOW as this approach lacks semantics in the sentence.
    LDA follows the concept of probabilistic distribution, so each document in the
    corpus portrays the probabilistic distribution of topics, and each extracted topic
    depicts the probabilistic distribution of words. It led to concluding a clear
    vision of the topic connection. LDA is applied to retrieve critical information
    or analysis from unstructured data. For example, research on social media makes
    users understandable reactions and conversations among the people connected in
    social media to conclude the patterns [ 26]. 4. Methodology The stepwise procedure
    of whatever tasks have been completed is affectingly explained, which picture
    quality defines our research methodology to predict the research trends of IoT
    agriculture. The methods used to conduct this review are depicted in Figure 2,
    in which three phases are involved. The first phase of research is data collection;
    in the second phase, collected data is preprocessed; finally, in the third phase,
    data is analyzed, and results are depicted.    Figure 2  Proposed methodology.
    4.1. Corpus The primary sources of data collection and formation of the research
    corpus were the various online digital libraries, journals, and conference proceedings
    available to users through Google Scholar. The search keywords for digital libraries
    have been selected based on topic selection. The research works of Sehra et al.
    [ 27] have influenced them to experiment. The search phrases identified were “IoT
    agriculture”. Scopus is considered the most extensive database for published articles
    globally. The string is run on the Scopus platform, and 4803 articles were extracted
    from the Scopus database. The specific keywords in the publication’s title, abstract,
    and keywords were collected by searching for them in various databases. Further
    processing required inclusion and exclusion criteria to finalize the corpus, so,
    for inclusion criteria, we considered the research papers published in English
    only. Then, the studies concerning IoT agriculture were only considered. Under
    the exclusion procedure, we excluded and removed those studies published in different
    native languages. In addition, studies having missing information like author,
    abstract, title, and year were excluded from the corpus. After applying the requirements,
    4309 studies were considered for the current research. Figure 3 represents the
    year-wise growth in article publication in IoT agriculture. It is clear from Figure
    3 that after 2015 there has been tremendous growth in publications. The leading
    publication is in 2021, 26.43% of the total corpus; in 2020, 21.95% of an article
    was published. In 2022 as per data, there is 0.07% publication, which can be increased
    by the end of the year.    Figure 3  Year publication analysis. This area of research
    is published in various reputed journals. Some top-rated journals or dominating
    journals in IoT agriculture are shown in Figure 4. Dominating journal analysis
    shows maximum participation from the Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,
    which has 134 articles having 0.031%, and this journal belongs to Springer, having
    H-Index 48 and 0.66 as its impact factor.    Figure 4  Dominating journals analysis.
    4.2. Preprocessing It is a preliminary step that processes the dataset or the
    information collected. The objective of preprocessing is to discard the extraneous
    information inside the information. Preprocessing removes unwanted words and characters
    from the accumulated or collected corpus and improves the dataset’s quality. As
    a result, the profile of further processing becomes more accurate and acceptable.
    In the collected corpus, the author used four types of data for LDA modeling:
    title of the paper, year of publication, journal of published article, abstract,
    and keywords of the documents. Further, abstract and keywords are combined under
    the same column. A sample of the loading corpus is shown in Table 3. Table 3  Sample
    of loading dataset. The first step to performing on the uploaded corpus is to
    token the words so that all the abstracts per title are tokenized into tokens.
    The generated tokens are then transformed into lowercase letters for each document.
    In tokenization, the focus is on removing the punctuation marks, single characters,
    and other special characters like “;”, “,”, “.”, “/”, “\\”, “brackets”, “!”. Further,
    any equation or formula used in the abstract was removed. Also, the numerical
    values were eradicated to get a full-fledge textual token [ 28]. Finally, after
    tokenization, the words which have no meaning are removed. The stop words are
    the commonly used words such as “the”, “if”, “but”, “a”, or “an”. These words
    take up space in our corpus and consume valuable processing time. Thus, it becomes
    crucial to remove these stop removals, and here in our experimentation, we have
    used Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This toolkit has stop words stored in more
    than sixteen languages. Here, the English-language stop words in the NLTK library
    and other phrases used to build the corpus were removed from the corpus [ 29].
    Further, stemming is reducing a word to its word stem. Stemming is essential in
    natural language understanding and natural language processing, endeavoring to
    extract the root or core word that is usually appended with the English suffixes
    and prefixes. It erases all the extraneous parts in the word and sources out the
    accurate, meaningful word. For example, use is the core word that can be extracted
    by stemming the word useless, useful, and uses. To prepare an adequate corpus,
    words stem from their original form using the Snowball stemmer algorithm [ 30],
    and the resulting base keywords are stored in the cleansed corpus. Finally, the
    words which were previously stemmed need to be lemmatized. Lemmatization is when
    the context is considered, and stemmed words are converted into more meaningful
    base words or lemmas. This phase targets removing inflected words and outputs
    the dictionary form of a word [ 31]. 5. Latent Dirichlet Allocation Latent Dirichlet
    allocation (LDA) is the most popular technique in NLP, so data is fed to the LDA
    model after preprocessing. Before sending data, bigrams and trigrams are removed
    from the corpus. Two words that occur together are named bigrams, like human resources,
    and the three words frequently occurring together in the document are termed trigrams,
    like human resource management. The LDA model is implemented in python language,
    where the genism library has been used to remove such phrases. Genism’s phrases
    model can build and identify these bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams, or even -grams
    [ 32]; thus, we can remove and improve the data cleansing process. It is also
    part of preprocessing, so after completing this stage, data is sent to the LDA
    model for further analysis [ 49, 67]. LDA topic modeling is based on three input
    parameters, one of which is a list of topics, and the other is hyperparameters.
    Before the distribution of a document’s topic content is the magnitude of the
    Dirichlet. This parameter is regarded as several “pseudowords” equally distributed
    across the document’s topics, regardless of how the document’s other words are
    assigned to topics. is per-word-weight of Dirichlet prior over topic-word distributions.
    The value for this experiment is taken as , where is the desired number of topics
    [ 33], and the has been fixed as 0.01 for all topic solutions. For identifying
    two, five, and ten topic solutions, as suggested by [ 26], the number of iterations
    considered is 1000. Thus, initializing these parameters becomes a concern as the
    values can define the distribution of high-quality topic results. The bag of words
    (BOW) extracted is initially processed in LDA topic modeling, where the most frequently
    and least frequently occurring are removed so the corpus can become absolute.
    This study removes a word frequency of more than 5000 from BOW. The top 20 frequently
    occurring words from the corpus with their frequency are shown in Figure 5, as
    it is clear from the graph that the most occurring keyword is the system, use,
    sensors, internet, agriculture, and many more.    Figure 5  Top 20 words from
    corpus with frequency. Hyperparameters are optimized using Python’s mallet library,
    a JAVA-based NLP package. Then, the mallet package extracts the desired topics
    by training the model using BOW. Unfortunately, no official or proven measure
    exists to find the optimal number of solutions [ 27]. Still, some observational
    parameters are given by Cao and Arun, which helps the researcher decide the optimal
    number of keys [ 55, 68]. Furthermore, the choice of the topic solution has been
    influenced by the heuristics and findings of the studies [ 55, 61, 68, 69]. Finally,
    -mean clustering algorithms are used to find the optimal number of topics from
    the BOW. 6. Topic Labeling Once the topics have been extracted with the help of
    the LDA model, each topic is labeled manually based on the key terms of each topic.
    As a result, there are 4309 articles in the corpus, and out of all documents,
    the top five high-loading papers and their contribution to the topic are mentioned
    in Table 1. 7. Result Analysis 7.1. Parameters of Topic Solutions The loadings
    for two, five, and ten topic solutions have been acquired by deploying the LDA
    model and are presented in Table 1. The selection of two, five, and ten topic
    solutions is based on a coherence score and is influenced by the previous studies.
    The coherence score plays an essential role in finding the semantic similarity
    between the key terms in the topic, and ideally, a 0.3 to 0.6 coherence value
    is considered a good score [ 81]. In this study, coherence values achieved are
    good; for two topic solutions, 0.62; for five topics, 0.58; and for ten topic
    solutions, 0.52 coherence value is reached. Therefore, five topic solutions are
    considered optimal based on coherence value. The dominance of each topic solution
    is also supported by the corresponding count of articles it covers. Table 4 summarizes
    the count of year-wise publications corresponding to each topic solution. Table
    4  Year-wise publication analysis for 2, 5, and 10 topic solutions. The initial
    choice of two topics will broadly depict the core research areas that have been
    widely covered by the researchers in the compiled research literature. Further,
    in five topic solutions, the researchers have explored the research areas. Therefore,
    we have depicted in detail the research areas studied in five topic solutions.
    Further in the hierarchy, the five topic solutions have widened into ten topic
    solutions, with new areas emerging as the research trends in GHRM. 7.2. Topic
    Labeling The core research zones explored and discovered based on the two topic
    solutions are depicted in topics T-2.1 and T-2.2. Let us discuss how this labeling
    has been performed. While implementing LDA on two topic solutions, the keywords
    and their loading has been extracted. The extraction results of LDA depict the
    high-loading articles per topic and the high-loading terms or keywords per topic.
    The labeling process is based on the high-loading keywords that have been collected.
    Thus, in the table, the labeling per topic solution corresponds to the terms extracted
    under the heads T-2.1, T-2.2, and so on; it goes for five and ten topic solutions.
    7.2.1. Core Research Area The two topic solutions present an abstract view of
    the literature dataset and divides it into “Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture”
    (T-2.1) and “Monitoring and Control System in Agriculture” (T-2.2). These two
    significant labels depict the research areas the researchers have extensively
    explored. (1) T-2.1: Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture. Agriculture has
    shaped human civilizations since ancient times. Rapid information and communication
    growth affects agriculture’s structure and operation (ICT) [ 82]. Despite advances,
    hazards may be significant, so smart farming must grasp security and privacy challenges
    before contemplating cyber attacks. Smart farming uses devices, protocols, and
    computer ideas to modernize agriculture. Digital farming changes everything and
    creates effective, efficient, sustainable, and open systems [ 83]. Mobile devices,
    precision agronomy, remote sensing, big data, cloud analytics, cyber security,
    and intelligent systems simplify agricultural technology integration. Incompatibility,
    heterogeneity, equipment constraints, processing, and data security may threaten
    smart farming, but recent years have increased usage of ICTs in agriculture [
    84]. Physical risks and concerns may impede agriculture’s deployment, but agriculture
    4.0 will be the new agriculture standard [ 85]. Simultaneous research is also
    going on in the area to secure smart agriculture. Technology has added to environmental
    problems—list agriculture’s physical threats by category. Population increase,
    urbanization, aging, and technical developments in food production all affect
    agriculture and farmers. Agriculture’s most significant physical hazard is weather
    [ 86]. External factors continually threaten agriculture. In recent decades, technology
    has reduced its influence. Agriculture apps need stable connections, IoT networks,
    and cloud computing [ 87]. External factors continually threaten agriculture.
    In recent decades, technology has reduced its influence. Agriculture apps need
    stable connections, IoT networks, and cloud computing. The sensors can malfunction,
    causing erroneous readings and instructions that could cause a manufacturing failure.
    Temperature, humidity, obstructions, and human presence can impact Lora WAN, Zigbee,
    and other agri-wireless networks, causing data loss. Sensors and networking equipment
    are usually exposed [ 88]. (2) T-2.2 Monitoring and Control System in Agriculture.
    New techniques, technology, and approaches have also helped in agriculture. 35%
    of the world’s workforce works in this profession. Agriculture helps many economies
    to grow [ 89]. It boosts industrialized nations’ economies. India is the second
    largest country that deals in this profession. Every country has practiced agriculture
    since ancient times. Businesses and other areas must support agriculture’s tech
    transformation. The future population rise is frightening. Mid-20th century population
    may have surpassed nine billion counts, so agriculture needs to be strengthened
    to meet the flooding needs. Agricultural engineering challenges include drainage,
    irrigation, crop scheduling, and bio-system optimization. The lack of agricultural
    technology to monitor and manage systems or machinery likely causes these problems.
    The report says control approaches increased seedling growth [ 90]. IoT helps
    in the process of modernizing the agriculture segment by gathering farming data.
    IoT-based agricultural monitoring system wirelessly communicates and disseminates
    the sensor data. Global agriculture uses 70% of available fresh water each year
    to irrigate 17% of the land [ 91]. Growing food requirements and global warming
    reduce irrigated land, a challenge in plague agriculture. FAO predicts global
    food production must rise by 70% to meet population and urbanization needs. Modern
    agriculture uses robotics, automation, and computer systems to replace challenging
    human jobs, so expanding agriculture needs new technologies to be included [ 92].
    Future agricultural technology includes robotics and machine vision. In addition,
    population growth will increase the demand for resources and products. “Sustainability”
    is blended into social, economic, and technological problems to address environmental
    conservation and economic development, and information and control systems will
    be crucial [ 93]. 7.2.2. Five Topic Solutions: Research Areas (1) T-5.1: Intelligent
    Disease Detection Models. India’s economy is mainly based on agriculture. Agriculture
    accounts for 16% of India’s GDP and exports. More than 75% of India’s population
    depends on agriculture. Healthy, high-quality agriculture is essential for economic
    prosperity [ 94]. Detection of plant disease is critical at an early stage. Plants
    can become ill while growing. Early illness diagnosis is a challenge in agriculture.
    Researchers first demonstrated cutting-edge machine learning methods for identifying
    plant illnesses [ 95]. Training parameters are used in modern systems but require
    powerful computers or lengthy training and prediction durations to work. Convolutional
    auto encoder (CAE) network prediction features have been reduced while preserving
    accuracy in this research. Thanks to technological advancements, the world’s population
    of 7 billion people can be fed [ 96]. Changing climates, declining pollinators,
    and plant diseases threaten the ability to produce enough food. Plant diseases
    endanger the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who depend on healthy crops [
    97]. Despite declining yields, smallholder farmers in developing economies provide
    more than 80% agricultural output. Methods for preventing disease already exist
    [ 98]. Pesticides have been replaced with integrated pest management (IPM). Early
    diagnosis is essential for successful therapy. Agricultural extension organizations
    and local plant clinics have long supported disease detection thanks to their
    computer power, high-resolution displays, and broad accessory sets, such as HD
    cameras. Smartphone diagnostics are a first-of-its-kind technology. 5-6 billion
    mobile phones will be in use by 2020. More than two-thirds of the world’s people
    now have access to mobile broadband, a 12-fold increase since 2007 [ 99]. (2)
    T-5.2: Data Security Challenges in Smart Agriculture. Technology, equipment, protocols,
    and computer paradigms are all used to enhance agricultural operations in smart
    agriculture. Big data, artificial intelligence, the cloud, and edge computing
    all store and analyze the data in various forms of storage and archiving. As a
    relatively new field, smart agriculture lacks adequate data security measures
    [ 84]. Farming’s future relies heavily on the availability and quality of data,
    which necessitates the need for security. To maintain security in smart agriculture,
    managing data compatibility, resource constraints, and massive data processing
    [ 100]. Agricultural systems may not be well suited to traditional IoT security
    solutions, resulting in unique demands and possibilities. New agricultural projects
    have been developed to keep up with population increase and food production. The
    success of agriculture depends on productivity, era-specific restrictions, and
    the advancement of science and technology. A lot may go wrong regarding smart
    agriculture, which is still in its infancy. In the future, farmers will rely heavily
    on the availability and quality of data to help them; thus, developing secure
    and stable systems is critical [ 101]. The growth of the agriculture generation
    is depicted in Figure 6, in which agriculture 1.0 started in 1784. In the 20th
    century, agriculture 2.0 came into existence. In 1992 agriculture 3.0 was started,
    and in 2018 agriculture 4.0 if followed.    Figure 6  Agriculture generation.
    Smart agriculture uses IT to increase information perception, quantitative decision-making,
    intelligent control, suitable investment, and personal service [ 102]. In addition,
    current technology boosts agricultural yield and improves security and privacy
    [ 103]. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using automation in smart
    agriculture. Computer-aided farming uses contemporary technology and procedures,
    so in the future, “digital agriculture” will be more productive, efficient, sustainable,
    inclusive, transparent, and resilient agriculture. Many different types of agricultural
    technology may be used in conjunction with one another to increase efficiency
    and productivity [ 104]. (3) T-5.3: Smart Monitoring System in Agriculture. Rainfall
    and temperature fluctuations are very unpredictable. Climate-smart farming is
    becoming increasingly popular among Indian farmers. IoT enables smart agriculture.
    It saves water, fertilizer, and agricultural yields. IoT-enabled automated systems
    and wireless networks are expanding industries. Thus, research into integrated
    sensor technology and the usage of IoT networks in agriculture is reaching the
    level [ 105]. (4) T-5.4: Production and Supply Chain Management in Agriculture.
    The growth of the supply chain and the movement of information are driven by the
    gathering of materials, the transformation of products, and the delivery to end-users.
    Information-driven, “connected supply chains” enable organizations to reduce inventory
    and expenditures; increase product value; extend resources; expedite time to market;
    and retain consumers, among other benefits [ 106]. Supply chain performance determines
    how healthy activities are linked to maximizing customer value and profitability
    at each process stage—the end-user benefits from an efficient supply chain. Several
    agricultural supply chains in India are problematic owing to issues in the agriculture
    industry [ 107]. Many factors affect the agri-food supply chain, including small
    and marginal farmers, disjointed supply chains, a lack of economies of scale,
    subpar processing, value addition, and fewer marketing options. Supply chain management
    is expanding into logistics by creating new divisions integrating manufacturing,
    procurement, transportation, and distribution [ 108]. Information flow visibility
    has increased because of advancements in telecommunications, electronic data interfaces,
    and other technologies. Animals and plants are used in agriculture to produce
    products that benefit human health. For example, agribusiness produces textiles
    and paper. Throughout the supply chain, the needs of customers are met. Organizations
    in the agricultural supply chain, such as cooperatives, distribute produce, fruits,
    grains, pulses, and products derived from animals [ 109]—a network of businesses
    that make goods and services for the end-user. There are several benefits to establishing
    a supply chain network, such as shifting risk and profit from one company to another.
    Quality is ensured by openness and accountability in the process. Quality is dependent
    on transparent processes and responsibilities at each stage of the process. The
    price and performance of transfer payments are crucial to the success of process
    chains. (5) T-5.5: Cost-Effective Communication System in Smart Agriculture. Low-cost
    solutions like crop rotation, green manuring, and mulching have cut cultivation
    expenses while saving soil and water. Legumes, weed control, and increased agricultural
    diversity are nonmonetary inputs [ 101]. Climate change, global warming, saltwater
    intrusion, desertification, and a lack of arable land have increased worldwide
    worries about food safety and security. Connectivity-of-Things applications require
    steady internet [ 110]. In the Mekong Delta and HCMC, climate change threatens
    food security. Drought and saltwater intrusion in the South and Central Highlands
    in early 2016 demonstrate the vulnerability and susceptibility of unsustainable
    agriculture. Agriculture may be more efficient and safer thanks to a new Farming
    system. Vietnam may become a smart and sustainable farm by modernizing, boosting
    productivity, and ensuring quality. Businesses in Vietnam have shared their know-how
    with companies in other countries. Another important factor to consider is the
    safety of the food being prepared. When deciding which meals are good for you
    and the environment, most people have no idea where to begin. Concerns about food
    safety have given rise to new ideas like “city farms” and “growing your veggies
    at home” [ 111]. However, the economic sustainability of these models must be
    thoroughly explored. Researchers are currently focusing on developing an IoT-enabled
    agriculture system. Increased productivity, quality, and safety may be achieved
    via this method [ 82]. 7.2.3. Ten Topic Solutions: Research Trends (1) T-10.1:
    Greenhouse Monitoring System. Most Indians work in agriculture, contributing to
    the country’s economy—agriculture benefits from technological advancements. However,
    pesticides are used to grow most fruits and vegetables since contemporary farming
    methods cannot keep up with demand. As a result, conventional farming practices
    contend with weather and disease. Although crop yields may be increased by altering
    agricultural practices [ 112] because of urbanization and land scarcity, farming
    must be done in greenhouses. Temperature, humidity, light, water content, pH,
    and wetness are all shown via LEDs in the greenhouse. The goal is to create an
    intelligent greenhouse. Greenhouse temperature and humidity may be adjusted automatically
    using programmable modules and low-cost and high-efficiency options [ 113]. Soil
    water content, light intensity, temperature, and humidity may be adjusted. In
    greenhouse crop production, the appropriate growth conditions must be changed
    to achieve high yields, low costs, improved quality, and the lowest environmental
    impact. To attain these goals, proper heating and ventilation must be maintained.
    Using a greenhouse is more dependable, but it is also more difficult [ 114]. Temperature
    and timing controls had previously improved crop quality. Many control devices
    and systems lack automation and efficiency in today’s dynamic and competitive
    environment. A variety of complicated models depict the greenhouse effect. Costs
    increased, plans became more complex, and more control was required. The usage
    of computers in greenhouses has increased during the last decade. These components
    are necessary for a control system. Sophisticated microelectronic hybrid circuits
    boost sensor manufacturing. Advances in product quality and dependability enable
    commercial competitiveness. Each sensor’s performance is determined by its calibration
    and sensing processes. It will be impossible to automate some jobs even in the
    far future. Several American businesses have yet to automate fully, maybe due
    to cost concerns [ 115]. (2) T-10.2: Service-Based Industry for Smart Agriculture.
    Technical advancement has been driven by the widespread use of IT and its adaptability
    in satisfying various requirements. Service-based agriculture (SBA) is widely
    utilized in multiple industries. Farming systems that make it easier for farmers
    to do their work. A large-scale service smart agriculture systems link buses to
    a hotel, hospital, logistics center, restaurant, grocery store, or traditional
    market. With SBA, material sales partners may easily share information about their
    products with one other fast. As a result of SBA, Indonesia will see an increase
    in its economy, as quoted in one study. Over time, the importance of information
    technology has grown. The production of farms has increased thanks to the adoption
    of contemporary technology [ 116]. Many people are familiar with the predicament
    of Indonesian farmers. The significance of variables cannot be overstated. Farmers
    have a fear of technology. Farmers in Indonesia may be able to increase their
    abilities and produce food for the country’s population by utilizing new technologies.
    Brokers are often used to resell the produce of Indonesian farmers. Small-scale
    farmers in Indonesia were hurt by brokers who gambled on the price of agricultural
    goods [ 117]. Prices for components are rising. Broker fraud inflated market values.
    Brokers save agricultural products, giving the impression that the market is oversupplied
    and driving up the price of food. When chili prices climb and there is a shortage,
    many brokers refuse to buy from growers. The growing cost of food in Indonesia
    might harm the country’s economy. Farmers must be able to sell their products
    directly to consumers. The direct distribution offers farmers an easy way to market
    their products. Wholesalers buy agricultural goods from farmers at inexpensive
    rates [ 118]. To get their goods to market, farmers must rent a vehicle. Commodities
    no longer impact farmers’ earnings with a long processing time. Indonesians rely
    heavily on their smartphones to get information. Technology can help farmers become
    food wholesalers. Local markets and restaurants might be fed using this method
    by farmers. The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing support agriculture’s
    food supply and distribution systems [ 119]. Nowadays, nanotechnology is also
    used in agriculture to improve yields and reduce waste. (3) T-10.3: Cloud-Based
    Smart Applications in Agriculture. Smart farming uses technology to increase production
    and improve product quality. For example, the Internet of Things-based smart agriculture
    automates crop inspections and watering. Database traffic and data cannot be handled
    by a cloud-based IoT-based system. As a result, there is less lag, the battery
    lasts longer, and the money and information are better managed [ 120]. In many
    cases, the edge for IoT may provide significant advantages, such as removing the
    need for interval and geometric communications efficiency. High interface automation
    in IoT activities may achieve reduced latency and faster processing. This simulator
    replicates the sting, edge, and fog of IoT. IoT-based edge computing is more immediate,
    cost-effective, and efficient than traditional computer systems [ 121]. In cities,
    these strategies are ineffective. Rural locations are where they are most commonly
    used. Robots should be used in agriculture. The field is navigated using the GPS
    on the tractor. Agribusiness in the 21st century is anything but digital or computerized.
    Monitoring crops and animals with sensors, GPS-enabled tractors, image processing,
    and machine learning is possible. Edge computing reduces the amount of noise in
    the raw data it analyses which can be cleaned using data mining techniques [ 122].
    On the other hand, Broadband networks are more cumbersome and difficult to standardize.
    After sensors are installed, data is automatically collected. We can identify
    if animals or birds are active, inactive, unwell, healthy, submissive, or dominant.
    We may alter their treatment, living circumstances, medicine, and food to suit
    their needs [ 123]. (4) T-10.4: Energy-Efficient Smart Transmission System. An
    intelligent electrical infrastructure that satisfies society’s sustainability
    and energy efficiency demands is called “smart infrastructure” Customers and utility
    providers will benefit from the smart grid’s ability to monitor their energy use
    better and link the power grid with micro-networks. As a result, there is a danger
    to data security and privacy. Economic growth depends on the availability of electricity,
    which boosts productivity and sustains quality of life. Global economic development
    and electricity usage are depleting the world’s energy resources [ 124]. The smart
    grid’s core assumption is to minimize resource depletion and promote economic
    growth through energy efficiency and management technologies. Demand management
    lowers transmission and distribution system stress and high-demand overhead lines.
    Several countries have used industrial and commercial demand response strategies
    to boost their economies. Direct load limiting often reduces peak demand [ 125].
    Direct load management may result in a decrease in customer satisfaction—direct
    load management. Consumers and utility companies benefit from reduced peak demand
    when loads are shifted. However, the electrical system’s stability and dependability
    are compromised during periods of high energy demand. The smart grid and load
    modeling need to limit peak energy use. Trouble ensues when demand exceeds supply.
    From 2019 to 2030, India’s population and development demands are expected to
    grow by 50 percent [ 126]. A transmission system that can endure interruptions
    and blackouts must meet these criteria. Grid operators must regularly monitor
    supply and demand to avoid power outages. To fix this problem, load shedding disconnects
    specific customers’ electricity. Generators must be turned down to prevent blackouts
    if supply and demand are out of sync. Smart grids can identify problems early
    on and immediately resolve them. Sensors monitor the grid and manage the flow
    of current. These are computerized to increase productivity [ 127]. (5) T-10.5:
    Smart Solutions for Modern Farming. Sustainable food production is in high demand
    as the world’s population expands and weather patterns shift. Agriculture and
    development go forward as time goes by. Agricultural technology is advancing rapidly.
    These new technologies are pretty effective, but they must be constantly improved.
    Using information and communications technology, planting, watering, and harvesting
    are all enhanced. Many fields, including agriculture, benefit from technological
    advancements. The Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture is referred to as “smart
    farming” [ 128]. Produce and livestock will be healthier thanks to IoT-enabled
    smart farming. Real-time information is provided through wearables and sensors
    in the field. Shelter, clothing, and food have been top priorities for humanity
    since the dawn of civilization. There is a lot of modernity in the house and clothing.
    According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), humanity’s food requirements
    will rise by 70% by 2050, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) [ 129]. IoT can be used to solve problems in business and technology. Tractors
    are used to plant seeds and gather crops. You can use it for business or yourself.
    Farming is done with the help of tractors. Farmers can do other things when they
    use tractors that drive themselves. A Polish company called Agribot makes tractors
    that can work independently. When they pull weeds, their tractors have sensors
    that reduce the number of chemicals and pesticides exposed. Agro-IoT devices can
    meet the needs of farming in the future. Traditional agriculture must become more
    productive and less risky for the global economy to grow. IoT helps growth. Farmers
    can keep an eye on their land with the help of the Internet of Things. IoT applications
    include keeping an eye on climate change, managing water, keeping an eye on land,
    improving productivity, keeping an eye on farming, and keeping track of pesticides
    and herbicides [ 130]. (6) T-10.6: Smart Irrigation System for Agriculture. The
    most difficult chore in agriculture is watering fields. Water systems consist
    of drips, nozzles, tubes, and sprinklers, among other things. As a whole, agriculture
    has a positive impact on economic activity. Watering by hand is required. Gardening
    and soil deterioration are both covered in rainfall. Agriculture’s key objectives
    are the production of food and livestock. IoT is a network of interconnected devices
    that can exchange data [ 131]. When water supplies are limited, automatic irrigation
    may be necessary. According on the weather, irrigation might be done continuously
    or intermittently. As a result, there is less spillage. Almost all of the water
    comes from drip irrigation or sprinklers. With a wireless gadget, soil moisture
    and humidity may be monitored. In agriculture, controllers manage everything from
    power to intruder detection to pump switching [ 69]. A pump is used to deliver
    water to the ground. Water is conserved when drippers are used. Drip irrigation
    and flood irrigation are both standard irrigation methods. Both all of the sensors,
    pumps, and controls work as expected. Manual watering may hurt or deplete crops
    and the environment. Automated irrigation systems can be used to address the difficulties.
    Farming may benefit from drip irrigation, which saves on water. Automatic irrigation
    systems for crop management have become widespread during rainstorms, landscaping,
    and soil erosion. Wi-fi sensors are used to gauge the humidity and moisture content
    of the soil. In agriculture, controllers keep an eye on the electricity, keep
    an eye out for intruders, and manage the pumps. Saturating the soil is accomplished
    with the use of pumps. Using drippers saves water, therefore reducing the amount
    of water used. Floatation irrigation commonly utilizes electricity, sensors, pumps,
    and controls [ 132]. (7) T-10.7: Blockchain-Based Security System for Agriculture.
    There are nodes in a blockchain, and each node has its own distributed ledger,
    allowing several nodes to read and amend a single ledger while preserving shared
    control. Each blockchain node contains a distributed ledger that is safe and accessible
    to all participants. There are no middlemen to authenticate, track, store or synchronize
    transactions using blockchain technology. According to several research studies,
    blockchain has altered technology from centralized to decentralized and distributed
    networks, a shift that has been well documented. The blockchain helps business
    networks [ 133]. Business networks are composed of companies or individuals that
    trade assets. Products, materials, and equipment are examples of physical assets.
    A distributed ledger may be used to move assets across the network by anybody
    who is a member. The most recent ledger is available to all members. Consensus-based
    distributed ledgers and smart contracts foster network confidence. Assets and
    transactions are recorded in the distributed ledger. Transactions are possible
    with a distributed ledger. You cannot remove a transaction after it has been added.
    An encrypted ledger prevents tampering with transactions. With blockchain, the
    distributed ledger is transformed into a reliable data source for the network
    [ 134]. A distributed ledger of digital commerce is known as a blockchain. Each
    node of the network modifies distributed ledgers through cryptography. Components
    of a blockchain include its block header, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root hash.
    Smart apps are being developed for rural agriculture. Agricultural modernization
    relies on ICT to automate processes and protect personal data. Data from many
    IoT devices may be sent to a central hub to analyze and manage autonomous farm
    activities. However, centralized intermediates are inherent in a single point
    of failure, data loss risk, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Thanks to smart contracts
    on the blockchain, decentralized and safe agricultural automations are now possible
    [ 135]. (8) T-10.8: Production-Based Smart System for Agriculture. It is possible
    to increase productivity and quality by using IoT-based agricultural convergence
    technologies. Predicting demand, managing supply, and ensuring quality are benefits
    of precision agriculture. The expansion of the economy is mainly fueled by agriculture.
    The government is responsible for protecting the land [ 136]. Nothing has changed
    despite advances in science and technology. There is no shortage of green technologies.
    Farmers need to reduce the time they spend working and increase the precision
    they use their resources. Complex statistical methodologies are used by agriculturalists
    when analyzing historical data and making economic predictions. Farm yields are
    improved via GPS, sensors, and big data. Real-time data from ICT-based decision
    support systems can take the role of farmers’ knowledge and intuition [ 137].
    Improved decision-making reduces the amount of waste and increases efficiency.
    Images, GPS, science-based solutions, climate forecasts, technology, and environmental
    controls play a role in agriculture. As with the terms “smart meters” and “smart
    cities,” “smart farming” refers to any M2M application. Technology advances to
    aid in harvest forecasting. However, predictions based on statistics are not always
    accurate. Harvest data and the agricultural environment should be correlated.
    IoT will provide agricultural data. Complex statistical methodologies are used
    by agriculturalists when analyzing historical data and making economic predictions.
    Predicting crop yields is aided by the use of smart systems. In the end, statistical
    forecasts are not perfect; they are only a starting point. Make a connection between
    the agricultural environment and harvest data. Crop pattern data will be provided
    through IoT-based decision support. On IoT, agribusiness utilizes data mining,
    statistical forecasting, and IoT services [ 138]. (9) T-10.9: Industry 4.0 in
    Agriculture. Global agriculture must undergo a paradigm shift in light of evolving
    environmental conditions, dietary preferences, and a scarcity of critical inputs.
    It is all about the latest advancements in agriculture. As a result of the adoption
    of Industry 4.0, businesses may expect to see advances in output, efficiency,
    and creativity. First, agriculture provides food for the world’s population. Second,
    agriculture 4.0 decreases labor and environmental effects to increase agricultural
    profitability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and water use. Third, agriculture
    is the primary source of income for half of India’s population, India’s veins
    and arteries [ 139]. The fourth stage of industrial development is large-scale
    agriculture. Among the essential ICTs is the IoT. Flexibility is improved in “smart
    factories.” People, equipment, and software work together to satisfy production
    demands, which are met through cutting-edge technology such as CPS/IoT/iOS and
    real-time interaction. The industry benefits from consolidation. However, future
    manufacturing and commerce will be harmed. This shift is made possible due to
    the Internet and information technology [ 140]. Quality control encompasses all
    aspects of engineering, management, manufacturing, operations, and logistics.
    Costs, availability, use of resources, and market demand may all be automated.
    ‘The implementation of Industry 4.0 will profoundly impact the agriculture and
    industrial sectors. All technologies like Big Data, AI, and IoT are part of Industry
    4.0. IoT allows agricultural systems and equipment to connect with one another,
    making Industry 4.0 a game changer in agriculture [ 141]. The fourth industrial
    revolution created networked tractors, farms, and manufacturing equipment [ 142].
    “Industry Revolutions 4.0” refers to three factors: (1) Digitalization and its
    integration into simple economical and technical networks (2) Digitalization of
    services and products (3) Market models that have been updated As economic, economic
    and business models develop, humans become more distant from the center of production
    and surveillance of crops. Industry 4.0 is being used by both developed and developing
    countries. India has a lot of untapped potential for agricultural growth. Robotics,
    IoT, and e-business are the three pillars of this revolution, aiming to deliver
    technology to every corner of the globe. (10) T-10.10: Image-Based Classification
    Techniques in Intelligent Agriculture. Agriculture originated thirteen thousand
    years ago between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers north of Iraq. Gathered vegetation
    included wild wheat and others. Few people needed food. UN estimates that the
    world’s population will reach 10 billion by 2050, impacting farmers. Desertification
    and urbanization wreak havoc on farmland. COVID-19 is a threat to food security
    and the nation’s economy. To solve this problem, we need to use fewer people to
    generate more food [ 143]. In certain parts of India, rainfall is the only irrigation
    water supply. However, crop destruction can occur in some places due to unpredictability
    in rainfall, which is a problem. Management of watersheds is critical. Many-variable
    hydrological modeling is required to predict rainfall and runoff in different
    basins accurately. Estimates of imperviousness necessitate a terrain categorization,
    which ultimately categorizes land use and cover [ 144]. The image classification
    curve number is used in modeling. Satellite pictures are difficult to classify
    because of their high resolution and wide range of applications. Nevertheless,
    images are a common practice in agriculture and water management. There are a
    plethora of tools and methods for classifying images. ANN and SVM are used for
    image classification [ 145]. Techniques used to organize pictures traditionally
    are time-consuming and prone to human error. With pattern recognition, alternate
    ways can reduce time and enhance accuracy. Unlike Bayes’ discriminant criteria,
    SVM multiclassification outperforms. 8. Threats to Validity This analysis is based
    on LDA topic modeling and has bounded to the limitations of this topic modeling
    technique. A sufficient article count has been achieved, yet the risk of missing
    out is a concern. The bibliographic material has also been inferred. The search
    string insufficiency has been eradicated appropriately due to the limitations
    of selected search terms, synonyms, string formulation, and search engines’ variedness
    resulting in imperfect retrieval of literature corpus. Labeling topics is a significant
    concern due to subjectivity and bias. According to the author, a deep discussion
    has been conducted to determine the label best to overcome this limitation. Then,
    based on critical terms, labels have been formulated to draw the best topic labels
    for researchers and practitioners. 9. Conclusion Using IoT technology, farmers
    and producers may better manage their resources, such as fertilizer consumption
    and the number of trips made by farm vehicles, while minimizing waste and maximizing
    productivity, including water, electricity, and other inputs. In IoT smart farming
    systems, sensors monitor the agricultural field and automate the irrigation system.
    Farmers can monitor their fields from anywhere. This paper concluded the research
    direction in smart agriculture and farming. Technology has shaped agriculture’s
    history. Historians have identified several agricultural revolutions that changed
    practice and output. Technological advances have fueled these revolutions. The
    Industrial Revolution mechanized agriculture, improving farm labor productivity.
    Modern mechanized agriculture has replaced numerous farm activities by hand or
    by oxen, horses, and mules. Weather forecasting and barbed wire were 19thcentury
    advances. Portable engines and threshing machines became popular after improvements.
    In the 20thcentury, synthetic fertilizers and insecticides, mass-produced tractors,
    and agricultural aircraft for aerial pesticide application were developed. Precision
    farming, disease monitoring, agricultural drones, satellite imagery, and sensors
    are just ways technology makes farming easier for farmers. Intelligent software
    analysis for pest and disease prediction and soil management are only a few of
    the many analytical activities that IoT-based sensor networks may do. New issues
    in smart farming include the security of the farming data, technical failures,
    and technical incompetence. 10. Future Work The LDA model works like a recommender
    system. The current research is based on extracting keywords from the documents
    and recommends current and trending research areas based on the correlation of
    the keywords in the specified field. So, in the real-time scenario, any corpus
    of any size can be passed to the model to get the relevant keywords, and based
    on these keywords, suggestions for topics can be depicted. The authors have used
    this model on smart agriculture in the current research. In contrast, this model
    can also be implemented in other research fields like smart cities, blockchain,
    and Wireless Sensor Networks. In this study, the authors analyzed data retrieved
    from the Scopus database instead of Web of Science, Education Resources Information
    Center, ScienceDirect, or the Directory of Open Access Journals. However, the
    authors chose the Scopus database over these other databases because Scopus has
    more excellent coverage of publications, demonstrating that it is a comprehensive
    and dependable data source and so justifying its eligibility for this review.

    (IoT)LogisticsReviewMethodology 1. Introduction As the coverage of the Internet
    increases, so does the number of physical objects that connect to the Internet
    [1]. The number of Internet-connected objects had reached about 12.5 billion by
    2011 [2], and especially with the advent of the 5G-Internet [3], it is projected
    to cross 25 billion by the end of 2020 [4] and 50 billion by the end of 2050 [5].
    So, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), has received a great deal of attention, especially
    in recent years, as it has led to significant changes from lifestyle to emerging
    technologies [6], such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication [7], context-aware
    computing [8], and Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) [9]. These technologies
    make it possible to identify, connect, adapt and localize, and track and monitor
    such objects [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] as wearable devices [16], smart
    home appliances [17], intelligent vehicles and drones [18, 19], and smart applications
    for industrial automation [20, 21] and logistics [22], [23], [24], [25], [26],
    on an open [27], gigantic [28], self-configured, and dynamic [29] internet-based
    network. This improves productivity, accuracy, and economic profitability by integrating
    the physical world directly into computer-based systems and networks [1, 30] with
    no human intervention [31]. Hence, the applications of the IoT have received a
    lot of attention in such areas as smart grid [32, 33], smart home [17, 34, 35]
    and building [36], smart city [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44],
    energy & environment [45], [46], [47], [48], traffic & transportation [49], [50],
    [51], [52], [53], [54], healthcare [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62],
    [63], business & industries [64], [65], [66], [67], libraries [68], [69], [70],
    [71], [72], [73], [74], agriculture [75], [76], [77], Supply Chain (SC) [78],
    [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], general management [38, 85], and fluid transportation
    systems [86, 87], somewhat reviewed by Atzori et al. [88] and Zhang [89]. Besides,
    increasing attention to the concept of the IoT has led to the publication of many
    other review papers in this field [1, [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104]]. Despite numerous reviews
    of the IoT applications, a comprehensive review of its application in logistics
    is missing. However, all logistics functions, including the right goods, amount,
    place, quality, time, and price, can be fully supported with the aforementioned
    set of common IoT features [105]. Relying on these features, Zhong et al. [106]
    have developed an environment equipped with various IoT interface devices to convert
    traditional logistics resources into active/passive smart logistics objects. Despite
    this, while studying the features and state of knowledge of IoT-based logistics
    4.0, in line with the concept of industry 4.0, Winkelhaus and Grosse [107] lay
    stress on the lack of systematic reviews on Logistics Internet-of-Things (L-IoT).
    And this research is originally presented to fill this gap. 1.1. Research motivation,
    aim, and methodology The main motivation of this paper is to answer the following
    Research Questions (RQs), based on existing studies, select and evaluate contributions,
    analyze and synthesize data, and report evidences in a way that allows researchers
    to organize their conclusions about what is known and unknown in L-IoT. RQ1) What
    is the state of knowledge of L-IoT? RQ2) What are the trends in research areas,
    methods, and strategies, and what conferences, journals, and publishers have been
    active in the L-IoT over time? RQ3) Which aspect of L-IoT is practical but less
    understood? RQ4) How L-IoT can be categorized to highlight and understand new
    topics? RQ5) What are the future directions of research in L-IoT? Following these
    RQs, the paper aims to directly review and analyze 560 articles and classify 185
    of these papers that have been published between January 2008 and September 2020.
    To answer the RQs, considering several dimensions and categories, first, published/accepted
    papers are systematically classified. The papers are English research works that
    have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and conferences, due
    to the novelty of the term [108]. Doing so, the Google Scholar search engine is
    queried with the exact keywords as “logistic/s AND Internet-of-Things”, “logistic/s
    AND IoT”, and “IoT-based AND logistic/s” in their title. The papers are cross-checked,
    and their citations are also followed to ensure the reliability of the process
    of finding and selecting papers and the validity of the research. 1.2. Research
    contributions The outline of the contributions of this paper relative to the recent
    literature in the field can be summarized as follows: a) The main contribution
    of this research is an autonomous, comprehensive, and systematic review study
    that is presented for the first time on the L-IoT. b) This research introduces
    the features of the L-IoT based on the distinctions from the generic IoT systems.
    c) This is the first study to summarize the existing research and identify the
    conceptual content of the L-IoT as well as its specific architecture and provide
    a framework for classifying and organizing the concept. d) This study explores
    and analyzes the potential for future research and implementation of the L-IoT.
    1.3. Paper organization The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section
    2, special attention is paid to definitions and taxonomies of the L-IoT followed
    by proposing a general architecture for it. Some basic definitions about the IoT
    and logistics are also provided in this section. Detailed analysis and classification
    of reviewed papers are discussed in Section 3. Finally, the conclusion and current
    gaps analysis as well as future research opportunities are presented and discussed
    in Section 4. 2. Definitions and taxonomies Thanks to the literature review, the
    development of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has first led to
    the transition from traditional logistics to electronic logistics and then to
    L-IoT. Benefiting from Third Party Logistics (3PL) [109], [110], [111], the first
    transition transforms the family business to an online logistics [112], and the
    second further transforms it into a cloud-based, smart, and intelligent logistics
    by leveraging digital sensors [113], [114], [115]. Since a system can be identified
    through the four corners of composition, structure, mechanisms, and environment,
    so following the definitions of logistics and IoT, the components and architecture
    of the L-IoT are defined and analyzed in this section. 2.1. Logistics The term
    “logistics” originates from the medieval Latin “logisticus” of calculation, Greek
    “logistikos” as “skilled in calculating”, ”logizesthai” that means “to calculate”,
    “logos” as “reckoning” [116], and French “Loger/Logistique” as “lodge” [117].
    It entered the English language during World War II in the early 19th century
    [117, 118]. However, it also existed in Roman and Byzantine times as a military
    administrative official called \"Logista\" [119, 120]. Hou et al. [121] attribute
    the beginning of the rapid worldwide growth of logistics to the study of the physical
    distribution in the American agricultural industry. More specifically, since 1997,
    with the development of such plans as the 2013 National Logistics Park Development
    Plan [122], China''s logistics industry has been increasing 10 times by 2016 [123].
    The reason for such attention to logistics is that it can integrate long-run decisions
    on facility location and fleet acquisition with short-term operations of the physical,
    managerial, and information systems to allow goods to overcome time and space
    [121, 124]. Although logistics management involves such short-term operations
    as material and inventory handling and communications in an SC [125, 126], there
    are four perspectives on logistics versus SCs as 1) re-labeling, 2) traditionalist,
    3) inter-sectionist, and 4) unionist. The first simply renames logistics to SC.
    The second positions SC within logistics, and the third claims they have some
    intersections, while the last treats logistics as a part of SC. Accordingly, there
    is disagreement about how SC management relates to logistics [127]. So, following
    the last perspective, this paper focuses specifically on the term “logistics”,
    about which recent research has taken two different directions: economic versus
    behavioral [128]. The former usually focuses on cost [129, 130]/profit [131] optimization
    through mathematical modeling [132, 133] or simulation [134]. While, the latter
    emphasizes the psychological and sociological aspects obtained primarily via questionnaires,
    interviews, and case studies [135], [136], [137]. However, despite the fundamental
    differences, both approaches consider Information Technology (IT) to be the main
    factor facilitating logistics [80, 126, [138], [139], [140]] in both its internal
    and external activities [141]. As the IoT is a major change in the field of IT,
    it is of particular importance for today''s modern logistics [88]. 2.2. Internet-of-Things
    technology IoT is a novel global Internet-based architecture that can specifically
    facilitate the exchange of goods and services [142] in logistics networks [143],
    which include uncertainty [144] and risk [145, 146]. As shown in Fig. 1, the basic
    idea of the IoT is to connect each object to a data network by assigning a digital
    identity [147]. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. The IoT architecture [148], [149], [150], [151], [152], [153], [154],
    [155], [156]. From the figure, the IoT technology is bridging the gaps between
    human, cyber, and physical worlds [157], [158], [159], [160] aiming at creating
    a worldwide network to connect people, things, data, and processes [161], [162],
    [163]. It includes anything in the physical or virtual world that can be integrated
    into global communication networks [164]. More technically, the conjunction of
    the Internet with the RFID and related identification technologies is the cornerstone
    of the IoT technology, shown in Fig. 1 [165], [166], [167], [168]. This is so
    important that some researchers, in addition to advances in wireless communications
    networks, have linked the success of RFID technology in tracking objects, people,
    and animals to the realization of the IoT technology vision [169], [170], [171].
    From a managerial point of view, the vision is the result of combining three views
    of \"object-oriented (sensors or smart things)\", “internet-oriented”, and “semantic-oriented
    (knowledge)” [88] through a network that performs its tasks through four conceptualizations.
    (1) IoT as the setting for liquification and density of resources’ information;
    (2) IoT as digital materiality; (3) IoT as assemblage or service system, and (4)
    IoT as modules, transactions, and service [92, [172], [173], [174], [175]]. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, there is no single definition or understanding of the IoT and its
    inclusion [88, 166, 176, 177], especially in the field of logistics. It is due
    to major challenges still exist in the real-time information-driven logistics
    services [178]. 2.3. Logistics Internet-of-Things As aforementioned, one of the
    major applications of the IoT is in the field of logistics. The L-IoT is, therefore,
    the IoT system deployed for logistics applications. Thanks to the reviewed papers,
    the proposed architecture of the L-IoT is presented in Fig. 2, based on the general
    IoT architecture presented in Fig. 1. As a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
    [179], it consists of: 1) A core layer to perform cloud computing to manage and
    categorize the data received from the first part of the system, i.e. the first
    three layers, and prepare them for delivery to its second part, i.e. the last
    three layers; 2) Layers 2 and 5 to make object- and service-oriented interactions
    between physical and virtual objects, as well as packaged services and applications,
    and 3) The final business layer to manage the entire system. Download : Download

    the study (185 papers: 2008–2020). The first interface layer transforms physical
    objects into virtual entities to be ready to be analyzed and classified in the
    core layer so that they are available for the system''s various users through
    their applications by passing through the second interface layer. And, finally,
    the whole process is managed by the business layer. The inherent breadth of logistics
    knowledge, along with such a possibility of adapting to the growing concept of
    the IoT, has led to a significant increase in research on the concept of the L-IoT
    since its inception in 2008, shown in Fig. 5. Form the Figure, among the 185 papers
    categorized in this research, with a growth rate of approximately 1.76 papers
    per year, only one research was published before 2010 and most of the papers were
    published between 2011 and 2012, and 2017 to 2020. It should be noted that the
    reason for the slight decrease in the number of articles in 2020, compared to
    2019, can be explained because the initial search was conducted in September of
    that year. This is almost consistent with what is concluded in [180], in which
    39 out of 91 papers (43%) were applied and the rest were related to the theory
    of the IoT, and only 8 out of these 39 papers (20%) are related to the logistics.
    Since most of the papers, they have reviewed were published between 2013 and 2016,
    it is acceptable that the number of applied research works, especially in the
    field of logistics, was not large enough, because, at that time, academics have
    focused more on theorizing the IoT. Further details on how research works are
    distributed in journals (22.5%) and conferences (77.5%), mostly contain conference
    papers that are published by Springer, Elsevier, and IEEE, during the study period
    are shown in Fig. 4. And the growing trend of the journals that are interested
    in the L-IoT during the period is shown in Fig. 5. From the figures, as 2020 approaches,
    not only has the number of journal articles on the L-IoT increased, but the number
    of journals in this field has also increased by about 0.8 journals per year. This
    increase, while the number of conference papers has not decreased, indicates an
    increase in researchers'' attention to the subject. This is in line with the growing
    focus on the IoT and its applications since 2015, which was also studied in [180],
    [181], [182]. Because increasing attention to the use of the IoT in logistics
    cannot logically be exempt from the increase in attention in other areas. Download

    in this study, shown in Fig. 6, is further evidence of the growing trend towards
    L-IoT. The greater contribution of the IEEE and Springer to the published papers
    is not unexpected, given what is shown in Fig. 4. Because in addition to publishing
    journal articles, they are also very active in publishing conference papers. Download

    Now that the issue has been clarified, given the breadth of the scope of both
    the IoT and logistics concepts, it is necessary to provide an appropriate classification
    of the L-IoT to examine its various aspects in detail and answer the RQs raised
    in Section 1.1. The main topics, which include theoretical and empirical evidence
    on the applications of the IoT technology in logistics, can be classified into
    three classes, presented in Fig. 7, i.e. field of interest (12 classes), research
    strategy (RSG) (two classes), and research methodology (RMT) (three classes).

    reasons, opinions, and motivations to provide insight into the issue or to help
    develop ideas or hypotheses for potential quantitative research. “Quantitative
    research” works, on the contrary, emphasize objective measurements and statistical,
    mathematical, or numerical analysis of data collected through surveys and questionnaires,
    or by manipulating current statistical data using computational techniques. “Literature
    review” is a secondary source that does not report new or major experimental work,
    but contains current knowledge including basic findings and theoretical and methodological
    contributions to the subject. In terms of “research strategy”, a “case-based study”,
    as opposed to a “data-based study”, is an empirical inquiry that examines a phenomenon
    within its real-life situation [183, 184]. Based on the presented 12 categories
    in Fig. 7, Fig. 8 shows the number of articles in each major field of interest
    during the study period. Out of a total of 185 classified articles, 73 (39%) fall
    into the “IoT-based general logistics” category. This group includes studies devoted
    to the principles of L-IoT without regard to a particular field of interest. The
    reason for the large number of studies in this category is that the principles
    of the L-IoT, both academically and empirically, have not yet been sufficiently
    and fully explained. Download : Download high-res image (434KB) Download : Download

    distribution of papers published during the study period, outlined in Fig. 9,
    shows that the proportion of papers published in the fields of “IoT-based general
    logistics”, “IoT-based agricultural, food, drink, and cold logistics”, “IoT-based
    intelligent cargo and objects logistics”, “IoT-based production logistics”, and
    “IoT-based smart inventory control” have strong growth rates, respectively. This
    slope has lower increases in the areas of “IoT-based electronic logistics”, “IoT-based
    chemical logistics”, “IoT-based green logistics”, and “IoT-based railway logistics”,
    while it decreases in “IoT-based emergency logistics”, “IoT-based military logistics”,
    and “IoT-based postal logistics”, respectively. Download : Download high-res image

    and strategies of the reviewed papers during the study period are also presented
    in Fig. 10(a) and Fig. 10(b), respectively. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the share
    of qualitative, quantitative, and review research is about 75%, 23%, and 2%, respectively.
    It is noteworthy that since Tu [185] has used both qualitative and quantitative
    research methods, to achieve a clearer and more accurate view, its membership
    in both methods is considered 0.5. To provide a more accurate view, Fig. 10(c)
    reveals the overall trend of the qualitative, quantitative, and review studies
    over the study period. As shown in the figure, from 2013 onwards, quantitative
    research works have received more attention, while the trend towards qualitative
    approaches, albeit with a low slope, has been declining. In terms of research
    strategies, although the share of case-based papers has been lower than that of
    data-based papers so far, the very small growth trend of data-based papers, compared
    to the increasing rate of case-based papers, shown in Fig. 10(d), builds a brighter
    future for case-based studies. This is also definitely expected due to the wide
    range of applications mentioned in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image

    analysis of the literature Based on the classification introduced in Fig. 7, this
    section is devoted to the study of selected papers and provides a holistic view
    of recent and state-of-the-art studies in the field of L-IoT aiming at illuminating
    current gaps and future research directions. Useful information about the classified
    papers is summarized in Table 1 to Table 12, in the order of their Google Scholar
    Citation Score (GSCS). In the tables, QL, QN, LR, DB, and CB, stand for “Qualitative
    Research”, “Quantitative Research”, and “Literature Review”, as well as “Data-Based”,
    and “Case-Based” research works, respectively. 3.1. IoT-Based general logistics
    Employing the RFID, Near Field Communications (NFC), and Global Positioning System
    (GPS) technologies, IoT technology can not only provide real-time visibility for
    operations but also create value for both consumers and providers on the market
    [186, 187]. It can optimize the business and industrial process flows based on
    big data analysis, leveraging smart tags and objects, and implementing ad-hoc
    predictive maintenance applications while delivering efficient logistics service
    solutions [188, 189]. This advanced system helps logistics service providers make
    timely decisions on how to monitor, route, and deliver goods to their customers
    [190], thereby enhancing their competitiveness [191, 192]. This is because providing
    autonomous and self-controlled transport of objects from sender to consignee [193]
    reduces the long response time in traditional logistics networks to several days
    for L-IoT [88, 194]. Such benefits have led many researchers to try to equip regular
    logistics with IoT technology, denoted in Table 1. Table 1. Detailed information

    are part of the emerging concept of industry 4.0 [269], [270], [271], and Industrial
    Internet-of-Things (I-IoT) [272], [273], [274], [275], [276], [277], [278], IoT
    technology combines IT and SC [279] to produce a higher-quality product [280]
    in a more agile process [281], by providing real-time visibility. It also helps
    manufacturers reduce data analysis and decision delays [282]. Because it provides
    high-quality information by enabling fast, accurate, and timely transfer to create
    dynamic control over production logistics systems. Therefore, the IoT can be a
    source of many effective changes in production logistics, especially on a global
    scale [283]. Because production logistics, in its intra- and inter-firm scope,
    accounts for approximately 95% of the total production process [284]. Therefore,
    although the high dynamics of production logistics [284] complicate its modeling,
    many researchers have researched IoT-based production logistics, presented in
    Table 2. Among the researchers, Tu et al. [283] and Tu et al. [285] have proposed
    a unified IoT-oriented modeling framework to tackle its dynamicity. They have
    used ontology, process analysis, and Petri Net (PN) modeling scheme to reduce
    the complexity of the IoT-based production system development. In the meantime,
    Kim and Sohn [286] have also introduced a control system for managing industrial
    machines, resources, and products through the IoT technology. Table 2. Detailed

    intelligent cargo and objects logistics Today, not only manufacturers but also
    the logistics industry is concerned about how to handle cargo. In response to
    this concern, RFID tags can provide and update freight information, such as storage,
    inventory, and delivery conditions, for immediate control, monitoring, and tracking
    through a network connection [299]. They can detect cargo to prevent displacement
    and loss, while weight sensors may also be used to prevent overload in vehicles
    [300]. Further, GPS [301] and Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) can
    be employed to achieve real-time tracking position of vehicles [299, 302, 303].
    However, the high cost of these sensors to overcome such performance limitations
    as operation in harsh and dirty environments with extreme temperatures, facing
    unmanageable data, the need for longer reading ranges, the diversity of the standards,
    etc., makes it uneconomical to incorporate tags into every retail item [304],
    [305], [306]. To meet this challenge, Oliveira et al. [187] and Oliveira et al.
    [186] have presented a low-cost RFID-based intelligent tracking system, named
    “SafeTrack”, to effectively provide route planning and cargo tracking management
    by using geofencing algorithms. Yang et al. [307] have proposed a hybrid cargo-level
    tracking system and other researchers have conducted studies on IoT-based intelligent

    control More technically, using the IoT technology in manufacturing logistics
    is based on the EPC as a unique global identifier of each product, which is used
    to track and trace products [339, 340]. Objects with RFID tags and unique EPCs
    provide information services to subscribers not only locally, but also remotely
    [144, 341]. By this means, RFID technology with the involvement of the EPC in
    warehouses can eliminate industrial risks and theft problems, improve productivity,
    and make products easier to track [342], [343], [344]. However, the use of IoT
    in large industrial applications faces many challenges such as security, safety,
    and reliability [345]. Therefore, although RFID tags can hold all the information
    about objects [346], they usually do not contain all the information. And the
    information supply is made upon linking and cross-linking by using an Object Naming
    Service (ONS) that is similar to the Domain Name System (DNS) [144, 347]. An ONS,
    as the middleware of the system [348], is a directory service for companies wishing
    to look-up EPC numbers on the Internet to instantly know the location, date, and
    time of production [349]. And the assigned RFID, just like a serial number, enables
    the company to have that number [350] to be used through an IoT-based smart inventory
    control system. In such an environment, Wang et al. [351] have proposed a digital
    warehouse management system. Alyahya et al. [352] have studied the capability
    of an RFID-enabled automated inventory and retrieval system. Thürer et al. [353]

    With the development of e-commerce, logistics has attracted the attention of big
    enterprises [364], [365], [366]. E-commerce, unlike other industrial sectors,
    refers to the use of ICT for business transactions [367, 368]. Vendors, in such
    industries, should capable of achieving pull-mode delivery of a broad range of
    services and goods in acceptable volumes and qualities. Interplant Planning and
    Logistics Integration (IPLI) is, therefore, needed to link all Material Requirements
    Planning (MRP) systems via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to reduce information
    flow delays [369] and costs, while enhancing flexibility and efficiency [368].
    Because such information flow systems can effectively monitor online customer
    orders in a real-time manner, while guaranteeing products fast flow covered by
    a Time-Based Management (TBM) program [370]. And since the IoT technology is defined
    to do so, it makes sense to use it to aid electronic logistics, although there
    exists a limited amount of research in this field as listed in Table 5. Table

    projected to grow by nearly 14% annually in 2018–2022, compared to 5.48% in 2013–2018
    [378]. However, unlike non-chemical logistics, chemical logistics is non-eco-efficient
    [379, 380], flammable, explosive, toxic, and corrosive, etc. [381]. Therefore,
    its market is not fully standardized and despite its high cost, little information
    is available about it [382]. Notwithstanding, the IoT offers new opportunities
    for advancing chemical logistics to achieve better system performance in globalized
    environments [383, 384]. For instance, since energy consumption is so high in
    the industrial sector, especially in chemical companies, energy monitoring by
    using IoT sensors can be a good source of cost savings [385, 386]. Besides, in
    terms of security, the use of the IoT makes it easy for chemical companies to
    effectively collect data to allow them to quickly identify unauthorised access
    and prevent further intrusion [387]. Such characteristics, along with other benefits
    of using IoT, have prompted researchers to conduct research on IoT-based chemical
    logistics listed in Table 6. Table 6. Detailed information about reviewed IoT-based

    3.7. IoT-Based green logistics Since the consumption of fossil fuels is at the
    heart of logistics operations [393], greater use of these fuels, compared to green
    energy sources such as biofuels [394], leads to greater negative impacts on society
    and environmental sustainability [138, 395, 396]. Thus, the concept of green logistics
    has attracted wide interest [397], despite existing barriers, especially in emerging
    [398] and poor [399] economies. It is one of the most important approaches to
    environmental protection [400], [401], [402] by reducing energy consumption due
    to freight and waste handling, packaging [403], and transportation [404]. More
    specifically, the characteristics of green packaging such as size, shape, and
    material are of great importance in green and sustainable logistics [405, 406].
    This is due to their positive impacts on the products’ transportation [407], overall
    organizational performance [408, 409], and social factors [410, 411]. However,
    due to the need to upgrade technology, it may be able to reap the benefits of
    green logistics in the long run, but it will be costly to implement in the short
    term [412]. Thus, how to achieve green logistics services has become a hot topic
    for SC networks and the logistics industry [178]. And because digital, Internet-based
    logistics is also a major driver of green logistics [82, 386, 413, 414], researchers
    have turned to research in this area, whose research is listed in Table 7. Table

    3.8. IoT-Based agricultural, food, drink, and cold logistics Agri-food logistics
    plays a key role in the global economy [418, 419] and ecology [379]. It is usually
    done in large volumes with high delivery rates [420]. And safety, sustainability
    [421], short shelf-life time of the products [422], [423], [424] as well as high
    demand for traceability [425], [426], [427] and low-cost pressure [428], make
    it more diverse and difficult than other logistics systems [429, 430]. In the
    meantime, the concept of the cold chain [431] and maintaining accurate temperatures,
    as well as monitoring and mitigating risk factors during the transport of food
    [432], vegetables [433], and medicines [434] are of paramount importance worldwide.
    Since, IoT technology can provide significant potential in agri-food logistics
    by enabling the acquisition of real-time data [435, 436], researchers have researched
    the IoT-based agricultural, food, drink, and cold logistics, which are listed
    in Table 8. Among these researchers, Bottani et al. [437] have improved integrated
    food logistics, while reducing costs. Thiesse and Condea [438] have analyzed the
    quality of agricultural products by using IoT technology. Ko et al. [439] have
    proposed a framework for a cloud-based intelligent cold chain that enables users
    to employ any type of IoT devices including RFID tags, Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs), and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor nodes. Tsang et al. [440] and Chen
    [441] have presented real-time IoT-based monitoring systems for product quality
    control and occupational safety in cold chains and fishery logistics management.
    The great importance of transparency and safety in the growing demand of customers
    [441], and the special need for quality control of fishery logistics from sources
    that are wild and vulnerable, distinguishes it from other logistics [442]. Donnelly
    et al. [442] have presented costs and benefits of implementing fishery logistics
    improvement strategies that have been experimentally tested on Italian fishery
    processors by Asioli et al. [443]. However, this type of logistics is long and
    sinuous, and due to the existence of different types of production and distribution
    chains, it is difficult to manage and track upstream and downstream compounds
    and their information [444]. The use of such modern IT as IoT technology makes
    such logistics more secure, reliable, and tractable. Table 8. Detailed information

    IoT-Based emergency logistics Regardless of the source of disasters, such as fires,
    floods, earthquakes, wars, or terrorist attacks, and infectious disease including
    the 2002 SARS-CoV, 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, MERS-CoV, Coronavirus disease
    (COVID-19), and Ebola and Zika viruses outbreaks [470, 471], critical situations
    are often associated with the possibility of serious loss of life and property
    if not responded to properly [472]. Logistics, consisting of facility location,
    relief distribution and casualty transportation, and other operations, has always
    been considered an important factor in emergency response operations [473]. Today,
    emergency logistics is of increasing concern due to the occurrence of several
    man-made natural disasters [474, 475] and epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic
    [476]. More specifically, it is estimated that about 75,000 people are killed
    in more than 500 disasters each year and the lives of more than 200 million others
    are affected [116]. And from the beginning of the outbreak until September 22,
    2020, approximately 962,000 deaths from the COVID-19 have been reported to the
    World Health Organization (WHO) [477]. Planning, managing, and controlling the
    flow of resources is critical to help people in such situations [478]. Main challenges
    to emergency logistics planning compared to regular businesses logistics are highlighted
    by Balcik and Beamon [479], Sheu [478], and Caunhye et al. [480] as 1) additional
    uncertainties, 2) complex communication and coordination, 3) harder-to-achieve
    efficient and timely delivery, and 4) limited resources. Accordingly, the emergency
    response operations need the help of a wide range of organizations, including
    firefighting, police forces, ambulance services, local or national public sectors,
    and humanitarian aid organizations. Because it involves providing large quantities
    of rescue equipment, vehicles, and on-site staff as well as food, medicine, and
    essential goods for life [481]. In such situations, information and resource sharing
    becomes much more crucial [482]. And IoT and RFID technologies can empower flexible
    information and resource sharing as well as enhanced collaborations [472, 483,
    484]. In addition, such technologies can also be used to predict disasters to
    prevent the occurrence of accidents and to support evacuation or attention in
    case of emergencies [485], [486], [487], [488]. Such benefits have led scholars
    to try to equip emergencyies logistics with IoT technology. The corresponding
    research are listed in Table 9. Table 9. Detailed discussion about reviewed IoT-based

    initial study of military logistics by Antoine-Henri Jomini, in 1838 [120, 491,
    492], military logistics has become a determining factor in the overall outcome
    of wars [119, 493]. Although military logistics is similar to regular business
    logistics in terms of suppliers, procurement, manufacturing, order management,
    transportation, warehousing, and customers (soldiers), the key to their success
    is not the same. Lenzini [494] has claimed that customers need, information and
    communications technologies, deployment within and outside the continental United
    States, joint interoperability, department of defense regulations, environmental
    concerns (to include enemy forces), and mission requirements are the important
    success factors for the United States Army. In addition to the existence of non-profit
    organizations in military logistics [495], the presence of army retrogrades equipment
    for maintenance and retrograde personnel for medical care are the other differences
    between military logistics and regular business logistics. There are some other
    differences in the external factors including joint interoperability among the
    services’ command, control, computer, communications, and intelligence systems,
    deployment of forces, and soldier and mission requirements [496]. As can be seen,
    one of the vital factors for establishing a good military logistics system is
    the ability to achieve proper communication, which can be well-defined by using
    IoT technology. Notwithstanding, there is a gap in military logistics literature
    about the potential of emerging technologies, including AI and ML, robotics, additive
    manufacturing, blockchain, alternative energy technologies, and the IoT [497].
    Therefore, some research works on the use of IoT technology in military logistics
    has been conducted, which are listed in Table 10. Table 10. Detailed information

    logistics Compared to regular business logistics, efficient mail delivery through
    postal logistics requires a complex transportation network that encompasses a
    large amount of data. The network involves several functional sites with a hybrid
    hub-and-spoke structure, including several delivery and pickup stations, and multiple
    mail processing and exchange centers. Therefore, designing an efficient postal
    logistics network has become a very important issue, despite the special difficulties
    in working with texts and a great variety of letters [504]. The existence of big
    data due to increased storage capacity and speed of computing and communication
    has made cloud computing and IoT technology suitable methods to deal with such
    difficulties [505], [506], [507]. The Internet of Postal Things (IoPT) has then
    emerged as a network of autonomous sensors attached to different parts of the
    mail infrastructure, including mailboxes, delivery vans, sorting machines, and
    individual mail pieces [508], [509], [510]. However, how to use RFID technology
    to manage parcel processing [511] and how to accurately computerize, characterize,
    and standardize such a highly dynamic logistics network are still unclear. Because
    optimality [504, 512] and accuracy [513] are very important issues in postal logistics.
    Although the use of IoT technology allows these features to be achieved at a reasonable
    cost and with the highest accuracy, little research has been done so far (see
    Table 11), while some research has been done on the compatibility of RFID technology
    with postal logistics [513], [514], [515]. Table 11. Detailed information about

    requirements [517] in line with the criticality of real-time monitoring, especially
    in high-speed railway networks of such large countries as China [518], Russia,
    and the USA as well as the European Union [519] have led to the development of
    IoT technology in railway logistics [517, 520]. Because proper ICT can enable
    a railway logistics organization to achieve a rapid response to logistics demand
    based on the optimization of existing rail transportation and the integration
    of resources and costs [521]. In the meantime, the intelligent identification
    system of railway logistics is more readable, more recognizable, locatable, more
    addressable, and more controllable via the RFID and IoT technology [522]. However,
    although the RFID technology has become more attractive in railway logistics,
    information collision is inevitable. Conflict of tags, as a multi-channel access
    problem, excessive goods, and dynamic changes are also denoted as the essential
    challenges of the railway RFID-based logistics. However, by using cloud computing
    technology, such issues can be resolved by further developing the IoT technology
    in railway logistics, which are studied in some research papers listed in Table

    research provides a systematic review of L-IoT studies. The main definitions and
    concepts related to logistics along with the definitions, concepts, and proposed
    architecture of L-IoT and its distinctive and special features in accordance with
    the architecture and features of the IoT are presented in this paper. The main
    theoretical contribution of the paper is to identify and guide future research
    in the field of L-IoT, which is presented using comprehensive and critical analysis
    of the literature. By carefully reviewing journal and conference papers, the findings
    are discussed and critically synthesized as follows: a) Employing quantitative
    research methods. A major research opportunity can be deduced from Fig. 10(a)
    and Fig. 10(c). From Fig. 10(a), only a handful of research papers have attempted
    to use quantitative approaches to address L-IoT issues. It is while Fig. 10(c)
    reveals that quantitative approaches have attracted a lot of interest compared
    to the decreasing trend of qualitative approaches. Quantitative research is confirmatory,
    while qualitative research is exploratory in nature [184]. So, based on the research
    done in this paper, since the applicability and usefulness of the IoT in relation
    to the logistics concept is undeniable [262], it is time to switch from the exploratory
    research to the conformity one to address L-IoT issues. b) Focusing on mathematical
    approaches for optimally modeling and designing IoT-based systems. Although Tu
    et al. [283] and Tu et al. [285] have taken effective steps to use mathematical
    optimization in IoT-based production logistics, further efforts are still needed.
    Because since mathematical optimization techniques evaluate only a few designs,
    they can improve IoT performance not only in terms of logistic decision making
    but in all its applications by reducing the computational time of achieving optimal
    design [140, [528], [529], [530]]. And that is why the use of optimization approaches
    has become more acceptable, especially in recent years [531]. In this regard,
    the combination of IoT technology with data access networks, GIS, combinatorial
    optimization, and electrical engineering to improve urban management systems has
    been practically studied in [532]. And Yaghmaee Moghaddam et al. [533] and Golpîra
    and Bahramara [39] have optimized energy consumption by using cloud-based optimization
    approaches. However, research on the integration of mathematical modeling and
    optimization approaches in L-IoT and the development of user-friendly decision
    support systems with the ability to use these models is still very rare. Thus,
    how to build IoT-based decision support systems as well as mathematical models
    to optimally support the L-IoT, and how to solve models have become important
    potentials for future research. c) Developing tools to deal with sources of uncertainty.
    Working and investing in the IoT can, on the one hand, be difficult and fraught
    with technical uncertainty and high risk, which should be addressed to increase
    its trustworthiness and acceptability [506], especially in RFID-based pharmaceutical
    logistics [534]. The IoT, on the other hand, can reduce risk and uncertainty by
    monitoring and managing misjudgment resulting from uncertainty [82, 535]. Therefore,
    the development of methods and tools to manage this contradiction can be good
    research potential in both investment and operation phases. In this regard, due
    to the seriousness of uncertainty, more attention to robust optimization techniques
    seems more reasonable than other mathematical optimization approaches. d) Using
    a case-based research strategy. The other major research opportunity can be conducted
    from Fig. 10(b) and Fig. 10(d). Fig. 10(d) shows the significant growth of case-based
    approaches compared to the very small growth of data-driven methods to address
    L-IoT. Notwithstanding, Fig. 10(b) shows that there is currently less emphasis
    on case-based approaches than on data-based methods. This is while in dealing
    with new topics, the use of real cases is better than the development of conceptual
    research [183]. Thus, future research is required to assess the system in practice.
    e) Developing a generic mechanism for case adaption. Although a general architecture
    is proposed in this paper for an L-IoT network, there is no generic mechanism
    for case adaptation. This may be because case adaptation can be a very complex
    process in attempting to derive modification rules [536] in such a fast-changing
    pull (customer-driven) network [536]. Therefore, developing a general mechanism
    that can be used almost unchanged for almost all logistics applications could
    be a potential opportunity for future research. In this regard, the development
    of diverse, integrated, and effective hardware facilities that enable L-IoT implementation
    can be helpful. f) Focusing on continuous event systems. Continuous events, unlike
    discrete events in which an event occurs at a particular time, include events
    that last at least for some amount of time [8]. Reviewing the literature shows
    that answering how and why questions on L-IoT in continuous event systems, such
    as a cold chain or continuous-flow manufacturing, still needs more effort from
    both academicians and practitioners. Because existing architectures do not process
    continuous event flows efficiently [537]. g) Working on better data processing
    tools. The big data generated from the IoT devices, which should be aggregated
    and analyzed in real-time, make the traditional data processing methods inapplicable
    for the L-IoT. Further, due to the different data formats and different applications,
    the RFID and WSNs need different data processing methods for data filtering, aggregation,
    and other data processing. Therefore, it is necessary to do research on information
    access format, data storage format, data processing methods, and mechanisms of
    security control. In this regard, although there are challenges when applying
    AI for decision-making based on big data [538], recent advances in the IoT and
    AI have provided opportunities to take advantage of their combined approaches
    [539]. In addition, since ML allows data processing algorithms and approaches
    to be applied on large-scale systems, it can be applied in IoT device computing,
    AI, and logistics terminal management, etc. [153, 540] as in the petrochemical
    industries [541] and smart cities [542]. h) Focusing on the cost-efficiency of
    the L-IoT. The cost of connecting to the IoT terminal [543], [544], [545] may
    not be important for large businesses, but it is a big deal for Small and Medium-sized
    Enterprises (SMEs). It is while its development is heavily subject to its influence
    on SMEs that are considered the economic backbone of many countries [546]. This
    may make the cost issue more critical for L-IoT. Because it needs to install large-scale
    infrastructures, such as sensors and computers in every container, vehicle, and
    warehouse, and to hire qualified managers and educate employees [547]. So, working
    on the development of cost-effective L-IoT can be a good potential for future
    research. i) Defining the role of government. Given the cost of planning and implementing
    the IoT in logistics, the role of government legislation to encourage industries
    and services, despite its importance, has received little attention [548]. How
    to standardize the L-IoT and how to encourage on-line marketing and trading based
    on the IoT technology can then be the future directions for researchers in the
    field of L-IoT. Legislation, standardization, and governmental support become
    even more important in such industries as postal logistics that are more vulnerable
    to information and communication technology upgrades and improvements. j) Focusing
    on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)/ Electronic-waste (E-waste)
    management. The IoT, while increasing E-waste, is also a good tool for managing
    E-waste [549]. Thus, with a growing interest in using IoT technology, E-waste
    management will become more important in the future [550]. Thus, research works
    on reverse logistics and closed-loop SC of E-waste, which have been reviewed in
    [551], may be a good potential for future research. In this regard, EPCs can allow
    the involvement of various agents of a reverse logistics network for information
    sharing [552]. In the meantime, moving towards smart and expert infrastructures
    for identification, tracing, proper separation, on-time collection, and recovery
    of E-waste may be an interesting direction for future research [553]. k) Integrating
    electric vehicles, smart grids, and IoT technologies, using renewable energy resources
    towards green smart transportation. Road transport is one of the main energy consumers
    and causes many environmental pollution issues [554]. Although electric vehicles,
    which are playing an important role in the intelligent transportation system [555],
    have been introduced to deal with this issue, uncertainty [556] and lack of efficient
    and intelligent charge scheduling process are big challenges in their use [557,
    558]. In this regard, good integration of smart grids equipped with sensors, meters,
    and renewable energies through Microgrids and electric vehicles with IoT technology
    may facilitate intelligent transportation and further enhance greenness and sustainability.
    Thus, it may become a good potential for further research. l) Moving towards further
    integration of the IoT technology in railway logistics systems. Automated Guided
    Vehicles (AGVs) can enhance the safety and efficiency of objects and cargo transportation
    [559, 560]. By this means, doing research on flexible and intelligent IoT-based
    railway logistics using WiFi telecommunication, automated conveying, intelligent
    sorting, etc. may be an opportunity for further development of railway logistics
    based on IoT technology. Establishing an IoT-based railway transport information
    management, monitoring, and emergency command systems can also be the other potential
    for future research in the field of railway logistics systems. In this way, establishing
    a good technical architecture of this type of logistics, which is in connection
    with the basic IoT layers, can be of interest, especially for practitioners. Declaration

    of Things (IoT) is a network of smart things that share information over the internet.
    The smart things are used to deploy in a different environment to capture the
    information, and some events are triggered. The applications of IoT is a smart
    city, smart home, Intelligent transportation system, agriculture, hospital, supply
    chain system, earthquake detection, a smart grid system. As per CISCO estimated,
    the IoT devices connected will be 50 billion at the end of 2020. The grown of
    IoT devices is rapidly changing as it crosses the total world population. The
    data generated by the IoT devices are enormous. In traditional IoT, architecture
    is three types physical, network, and application layer. In the physical layer,
    devices are embedded with some technology which way they sense the environment
    and also able to connect in wired or wireless to the other device. Like in the
    smart home system fridge can place an order automatically to the registered retailer
    whenever the fruits chamber empty it, and notification will be sent to the home
    users. The similarity in smart hospital patients can monitor in an emergency through
    sensors and corresponding computing devices. As the sensors are low-end devices,
    less computation power, and have heterogeneous properties. Implementation of IoT
    comes with lots of challenges. The standardization, interoperability, data storage,
    processing, trust management, identity, confidentiality, integrity, availability,
    security, and privacy are some of the open challenges in various IoT applications
    [1]. The IoT is one of the most emerging technologies in the last decade and its
    uses in numerous applications area. Security and privacy are still challenges
    in many applications area. Some research work addressing security and privacy
    issue in IoT is already done. But as the new technology comes, which can address
    so of the security issue in IoT. So in this work, authors have identified three
    leading technologies like ML, Blockchain, and AI, which address different security
    issues. 1.1. Objective and contribution The main objective of this survey is to
    find out the security and privacy challenges that exist in IoT applications. The
    authors also identified some emerging technology that can address security issues
    present in the system. Here the main goal is to find the research challenges and
    corresponding solution approach in IoT security. The following are the contribution
    of the paper: • The paper explained the IoT architecture and its enabling technology
    with challenges. • The security issues in the IoT system are identified as in-depth
    layer-wise. • An extensive survey on similar technologies like machine learning,
    artificial intelligence, and Blockchain technology integration with IoT security
    are performed. • The research challenges and corresponding solution approach with
    emerging technology (ML, AI, Blockchain) are also explained. 1.2. Paper organization
    The rest of the paper organized as in Section 2 related work of security and privacy
    issues of IoT are identified, and comparison was also made. The IoT architecture
    details and associated technology are described in Section 3. The security issues
    are explained in Section 4. The different security issues address in IoT applications
    using Machine Learning, Artificial intelligence, and Blockchain technology are
    explained in detail in Sections 5–7 sequentially. An analysis of the entire survey
    and future challenges are summarized in Section 8. The paper concludes with a
    summary of the work done in Section 9. 2. Related work The authors explain the
    underlying system architecture and security issues in paper[2]. Previously some
    works related to a security issue in IoT applications, infrastructure are already
    done. In Table 1, a summary of some of the survey works is mentioned. Although
    several works already exist in this regard from different perspectives, for implementation
    purposes, there is no such study done. So in this survey, authors have identified
    the recent emerging technology (ML, AI, Blockchain), which can be addressed security
    issues in IoT. Some of the work integration with recent technology and IoT has
    already been done. In this survey, the authors tried to give the details about
    the insight of that technology how it will solve security challenges in IoT. This
    will helps the reader to understand the IoT infrastructure creation and implementing
    it securely. Table 1. Related surveys work on IoT security. Reference paper Year
    Contribution Jing et al. [3] 2014 The security issue of three layers of IoT and
    its corresponding solution are surveyed in this paper. Ngu et al. [4] 2016 The
    IoT middleware based architecture is proposed and explained each layer details.
    The authors also described the adaptability and security issues in the IoT middleware
    system. Mosenia et al. [5] 2016 The authors in this survey explained the reference
    model and security threads present on the edge side of the model. The paper also
    reviewed the countermeasure to address the possible solutions. Lin et al. [6]
    2017 The paper initially described the IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integration.
    The security and privacy issues survey in detail. The edge/fog computing integration
    with IoT is also explained in this survey paper. Yang et al. [7] 2017 The paper
    has done a survey on security and privacy issue on IoT applications and systems.
    The authors reviewed the authentication protocol in the IoT system. The challenging
    security issue in four-layer architecture based IoT application are explained
    in details. Alaba et al. [8] 2017 The authors in this survey investigated the
    state of art security issues in IoT applications. The threats and vulnerability
    of the system in terms of communications, architecture, and applications are extensively
    reviewed. the paper concludes with the solution approach for different security
    issues. Grammatikis et al. [9] 2018 The paper provides a detailed study of IoT
    security layer-wise. The suitable countermeasure and potential threats model are
    discussed in detail. Das et al. [10] 2018 The authors in this paper investigate
    the security and threat model in IoT applications. The paper mentioned some of
    the issues in IoT systems like authentication, trust management, and access control.
    Some solution approach was also addressed. Di Martino et al. [11] 2018 This paper
    reviewed the different standardized architecture of IoT systems and the current
    solution approach in terms of Security and Interoperability are explained. Hassija
    et al. [12] 2019 The authors of this paper reviewed the security and threat in
    IoT applications. The different solution approach using machine learning, fog
    computing, edge computing, and Blockchain was proposed. Proposed paper 2020 The
    authors in this paper initially identified the necessary Infrastructure, Protocol,
    Application of the IoT system. Then security issue is identified in the IoT model.
    Some emerging technique which can be used to solve the security issues in IoT
    is identified. After a rigorous survey, the authors found that machine learning,
    Blockchain, and Artificial intelligence are the current solution approach to solve
    the Security issue in IoT. 3. Internet of things (IoT) infrastructure,protocol,
    application Internet of Things (IoT) has lots of potentials to apply in different
    real-time applications. It integrates sensors, smart devices, radiofrequency identification
    (RFID), and the Internet to build an intelligent system. As per Goldman Sachs
    estimated 28 billion smart things would be connected to a different network by
    2020. The growth of IoT in the last decade in such a way that it incorporates
    everything from sensors to cloud computing intermediate with fog/edge computing.
    The IoT has different types of a network like a distributed, ubiquitous, grid,
    and vehicular. The applications of IoT made a huge impact in day to day life like
    sensors deploy in the patient body to monitoring in critical condition, monitoring
    gas leakage in smart kitchen, agriculture field, smart car parking, smart transportation,
    tracking goods details in supply chain system using sensors in the vehicle. The
    sensors are resource constraint devices connected through wired or wirelessly
    across heterogeneous networks. The IoT networks are possessed different security,
    privacy, and vulnerable to the attacker. 3.1. IoT infrastructure IoT application
    consists of different smart things that collect, process, compute and communicate
    with other smart things. IoT has three layers physical, network, and application
    layer. Recently industries are developed many things which are embedded with intelligent
    things. As shown in Fig. 1 IoT infrastructure consists of not only sensors, but
    it also integrates with some emerging technology. The IoT application is based
    on either IoT-Cloud or IoT-Fog-Cloud. The security issue like data privacy [13],
    machine to machine communication [14], real-time monitoring [15] and IoT testbed
    [16] are need to be addressed for efficient IoT applications. The architecture
    of IoT may be centralized, distributed, decentralized structure. In IoT application
    processing and computing in real-time is one of the most challenging issues. Cloud
    computing provides more storage and assures security to the data. But recently,
    most of the real-time monitoring IoT application demand processing and computing
    in the edge of the network. So that quick action can be taken like monitoring
    the health condition of the serious patient, fire detection. When processing and
    computing are done on the edge of the network using fog devices, it becomes more
    vulnerable to the attacker as their devices are lightweight device traditional
    security is not applicable. During analytic data, a technique like a machine learning
    is recently used to make the IoT system more intelligent and independent to make
    a decision. The different smart devices are connected to make an application using
    some standard protocols. The security issue exists in IoT infrastructure, which
    needs to be addressed to build trust among end-users and make the system temper-proof.
    The data interoperability [17] in the IoT system works using an intelligent algorithm.

    3.2. Standard protocol The basic IoT architecture is a four layer network. Each
    of these layer consists of some standard protocol as shown in Table 2. Table 2.

    3.2.1. MQTT MQTT stands for transportation of MQ Telemetry. It is a straightforward
    and lightweight messaging protocol for publishing / subscribe, designed for restricted
    devices and low bandwidth, high latency, or unreliable networks. The design principles
    are to minimize the requirements for network bandwidth and device resources while
    also trying to ensure reliability and some degree of delivery assurance. These
    principles also result in making the protocol ideal for the emerging world of
    low end connected devices “machine-to-machine” (M2 M) or “Internet of Things.”
    3.2.2. CoAP Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), as defined in RFC 7252, is
    a specialized Internet Application Protocol for restricted devices. It allows
    those restricted devices called “nodes” to use similar protocols to communicate
    with the broader Internet. CoAP is designed to be used by devices on the same
    network. 3.2.3. REST REST stands for State Transfer Member. REST is an architecture
    based on web standards and uses the HTTP protocol. It revolves around resources
    where each element is a resource, and a resource is accessed using standard HTTP
    methods through a specific interface. Roy Fielding introduced REST in 2000. A
    REST server offers access to resources in REST architecture, and REST user accesses
    and modifies resources. Here, URIs / global IDs classify each asset. REST uses
    a variety of representations to describe a resource such as text, JSON, XML. 3.2.4.
    AMQP An open standard for transferring business messages between applications
    or organizations is the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It connects
    systems, feeds business processes with the information they need, and transmits
    the instructions that achieve their goals reliably forward. 3.2.5. TCP Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented communications protocol that provides
    the facility to exchange messages in a network between computer devices. 3.2.6.
    UDP A Transport Layer protocol is the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). UDP is part
    of the Internet Protocol suite, known as UDP / IP. Like TCP, this protocol is
    unstable and unconnected. There is thus no need to create a link before transferring
    data. 3.2.7. DCCP DCCP provides a way for congestion-control mechanisms to be
    accessed without having to implement them at the application layer. It allows
    flow-based semiconducting, as in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), but
    does not provide reliable delivery on-order. Sequenced transmission across multiple
    streams is not possible in DCCP, as in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
    (SCTP). A DCCP link requires both the network acknowledgment and data traffic.
    Acknowledgments notify a sender that their packets have arrived and whether they
    have been labeled with an Explicit Notification of Congestion (ECN). 3.2.8. SCTP
    The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a computer networking communication
    protocol that operates at the transportation layer and serves a similar role to
    the popular TCP and UDP protocols. It is defined in RFC 4960 by IETF.SCTP incorporates
    some of the features of both UDP and TCP: it is message-oriented like UDP and
    ensures secure, in-sequence congestion-controlled transmission of messages like
    TCP. It differs from those protocols by providing multi-homing and redundant paths
    to increase resilience and reliability. 3.2.9. RSVP The Resource Reservation Protocol
    (RSVP) is a transport layer [1] protocol designed to use the distributed infrastructure
    model to reserve resources across a network. RSVP works over an IPv4 or IPv6 and
    sets up resource reservations for multicast or unicast data flows, initiated by
    the recipient. It does not transmit data from applications but is similar to a
    control protocol, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) or the
    Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). RSVP is set out in RFC 2205. 3.2.10.
    QUIC QUIC (pronounced’ quick’) is a general-purpose network layer protocol initially
    designed by Google’s Jim Roskind, introduced and deployed in 2012, publicly announced
    in 2013 as an extended experiment and defined by the IETF. While still an Internet-Draft,
    more than half of all Chrome web browser connections to Google’s servers use QUIC.[citation
    needed] Most other web browsers don’t follow the protocol. 3.2.11. CLNS Connectionless
    mode Network Service (CLNS) or simply Connectionless Network Service is an OSI
    Network Layer datagram service that does not require a circuit to be set up before
    data is transmitted, and routes messages to their destinations independently of
    any other messages. CLNS is not an Internet service but offers features similar
    to those offered by the Internet Protocol (IP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
    in an OSI Network environment. 3.2.12. DDP Distributed Data Protocol (or DDP)
    is a client-server protocol designed to query and update a server-side database
    and to synchronize such updates between clients. It uses a messaging pattern for
    publish-subscribe. The Meteor JavaScript application was developed for use. 3.2.13.
    ICMP Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS) or simply Connectionless Network
    Service is an OSI Network Layer datagram service that does not allow a circuit
    to be set up before data is transmitted and routes messages to their destinations
    independently of any other messages. As such, it is a best-effort rather than
    a “reliable” delivery service. CLNS is not an Internet service but offers features
    similar to those offered by the Internet Protocol (IP) and User Datagram Protocol
    (UDP) in an OSI Network environment. 3.2.14. DSI Digital Serial Interface (DSI)
    is a protocol for regulating lighting (initially electrical ballast) in buildings.
    It is based on Manchester-coded 8-bit protocol, 1200 baud data rate, 1 start bit,
    8 data bits (dim value), 4 stop bits, and is the basis for the more advanced Digital
    Addressable Lighting Interface (DALI) protocol. The technology uses a single byte
    (0–255 or 0x00-0xFF) to communicate the lighting level. DSI was the first use
    of digital communication to control lighting and was the precursor to DALI. 3.2.15.
    ISDN Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of communication standards
    for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network
    services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network.
    The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines,
    adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. In the
    emergency mode of IoT devices, the ISDN facility can be useful. 3.3. Application
    IoT applications are nowadays developed in many fields. The development of many
    open-source platforms like Azure IoT Suite, IBM Watson, Amazon Web Services (AWS),
    Oracle IoT, Kaa, Bevywise IoT platform used for industrial IoT, IoTIFY cloud-based
    platform used to build scalable IoT applications. Most of the opensource platform
    is enabled with AI and ML technology for intelligent processing and computing
    the information. The manufacture of smart devices that can read, process, and
    computing the things makes the IoT as one of the emerging fields. There are many
    application areas where IoT is used, as shown in Fig. 2. In these eight different
    application fields, IoT has already made an impact on enhancing and increasing
    the efficiency of the system. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Internet
    of things applications. 3.3.1. Smart home The IoT makes the traditional home system
    into an intelligent one. The refrigerator, smart television, security camera,
    gas sensors, temperature sensor, light system all can sense the home environment,
    communicate and connect to the internet through wired or wireless. Even the refrigerator
    can place an order to the registered retail shop and give notification to the
    user. Due to the development of smart things, the living standard becomes more
    comfortable. In paper [18], authors design a smart home system based on IoT technology.
    Using technology like IoT and Fog computing home converted into an intelligent
    home system where monitoring of the home can be done remotely as well as processing
    can be done instantly. The authentication of devices is essential to prevent unwanted
    access to the IoT network. The authors in Satapathy et al. [19] and Panda et al.
    [20] proposed different authentication schemes for a smart home network. Still,
    some security issues [21], are exist in IoT based smart home systems. 3.3.2. Smart
    hospital Since the development of IoT patient monitoring in real-time is possible
    with the use of sensors and fog/edge computing, the paper [22], authors have proposed
    an IoT-cloud based framework for data collection in the healthcare system. Similarly,
    in Moosavi et al. [23], authors performed the authentication and authorization
    of the smart devices in the healthcare system. In the healthcare system, privacy
    is one of the main issues, so proper security and privacy protocol need to be
    developed to secure the system. 3.3.3. Smart city The ever-growing city has lots
    of problems like traffic management, waste management, waste management, and environmental
    management. The city needs a solution to monitor and control the problem exist.
    In papers [24], [25], authors explained the challenges that exist in implementing
    smart cities and done a survey in detail about how IoT can solve an existing problem.
    Using IoT and associated technology, a smart city can be developed to enhance
    the living standard of the city, maintaining the security and privacy issue of
    the citizen. 3.3.4. Smart transportation In recent times traffic is one of the
    major problems in a city. The intelligent transportation system is the need of
    the hour. The IoT enables vehicles can collect information from the roadside unit
    and process to get the details about journey path, time, and traffic details.
    Some of the research work [26], [27] addressed the smart transportation issue
    using IoT. In paper [28], the authors proposed the IoT-ITS system for the transportation
    system. The authors in Dey et al. [29] proposed a “Magtrack” to detect condition
    of the road surface using in-build mobile sensors and machine learning concepts.
    3.3.5. Smart grid The smart grid is one of the application areas of IoT, where
    a grid system can be made automation using IoT. The electric power generation
    and distribution among consumers can be monitor in real-time. The cybersecurity
    solution approach [30] is explained in detail. The architecture of the IoT-Cloud
    based system proposed by the authors in paper [31]. The efficient, economical
    and distribution can be improved using the IoT technology in the smart grid system.
    3.3.6. Supply chain system The IoT smart devices, once used in a supply chain
    management system, can fundamentally change the traditional way to monitor the
    transport system. By using the IoT technique, the material is easily located,
    their current condition, packing details, and it is easy to track how goods are
    a move through the supply chain. It increases to maintain the demand-supply of
    good, easy to monitor the material movement, real-time tracking, efficient storage,
    energy efficient [32], and distribution. The authors in Li et al. [33], explained
    how tracking and tracing could be done in real-time using the IoT system. Similarly,
    in paper [34], [35] authors, discussed the IoT based architecture and risk management
    in the supply chain system. In paper [34], authors have proposed artificial intelligent
    integration with IoT for the retail shop supply chain system. 3.3.7. Smart retails
    The retail sector also using IoT services along with artificial intelligent[36]
    to enhance productivity, improve store operation, and to take the decision in
    real-time to manage the inventory system. 3.3.8. Agriculture Agriculture is one
    of the promising application areas in IoT. In a smart agriculture system by deploying
    the sensors to monitor the soil quality, water management, crop growing condition,
    etc. which improve the farming efficiency by reducing time and cost. In real-time,
    a user can monitor all details from the remote locations. In paper [37], [38]
    authors proposed smart irrigation using machine learning and IoT to enhance farming.
    similarly, in paper [39], [40], smart water management and weather conditions
    in the agriculture system are explained in detail. Likewise, in paper [41], [42],
    smart agriculture system integration with IoT technologies is explained in detail.
    As some of the work already done in the field of agriculture, still some security
    issues exist like mobility, infrastructure, and secure processing of the collected
    data. 4. Security attacks in internet of things In Table 3 some common Internet
    of Things attacks in the different layer is shown along with the current research
    work done on the corresponding attacks types. Table 3. The different security
    attacks in IoT. Different attacks cases and relevant research papers Empty Cell
    Attacks type Paper IoT Attacks Jamming attacks [43] DoS attacks [44] Intrusion
    detection System [45] Malicious node [46] Power analysis attack [47], [48] Internal
    attacks [49] Access control [50] Wormhole attack [51] Side channel security [52]
    Distributed Dos [53] Man in the Middle attack [54] Active attacks [55] Routing
    attacks [56] Sybil attacks [57], [58] Deceptive attack [59] Spoofing [60] Buffer
    overflow attack [61] Impersonation attack [62] Jamming attack is a subset of DoS
    attacks where the attacker tries to affect the communication channel in paper
    [43] authors also explained the details about the jamming attacks. Dos attack
    is one of the common attack used in IoT applications. Most of the IoT devices
    are a low-end device which is vulnerable to the attacker. The attacker gets under
    the data traffic stream through device connection or infrastructure. Denial of
    service (DoS) attacks, consists of a huge volume of network packets, targeting
    the node present in the application causes service interrupt in real-time [44].
    Intrusion detection system(IDS) is the process in which network traffic is control
    by the attacker. There are some types of IDS attacks, like misuse detection, anomaly
    detection, Host-based IDS, and Network-based IDS. The authors in paper [45] described
    the IDS attacks in IoT network. Malicious node attack is possible in a distributed
    IoT network due to the heterogeneous nature of the smart devices. The identify
    the genius node or fake node in the network is a challenging one. In paper [46]
    authors proposed a perception and K-mean to build the trust among the node and
    detect the malicious node. Power analysis attack and its corresponding solution
    approach are explained in papers [47], [48]. This attack is mainly made to gain
    the computational power of the nodes so that the basic cryptographic algorithm
    is not possible to execute. In an IoT network, privacy also needs to be maintained
    to build trust among the node. Internal attack in paper [49] and Access control
    attack in paper [50] are discussed in details. Wormhole attack is taken place
    at the 6LoWPAN layer, where the attacker makes a tunnel between two nodes that
    are connected [51]. The Side channel security attack in cloud-based IoT application
    along with the security challenges are explained in paper [52]. Similarly, Distributed
    Dos attack is the process where the server is unreachable so that smart nodes
    in the network can not get the services it desires to get [53]. Man-in-the-middle
    attack, where the attacker relays the message or change the message during the
    transmission in the insecure channel, explained in Li et al. [54] IoT-Fog network.
    Active attacks is explained in Zhang et al. [55] and its corresponding solution
    in the physical layer of the IoT network. There are different types of active
    attacks possible in IoT, where attackers make changes in the target node. The
    authors in Raoof et al. [56] explained the Routing attacks in routing protocol
    lossy network based on IoT application. The Sybil attack is one most common types
    of attack in IoT. The authors in Zhang et al. [57] and Mishra et al. [58] study
    the phases of Sybil attacks and their countermeasures in the internet of things.
    The Deceptive attack in La et al. [59] and Spoofing attack in Zhang et al. [60]
    authors have addressed the corresponding attacks and their security analysis in
    the internet of things applications. The Buffer overflow attacks is the process
    of writing the program in a block of memory where the memory space is insufficient.
    The A IoT network, when nodes execute the different programs in the deices for
    processing or computation purpose attackers, can capture that and perform memory
    overflow attack. The detecting buffer overflow attack and providing appropriate
    security design in explained in Xu et al. [61]. In a large IoT network where heterogeneous
    devices are connected and communicate with each other. The trust is one of the
    major issues in the network. The Impersonation [62] attacks where a fake node
    behaves like a genius node in the network and tries to gain the information from
    other nodes. This is one of the most challenging issues in IoT applications where
    smart devices are heterogeneous and low-end devices. 5. Security issue address
    using machine learning The machine learning is a technique to perform computational
    intelligently. The model needs to design and test using different learning methods.
    Figs. 3 and 4 describe the basic principle of machine learning functionality and
    integration with IoT applications. As discussed in Section 3.3 application of
    the Internet of Things is many. Some of the application requirement is decision
    should be taken before the actual event occurs. For example, predicting the fire
    in a kitchen or any industrial area and alarm the sound to prevent the fire. This
    could be possible if machine learning technologies are used in IoT applications.
    Also, it needs to address the security issue present in the IoT system ta make
    the system tamper-proof. An efficient framework [63] is required to process and
    compute the huge data collection using a machine learning technique. In paper
    [64], authors review the security issue associated when applying machine learning
    in a smart grid application. In paper [65], [66] authors address the intrusion
    detection in IoT application. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The

    or benign network activity and to detect network-based cyber-attacks such as DoS,
    MITM/Spoofing, Replay, and Reconnaissance and also to detect a multi-stage attack
    on IoT networks. [67] 2017 Proposed a physical-layer authentication (PLA) scheme

    spoofing detection accuracy. [68] 2017 Proposed an ML-based malicious app detection
    tool that uses naive Bayesian, J48 decision tree as a classifier model to detect
    malicious applications instantaneously in Android devices. [69] 2018 Implemented
    an autonomous and adaptive detection mechanisms using ML and software-defined
    networking (SDN) for their IoT security framework to deal with the problem of
    erratic behavior and heterogeneity of IoT systems. [70] 2018 Presented the different
    ML methods that can be applied to the data generated in the IoT system based environments

    technique by analyzing the traffic flow exchange in IoT gateways. To detect the
    network attacks online such as TCP SYN attack, which is a variety of denial-of-service
    (DoS) attacks. [73] 2018 The authors proposed a robust real-time distributed fog-based
    attack detection framework for IoT, which relies on a fog computing paradigm and
    a newly proposed ELM-based Semi-supervised Fuzzy C-Means (ESFCM). Extreme Learning
    Machine (ELM) algorithm provides good generalization performance at a faster detection
    rate, and semi-supervised Fuzzy C-Means method handles the labeled data issue
    in IoT. [74] 2018 The proposed a new darknet analysis method to find the traffic
    patterns of a specific scanning attack i.e., TCP SYN packets due to the majority
    of darknet packets using the association rule learning. [75] 2018 The authors
    proposed a novel algorithm for quantifiable intelligent trust assessment model
    to overcome the issue of potential discrimination. The data analytics is done
    over delicate information such as locations, interests, and activities, using
    the SVM model of ML. This process generates exact and inherent trust values for
    probable actors. It helps in determining whether an incoming interaction is trustworthy
    or not, based on several trusts features corresponding to an IoT environment.

    emitter identification (SEI) on IoT devices using raw in-phase and quadrature
    (IQ) streams, with protocols to secure IoT networks by providing an extra layer
    of security and trust. 6. Security issue address using artificial intelligence
    The innovation of smart devices having sensing and acting capability makes the
    IoT system usability in widely. As the numbers of devices are connected to the
    network are huge, which generate a large volume of data. To process and perform
    computation is a challenging task in an IoT environment. So Artificial intelligence
    comes as a rescue along with some other emerging technology to address the security
    issue in IoT. As shown in Fig. 5, IoT and AI can combine to improve the analysis
    of the system, improve operational efficiency, and improve the accuracy rate.
    The authors in Ghosh et al. [82] explained that AI could help IoT huge volume,
    unstructured data, heterogeneous data to compute in real-time, which makes the
    system realistic. The authors propose the large margin cosine estimation (LMCE)
    technique in this paper [83] to detect the adversary in IoT enable environments.

    Fig. 6, integration of IoT and AI with some basic functionality are shown. The
    combination of AI and IoT some work is already done by the researcher addressing
    that AI can be a driving force to make the IoT system more improve in decision
    making and doing computation.The authors apply a master attack in IoT enables
    smart city application based on AI [86]. Similarly, in Zou et al. [87], the authors

    issue address using blockchain technology Blockchain technology is a decentralized/distributed
    network where each is connected to others in some way. The message is broadcast
    in the Blockchain network. As shown in Fig. 7 distributed architecture based on
    blockchain techniques in IoT application. A block consists of lots of valid transaction
    and its associated attributes. The smart contract [88] are self executable program
    used to implement the business logic in the network. The Blockchain network uses
    different consensus algorithm [89] to meet the consensus among the nodes. The
    details Blockchain architecture and application areas are explained in paper [90]
    by the authors. The authors in paper [91], [92] described the mechanism and related
    work on IoT security along with Blockchain as a solution approach.The authors
    have proposed a secure framework for the internet of things applications based
    on a distributed Blockchain system in Satapathy et al. [93]. The use of Blockchain
    technology in IoT is briefly given in paper [94] by the authors. The many IoT
    security challenges and corresponding Blockchain solutions, along with the implementation
    challenges, are review by the authors in paper [95]. In Table 7, Table 8, Table

    Related work blockchain and IoT security. Focus area Reference Contribution Privacy
    Perservation [118], [119] [120], [121] [122] In an IoT application, privacy is
    a significant concern for the end-users. The blockchain-based encryption techniques
    are proposed by different authors to solve the privacy preservation issue. Authentication
    [123], [124] [125], [126] [127] [128] The device authentication is one of the
    important factors for secure communication in the IoT network. The different methods,
    like mutual authentication, PSO-AES, and distributed authentication, are used
    for IoT device authentication using blockchain techniques. Access Control [129],
    [130] The management of devices accessibility in the IoT system is essential as
    critical information is sense using different smart things. The attribute-based
    access control and blockchain-based permission delegation access control techniques
    are proposed by the researcher to manage the accessibility of the vital information
    securely. Scalability [131], [132] The work has already been done to address the
    scalable issue in IoT network using blockchain. Information Share [133], [134]
    [135], [136] [137], [138] [139], [140] Information exchange in the IoT network
    is very important in real-time monitoring of the environment. The blockchain-based
    secure information share mechanism is integrated with the IoT system. Trust Management
    [141], [142] [143], [144] [145] In many IoT applications, multiple nodes are required
    in the decision-making process for better and efficient decisions. Some work has
    already been done regarding trust management. 8. Analysis of the survey and research
    challenges The Internet of Things (IoT) in recent time attract lots of attention
    to the research community as well as an industry sector. The IoT devices are manufactures
    in large number which already cross the total world population. These smart devices
    are connected to different applications for capturing information from the environment.
    The IoT devices are resource constraint devices, so devices are vulnerable to
    the attacker. Security and privacy issues are important for IoT applications.
    So this survey is carried out in-depth to identified security and privacy issues
    that exist in the IoT system up to March 2020. The solution approaches of these
    security and privacy issues solved by some emerging technologies are also discussed.

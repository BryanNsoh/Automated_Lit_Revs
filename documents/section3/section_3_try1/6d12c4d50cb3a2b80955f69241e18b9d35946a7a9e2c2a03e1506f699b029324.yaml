    systemsManagement systemsSmart cities 1. Introduction Internet of Things (IoT)
    based automation has been trending for years now. From automating industrial machinery
    to consumer houses, automation is being integrated into every aspect of our lives.
    IoT is the basis of automation that connects various devices on a single network,
    allowing them to communicate and exchange data and resources (Lee & Lee, 2015).
    It can either work as a central/peripheral system with one core and multiple nodes
    or by decentralizing the network and by managing it without depending on a single
    center for the system. Several nodes can connect and extend the network in order
    to increase the functionality of the system. The complete mesh of IoT comprises
    of several sensors, actuators, devices and components that are connected through
    a communication protocol. To be able to collect, analyze, exchange and produce
    data is what makes IoT a powerful tool, leading towards “smartness”. Many industries
    have transformed into smart and IoT based systems, that has given rise to several
    sub domains of IoT that are interacting with a common man now more as compared
    to the situation a decade ago. Smart home automation is a very familiar concept
    these days, which started in the beginning of last decade as Machine 2 Machine
    (M2M) communication using wired technologies. The architectures were complex to
    implement and hassle rather than a comfort (Schneps-Schneppe, Maximenko, Namiot,
    & Malov, 2012). As the technology was expensive and inaccessible, it was mostly
    a luxury than a necessity and could only be afforded by some. Hence cost metrics
    started to play an important role in addition to the performance metrics. Over
    the course of years, affordable and efficient sensors were beginning to develop
    (Ciuffoletti, 2018) and new protocol suites started to emerge in order to implement
    those devices in a holistic manner (Al-Sarawi, Anbar, Alieyan, & Alzubaidi, 2017).
    Although initially, the home automation systems were merely a structure confined
    to each room separately without any information interchange among the devices
    (Soliman, Alahmadi, Maash, & Elhabib, 2017). Nonetheless, the integration of IoT
    to the automation systems is a newer step in this technology. The IoT has been
    boosted and its concept initiated from this area of interest, then accessibility
    of IoT is extended from the heavy industries to common house holds. Now a days,
    smart homes is not a new topic and has been extensively implemented over the last
    decade. The concept has now matured enough as the mankind is getting more into
    the themes of ease and comfort. This technology is useful to implement the smart
    home automation along with simple communication protocols and the ability to control
    every nook and corner of a house using a hand held device (Kumar et al., 2021).
    The future is now reaching into the integrated smart homes systems and setting
    up colonies and towns with shared information systems. This is one step ahead
    of the smart homes automation and needs some important factors to look into scalability,
    sustainability, and integration and sharing of information systems (Blasi, Ganzaroli,
    & Noni, 2022). Smart cities are broadly defined as a modern urban area that makes
    use of ubiquitous technology in order to improve the life standards of its residents
    (Nuaimi et al., 2015, Yin et al., 2015). Its architecture can be divided into
    various subsections and departments like Smart homes, Transportation, Energy management,
    Health sector, Public welfare and Finance Management. All of these departments
    and sections (referred to as nodes in our paper) are in constant communication
    with each other and the sustainability of the city owes to the ease in smooth
    communication and robust data sharing. Smart cities are modeled and designed as
    information systems that consist of many modules where each module interacts with
    others and shares information and resources (Batty et al., 2012). Contrary to
    a smart home, the smart cities deal with the big data that is being sent and transmitted
    from a number of sources. Computation and management data at such a large scale
    requires smart and scalable solution that could cater the needs of all the nodes
    information system. A large number of literature has been produced on the concept
    of smart homes and its automation (Ghayvat et al., 2015, Klein and Kaefer, 2008,
    Silva et al., 2018). However, the concept of smart cities is yet in its hatching
    phase and needs to be matured. In this paper we have collected a literature of
    the existing research on automation systems in smart homes and analyzed it on
    the basis of its translation into smart cities. This paper studies the technology
    that has been used for smart homes and analyzes its use in order to provide information
    about designing sustainable smart cities infrastructures (Arasteh et al., 2016,
    Guelzim et al., 2016). The proposed paper also discussed the comparison of various
    technologies used for automation in developing smart homes and cities and finding
    new ways to communicate with each other in a cohesive manner (Hui, Sherratt, &
    Sánchez, 2017). In an attempt of doing this, we have presented a meticulous discussion
    of contemporary systems of technology used in smart home automation and the challenges
    in translating those to smart cities’ infrastructure and design, in depth analysis
    of the technical aspects of urban infrastructure and exploration for sustainable
    solutions for development. In addition to that there is a holistic comparison
    of technologies mentioned in literature used in urban management and planning
    in reference to various domains of Smart Cities, and a commentary on future research
    directions extracted from the challenges and limitations Following are the key
    contribution of this paper: • Technical advancement needed for transformation
    of home automation to a next level. • Smart cities that build from the foundation
    of homes automation’s have been discussed. • Comparison with the existing papers
    to unlock new research directions in this area. The remaining paper is divided
    into following sections, Section 2 discusses the research methodology, Section
    3 provides a background and detailed analysis of techniques presented in the past
    few years with comparison and possible outcomes. Section 4 presents the challenges
    present in utilizing state-of-the-art technologies for sustainable smart cities.
    Section 5 presents a comparison of this review with existing studies and finally
    it concludes with future directions for researchers. 2. Methodology In order to
    gather the scope of a research area in a holistic manner, we need to define the
    criteria on which the search is carried out. The research questions as mentioned
    in Table 1, categorize the studies into semi structured forms that makes it feasible
    to not only gather the data but also provide valuable insights about it. The basis
    of conducting a review is the sources used for gathering the information. There
    are number of digital sources such as Google Scholar, Science Direct and Scopus
    have used for searching of indexed articles and papers Scopus is a database indexed
    by expert editors. It has a refined structure and a uniform collection of articles
    that are tagged with the authors name, title, and publishers etc., along with
    providing citations that are helpful in assessing the quality of an article/author.
    It makes sure that the researcher gets reliable and accurate results. It provides
    the ease of searching through different formats ranging from texts to audio and
    videos etc. Collectively these cover a wide range of articles from 1900s to the
    modern era which gives a large scope of articles from various sources. These databases
    focus on the quality of the results fetched, removing the repeated articles, and
    providing the results that are actually what they appear to be, which makes them
    a better choice over the other search engines. The search criteria needs to be
    defined by using some keywords. In this papers following keywords were used to
    in Boolean search to gather articles from the databases. The articles collected
    were ranged from 2011 to 2023. • IoT AND “Automation systems” AND “Smart cities”
    AND “Components” OR “Sensors” • IoT AND “Automation systems” AND “Smart cities”
    AND “Smart homes” • IoT AND “Automation systems” AND “Smart cities” AND “Architecture”
    • “Automation systems” AND “Internet of Things” AND “Architecture models” AND

    analysis The concept of smart homes is being discussed since the start of past
    decade. With a number of technologies proposed since then, smart homes automation
    is evolving day by day. As the IoT techniques got more common along with concept
    of decentralization. Decentralized systems have proposed since the start of previous
    decade (Ghaleb and Azzedin, 2021, Plociennik et al., 2018) for communication,
    data sharing and power generation purpose. Decentralization not only prevented
    the loss of data and helped against data breach, but also saved the resources
    required in maintaining the online contact with a centralized system all the time
    (Gadekallu et al., 2022, Zhang and Yan, 2021). After a few years it got transformed
    into the idea of edge computing that not only affected the industrial automation
    practices but also home automation. The concept of integrating together smart
    homes into a community and forming smart cities has proposed in Emekci (2022).
    In this section a detailed comparative analysis of technologies used in smart
    homes is presented along with an analysis of how these technologies can be used
    to translate smart homes into sustainable smart cities. The analysis is divided
    into different technologies used for communication protocols, networking topologies,
    components, controllers, management systems, security and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI). An overall architecture of an IoT system is shown in Fig. 1 as mentioned
    in Asaithambi, Venkatraman, and Venkatraman (2021). Download : Download high-res

    3.1. Components and controllers An automated smart home consists of a complete
    network of nodes and meshes. Hardware is one of the important aspects in this
    area of interest. The choice of controllers and components mainly depends on the
    type of architecture used for automation and can play a huge role in taking up
    the automation technique to the next level. Adriansyah et al. used arduino to
    design a smart home automation based system (Adriansyah & Dani, 2014). Implementation
    of automation system at smart home on small scale required few temperature sensors
    and buzzers. David N. extended the architecture to further nodes and added the
    user interaction with different types of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) (David,
    2015). Arduino was considered first time for the purpose of automation, although
    it was inefficient due to less number of pins and functionalities. Raspberry pi
    has used by Vujović et al. to integrate with sensor web node. The system also
    provided a programmable GUI giving the ease of customization (Vujović & Maksimović,
    2015). The increase in trends of automation brought up the use of various controllers
    like PIC. Puri et al. designed a home automation system using PIC micro-controller
    and bluetooth as a communication medium (Puri & Nayyar, 2016). Patchava et al.
    used raspberry pi with motion sensors and also introduced functions like intruder
    detection using computer vision (Patchava, Kandala, & Babu, 2017). Apart from
    different controllers, sensors and actuators are tremendous importance in complete
    implementation of a smart home architecture (Hoque & Davidson, 2019). A multi
    sensor technique has been used by Hsu et al. in designing wearable bands integrated
    with main home system that increase user interaction. The system also used intelligence
    monitoring to analyze resources like energy usage etc (Hsu et al., 2017). Wadhwani
    et al. used embedded systems with relays and motor drivers, utilizing cloud based
    platforms integrated with various sensors (Wadhwani, Singh, Singh, & Dwivedi,
    2018). Different sensors like humidity, smoke detector, temperature sensors have
    integrated with different controllers to monitor the surroundings of the house
    and to respond to the collected readings like alarms and buzzers (Gunawan et al.,
    2017, Marhoon et al., 2018, Wahyuni et al., 2021, Yan et al., 2018). In addition
    to these, the components and devices have been designed to not only provide ease
    and comfort to people, but also help disabled people who are challenged physically
    or those who are aged, to improve the quality of their lives. Wearable integrated
    with smart homes have been designed to make their lives easier and better (Volety
    & Geethanjali, 2022). With the advancement in technology in addition to sensors
    and actuators, user interactivity started to gain importance. Augmented Reality
    (AR) integrated with the GUIs to provide an interactive user panel to control
    various functionalities around the smart home has proposed by Mishra, Karmakar,
    Bose, and Dutta (2020). The better controllers like ESP, Wemos and STM32 replaced
    Arduinos and PICs due to its high data transfer rate, multi functionality, and
    Internet accessibility. The sensor multiplexing made easy by using ESPs that also
    decreased the implementation cost (Nagendram, Kanakaraja, KiranNag, & Akhil, 2021).
    Overall the components are the most important fraction of a smart home. The functionality
    can be increased effectively using controllers like NodeMCU and ESPs in integration
    with Raspberry Pi that can help in extending the number of nodes and sensors while
    maintaining a centralized management. A comparison of various microcontrollers
    used for automation in literature is presented in Table 2. Many sensors have been
    designed having compatibility with controllers like ESPs and NodeMCU which have
    rendered immense ease in customization of the sensors according to the user requirements.

    of past decade for evolution of various hardware controllers used in smart home
    automation. In order to transform the smart houses into smart cities, one of the
    basic challenges is to integrate the different nodes i.e homes to a network. The
    microcontrollers that are to be used for this purpose need to have high reliability
    and dependability. As for the smart cities, the controllers are required to manage
    the data transmitted by various sensors and send it to relevant actuators. In
    a smart city managing the traffic, weather updates, energy distribution are important
    tasks. For these purpose, different types of controllers are proposed. As the
    controllers need to constantly manage a lot of data, the requirements for choosing
    the controllers include a large number of GPIO pins and network connectivity.
    In addition to that the presence of an operating system makes it easier to design
    dedicated embedded systems. D’Ortona et al. have proposed an automation system
    for smart cities using ESP 32. It proposes the use of wearable with Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) and MQTT for the pedestrians walking on the streets. ESP 32 used
    with Raspberry Pi as a broker to send and receive data and enable communication
    (D’Ortona et al., 2022). John et al. designed a smart waste disposal system using
    Arduino that consisted of a small module that can be installed inside the waste
    bins and can measure the fill levels. The system is also connected to a cloud
    server that receives the data from the bins all over the city and takes intelligent
    decisions about changing or emptying the bins (John et al., 2022). Similarly Arduino
    is also used by Nandanwar and Chauhan (2021) to monitor the pollution levels at
    various points around the city. In order to detect empty car parking space, a
    smart car parking system has designed using oscillator circuits and micro controllers
    (Fischer, Guggenberger, & Ussmueller, 2021). To have efficient data transfer using
    the internet, ESP 32 is used in the embedded design systems (Sajjad et al., 2020).
    ESP32 along with LoRA has proposed to design smart Lamp posts that can be automatically
    controlled using light intensity (Fischer et al., 2021). In order to provide portability,
    Raspberry pi is also used that gives additional support of its operating system
    too. The operating system can be supported by using micro controllers on a small
    device. Saradopoulos et al. utilized Raspberry Pi in concurrent with the edge
    computing and implemented computer vision models on ESP 32 to control pest infestation
    in urban cities (Saradopoulos et al., 2022). Leccese used Raspberry pi and ZigBee
    modules to control lamp posts remotely (Leccese, Cagnetti, & Trinca, 2014). In
    paper (Dawn, Bhowmick, Bhowmik, & Mandal, 2023) smart door system has been developed,
    that automatically detect the person and sent the message to the user for security
    purpose. The different techniques for the improvement of power quality and detection
    of harmonics in smart grid has been explained in Ghiasi et al., 2023, Rahiman
    et al., 2023. Kernel least mean p-power (PKLMP) controller has been suggested
    for integration of grid with PV system (Pattnaik, Badoni, & Tatte, 2023). In paper
    Braun, Grüne, Kellett, and Worthmann (2023) model predictive controller has discussed
    for management of load by considering different load condition for smart grid.
    In Ref. (Fakhar, Haidar, Abdullah, & Das, 2023) planning and management of green
    energy system has reviewed for future technologies used in smart grid and cities.
    The planning and modeling of energy management for smart city in South Asia has
    been discussed in Shafiullah et al. (2023). It is proved that the energy system
    for the smart cities depend on development of policy, modern technology along
    with human capacity. The security and establish a bidirectional communication
    with surrounding has been noticed in term of merits and demerits (Muqeet, Liaqat,
    Jamil, & Khan, 2023). Literature shows that different kinds of controller and
    component that are used for collecting and managing the information with in a
    smart city, however, to achieve the goal of sustainable smart cities the controllers
    and components need to work at low power and have higher processing powers. The
    ARM Cortex controllers as well as STM are strong candidates for this with some
    trade offs. The advancements of various hardware components used in smart home
    automation is shown in a timeline in Fig. 2. It shows that with time, there has
    been a significant rise in processing power of hardware which is just the right
    thing required for handling large amounts of data in a smart city. Download :

    architecture. 3.2. Protocol stack and networking In IoT, protocols for networking
    act as a backbone of the system. They are the glue that bind the whole network
    together. Data transfer from one end of the system to the other is managed by
    these protocols. Different protocols work on various layers of the network model.
    These are broadly divided into wired and wireless with each of them having their
    own specific benefits and advantages in certain specific situations. 3.2.1. Wired
    communication Wired protocols ensure secure long distance communication that is
    usually between two dedicated devices. The protocols like SPI, I2C and UART have
    been in use for years for simplest yet effective communication (Arun Francis et
    al., 2021, VasudhaaC.S. and Professor, 2021). Wired communication is achieved
    by ethernet cables providing Local Area Network (LAN), which restricts the activity
    to a particular premises only (Oluwole, Odekunle, & Olubakinde, 2021). In case
    of smart cities, the data is more localized into small divisions consisting of
    users and it is not feasible to manage the transmission and receiving using long
    wired transmissions. 3.2.2. Wireless communication Contrary to that, Wireless
    protocols are mostly used in circumstances requiring data transmission to a large
    number of users or nodes at the same time. It can increase the efficiency of the
    transfer rate and reduce the latency while giving the advantage of hardware portability.
    MQ Telemetry (MQTT) has been known to have high transfer rate in short distance
    communication and is very effective in transmitting tiny messages like temperature
    or energy usage updates proving its effectiveness in a smart homes as well as
    smart city automation. Sonar et al. designed a controller based energy meter to
    monitor the energy consumption and transmit the data in real time using MQTT protocol
    (Sonar & Deshpande, 2019). Similarly, a diverse approach of data transfer using
    MQTT has been presented in Chauhan and Malik, 2021, Hercog et al., 2020. The data
    transmission in smart cities can be centralized or decentralized depending on
    the information being transferred. Edge computing plays a major role and used
    with MQTT protocol to develop small decentralized architectures with in smart
    cities that can be used for parking management, water distribution or traffic
    management etc (Alam et al., 2022, Merzoug et al., 2021, Zaman et al., 2021).
    These challenging tasks require no coordination with a central server and can
    be managed on small, low-power edge devices that can handle the computing at the
    nodes. However if there is a need of communication with a central server than
    the data can be made online at regular interval or shared with a cloud. The cloud
    computing makes the data secure and leads to a sustainable infrastructure with
    in a smart city (Massobrio, Nesmachnow, Tchernykh, Avetisyan, & Radchenko, 2018).
    The paper (Bellini, Nesi, & Pantaleo, 2022) explained the communication between
    different nodes in smart city by using IoT technology. The smart environment is
    based on communication of smart devices with each other to make smart country
    with the help of IoT architecture (Ketu & Mishra, 2022). MQTT is used in the situation
    where one centralized broker is connected to many subscribers and publishers,
    however, in case of decentralized architecture, client–server model has been used
    widely in literature. It gives a more specific approach in which one of the devices
    acts as a server while the other acts as the client and protocols like HTTP/s
    and websockets that are used to transmit the data to web pages. These protocols
    although are slower as compared to MQTT, nevertheless, their usage is more from
    the practicality point of view (Luigi, 2015, Surajudeen-Bakinde and Isiwekpeni,
    2016). Generic MQTT architecture is shown in Fig. 3 as mentioned in Khan, Huda,
    and Zaman (2022) and HTTP architecture is illustrated in Fig. 4. Besides from
    this COAP is also suggested which is most similar to HTTP in many aspects and
    is useful in linking up small devices and local web pages. To transmit the information
    via these protocols the mode of transmission used are GSM (Global System for Mobile
    communication), WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth and LoRaWAN etc. with each of them having
    their own pros and cons (Rajkumar, Rajendra, Prafulla, & Vinod, 2020). WiFi and
    Bluetooth both are regarded as an ideal option for home automation as these provide
    wireless connectivity and can easily be configured for the commonly used sensors.
    However both of these are short ranged and need repeated access points all over
    the house to get unrestricted connectivity (Folea, Bordencea, Hotea, & Valean,
    2012). To compensate these points, LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) has
    introduced. As the name says so, it provides long range connectivity to the devices
    enabling them to send and transmit data. Islam et al. used LoRaWAN to design a
    new architecture for smart homes that linked all the devices on one android application
    and the results showed significantly less delay than WiFi and bluetooth (Islam
    et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (257KB) Download : Download

    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is used for devices that do not need to be sending
    data continuously. It uses less energy which is the main advantages of BLE (Collotta
    and Pau, 2015, D. et al., 2021). Another significant extension is the use of GSM
    that not only provides connectivity inside the house but also perform everywhere
    with the help of cellular network (Felix & Jacob Raglend, 2011). It has been widely
    used in the literature in automation architectures and proved valuable in integrating
    smart phones to the automated architectures to receive updates (Rajkumar et al.,
    2020). Bluetooth can only provide the connectivity within a limited range hence
    not feasible for smart city applications. However, the introduction of 5G has
    brought a revolution in this field. 5G not only provides fast data transfer rate
    with a high bandwidth but also enables the smart city applications to be able
    to connect to any cloud or local server. A newly designed smart city applications
    are now shifting towards using 5G for communication. ZigBee and Z-Wave are new
    addition to the list. ZigBee is used with a gateway and has the ability to connect
    to various clients at the same time (Byun et al., 2012, Ciffee et al., 2021).
    Z-wave has emerged as the rival to WiFi, being able to operate on low frequencies,
    it does not interferes with the other frequencies in home. Moreover, it does not
    need any gateway or router, as in the case of WiFi. The devices connect with each
    other forming a mesh, making it a promising choice for the home automation (Dawoud
    & Dawoud, 2020). A generic Z-wave architecture is shown in Fig. 5. Overall the
    use of right protocol can either make or break the whole smart home automation
    system (Rajasekhar, Basu, & Sowjanya, 2021). The type of environment, user activity,
    number of devices are the variables that determine the premier technology for
    the correct circumstances. A comparison of various protocol suites is presented
    in Table 3 and a timeline of evolution of the technologies in Fig. 6, for communicating
    and transmitting large amounts of data. The timeline shows that the trend has
    been shifting more towards decentralized approaches for data transmission in the
    form of 5G and NB-IoT, that not only provide commendable coverage but also are
    available on a wide area of land, surpassing the limitations for big data handling.

    communication between vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I)
    Vehicle management and controlling the data associated with it is one of the vital
    tasks in a smart city, since with the increase in automated vehicles on the road.
    In this work we reviewed a vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication
    to reduce the chances of accident and control the traffic. The information details
    of one vehicle such as speed, location, petrol quantity and other essential data
    should be shared with other infrastructure by using IoT technology. Electric vehicle
    can be charged from the traffic light automatically to detect its battery state
    of charge (SoC). The paper (Rani & Sharma, 2023) explained that the intelligent
    Internet of vehicles (IOVs) is based on intelligent transportation system which
    is proposed for smart city. It modeled different machine algorithms such as Decision
    Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF). The different optimization rule based algorithm
    has designed to sure the possible communication between V2V and V2I (Alsaleh,
    2023). The concept of Semi-Autonomous Electric Vehicles (SAEVs) for smart cities
    has been introduced in paper (Xidias, Panagiotopoulos, & Zacharia, 2023). An intelligent
    management system (ITS) has proposed to relocate the SAEVs. In paper Jiang et
    al. (2023) discussed that how the performance of Connected vehicles (CVs) has
    effected by weather conditions. The concept of V2V and V2I is presented in Fig.
    7. 3.3. Architecture In the literature a lot of work has been done on proposing
    and implementing various architectures for smart homes and smart cities which
    paves the way towards finding more smart and sustainable technologies for automation
    (Foth et al., 2021, Nižetić et al., 2022). All the architectures are carefully
    curated for that particular structure to perform according to the requirements
    under given circumstances. The management of the automated structures also plays
    an important role in deciding the type of architecture to design. Two broad classes
    of management systems are centralized and decentralized, which comprising a generic
    smart city architecture is shown in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image
    (338KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. A generic IoT based Smart
    City Architecture. 3.3.1. Centralized architecture A centralized architecture
    is a central management system that can be wired or wireless. It employs a server
    and broker in HTTP/S and MQTT respectively, that acts as a gateway. It collects,
    disperse and relays data to all the internal and external agents of the system,
    enabling it to look over the whole system at the same time. Gambi et al. designed
    a LoRa based architecture for long range communication using MQTT, that received
    the data from its publishers and made it accessible to the subscribers (Gambi,
    Montanini, Pigini, Ciattaglia, & Spinsante, 2018). Jabbar et al. proposed a hybrid
    architecture with both local and remote control and managements systems along
    with a portable control box that allowed to be attached to any house for monitoring
    purposes (Jabbar et al., 2019). 3.3.2. Decentralized architecture Decentralization
    is cloud based management system that moves the databases to the cloud and not
    on the local devices that helps in decreasing load from the devices and increasing
    efficiency. One of such processes is described by Ye et al. who have focused on
    automating a house into smart house using cloud and provided a cost and energy
    efficient solution (Ye & Huang, 2011). Integrating various operations in a smart
    home system is difficult task. Inter-operability of different appliances with
    in a smart home is performed by assigning unique identifiers to each device. An
    architecture based on Resource Name Service (RNS) proposed by Yang et al. that
    allowed inter-operability and integration with existing automation solutions (Yang,
    Yuan, Tian, Feng, & Mao, 2014). Similarly another cloud based architecture presented
    by Frincu et al. that also incorporated scalability to enable data flow in the
    smart home (Frincu & Draghici, 2016). Mohpatra et al. made a huge leap from the
    past technologies and introduced voice control mechanism integrated over ZigBee
    that started a new amalgamation of IoT, Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence
    (Mohapatra, Nayak, & Nayak, 2021). Another ZigBee based architecture has introduced
    by Kuang et al. that focused on imperceptibility in automated structures based
    on cloud data processing (Kuang & Li, 2021). Ozmen et al. used Fog-based Home
    Automation Platform (FOGHA) based smart home automation that provided real time
    services over its cloud nodes (Ozmen, Isik, & Ersoy, 2021). Alani et al. presented
    a comparison between Blynk and NETPI IoT platforms while discussing the need of
    user friendly interfaces and applications (Alani et al., 2021). In the recent
    years block chain has emerged as a latest playing ground in the field of technology.
    A block chain based architecture has been proposed by Ammi et al. ensuring communication
    confidentiality and integrity (Ammi, Alarabi, & Benkhelifa, 2021). Contrary to
    the smart homes, the smart city architecture consists of several divisions and
    departments that either need to be governed with a central server or can work
    autonomously with a decentralized management (Ghosh, 2018, Jung et al., 2013).
    The idea of smart city governance using information system management connected
    to a centralized structure is proposed in Sarangi, Pal, Prusty, and Chen (2022).
    Because of their intrinsic variety and incoherence, managing IoT solutions in
    an automated architecture is a difficult undertaking. IoT management techniques
    are primarily concerned with devices and connectivity, and as a result, they lack
    a various software, hardware, and communication components that make up an IoT-based
    solution. The paper (Silva, Faria, & Vale, 2022) presents a new four-layer IoT
    management architecture for managing, regulating, and monitoring software, hardware,
    and communication components, as well as data flow and data quality in a distributed
    infrastructure. Edge computing in such IoT network facilitates distributed computing
    by bringing computational applications closer to end-users in the form of Fog
    sub-networks, which include local participating end-user IoT nodes as service
    requesters and specialized servers catering to the requests, which are modeled
    for the infrastructure category (Bhardwaj, Banyal, Sharma, & Al-Numay, 2022).
    Distributed and Edge computing manages and coordinates the tasks at a lower level
    to maintain the higher level infrastructure (Abdrabou et al., 2022, Arena et al.,
    2022). The paradigm change from a hierarchical pyramid to an inverted pyramid,
    which is the foundation for edge, fog, and cloud-based architectures which is
    presented in the article Poza-Lujan, Uribe-Chavert, Sáenz-Peñafiel, and Posadas-Yagüe
    (2022). It provides a distributed modular architecture where the devices are built
    up of control nodes, which can connect with one another to improve their operation
    without sending raw data to the cloud. Identical controlling connect with a sensing
    element were developed to evaluate the architecture. The paper Zineb, Siham, and
    Jean-Philippe (2022) worked on a smart city architecture based on centralization
    of smart city services, self-control and adaptability, and prediction of future
    system behavior. The proposal includes a centralized administration application
    for visualizing the numerous events of the many smart applications, as well as
    their interdependencies that enables all aspects of smart city applications and
    system health to be monitored and controlled. Furthermore, by describing the many
    decisions and actions done, this primary application aids in gaining users trust.
    In Jnr and Petersen (2022) Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) is introduced
    to promote the digitalization of urban settings in order to assist smart cities
    in aligning information systems (IT) and business objectives to accomplish urban
    digitalization. A mixed-mode methodology has used to develop a research model
    using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). To empirically test the established
    EAF, quantitative data via questionnaire survey was collected from practitioners
    in firms in Norway and Ireland that are currently using Enterprise Architecture
    (EA) in a smart city initiative. 3.3.3. Data computation and handling The computation
    of the data at such a large scale is one of the biggest requirements to deal with
    the architecture for a smart city. By adopting the fog computing concept, this
    problem can be handled. Industry 4.0 and smart city deployments face a number
    of obstacles, including high energy consumption and an excess of data to be processed
    at data nodes. By acting as a low-complexity computational layer between the cloud
    and the internet of things (IoT), a fog computing-enabled architecture can assist
    to alleviate some of these issues. Computationally heavy data processing duties
    can be shifted from the cloud layer to the fog layer, and the fog layer can also
    operate as a gateway to the other top layers, and can also be set up at the edge
    of the network for efficiency (Mana, Samhitha, Deepa, & Vignesh, 2022). The collecting
    of heterogeneous data in a smart city an uniform access to data and collection
    system. Song et al. propose a method for building software and hardware systems,
    as well as an urban perception network middle-ware architecture, that can meet
    the demand of M2M and realize dynamic management of cognitive resources, based
    on the IoT computing framework put forth to fulfill urban sensing network information
    gathering, transmitting, and computing smart technology, according to the required
    properties of IoT gateway (Song & Wu, 2022). It also enables HTTP-based ubiquitous
    services. This is critical for offering intelligent services that include a wide
    range of solutions, controllers, and computer terminals. It also examines ways
    to employ intelligent sensors, wireless connectivity, data mining, and other IoT
    technologies to link people within a smart city infrastructure. 3.4. Security
    for sustainable networks In any system interchanging the information, security
    and privacy is the biggest concern which leads to the stability of the system.
    Data integrity and confidentiality needs to be maintained as a part of transmission
    as well as protection against packet sniffing, eaves dropping and repudiation
    attacks (Deepika, 2021, Gupta et al., 2022). At the start of automation trend,
    security was not main concern. it started to get matured as the technology got
    refined. Smart homes’ and Smart Cities’ devices, sensors and actuators are interchanging
    information all the time so the security became a major focus of the developers.
    Many methods have proposed for secure automation solution that protected the system
    using a login authentication for user and using SSL for client/server communication,
    which can be regarded as a bare minimum for now a days, nevertheless it was a
    progressive start (Karaca, Sisman, & Savruk, 2016), the similar system has also
    implemented along with finger print authentication and voice recognition to provide
    a dual authentication (Jose et al., 2016, Kumar and Lee, 2014, Rasheeda, 2020,
    Venkatraman et al., 2021). To verify and exclude the false alarms the system has
    improved using access points around the premises (Jose & Malekian, 2017). The
    use of third party based security applications also emerged along with the risk
    of data breach by those third parties (Fernandes et al., 2016, Jacobsson et al.,
    2016). Real time monitoring of appliances and premises have done using sensors
    sending GSM based notifications to users and intrusion detection based on vision
    based home automation systems (Chowdhry et al., 2015, Gupta and Chhabra, 2016,
    ShariqSuhail et al., 2016). As discussed above, in the beginning the security
    was mainly against the trespassing or appliance safety and little amount of energies
    were being utilized in securing the network of a smart automation systems. As
    the network grew wider, many nodes and end users started communication. The data
    integrity and confidentiality became a necessity (Goudbeek, Choo, & Le-Khac, 2018),
    for which many authentication methods were proposed based on cryptographic algorithms
    (Ashari, Shouran, & Priyambodo, 2019). To authenticate the smart phones in a smart
    automated environment and to send secure messages, Mantoro et al. used Diffie–Hellman
    key exchange, AES 256 encryption and hash function based on RC-4 (Mantoro, Ayu,
    & binti Mahmod, 2014). The transmitted messages first pass through a central gateway,
    get encrypted to generate hash messages. A network security mechanism based on
    efficient key generation has proposed in order to encrypt the data into cypher
    text. The method also ensured a low energy consumption by using the proposed technique
    (Pirbhulal et al., 2017). The security and privacy has been explained in term
    of facilities provided to the people in smart city which is based on IoT (Thilakarathne
    & Madhuka Priyashan, 2021). To enhance user privacy a security architecture has
    proposed by Lee, Kim, and Shon (2016). The architecture is based on a security
    framework to provide data encryption, authentication by using digital signature
    and access control. Prudanov et al. presented multi factor authentication based
    on yoking proof protocol to ensure mutual confidentiality (Prudanov et al., 2016).
    Kang et al. designed security frame work for appliances in smart homes. The method
    used a module level approach integrated with kernel of the device. The module
    based on application, smart appliance and appliance integrity and ensured authentication
    and integrity in the appliance’s data transmission (Kang, Moon, & Park, 2017).
    To detect network anomalies like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), a machine
    learning technique based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has designed in Ramapatruni,
    Narayanan, Mittal, Joshi, and Joshi (2019). The technique used the HMM to predict
    the anomalies by analyzing the normal user behavior based on data collected in
    defined collection points. In Al-Turjman, Zahmatkesh, and Shahroze (2022) discussed
    the major problems related to security and privacy of important information in
    smart city. The addition of security algorithms commonly used in smart homes’
    security applications provides scalable solutions to efficiently cater the requirements
    of smart cities security system (Bertino et al., 2016, Jutila, 2016). In Jin et
    al., 2016, Khan and Salah, 2018, Lin et al., 2017, Minoli, 2020 discussed the
    different security risk at the beginning stage of implementing smart city application.
    As mentioned above, that the smart city consists of multiple sections in which
    connectivity of all sections and units on one network increases the risk of vulnerable
    node. Edge computing and decentralization is a intelligent and feasible solution
    that secures the network from various sorts of DDoS, Forgeries, Brute Forcing,
    Non repudiation attacks etc (Makkar, 2022, Sani et al., 2022, Seddik et al., 2022)
    Integration of transportation network within a smart city along with stand alone
    security model using blockchain has noted in Aloqaily et al., 2019, Su et al.,
    2019, Wu et al., 2022. Xu et al. improved the idea of Certificate-less Designated
    Verifier Proxy Signature Scheme (CLDVPS) as proposed by He, Ma, Qi, and Wang (2021),
    by resisting the user impersonation attacks in Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs)
    while keeping intact the data privacy and security (Xu, Luo, Vijayakumar, Peng,
    & Wang, 2022). In Kuppa et al. (2022) suggested the deep learning approach to
    design a solution for detection of malicious injection attacks in the code and
    cleaning up of the malicious code using context based awareness playing a pivotal
    role in the sustainable smart city infrastructure. The stability of the data transmission
    of the network is embedded in securing the vulnerabilities of the network. DDoS
    attacks can choke the network by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the IoT device
    standards, securing of which can evidently decrease the DDoS, bruteforcing and
    accessing the open ports (Nisa, Alhudhaif, Qureshi, Hadi, & Jeon, 2022). The use
    of Fuzzy Algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Deep Learning algorithms
    plays an important role in pattern analysis and prediction of future attacks (Rajasekhar
    et al., 2021), while providing the ability to trace the data sharing and mitigating
    the further anomalies (Zhan et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022).
    3.4.1. Securing big data and the role of blockchain Blockchain based security
    systems have been introduced in most of the networks as a decentralized approach
    to security, consisting of a public ledger of members handling and passing on
    cryptographic data that makes it impossible to alter the data, hence enforcing
    integrity. It is easier to implement on to an existing smart automation system
    due to its ability of being independent of the conventional protocols. An analysis
    of blockchain along with ways to implement it, has been presented by Moniruzzaman
    et al. hinting at the need of a prototype design for implementation (Moniruzzaman,
    Khezr, Yassine, & Benlamri, 2020). The blockchain can be private or public and
    runs under the IoT layer in a smart home network. Public blockchain can drastically
    increase the overhead as it provides open access for users to join the network,
    making private blockchains a more feasible option for small, disjoint architectures
    like homes and offices etc. Block mining time using ESP 32 for basic difficulty
    level, a minimum requirement for smart homes, has been calculated to be 1 s which
    can be improved by increasing computational power (Arif, Khan, Rehman, Kabir,
    & Imran, 2020). Technologies like Deep Re-enforcement Learning integrated with
    blockchain help improve the system and protect them from getting hack (Shahbazi,
    Byun, & Kwak, 2021). As blockchain methods are difficult to implement over the
    whole system, suggestion to start with implementation on gateway have been proposed
    in Minoli (2020). A detailed security analysis of centralized databases based
    systems that hinted at the need of devising better analysis methods to assess
    the security as well as securing the smart phones that are connected to the smart
    home systems, in order to ensure complete data integrity and privacy (Kafle, Moran,
    Manandhar, Nadkarni, & Poshyvanyk, 2021). Download : Download high-res image (208KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Block chain with IoT network. Cloning
    and jamming attack protection based on RFIDs have provided better results of simulations
    and practical implementation (Mbarek, Ge, & Pitner, 2021). Several works have
    been done on Intruder detection based on predictive learning, designing frameworks
    based on machine learning. One of such framework based on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy
    Inference System (ANFIS) presented by Ahanger et al. predicted the presence of
    intruder with an accuracy of 93.66% (Ahanger, Tariq, Ibrahim, Ullah, & Bouteraa,
    2020). Use of Big data analytics to manage data stream coming from various devices,
    along with machine learning can predict user behavior and presence (Asaithambi
    et al., 2021). The trend of security is shifting towards prediction in order to
    foresee the anomalies before they can cause any harm to the network. Implementation
    of machine learning algorithms along with network security and data encryption
    can improve the security of the automated systems. Two way authentication can
    be applied by using fingerprint and retina pattern to detect intrusion. The blockchain
    makes it feasible to integrate several smart homes into a decentralized ledger,
    similar method can be scaled to an automated smart city architecture. Blockchain
    enables different departments and sections of the smart city to be able to have
    secure communication via blockchain layer that is embedded in between the IoT
    layer and the Application Layer of the system as shown in Fig. 9. As discussed
    above, the IoT, cloud computing, and 5G are all becoming indispensable parts of
    our lives as a result of the rapid advancement of information technology. Smart
    cities have become a reality as a result of the advancement of cutting-edge digital
    technologies and different city sensing devices generate a large amount of data
    throughout the smart cities (Zhao, Wang, Liu, Qiao, & Zhou, 2021). Although, Smart
    cities can adopt the cloud computing paradigm to smoothly use massive data, this
    data would be effectively processed and stored by cloud servers. However, the
    constant communication between the nodes in a smart city needs to be uninterrupted
    and secure, as opposed to traditional cloud solutions (Haseeb, Din, Almogren,
    Ahmed, & Guizani, 2021). Hence the use of edge technology naturally calls for
    Blockchain solutions for securing the transmission of big data among the nodes
    and playing an integral role in becoming sustainable (Alazab, Manogaran, & Montenegro-Marin,
    2021). Particular sections of the smart city can have their own edge based networks
    and surveillance systems to enable agile optimization (Ke et al., 2021, Peyman
    et al., 2021). For the surveillance and security of intelligent transportation
    systems to secure them against hijacking, GPS spoofing or DDoS attacks, blockchain
    based solutions are proposed to reduce the chance of single point failure (Gupta,
    Kumari, & Tanwar, 2021). The presence of resilient network framework works on
    the front line under the circumstances of a cyber-attack. The use of distributed
    frameworks solution utilizing the distributed end nodes up to full capability
    and taking up the load of the system in case of attack to keep the systems running
    smoothly (Chen, Qiu, Zhao, Zhou, & Ning, 2021). Using specifically designed network
    APIs gateways keep registration and user validation secure from denial of service
    attacks (Dai et al., 2021, Ferreira et al., 2021). Nonetheless, as a demerit,
    Edge servers have limited resources and lack a diverse set of capabilities. It
    is critical to increase the average resource usage of all edge servers while still
    maintaining load balancing of the edge server cluster. However, because a large
    number of applications are delay-sensitive, it is vital to verify that these applications
    are secure. In Peng, Liu, Tao, and Huang (2021) looked at how to improve the overall
    performance of a Edge enabled smart city by combining mobile device and edge server
    optimization. In terms of technology, a novel multi-objective computation offloading
    approach has been designed to reduce time and energy consumption, maintain load
    balancing of edge servers, and boost average resource utilization. A comparison
    of various tools used for security of data in a smart city is shown in Table 4.
    Although with this much work into this field, it still has a lot of pages left
    unexplored and it undoubtedly is one of the vital tools to tackle the big data
    in a safe and secure way. Table 4. Comparison of security tools. S. No. Tool Advantage

    et al. (2021) 3.4.2. Drone or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for security Drones
    could be employed for a variety of application in both military and industry.
    The major application of drone is security purpose. In paper Nguyen and Nguyen
    (2021) the drone is proposed for the security purpose like cyber and public security.
    Various methods has also been suggested for the protection of drone. It also shared
    the important information regarding cyber security for the future. The paper Qadir,
    Ullah, Munawar, and Al-Turjman (2021) explained the application of UAVs in different
    fields like disaster and rescue. It proposed the path planning algorithm to find
    the shortest path to minimize the energy and cost for doing different tasks. The
    charge station has been introduced in Zou et al. (2023) to charge the UAVs and
    extend its battery life. The paper Lucic, Bouhamed, Ghazzai, Khanfor, and Massoud
    (2023) presents the application of UAVs for smart cities, specially addressed
    the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) for the smart cities. The identification
    of remote location using drone is a challenging task, that has been discussed
    in Prabu, Malathy, Taj, and Madhan (2023) that monitor and control the data for
    application of smart city using drone network. The collection of data pattern
    from different nodes in smart city is illustrated in Fig. 10. Download : Download

    in smart cities. 3.4.3. Service providing in emergencies The concept of smart
    cities is introduced to provide high quality life by using latest smart technology.
    To provide best services in case of emergency condition like COVID-19 pandemic
    (Alshamaila, Papagiannidis, Alsawalqah, & Aljarah, 2023). It noted that the responses
    in term of traffic, UAVs and emergency management. The paper Rawat, Bist, Apriani,
    Permadi, and Nabila (2023) considered the AI based drone for better emergency
    service by using block chains system. In Hasan, Islam, Sadeq, Fung, and Uddin
    (2023) deep learning technology has proposed to reduce the speed of COVID-19 pandemic
    and grow awareness in the people. It discussed methods of deep learning by using
    mass video surveillance. In case of emergency the data has been collected from
    social media, then proceed to the intelligent base system (Alkhatib, El Barachi,
    & Shaalan, 2019) to create alarm sign for the rescue. The concept of smart hospital
    has been proposed in Buhalis, O’Connor, and Leung (2023), to provide quick relief
    and services to the people. The paper (Tushar, Alam, Bari, & Karmaker, 2023) introduced
    the better medical waste management (MWM) system to reduce the effect of unavoidable
    situation like COVID-19 pandemic. It used different techniques such as Best–Worst
    Method (BWM) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). 3.5. Artificial intelligence
    With the introduction of quantum computing and block chain, Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has a major part in the technological domain. Starting
    from the recommendations on our search engines to automatic cars running to the
    road, AI has infiltrated everything and forming a networked hive mind and home
    automation is not far behind in this race (Asaithambi et al., 2021). AI based
    home automation came into sight around the beginning of last decade when the idea
    of machine learning emerged (Kriška, Janitor, & Fecilak, 2014). The different
    latest techniques have been proposed in Mishra et al. (2022), such as machine
    to machine communication, Internet of thing along with Artificial intelligence
    etc... It started from controlling the appliances using voice commands, the machine
    could learn and identify the voice patterns and the voice commands activated the
    functionality (Lecouteux et al., 2011, Nagaraja and Srinath, 2020, Shingala and
    Patel, 2017). With the passage of time, the machine learning algorithms started
    to improve and emerged in every field of life. Intelligent and Fuzzy based controllers
    have proposed combined for feedback and refine the system based on it. It make
    the system efficient by increasing their data sets. In the literature many discussions
    have been going on, on the need of developing relevant standards to translate
    AI from literature to product (Guo et al., 2019, Thakkar and Lohiya, 2021, Zaidan
    and Zaidan, 2020). In the beginning, the behavior and activity recognition has
    done in order to design models and frameworks (Chahuara, Fleury, Portet, & Vacher,
    2012). Models have designed on smaller scale for example to control heat settings
    based on temperature forecasts (Bausch, Tewkesbury, Bausch, & Tewkesbury, 0000)
    and intelligent lighting control sensors (Andramuño et al., 2021, Tang et al.,
    2017). Different controller based systems have designed that could intelligently
    control a smart home environment (Chandramohan et al., 2017). Artificial Neural
    Networks (ANN) (Teslyuk, Kazarian, Kryvinska, & Tsmots, 2021) and Deep Learning
    algorithms began to incorporate in the management and security of smart premises
    (Abdulrahman, Isiwekpeni, Surajudeen-Bakinde, & Otuoze, 2016). Different models
    are designed to perform various tasks around the house and are based on different
    algorithms. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning have been useful in conservation
    of energy (Bhatt et al., 2021, Popa et al., 2019), voice recognition (Brenon et
    al., 2018, Rani et al., 2017), object detection (Mehmood, Ullah, Ahmad, & Kim,
    2019), multimedia management (Rego, Ramírez, Jimenez, & Lloret, 2021) system control
    (Andramuno et al., 2021) and image processing related tasks in a smart home. The
    translation of AI from automating smart houses to smart cities is a massive challenge
    itself. The success of AI models is based on their training which ultimately depends
    on the data sets provided to the models. As for smart homes, the data sets are
    small and easier to manage while in case of smart cities, the training data set
    can add up to many tera bytes easily which not only makes data collection and
    management a hassle but also the training becomes a tedious task. For that purpose,
    Big data analytics start to play its role and helps in extracting meaningful insights
    from the data by recognizing patterns and trends. It can also act as a pre-processing
    phase for the data before being fed to the AI models for training. Although it
    is a new concept for smart cities but it has gain immense popularity among research
    enthusiasts. It initiated with the designing of intelligent systems for small
    tasks like cost calculation and optimization for resources management (Ponte,
    Fuente, Pino, & Priore, 2013), optimization of energy utilized by Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSNs) (Azpilicueta, Nazabal, Falcone, Fernández-Valdivielso, & Matías,
    2013) and traffic traceability and surveillance systems (Fernãndez et al., 2013,
    Mora-Mora et al., 2015). Transportation and vehicle management techniques greatly
    improved by the use of intelligent systems (Hernafi, Ahmed, & Bouhorma, 2017).
    Transportation management in a parallel fashion using intelligent agent based
    control is proposed by Zhu et al. to aid the traffic congestion (Zhu, Li, Chen,
    & Xiong, 2016). Similarly decision trees and optimization techniques proposed
    by Huang et al. assisted in maintaining a low power profile for the Trains’ network
    in smart cities (Huang, Deng, Yang, & Sun, 2016). Classification techniques and
    anomaly detection methods have proposed in Brisimi, Cassandras, Osgood, Paschalidis,
    and Zhang (2016) for obstacle detection in the streets and improved by using ML
    techniques and methods like K nearest neighbors and ANN incorporating the Fog
    Computing (Bustamante-Bello et al., 2022). Neural Network based prediction system
    for vehicle parking proposed in Provoost, Kamilaris, Wismans, van der Drift, and
    van Keulen (2020) outperformed with a mean square error of only 7.18. Ballis et
    al. used re-enforcement learning for traffic signals and designed strategies to
    reduce congestion (Ballis & Dimitriou, 2020). An accuracy of 81% has achieved
    by using YOLO framework in achieving traffic clearance at the signals (Khan et
    al., 2022). Gradually AI and intelligent systems started to engulf different sectors
    of the smart city automation and data handling became more robust and uninterrupted.
    To ensure the mobility and robust data flow, Intelligent Software Define Networks
    (SDNs) have proposed to manage the inter-operability of wireless sensors and networks
    aiding the heterogeneous wireless networks (Kosmides et al., 2015). To collect
    data holistically, human or vehicle mounted sensors can be used, utilizing the
    concepts of situation awareness and computational intelligence as proposed in
    Rolim et al. (2016). Use of Artificial Intelligence based solutions for the security
    and safety of smart cities are also explored by researchers. State of the art
    classification techniques have proposed in Castelli, Sormani, Trujillo, and Popovič
    (2017) to predict the crime rates. The use of Unmanned Ariel Vehicles operated
    using Multi agent systems has studied in Wan, Lu, Fan, and Letaief (2017) to deal
    with emergencies. The use of Closed-Circuited Television (CCTVs) can improve the
    security situation, however to deal with the massive amounts of video data is
    an exhaustive task which can be eased by the improved AI based video analysis
    techniques proposed in Pawlowski, Dabrowski, Balcerek, Konieczka, and Piniarski
    (2020). Computer vision used for face and vehicle number plate recognition plays
    an important role in the maintaining the security for which various AI frameworks
    have been proposed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ANNs etc. Medapati,
    Murthy, and Sridhar (2020). Salma et al. used the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework
    for object detection in designing an automated number plate recognition system
    with an accuracy of 99.5% (Salma et al., 2021). Energy production and management
    is a vital sector in the stability of any city, which is discussed in detail in
    the next subsection. Intelligent systems are also designed for this domain to
    be used for forecasting energy demands to optimizing the production. Machine Learning
    approaches like Support Vector Machine (SVM), neural networks and regression trees
    are used under supervised learning to present a data driven approach for the prediction
    of load in buildings is discussed in Idowu, Saguna, Åhlund, and Schelén (2016).
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based light control system is proposed by De Paz
    et al. that is designed using modular approach and mitigates the energy utilization
    having a scalable solution (Paz, Bajo, Rodríguez, Villarrubia, & Corchado, 2016).
    Similarly data mining techniques can be used to design rule based inference systems
    based on the sensors to assist in controlled resource consumption (Peña, Biscarri,
    Guerrero, Monedero, & León, 2016). Deep Learning (DL) which is a subset of ML
    uses efficient neural networks like CNN to learn the pattern details in the distributed
    generation with in the power grids, the pattern information is fed to the neural
    network and can predict the parameters like power generation and user consumption
    etc. with improved accuracy as compared to simple classification and pattern recognition
    techniques (Xin, Alazab, Díaz, Montenegro-Marin, & Crespo, 2022). The key to successfully
    deploy smart and intelligent systems in smart cities is to divide the premises
    into smaller regions and use decentralized approach and Intelligent Edge techniques
    (Chilipirea et al., 2017, Patel et al., 2017). As for now there has not been enough
    data sets collected or models train that can make machines oversee the complete
    smart cities while making intelligent decisions which is a work in progress for
    future. Concisely, the field of AI and machine learning is rising up steadily
    in the congregation of IoT and automation, the need is to design suitable hardware
    devices with small memory foot print and power consumption and efficient protocols
    to deploy the AI frameworks, in order to design a smart city completely. A graphical
    representation of popular AI frameworks and models (reviewed in this paper) used
    in various sectors of Smart cities in is presented in Fig. 11. The cascaded multi-fidelity
    deep learning (CMF-DL) is proposed to predict the data based on both types of
    prediction and observation weather data (Luo & Zhang, 2023). In paper Petrosino,
    Striccoli, Romanov, Boggia, and Grieco (2023) Light-Fidelity (LiFi) is reviewed
    the features of internet of device (IoT) at which improve its performance. The
    different application of deep learning along with internet of thing has been discussed
    in Munavalli, Bindu, and Shirur (2023) for smart infrastructure like smart home
    and cities, smart farm and supply. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) helps
    to evaluate the consumption of energy of individual device in smart home. A deep
    learning algorithm has been proposed to resolve the issue of consumption power
    calculation with the help of NILM (Hashim Shahab et al., 2023). In Ref. (Helmi,
    Al-qaness, Dahou, & Abd Elaziz, 2023) a robust human activity recognition (HAR)
    has been created with help of swarm intelligence and deep learning. The marine
    predator algorithm (MPA) has been developed to optimize the features that used
    in smart homes. In paper Uppal et al. (2023) recommender model based on fault
    prediction has been proposed to make the IoT devices efficient and provide better
    quality of life by proposing machine learning algorithm. Fig. 12 shows the process

    Federated learning (FL) is a latest technique that secure the privacy of the data
    coming from different IoT device with in the network. To protect the important
    information and make sure the privacy preservation in smart cities the federated
    learning (FL) has been suggested in paper (Albaseer et al., 2020, Pandya et al.,
    2023). In Jiang, Kantarci, Oktug, and Soyata (2020) described a federated learning
    application in a smart city to facilitate the smart services considering data
    acquisition. The different application of FL in smart city have been present in
    Zheng et al. (2022). The current research and challenges in FL area has also been
    noted along with their proposed solutions. The FL based on block chain has been
    proposed for defence of smart city in Demertzis (2021). The mechanism of Fl has
    been explained systematically on different three types of level (Alferaidi et
    al., 2022). The processing of data information of traffic for the development
    and improvement of smart city has been discussed in Wang, He, et al. (2023). In
    Anand, Mavromatis, Carnelli, and Khan (2022) the Fl has used for monitoring and
    controlling of smart street light to overcome the current challenges in smart
    cities. The consumption of water is very serious issue and increases day by day.
    In paper Hanjri, Kabbaj, Kobbane, and Abouaomar (2023) proposed FL methods based
    on forecasting of smart cities for consumption of water to cater and reduces the
    current challenges in smart cities. The major problem in smart city is care of
    users, FL has proposed to provide smart health system in smart city (Nguyen et
    al., 2022). 3.6. Applications of mobile robotics in smart cities The purpose of
    mobile robotics in smart cities to reduce the interference of human with the help
    of sensors and other IoT devices. The major role of mobile robotic in smart infrastructure
    is localization. The localization is evaluated on sensor based data. A delay-tolerant
    sensor network (DTN) has been proposed for localization (Pathirana, Bulusu, Savkin,
    & Jha, 2005). A network cluster has used for organizing sensors devices in DTN.
    The cleanness of smart cities can be done by proposing a robot team having one
    group leader (Dahanaka et al., 2022). The control of navigation system and trajectories
    for a mobile robot is a challenging task which has been noticed in paper Pandey
    et al. (2023). A nature-inspired algorithms help to cater and mange different
    resources which are applicable for smart city (Millham, Agbehadji, & Freeman,
    2023). The robot and sensor have proposed to monitor and control the traffic and
    avoid collision of traffic (Ponnusamy & Alagarsamy, 2021). The different application
    of mobile robotics have been discussed in various field of smart cities such as
    agriculture, education, health care and cleaning (Rivera, Amorim, & Reis, 2020).
    The concept of cloud robotic has been presented in Beigi, Partov, and Farokhi
    (2017) to collect more date and reduces the number of sensors in smart cities.
    The navigation path has been created by autonomous robot by extracting different
    features from free space (Islam et al., 2020). The concept of sound sensing and
    its importance in smart city has been mentioned in Bello, Mydlarz, and Salamon
    (2018). The another major concern in smart city is collection of information data,
    the public vehicle has been proposed for this purposes and act as a data courier.
    The organizing of path planning for this data courier has studied in Al-Turjman,
    Karakoc, and Gunay (2017). In paper Studley and Little (2021) introduced the concept
    robot in smart city and highlighted the connection between robot and smart city.
    The distributed leader control approach of mobile robot is noted in Zhao et al.
    (2023). The desired trajectory has been created by a leader and its reference
    orientation has detected which is to be useful for smart city in the future and
    we cannot ignore the importance of robot in transformation of smart home to smart
    city. 3.7. Energy management Any automated system requires energy to run and the
    smart home systems mostly contains embedded systems running on a small scale and
    run on low power. The power is taken from the main supply and stepped down to
    a few volts. Even in that case Low-Power circuits and controllers have advantages
    that could minimize the extra expenses of energy and provide maximum efficiency.
    Other than that smart grids and microgrids are now installed to manage the energy
    consumption of the smart home (Aliero et al., 2021, Büyük et al., 2022, Mansouri
    et al., 2021). Same technology is utilized on a large scale to manage the power
    and resources for a smart city (Badar and Anvari-Moghaddam, 2020, Jabeur et al.,
    2022). By advocating policies for energy efficiency, regionalized/distributed
    renewable energy generation, and intelligent energy management, smart cities are
    ways to promoting the transition to sustainable and effective energy systems (Lewandowska,
    Chodkowska-Miszczuk, Rogatka, & Starczewski, 2020). This shift towards a more
    integrated and intelligent energy supply method. A multitude of energy meta-information
    being made available via the IoT smart grid, allowing big data analytical services
    to forecast energy use and regulate usage patterns (Kaur, Kaur, Kumbhar, & Khanna,
    2017). This paper presents a context-aware framework for intelligent power equipment
    management (Choi, Esposito, Wang, Liu, & Choi, 2018). The design of the suggested
    frame work based on awareness is the main contribution of it, while other contributions
    are construction of a context ontology for power equipment management, the specification
    of context ontology inference rules, and a context-aware inference service for
    power equipment management. 3.7.1. Distributed generations and smart grids Conventionally,
    the power generation plants are located far from the residential areas and the
    power is transmitted to the city in transmission lines that causes a lot of line
    losses. The concept of smart cities promotes the intelligent distribution of energy
    and hence the idea of smart grids and micro grids is widely appreciated with in
    a smart city (Bhatt, Jani, & Bhatt, 2020). By generating the power near the end
    users can not only increase the energy efficiency but also improve the resilience
    of the grid system. Distributed Generation (DG) refers to the generation of on-site
    power that reduces the transmission losses. It can be effectively used within
    a smart city by dividing the city into smaller divisions with their own DGs. However,
    selecting the proper size and placement while keeping in mind the overall cost
    and environmental issues is a critical step in ensuring the system’s stability
    and durability. When generators are installed in the wrong location, it generates
    a slew of difficulties with voltage, power, and distribution, exposing the system
    to serious flaws and Increases the chances of connection to be lost between load
    and grid (Sayed, Elamary, & Swief, 2021). In addition to which the impact of integration
    of DGs to the main energy distribution network of the city is also required (Kumar
    & Savier, 2017). Other than that, with the increasing amount of big data available
    from smart sensors and the growing digitalization of technologies necessitate
    significant improvements in distribution systems to ensure the growth of sustainable
    smart cities (Nunes, Gouveia, Rodrigues, & Simão, 2017). From the perspective
    of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing and trade, this article Mahmud, Islam, and
    Lilley (2021) provides an architecture for a smart energy hub (SEH) for smart
    cities. The proposed architecture is based on the energy generation and consumption
    patterns of various facilities inside smart cities (residential, commercial, industrial,
    and community services). The capabilities of distributed energy resources (DERs)
    that supply electricity to multiple facilities (i.e., controllability of DERs)
    and the energy trading framework determine the prospects for P2P energy sharing
    and trading in a SEH Microgrids and Smart Grids are another extension of this
    concept. Smart grids use automated switches and control systems based on fault
    tolerant mechanisms that increase the system resilience. A smart grid dynamic
    characteristics improve traditional system requirements by applying advanced control
    strategies to provide uninterrupted electricity to the demand side from intermittent
    renewable generation. Communication networks and control systems that allow distributed
    generation which are critical technology for monitoring, protecting, and managing
    the smart grid, whether it is centralized or decentralized (Fakhar, Haidar, Abdullah,
    & Das, 2022). Ref. (Sanchez-García, Rodríguez-Aguilar, & Marmolejo-Saucedo, 2022)
    provides a quick assessment of the literature on the potential use of renewable
    energies via smart grid integration and use of electric vehicles as micro generators
    for energy exchange with the grid. The primary technological aspects, potential
    benefits and needs for said integration, are discussed. Micro grids are smaller
    grids located near the end users that can work autonomously when disconnected
    from the main grid. It can cater for the power outages with in a smart city and
    support the sustainable infrastructures. Dealing with severe power failures during
    severe occurrences, and the implications on people’s lives and social elements,
    is one of the key challenges of power systems. As a result, with the goal of improving
    distribution system resilience, the ideal use of microgrids that may be identified
    as a smart city that is equipped with renewable energy sources and distributed
    energy generation is explored in Ebadat-Parast, Nazari, and Hosseinian (2022).
    The idea of a Grid of Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids is presented in this study as a
    new paradigm for future smart cities (Kazerani & Tehrani, 2020). The focus is
    on the challenges and benefits expected in the seemingly inevitable transition
    from the existing traditional supply–demand model defined by distributed generation
    production, separate energy carriers, and low penetration of renewable energy
    sources. In order to mitigate the Demand Response (DR) from the active users,
    the paper (Silva et al., 2022) propose a methodology to shift the load to smaller
    grids by triggering a DR event. The use of machine learning and AI in the management
    of energy resources helps in predicting the energy flow and resource depletion
    and efficiently arrange for counter measures. A deep learning architecture of
    power management is proposed in Xin et al. (2022). It forecasts future power usage
    over a short period of time and allows power distributors and consumers to communicate
    effectively. Mobile devices connected to a universal IoT remote server linked
    to the intelligent grids in the suggested design to maintain energy usage and
    supply constant. Various preprocessing procedures for dealing with electrical
    data are followed by an effective brief prediction decision-making method. 3.7.2.
    Energy optimization A smart home is an idea that seeks to use as little energy
    with enhancing occupant comfort. In smart homes, comfort and energy use are conflicting
    issues. Increasing comfort frequently takes a lot of energy. Several different
    optimization algorithms have been designed for smart cities, to provide the better
    life to the users. The bat algorithm (BA) has been proposed in Malek et al. (2022)
    for occupant comfort which consider the impact of quality of indoor air and temperature.
    In paper Wang, Han, Yin, and Ma (2023) the efficient way has discussed for communication
    of data in smart grid through neighborhood area network (NAN), the optimization
    tool is proposed to formulate and minimize the energy. Multi objective, uncertainties,
    and coupling optimizer algorithm has proposed to increase the capacity of energy
    storage in grid and extend the usage of energy [MO]. In paper Braun et al. (2023)
    the distributed optimizer along with model predictive control (MPC) has been proposed
    to fulfill the requirement of smart grid at demand side. MPC is designed to minimize
    the demand of overall network. In the paper by Chen, Tan, and Quek (2014) optimization
    tool has used to analyze the optimal power flow (OPF) for charging of electric
    vehicle in smart grid. The Lyapunov optimization technique (LOT) has suggested
    to optimize the overall efficiency of consuming energy devices in sustainable
    smart home. The data for proposed algorithm is based on charging of electric vehicle,
    temperature, and energy storage devices (Albogamy et al., 2022). The convex optimization
    has been performed for the electric vehicle components size and to control and
    manage the energy. Optimization scheduling techniques has been used to minimize
    the cost of energy consumption along with peak load demand Lu, Guo, and Zeng (2022).
    In this work we proposed a novel technique called Grey Wolf Optimization. Actually
    tuning of controllers in smart cities can be done through GWO to optimize the
    gains or other required objectives. The implementation of optimization algorithm
    is shown in Fig. 13. Download : Download high-res image (322KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Optimization architecture. 3.7.3. Electric and autonomous
    vehicles and energy utilization As cities transition into smart cities, electric
    vehicles have been positioned as one of the basic pillars, primarily in terms
    of transforming the city’s transportation needs. Electric-powered vehicles converted
    into self-driving cars and autonomous public trains and buses that make mobility
    in the sustainable smart city in the future. Electric vehicles (EVs) not only
    promote the smart grid’s long-term sustainability, but also support and accelerate
    its upgrade. Without a doubt, by deploying Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Grid-to-Vehicle
    (G2V) communications, EVs may actively boost the development of the smart grid.
    EVs are better for the environment than hybrids or even internal combustion engines
    since they may reduce noise, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The integration
    of electric vehicles (EVs) could have a significant impact on society, not only
    in terms of providing transportation services, but also play a major roles in
    the economic development of the country by controlling the price of oil. Moreover
    its lowering emissions from the transportation sector. The efficient use of energy
    resources is critical in smart cities, and with mobile electric vehicles (EVs)
    playing a vital part in smart city power flow, the coordination of energy management
    systems (EMSs) at their parking places can yield global benefits. As a new contribution
    to previous studies, the coordination between household energy management systems
    (HEMSs) and EV parking Lot management systems (PLEMS) is proposed, modeled, and
    simulated in Lotfi et al. (2022). Individual EV schedules are partially shared
    by the EMSs, but no private information is shared. Mixed-integer linear programming
    is used to implement the HEMS and PLEMS (MILP). An optimization issue that reduces
    the total cost of all energy systems and maximizes the Regenerative Braking energy
    to restore subway is solved for optimal smart city functioning (Duan, Askari,
    Hemat, & Ali, 2021). Regenerative Braking system reuses the energy lost in deceleration
    of the vehicle and re-feeds it to the acceleration system. The traffic and duration
    of the routes are modeled in this article using electric vehicles such as vehicle
    to grid and Subway technology placed in an unique depot. It has also been proposed
    to increase the battery life of electric vehicles using a degradation model. In
    addition to reduce the energy resources, the EVs also work towards reducing the
    carbonization and harmful emissions from exhaust pipes. Research showing the results
    of decarbonization after the integration of EVs into the transportation system
    of a smart city is presented in Heinisch et al. (2021). When charging is linked
    with the local value of electricity in the city, the benefit of smart charging
    to the city energy system can be realized effectively. In the city energy and
    heating sectors, smart charging for vehicles minimizes the requirement for investments
    in term of fixed batteries and peak units and leads towards the sustainability
    of the city’s resources. Sharing the charging resources by charging the battery
    of EVs at the same time by giving optimum power is proposed in He et al. (2021).
    On the road towards the sustainability, in addition to smart vehicles, Autonomous
    Vehicles (AVs) are also presented. The future of the smart cities is moving towards
    the integrated AVs and EVs that can contribute towards a greener and sustainable
    environment (Yu and Lam, 2018, Zhou et al., 2022). The below subsection discussed
    the further details of G2V and V2G technology for smart cities; • Grid to Vehicle
    and Vehicle to Grid applications in smart cities: The crises of energy increase
    day by day which lead to increases the price of fuel along with greater emission
    of carbon dioxide that causes pollution. Therefore, G2V and V2G topology is proposed
    to deal these challenging tasks. The mode of operation depends on the direction
    of flow of power. The G2V and V2G mode can be possible by proposing two types
    of bidirectional converters, AC–DC and DC–DC converters (Ahmed et al., 2022, Ahmed
    et al., 2021, Rachid et al., 2019, Rachid et al., 2018, Rachid et al., 2020).
    The paper (Oad, Ahmad, Talpur, Zhao, & Pervez, 2023) proposed the smart management
    system that balance the supply and demand in the smart city. The economic model
    has been derived in Rahman, Gemechu, Oni, and Kumar (2023) that minimize the cost
    of energy in V2G mode for cold climate. The performance of proposed model has
    been tested at various temperatures. In article Mastoi et al. (2023) noted the
    features at which the life of the battery in electric vehicle reduces that causes
    many problems. It also discussed the techniques on which battery life can be extended
    for better charging and discharging processes. The smart city is based on smart
    grid therefore the application of electric vehicle can be ignored. A machine learning
    algorithm has been proposed (Mazhar et al., 2023) for better management of charging
    and discharging of battery according to the requirements. In smart home the vehicle
    to load (V2L) technology is suggested to fulfill the requirement of the load under
    different conditions. In this work we proposed a wireless V2L communication between
    vehicle to load to provide ease life to the user in smart cities. In vehicle to
    X (V2X) technology, where X denote every thing in smart cities can be charged
    and discharged according to the designed energy management algorithm. The different
    modes of operation in V2X topology for a smart city is depicted in Fig. 14. Download

    V2X topology. 3.7.4. Renewable energy resources The main energy resource in any
    system is usually retrieved from non renewable energy resources like fossil fuels
    or water from dams etc. Due to the climatic changes and global warming, not only
    the entropy of the world is decreasing but the natural resources are also depleting.
    Hence the smart cities are turning towards the use of renewable energy resources
    like solar and wind energy. Solar energy is one of the most popular and promising
    renewable energy sources accessible. In smart cities, solar facilities are frequently
    distributed in the form of small farms, rooftop installations, and parking lot
    blinds to maximize available area and decrease electricity lines. The different
    renewable sources like wind, solar and ocean for smart cities have been introduced
    in Hoang, Nguyen, et al. (2021). The integration of renewable energy sources with
    energy storage system increases the capacity of the storage to fulfill the requirements
    of the load. In paper (Khalil et al., 2021) the various sources of energy have
    been integrated to optimize the cost of energy and distributed the energy in efficient
    way in smart cities. The relationship among different section of energy management
    system in sustainable smart cities have been derived (Atasoy, Akınç, & Erçin,
    2015). The concept of sustainable energy system is explained which have low carbon
    dioxide emission to reduces the pollution and renewable energy sources. The energy
    management system is one of the main step towards smart city (Kamyab, Klemeš,
    Van Fan, & Lee, 2020). In paper (Neffati et al., 2021) discussed the transformation
    of traditional grid into smart grid in smart home/cities in term of energy, sustainability
    and transmission of power. The major role of renewable sources along with storage
    system in smart cities have been discussed in Farmanbar, Parham, Arild, and Rong
    (2019). It also studied the current project of smart cities in Europe. The future
    energy management system having greater flexibility. The flexible network is important
    in transmission and distribution of energy. Its play a vital role in smart cities
    to do certain tasks at the same time (Simões, Farret, Khajeh, Shahparasti, & Laaksonen,
    2022). Even though it is cheap and renewable, Solar energy, is a function of its
    surroundings, and abrupt changes in weather can produce intermittency and impair
    the power generation. Current–Voltage (IV) Tracing, in which the properties of
    a PV module are utilized to evaluate the module’s performance, is a standard method
    for measuring losses. For this purpose the monitoring of the panels is a constant
    need and IoT plays a helpful role in this. Shapsough et al. presented the design
    and implementation of a city-wide, large-scale, and distributed solar monitoring
    system based on the Internet of Things in smart cities. To conduct and communicate
    IV curves remotely from individual modules or strings in a remote facility, the
    system employs low-cost hardware and IoT networking technology (Shapsough, Takrouri,
    Dhaouadi, & Zualkernan, 2020). The energy planning of urban districts with renewable
    energy power plants (photovoltaic fields and wind micro-turbines), combined heat
    and power units, and traditional boilers is formalized using an optimization model,
    districts are connected to the public distribution grid (Bracco et al., 2018).
    The different kinds of wind turbines and cogeneration plants, the size of solar
    fields, and the power exchange with the public grid are the primary decision variables.
    The variables’ optimal values are determined by minimizing installation, maintenance,
    and operational costs while also satisfying load and technical constraints. In
    smart cities, energy generating efficiency and dependability have been critical
    needs. The paper Ha and Phung (2019) discussed the design and implementation of
    trustworthy microgrid management control schemes that can be smoothly incorporated
    into smart building management systems. Reliable controllers have been presented
    along with their hardware implementation, to recover from faults in a building
    microgrid’s solar energy system. The system uses the Internet of Things (IoT)
    as its central component to scalably coordinate the functioning of various subsystems.
    To ensure redundancy and reliability in solar tracking, the control strategy employs
    a number of controllers cooperating inside the network via a token-based approach.

    and future prospects In this ongoing review we have explored a great deal of various
    technologies used in certain aspects of smart homes and smart cities, be it the
    domain of architecture design, data handling or using Artificial Intelligence.
    We have not only discussed the traditional ways of implementing those technologies
    but also how those can be used to design sustainable smart cities. However, the
    road to sustainable smart cities is not so paved currently and has certain challenges
    that are being faced. Some of them we have already discussed in previous sections,
    which are now being clustered here. In this work, we are considering smart cities
    as a cluster of smart homes representing themselves as nodes. However, with the
    increase in the number of nodes, certain social and infrastructure management
    problems can arise which require careful planning. With the increase in the volume
    of a smart city, data handling becomes a tedious task since there are hundreds
    and thousands of data points being transmitted at all times. In this aspect, the
    technologies like Intelligent and wireless sensing are coming in handy. Instead
    of transmitting data continuously, we can use such technologies as a trigger point
    to exchange information. Moreover, the development of such communication protocols
    that can have a large overhead is the need of the hour, since the exchange of
    information is based on that. Further challenges faced by a sustainable smart
    city include data privacy and security. By ensuring that only then we can expect
    a healthy participation and engagement from citizens. In addition to that, providing
    equal access to facilities and services offered, promoting and practicing sustainable
    energy while looking for renewable energy sources are some other challenges in
    the way of implementing smart cities (Gupta, 2023). Moreover, the design of infrastructure
    and architecture to handle potential emergencies and disasters is one of the necessities
    for which crowd sourcing can be very helpful. A glance at the social aspects of
    these problems will reveal the need of incorporating the role of citizens in the
    decision making process of the management, which will help promote harmony and
    prevail sustainability and stability. As a crux of all this discussion, in this
    portion of this review paper, we have presented some future prospects for this
    domain. Here we are discussing some technologies that are being considered State-of-the-art
    in terms of automation solutions. These technologies originated and peaked just
    a while back and proved to be of paramount importance in designing sustainable
    and practical infrastructures for smart cites. 4.1. Narrow band-IoT One of the
    recent marvels in the field of communication is Narrow Band IoT, that is a communication
    standard specially designed for IoT based low power communication. It has a dedicated
    frequency band and works effortlessly in areas with less cellular coverage. Surpassing
    the limitations of WiFi and conventional cellular networks, NB-IoT can not only
    connect with former mentioned standards but also consumes very less power making
    it viable for communication between smart city’s various sectors (Routray et al.,
    2021). It also offers the luxury of connecting multiple devices in close proximity
    and transmitting data. The technology has made its way into smart city development
    and has been used in literature in small scale experimentation with various sensors
    and actuators (Duangsuwan, Takarn, & Jamjareegulgarn, 2018)(Zhu, Jia, Han, Zhou,
    & Guizani, 2019). 4.2. WiFi based intelligent sensing WiFi-based intelligent sensing
    is a technology that makes use of WiFi networks to allow sensors and gadgets to
    automatically and intelligently collect, transmit, and analyze data. WiFi, a wireless
    communication technology that is frequently used for internet access, is employed
    in this context to make it easier to gather different kinds of data from sensors
    and devices positioned across an area. Intelligent sensing refers to the capability
    of sensors to process and analyze data locally or remotely in addition to just
    detecting physical events (such as temperature, motion, light, etc.) (Ding et
    al., 2022). These sensors may transfer the gathered data to central systems, databases,
    or cloud platforms for additional analysis, archiving, and decision-making by
    using WiFi networks as the communication channel. Smart homes, industrial automation,
    environmental monitoring, healthcare, and other areas may all benefit from WiFi-based
    intelligent sensing. It makes it possible to build networks of interconnected
    devices and sensors that can communicate, adapt, and react to changes in their
    environment, improving productivity, comfort, and decision-making (Qi et al.,
    2023). A great understanding of this concept can be obtained through the work
    done by Zhang et al. (2022) where they have used wifi based intelligent sensing
    to recognize hand gesture in the air. They developed the methods of Dynamic Phase
    Vector (DPV) and Motion Rotation Variable (MRV), through which they were able
    to recognize hand gestures regardless of the transmission location. Similarly,
    in smart cities, Intelligent sensing based on WiFi can be used to locate and extract
    data from moving objects as done by Guillen-Pérez and Baños (2018) in counting
    the number of pedestrians to manage traffic in case of emergency. Similarly Reconfigurable
    Intelligent Surface (RIS) based WiFi sensing and device free localization of objects
    are also some applications of intelligent sensing that can be useful in smart
    cities (He, Zhang, & Chen, 2022)(Zhang, Li, Xiao, & Zhang, 2022). 4.3. Digital
    Twin Urban planning and development is very much needed in smart city infrastructure.
    However, with the rampant new technologies these tasks can be performed effortlessly.
    Digital Twin is such a technology that allows us to do that. A digital twin in
    the context of smart cities refers to a virtual representation of a physical city
    or urban environment (Deng, Zhang, & Shen, 2021). It is a dynamic and interconnected
    model that mirrors the real-world city and its various components, such as infrastructure,
    buildings, transportation systems, utilities, and more. The digital twin concept
    leverages data from sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and other sources
    to create a digital replica that can simulate and predict real-world scenarios,
    monitor changes, and optimize urban operations (Dembski, Wössner, Letzgus, Ruddat,
    & Yamu, 2020). Its application in smart cities can be found in planning disaster
    management techniques, expanding the urban architecture and predicting the increasing
    needs of the society (Ford & Wolf, 2020). 4.4. Metaverse Similarly to the previously
    mentioned concept of digital twin, Metaverse is a relatively new concept in the
    context of smart cities. It has similar applications as to predict the requirements
    of the urban population based on social, environmental and economical factors.
    Integrated with digital twin, eventually it helps in designing sustainable environment
    with the help of smart decision making (Yaqoob, Salah, Jayaraman, & Omar, 2023)(Kusuma
    & Supangkat, 2022). It is important to note that the concept of the metaverse
    is still evolving, and its integration with smart cities might take various forms.
    Given the rapid pace of technological advancements, it is possible that new developments
    and intersections between the metaverse and smart cities could emerge beyond our
    imagination. 4.5. Quantum communications Since data transmission and communication
    is one of the vital jobs of any smart city management system, the quest of finding
    efficient means of data transmission never ends. One of such quests has yield
    the method of Quantum Communications which is the latest technology in the context
    of smart city architecture. Based on the theory of quantum physics, quantum communications
    uses qubits instead of regular binary bits to transmit data with an attenuation
    of only 0.2dB/km (Bünzli & Kauzlarich, 2023). Since they are photons and travels
    in the form of packets of energy, they are unsusceptible to attenuation hence
    having minimal data loss. It not only finds its applications in data transmission
    but also cryptography, cybersecurity and Neural Network Designs (Mohammed, 2023).
    The literature and research on in the domain of smart city development is relatively
    new, however once implemented, it can truly be a revolution in this field (Kamruzzaman,
    2022)(Bonab, Fedele, Formisano, & Rudko, 2023). In this Section, we have discussed
    the challenges faced by the contemporary smart home automation technologies in
    designing sustainable smart cities. Moreover, we have also presented some state-of-the-art
    technologies that are quite new for this field and can help in solving the above
    mentioned challenges, providing the readers with future research prospects for
    this domain. 5. Comparison with existing solutions In this section we have presented
    a comparative analysis of proposed work with existing literature in Table 5. It
    analyzes the reviews on the presence of various parameters that are depicted in
    tabular form. Table 5. Comparison with existing studies. Year Hardware Communication

    work 6. Conclusion The marvel of automation has opened new doors to mankind, providing
    ease, comfort, efficiency and functionality at the same time. The idea of being
    able to control every thing around you with just a click, has always been fascinating.
    To bring that idea to life, technology is a helpful partner in designing the required
    architecture and framework. An automated smart city is made up of many different
    sectors and departments that consist of devices, components, operating on numerous
    protocols at a micro level, making up a complete mesh. In order to carefully choose
    and implement the right technology, it is inevitable to have the knowledge and
    pros and cons of the methods and their functionalities. In this paper, we have
    presented a detailed comparative analysis of the technologies used in various
    sections of smart home automation and linked them into designing sustainable smart
    cities. The overall analysis is divided into sub sections, in which the chronological
    discussion of the technology is presented, along with the pros and cons. In addition
    to that, every sub sections has its on comparison table that can give the reader
    a clear idea and the gist of the overall discussion. As for the future work directions,
    the need of the hour is to design sustainable and stable cities in which different
    nodes can work robustly and independent of the input from other nodes. The architecture
    can be improvised in such a way that divided sectors can keep working on the decentralized
    networks on edge, while there can be a central network running over the cloud
    and the data and information from nodes can be uploaded to the cloud network once
    in a while. Although the security of the data transmission will be vital and blockchain
    solutions can be designed for it. The uninterrupted running of systems on edge
    will also be a challenge in terms of both data handling and power management which
    can be optimized using efficient data pre processing techniques and discarding
    non renewable resources respectively. Moreover, there is a need of introducing
    more green and clean energy trend for the power systems and vehicles etc. that
    is also beneficial for environment in addition to being cost efficient. In addition
    to that, there is a huge niche of work in the domain of Artificial Intelligence
    and Digital Twin and Quantum Communication in terms of data sets, frameworks and
    feasible models, that requires more in depth research and development. This paper
    concludes that even though there has been numerous research performed in the domain
    of smart city automation, nevertheless there is a huge gap between the prototype
    development and actual scalable solutions for smart cities which requires the
    input from all the stakeholders to design mature solutions that bridge the gap
    towards sustainable cities. CRediT authorship contribution statement Noor Ul Huda:

    ISSN Information: DOI: 10.1109/LES.2023.3250162 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that has been widely deployed in many
    areas, from home applications to industry and health, among others. IoT is of
    interest because it facilitates the design and implementation of applications
    that connect devices and objects in the real world, enabling their identification
    and communication, for monitoring and/or control purposes. Several applications
    for energy conservation, based on IoT and cloud computing, have been developed
    in recent years. Some of them are aimed at automating energy management, according
    to models that try to reduce consumption and at the same time provide well-being
    to the inhabitants of the so-called smart buildings [1] and smart houses [2].
    Other proposals are intended to provide feedback to the users about their consumption,
    so that they can manage it rationally [3]. IoT devices generally have a small
    amount of memory, low processing resources, and it is often required that they
    have low energy consumption. This research is oriented to try to take advantage
    of a classic standard of cable communications, such as RS485, to allow the connection
    of simple devices to the TCP/IP network through an intermediary node. In this
    way, IoT devices could be based on a low-end microcontroller, requiring only an
    asynchronous serial interface (UART) to communicate. RS485 implements a multipoint,
    low-speed, half-duplex communication channel. It connects several nodes over a
    twisted pair bus, using differential signaling, reaching distances of up to 1
    km, with typical transmission rates between 9.6 and 115.2 kb/s. An interesting
    alternative that motivates this research, since it avoids laying an additional
    cable, is to use interfaces capable of transmitting RS485 over the electrical
    network. In this sense, an interface based on the THVD8000 [4] or THVD8010 [5]
    transceiver is analyzed and tested. From the point of view of energy requirements,
    it is worth making a comparison with another common IoT device. The power consumed
    by the THVD8000 with a 50% duty cycle is about 62.5 mW, while for an ESP8266 [6]
    with WiFi at 54 Mb/s and the same duty cycle is Tx: 420 mW and Rx: 168 mW. It
    is worth mentioning two related papers on this topic. One of them [7] presents
    an adaptation of 6LoWPAN to use RS485 as the physical layer, in order to enable
    the connection of low-capacity devices to an IPv6 network, using a CSMA-type scheme
    to access the shared medium, similar to the scheme of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless media
    access control. The other one [8] presents an implementation of IP over RS485,
    which uses a leader/follower scheme to regulate access to the medium, under the
    control of a node (called IP Router). Each node connected to RS485 has an IP address
    and a node identifier (which acts as a MAC address), so the IP Router must have
    both associated to be able to send packets to a specific node on the RS485 segment.
    The current proposal has similarities with the papers just cited, particularly
    the second, in terms of the leader/follower scheme to control access to the RS485
    network. However, the present study has a significant difference, which simplifies
    connection, enabling its application in low-resource devices which only needs
    to have a UART. Basically, a TCP/IP stack over RS485 is not required; instead,
    each node uses a link layer identifier, and the messages are identified according
    to the application. For example, it could be possible to develop an implementation
    of MQTT [9] over RS485, using the MQTT topics to identify subscriber nodes. A
    benefit of this approach is to have small frame sizes (at least a save of 20 bytes
    of the IP header and 20 bytes of the TCP header) and, consequently, less processing
    requirements, both in the RS485 nodes and in the gateway that links them with
    the rest of the network. This saving is significant for microcontrollers with
    a small amount of RAM. In the following sections, a possible implementation is
    presented, with a gateway that acts as a link between the nodes of the RS485 segment
    and the TCP/IP network. Then, the results obtained in the data frame transmission
    tests on the wiring of the electrical installation are presented, and finally,
    an estimate of its potential practical use is discussed. SECTION II. Proposed
    Network Scheme A. RS485 Topology With Gateway to TCP/IP Fig. 1 presents a scheme
    of the proposed topology. It shows the RS485 nodes identified by their number
    and the gateway that links them to the TCP/IP network. Fig. 1. RS485 topology
    with gateway to a TCP/IP network. Show All The way in which the RS485 nodes are
    recognized in the TCP/IP network may vary according to each application. For example,
    to send a message to node #n, it could be sent to the IP address of the gateway,
    using 8000 + n as the destination port. The gateway will take care of forwarding
    the message to node #n. Another alternative, previously mentioned as an example,
    could be based on the use of MQTT as the application protocol. RS485 nodes will
    be able to subscribe or publish topics; the gateway subscribes to the broker on
    behalf of the RS485 nodes, and when it receives a publication on a topic of interest
    to one or more nodes, it forwards it to them. These are just a few possible examples,
    and both the frame format and the gateway operation must be defined according
    to the application that is intended to be developed. B. RS485 Over Electrical
    Installation Fig. 2 shows a diagram of the connection between the RS485 nodes
    and the gateway, each one using an interface between the UART and the electrical
    installation. Fig. 2. Connection diagram for RS485 transmission over the electrical
    installation. Show All As already mentioned, the interface between the UART and
    the power line was developed based on the THVD8000 integrated circuit. It implements
    OOK modulation, with a selectable carrier frequency between 125 kHz and 5 MHz.
    When the UART transmit output, TxD, is high (idle or ones) there is no carrier
    on the output, while with TxD low (start bit or zeros) it transmits the carrier
    frequency. Fig. 3 shows a schematic of a basic interface of this type. Fig. 3.
    Basic UART interface to the power line. Show All The manufacturer specifies that
    the bit rate must be less than 10% of the carrier frequency. For example, 125
    kHz enables to transmit at 9600 b/s, while 500 kHz is suitable for 9600, 19 200,
    and 38 400 b/s. The capacitors C present high impedance at power line frequency
    and low impedance at the carrier frequency. Another design consideration states
    that Z C must be less than 5 Ω ; so, C=250 nF represents 5 Ω at 125 kHz and 1.3
    Ω at 500 kHz. Rt acts as a terminator at the carrier frequency and also as part
    of the voltage divider next to the capacitors C , so that a small fraction of
    the power line voltage remains between A and B. It should be noted that this capacitive
    coupling to the electrical installation is potentially dangerous in case the device
    is expected to interact with a person, in which case it is necessary to provide
    galvanic isolation to the connection with the power line [10]. Likewise, as is
    also indicated in [10], for the interface with low impedance loads, less than
    375 Ω , as in a typical electrical installation, a line driver (such as THS6222
    [11]) will also be necessary. C. RS485 Media Access Control The operating mode
    in the RS485 segment is half-duplex, using the MODE input to control the transmission
    direction of each interface. The gateway acts as the controller, implementing
    a polling scheme with the RS485 nodes. A possible frame format is presented in
    Fig. 4. The bit called SEQ, used as a frame sequence number, which alternates
    between 0 and 1 for each node, would be used to implement an acknowledgment scheme,
    if the application requires it. If a node receives the same SEQ value as the previous
    time, it assumes that it is a retransmission. If it receives an SEQ value other
    than the previous one, it assumes that the previous message was successfully received.
    If the gateway does not receive a response to a poll, the next time it will retransmit
    with the same SEQ value. Fig. 4. Frame format on RS485 segment. Show All The structure
    and the content of the Message field must be defined according to each specific
    application. As an example, and related to what was previously mentioned, one
    possibility would be to use the payload to implement MQTT over RS485, as described
    below. One-byte payloads can be reserved for node configuration commands and responses,
    while payloads of two or more bytes could be used to transport MQTT protocol messages.
    Subscribe: Unicast from node to gateway, using the acknowledgment scheme based
    on SEQ bit, that was mentioned above. Publish: Unicast from node to gateway, using
    the same acknowledgment scheme (QoS 1), or without acknowledgment (QoS 0). Publish:
    Unicast from the gateway to a specific node (QoS 1) or broadcast (QoS 0). An advantage
    of this proposal is that it would allow the integration of low-resource nodes
    to a network based on MQTT, without the need to implement the full TCP/IP stack.
    SECTION III. Tests and Results In order to evaluate the feasibility of RS485 transmission
    over electrical wiring, a series of tests with different frame sizes and distances
    were carried out on the electrical installation of an office floor. It should
    be noted that each electrical installation is a particular case, due to the devices
    connected, the many variants in the wiring topology, etc. For this reason, the
    results obtained are not conclusive, but serve as a reference to evaluate the
    potential of its application. The purpose of the tests was to obtain the rate
    of received frames under different operating conditions. Frames of 16, 32, 64,
    and 128 bytes were transmitted at 9600, 19 200, and 38 400 b/s, over distances
    of 12, 17, 22, and 29 m. These distances were chosen because they were the ones
    that were available, using different outlets of the installation on which it was
    tested. A. Tests at 9600 b/s Fig. 5 shows the results obtained in the tests that
    were carried out to compare the performance at 9600 b/s with carrier frequencies
    of 125 kHz and 500 kHz. Fig. 5. Rate of received frames at 9600 b/s with 125 and
    500 kHz. Show All It is observed that for short distances, better results were
    obtained with the 500-kHz carrier, probably related to the manufacturer’s recommendation
    regarding the relationship between the carrier frequency and bit rate. But as
    the distance increases, it is observed that with the 500-kHz carrier, the error
    rate tends to increase more than with the 125-kHz carrier. However, 500 kHz gave
    better results at 29 m than at 22 m. This could be due to the irregularities that
    exist in an electrical installation, which could have given rise to a better adaptation
    of impedances and/or lesser reflections in the case of 29 m. B. Tests With 500-MHz
    Carrier Frequency In this case, tests were carried out using a carrier frequency
    of 500 kHz and transmission rates of 9600, 19 200, and 38 400 b/s. Fig. 6 shows
    the results obtained. Fig. 6. Rate of received frames with 500-kHz carrier frequency.
    Show All The best results have been obtained at 19 200 b/s, slightly better than
    9600 b/s. At 38 400 b/s a rapid degradation is observed as the distance increases.
    This could be explained because at 9600 and 19 200 b/s, the ratio between bit
    rate and carrier frequency is still far away from the limit. And since the 19
    200 b/s frame is half the length of the 9600 b/s frame, it is less likely that
    impulsive noise will cause a burst error. At 38 400 b/s, it is closer to the limit
    of the relationship between bit rate and carrier frequency, so the combination
    of attenuation, noise, and distortion can cause irregularities in the timing of
    each bit of the recovered digital signal, giving rise to misinterpretations of
    the bit value. C. Choice of Carrier Frequency and Bit Rate Table I shows a summary
    of the results obtained, considering for each combination of frequency and bit
    rate the lowest percentage of frames that have been received through different
    tests, within the range of distances tested. TABLE I Results Summary This table
    allows us to select the most appropriate parameters based on the maximum frame
    size to be used. For 16-byte frames, the best combination would be 500 kHz and
    19 200 b/s. For frames between 32 and 128 bytes, the best combination would be
    125 kHz and 9600 b/s. However, if it is required to operate at 19 200 b/s, the
    lower efficiency could be compensated by the higher bit rate, so the effective
    transfer rate that could be achieved would have to be analyzed. SECTION IV. Conclusion
    The tests carried out showed that data communication through the electrical installation
    is an attractive possibility to connect low resource and low consumption IoT devices,
    due to the advantage of not requiring a network infrastructure, wired or wireless,
    and the associated reduction of consumption. The energy consumption required to
    transmit a small data packet via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, two common technologies used
    at home or office, is much higher than that required by RS485 over electrical
    installation. This proposal also implies less competition for the use of the wireless
    media and avoids the need to have access to the network in all the spaces to be
    monitored or controlled. More tests are planned to further characterize the potential
    of this data communication technique. This includes adding a line driver to the
    circuit, to improve the interface with the electrical installation and to be able
    to reach greater distances and/or reduce the error rate. Likewise, a version of
    MQTT over RS485 is under development, which allows taking advantage of the possibilities
    of this transmission mode by a typical IoT protocol. The experimental prototype
    is based on a Nodemcu ESP-32 module used as a gateway, programmed in C from the
    Arduino environment, and using mosquitto [12] as an MQTT broker on a commercial
    computer or other smart devices, such as a Raspberry Pi. On the other hand, the
    idea is that the RS485-MQTT nodes could be small microcontrollers with a reduced
    amount of memory and a UART as a communication interface. Authors Figures References

    Environment Chapter © 2024 1 Introduction With advancements in various mechanical
    sectors such as communication innovations, microelectronic circuits, sensors,
    embedded frameworks, and cell-running frameworks, the number of devices that can
    connect to the internet is increasing exponentially. This has given rise to the
    Internet of Things (IoT), which is an extensive network of interconnected devices
    that use specific communication protocols to communicate with each other and process
    data. IoT initiatives have been developed for various purposes such as smart cities,
    intelligent structures, security, visitors, remote monitoring, well-being, energy,
    disaster detection, farming, and industry. In the IoT, for communication, various
    communication protocols like MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, etc. are used at the application
    layer. MQTT is one of the popular protocols for M2M communication, allowing IoT
    networks to add devices (actual worldwide real devices with equipment and programming)
    for functional data exchange and collection. This method performs two-way message
    passing and is used to supervise and follow up on a wide range of assembly and
    supplier areas, like: health care, manufacturing and automation, smart home application,
    agricultural field etc. The Internet of Things covers cutoff applications and
    use-cases. Its examples and correspondence protocols grow and change over time
    [4, 5]. The spread buy-in design is a common region strategy for dealing with
    the expanding number of IoT devices in a knowing and adaptive way. Multi-solid
    informing is the foundation of spread buy-in. A manufacturer makes an impression
    on a special occasion channel. Over the event channel, the message is conveyed
    to each concerned endorser. This provides for decoupling in terms of space, time,
    and synchronization [6,7,8]. In IoT, various protocols like CoAP, XMPP, Advanced
    Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), etc. are used for communication at the application
    level. But an MQTT has various features, like being lightweight, small in size,
    low power usage, easy to implement and minimizing data packets, which makes this
    protocol ideal for IoT and M2M communication around the world. MQTT is popularly
    used in IoT worldwide. Other alternatives to MQTT are also available, like XMPP,
    AMQP, etc., but the basic reason for the popularity of the MQTT protocol is that
    it’s a lightweight and bandwidth-efficient protocol. Therefore, in this paper,
    the MQTT protocol is used for communication in Industrial IoT applications [9,
    10]. 1.1 MQTT protocol The fundamental acknowledgement of this depiction is the
    IoT convention informing the current state of the MQTT convention, which is discussed
    in this section. MQTT is an IoT informing convention that is well recognized with
    the useful asset of using the abbreviation MQTT. MQTT is a simple and versatile
    information protocol. It uses publish-subscribe correspondence model for communicating
    between MQTT clients. It was developed to reduce device reasserts and organizational
    transmission capacity, primarily for obligated devices. Within the MQTT message
    replacement technique, four fundamental phrasings appear. Let’s look at this phrase
    to better understand MQTT''s message substitution approach-An MQTT publisher is
    an MQTT buyer who acts as a source, sending a message to an MQTT merchant to be
    counted in a specified scenario; MQTT distributors are sensors such as moisture
    sensors, fire sensors, etc. MQTT Broker acts as a server that collects all measurements
    from MQTT Maker and then distributes that data to the proper journey spot supporter.
    The topic is a messaging task that enables the creation and endorsement of alternative
    measurements with a defined meaning. MQTT supporters are elements that eat up
    insights along with a cell phone, iPad, or stand-out IoT gadget from the MQTT
    representative [11,12,13]. In this paper, IIoT is used, which refers to the use
    of sensors that are connected through the network and other monitoring devices
    for improving the manufacturing and quality of a company''s products and parts.
    Majority of IIoT devices are used to acquire insights into machine health, determine
    the causes of malfunctioning parts, and collect general data. 1.2 Industrial IOT
    The IoT is the perfect system to link industrial equipment and sensors that are
    connected through the internet, which allows an authorized person or device in
    the industry to process the data acquired in a meaningful way using the information
    from these connected devices. Data is frequently supported, collected, analyzed,
    and visualized in IoT applications. Computers, smart devices, telecommunications,
    and cloud computing are all part of the Internet of Things infrastructure [14,15,16,17,18]
    (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Industrial IoT system architecture Full size image In the past,
    Bluetooth and radio frequency (RF) technology were used to manage industrial applications,
    but they were only effective over a short distance. Microcontrollers and telecommunications
    are available at low cost, which has increased demand for the Internet of Things.
    On the other hand, the adaptation of industrial businesses (large-scale industrial
    evolution), contemporary data-gathering methods, and the collection and assortment
    of data from distributed industrial enterprises for proper analysis and decision-making
    have increased demand for the IoT. In the traditional manufacturing approach,
    all the industrial operations are carried out manually, which has the risk of
    human errors [19]. In industrial IoT, such human errors can be eliminated by performing
    all the operations automatically through devices or machines. These automatic
    operations are possible because of machine-to-machine communication [19,20,21].
    Thus, in this paper, the motor monitoring and control application has been used
    to evaluate the QoS parameters of the MQTT protocol in industrial IoT applications.
    2 Literature survey Cuneyt Bayilmis et al. presented a broad overview of handling
    communication protocols that are light in weight. The IoT ecosystem and its recent
    developments in the application layer of the IoT system were discussed. The performance
    and limitations of different communication protocols were examined. The experimental
    comparison of CoAP, WebSocket and MQTT protocols, which are most suitable for
    small IoT equipment, was carried out. The traditional performance parameters,
    viz., energy consumption, reliability and bandwidth, were evaluated. These protocols
    were tested in a specific IoT environment. It was concluded that the MQTT protocol
    was found to be the best option for sending messages to multiple subscribers.
    The performance of these protocols needs to be verified for real-time IoT applications.
    Cuneyt applied machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to provide
    security and protection in the IoT [1], 21. He specified that there is a need
    to work on the authentication of data and users in IoT. Further scope is available
    for evaluating the security-related QoS parameters in communication protocols
    used in the IoT [1]. Hwang et al. has considered the MQTT protocol and analyzed
    the fundamental performance parameters and features of MQTT protocol communication,
    like message topics. The MQTT server, considering Mosquitto as a broker, was developed
    to carry out the performance test. The server was divided into three basic parts:
    the load generator for testing, an application that is to be monitored and the
    dashboard server. The Raspberry Pi and load generator were configured together
    to create message traffic for testing purposes. It was observed that the MQTT
    server works satisfactorily for different load tests. It was believed that, whenever
    the MQTT-based messaging server is developed, the developed monitoring system
    will be effectively utilized as a role model. Author Hwang et al. suggested the
    security algorithm but there is a tremendous need to define security protocol
    [2] (Table 1). Table 1 Parameters related to MQTT [2] Full size table Hariprasad
    et al. addressed two key issues related to handling large amounts of data from
    IoT devices: lack of security measures and time constraints for data management.
    They proposed a smart intrusion detection model that uses Elite Machine Learning
    (EML) and lightweight MQTT protocols to address these issues. The model consists
    of three components: (i) collecting sensor data from SENMQTTSET, (ii) extracting
    features from the SEN-MQTTSET dataset, and (iii) evaluating the dataset using
    machine learning (ML) techniques. The ML algorithms used, including Support Vector
    Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN),
    Linear Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT), achieved an accuracy of over 99%.
    The study also tested packet time and delay parameters for normal and attack traffic,
    finding that these parameters were higher for attack traffic than for normal traffic
    [3]. Hector Alaiz Moreton has suggested that the intrusion detection system protects
    the IoT application, which is continuously connected to the internet, from various
    anomalies. Two methods, namely deep learning and ensemble methods, were deployed
    to classify the attacks on IoT systems using the MQTT protocol. The recurrent
    network provides better results. He has obtained an accuracy of 96.08% with the
    Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). It was concluded that better results were obtained
    with the previous work, which was carried out using RF, SVM, and boosting gradient
    and obtained the maximum accuracy of 99.377% [4]. Hasan et al. addressed the security
    issues related to the IoT environment. Various attacks that may cause the catastrophic
    failure of IoT systems were listed. Different ML models that are useful for the
    precise prediction of attacks on IoT applications were compared. The SVM, DT,
    RF, LR, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms were applied; out of which
    ANN, DT, and RF provide 99.4% test accuracy. It was concluded that RF provides
    better results than other performance metrics [5]. Using the expansion of a moderate
    section to be modeled on a group of engines and their limitations in the area
    of facilitated factors, MQTT Protocol to Tra has come to see the inclusion of
    MQTT emission for transport of telemetry recordings. They depicted the type of
    release and transport of telemetry data to collect study, complete the best and
    most balanced condition of the primary MQTTs, and assemble the neighborhood of
    data between motion and utility server to ensure this goal [4, 6]. Gamess has
    described the term IoT as a collection of devices with specific knowledge and
    bandwidths. IoT-centric social class shows have gotten older in gaining interest
    due to the reach of IoT devices connected to the internet. This article distinguishes
    between the global runtime and one of the most well-liked restrictions, MQTT,
    which operates in Mosquitto, a popular runtime [6]. Since MQTT uses disperse/variant
    buying with a brokerage, our primary estimate is airtime, which is the amount
    of time it takes for a message to travel from a customer to another buyer via
    the brokerage [6,7,8,9,10]. Dikii has monitored the anomalous behavior of IoT
    devices using Machine Learning. He has examined the question of the secure institution
    of the IoT despite DoS attacks at public service level. He came up with a deliberate
    condition of the equipped assault ID gadget using the use of three classifiers
    using the attributes namely IP address, username, and device identity. It was
    shown that for the proposed working vector, it was reconstructed to check and
    prepare the data sets; the magnificent effects had been achieved with the help
    of the use of a multi-layer perceptron and a device for assistance vector with
    a winding base of the piece with the incorporation and advancement with the SMO
    estimate [11]. He stated that, in order to analyze the IoT network traffic accurately,
    it is essential to evaluate the QoS parameters of IoT applications. The IoT data
    exchange is currently maintained by several match broadcasts and different broadcast
    structures, each with its own advantages and shortcomings, and usually exists
    together in a coordinated fashion by sender approaches. However, different shows
    are material in different spaces; no show performs better under different circumstances.
    The objective of this work is twofold. In any case, provide a link between the
    various open game plans in so far as they show the assignment of, for example,
    transport type, media type mapping pattern, security views, including the name
    of the data network as a network based on the information of the mock critical
    plan by Silva et al. [12,13,14]. Fatma Hmiss et al. has performed the modeling
    of MQTT communication and evaluated the QoS parameters like delay and energy consumption.
    As compared to Cloud, Fog, and Edge, Fatma Hmiss has displayed the least match
    delay but also the fewest digital resources. Few IoT devices use MQTT broadcast
    to collect data due to its adaptability and friendliness, which gives IoT applications
    taking MQTT broadcast and Mist Computing integrators into consideration a fragile
    timeline. Given the limited resources of Mist hubs, they center on managing MQTT
    experts on those hubs to achieve disruption objectives. As a result, they present
    a strategy for selecting the appropriate MQTT expert fog. Additionally, they recommended
    the MQTT matching model [15], which provides ratings for the time and energy plane
    based on an M/M/1 model. Differentiating organizational denial attacks in IoT
    applications is a challenge for business districts. He specified that, there is
    a need to evaluate the other QoS parameters for evaluating the performance of
    MQTT communication The most recent classifiers demonstrate Michelena’s successful
    results [16]. Dikii has investigated the MQTT convention’s use of SUBSCRIBE messages.
    The frequent transmission of these kinds of messages has been shown to produce
    malicious IoT device activities, which significantly lengthen the time needed
    to process information at the gate and can cause organizational collapse [17].
    To counter the introduction of this mix and that demonstrated by the more conventional
    MQTT/TLS/TCP approach, Fatima Fernandez coordinated a GO-based runtime of the
    Quick UDP Internet connection (QUIC) show with MQTT. They organize remote frameworks
    using the ns 3 test framework and Linux compartments, copying several advancement
    [18]. Chouali has introduced the use of MQTT in Connected Vehicles (CV). Admittedly,
    in the primary MQTT show Samir typology, the agent effectively “sends” the data
    received to the backers by skipping a frame. In a similar vein, the data exchange
    was concealed by skipping a frame. As a vendor-based middleware, MQTT is used
    by OPC UA terminals to exchange data. The pairing dormancy of these terminals
    is examined and defined in [19] as appearing differently from client/server pairing.
    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol was primarily used for correspondence
    broadcasts when accessing the Internet. To match Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
    as would be expected to happen going forward, HTTP requires a high match, which
    the author is unable to provide. The Internet of Things has been given consideration
    for light-matching emissions [13]. Park developed the architecture to resolve
    the security issues of the MQTT protocol. It was concluded that the developed
    architecture is a noticeable solution for enhancing the security of MQTT. The
    importance of introducing end-to-end security between sender (publisher) and receiver
    (subscribers) was investigated [20]. Oak suggested that MQTT is the most commonly
    used protocol in IoT for exchanging information. The various encryption techniques
    for providing security to the MQTT protocol were applied and evaluated the time
    complexity of its implementation. It was concluded that it is essential to provide
    more lightweight solutions for MQTT [21]. Shapsough stated that, as the number
    of IoT devices is increasing day by day, the attack surface in IoT also increases.
    These limited power and low-cost IoT devices create security challenges [22].
    Banerjee et al. discussed the cyber threats in the manufacturing industry. A cyber-attack
    on a simple manufacturing process was demonstrated. It was observed that the manufacturing
    process industry can be a soft target during cyber-attacks, therefore there is
    a need to train the workforce for the industry 4.0 revolution [23]. Lee compared
    the old day’s security mechanism system RFID with the most focused cryptographic
    protocols. It was observed that the flaws and weaknesses of the RFID mechanism
    can be easily overcome using lightweight protocols [24]. Borsatti summarized that
    MQTT employs three levels of QoS, which may affect the latency in information
    transmission. So, the selection of QoS level must be done carefully depending
    on the nature of the IoT application [25]. Alharby observed that security procedures
    significantly lower the effectiveness of IoT devices. The power consumption begins
    to increase along with increasing levels of security. The provision must be available
    to the network designers to select the level of security according to their IoT
    application. Further, the scope is available to develop the system to evaluate
    and balance the security and quality of service [26]. From the given literature
    survey, we can conclude that the protocols used for messaging provides a straightforward
    channel for the resource-constrained network devices to deliver the data to other
    devices in the network. The IoT is one of the developing technologies. The IoT
    devices are resource constrained which is one of the limitations for data transmission
    in IoT network [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. So, there is a requirement to propose new
    protocols to fulfill the current needs and limitations. To fulfill such requirements
    the messaging protocols such as MQTT, CoAP etc. have been proposed. MQTT protocol
    offers three levels of QoS for various categories of data traffic classes. However,
    since the publisher sends data to subscribers via a broker, the flow of messages
    between MQTT subscribers and MQTT publishers is still uncontrolled. Data delivery
    delays and packet losses may increase in the absence of safe and secure data/message
    flow. [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. In this paper the deep neural network based
    approach is used for secure communication through MQTT protocol in the resource
    constrained IoT environment. 3 Existing system MQTT aspires to be simple, open,
    lightweight, and capable of extravagant data transmission, making it a strong
    competitor for gadget exchanges in constrained circumstances. It''s a well-known
    Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS). MQTT is an office/membership
    informing convention that is particularly well-suited to IoT. Its primary distinguishing
    feature is unshakable quality since it operates over Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP) or comparable conventions with similar characteristics: demanded lossless
    and bidirectional interchanges. It has a contention, like the other tuning/membership
    conventions, that is basically based on the design: the traded records are reviewed
    using increasingly pre-arranged subjects with the end goal that each message is
    associated to an article. Then, and only then, are messages more successfully
    focused to areas that are relevant to the underlying issue. The client can act
    as both a distributor and a supporter, sending information to a certain theme
    and receiving information from a specific subject [27, 28]. Broker programming
    on the application server that intervenes between clients. It plays out the assignments
    of laying out an association, confirming and making a client meeting, getting,
    and communicating information to specific vertices, controlling, and keeping up
    with the meeting, and delivering the lightweight (LWT) messages. Topix is a string
    utilized by the specialist to channel and course information between clients.
    It is a various leveled tree, isolated by cuts ‘/’, which stores the URL or way
    in the Linux record framework. Span point of interaction to combine two representatives.
    It permits you to make a solitary conveyed network, comprising of nearby representatives
    associated with the trade. This instrument makes it conceivable to disseminate
    the heap on the organization and to make a reproduction of the servers. A proviso
    is all together, notwithstanding, in a light of the fact that most MQTT conventions
    don’t ensure privacy of the information sent. Login and secret word verification
    is upheld yet is communicated free. To take care of this issue, Secure Sockets
    Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) cryptographic organization conventions
    are utilized for encryption and endorsements for client and specialist distinguishing
    proof and confirmation [29,30,31,32,33] (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 General IoT system architecture
    Full size image The IoT, is a plan of interrelated enrolling devices, mechanical
    and automated machines, things, animals, or people which has unique identifier
    can move the data over the network without hoping the human to human or human-to-machine
    data transmission. The IoT gateways receive the data collected by IoT devices,
    which is then either transferred to the cloud for analysis or locally examined.
    These devices occasionally converse with other similar devices and then go back
    to the data they exchanged earlier. The majority of the work is being carried
    out by the devices without human involvement, despite the fact that individuals
    can engage with them to set them up, assign rules, or retrieve data [16,17,18].
    In IoT, machine learning, or deep learning, can be used to forecast trends, identify
    anomalies, and enhance intelligence by ingesting image, video, and audio data.
    Some algorithms are listed below: 1. Logistic Regression: The LR is one of the
    classification methods that uses the sigmoid function to determine the likelihood
    of a class being present. The values of sigmoid function are fitted by using the
    gradient descent criterion. 2. K Nearest Neighbors: The records density is used
    in this class approach to label a new instance. It computes the K Nearest Neighbors
    (KNN) and the number of samples for each elegance to assess the elegance membership.
    3. Decision Trees: The DT rules are implemented by regularly splitting the dataset
    in such a way that maximizes pattern separation. The personal split necessitates
    optimizing the entropy reduction at each split. 4. Deep Neural Network: The main
    building block of the Deep Neural Networks is a multi-layered structure, each
    of whose neurons connected to the neurons of the neighboring layers. The weights
    of each connection and the activation feature parameters are adjusted throughout
    instruction using the minimizing error criterion. In the proposed system, the
    Deep Neural Network approach is used for evaluating the QoS parameters of MQTT
    communication in IoT applications. In this paper, the deep neural network is designed
    with four hidden layers. 4 Proposed methodology 4.1 MQTT communication The data
    has been continuously recorded in an Excel sheet at both publisher and subscriber
    ends. The data, based on the packet loss and time to deliver the data, is extracted,
    and then statistical features are calculated. Then, using a deep neural network,
    the system evaluates the parameters in the transmitter dataset, the tx date and
    tx time have been recorded as the data transmission date and data transmission
    time, respectively. In the receiver dataset, the tx date, tx time, rx date, and
    rx time have been recorded as data transmission date, data transmission time,
    data receiver date, and data receiver time, respectively. The proposed system
    uses the two-way authentication scheme depicted in the block diagram (Fig. 5)
    to verify the data authorization. In MQTT communication, a publisher distributes
    messages to specific bloggers based on topics. The broker serves as a switchboard,
    receiving messages from publishers along with topics and forwarding them to subscribers
    interested in those topics. A subscriber, receives communication from connected
    brokers and topics. An MQTT broker can handle the millions of simultaneously connected
    MQTT clients based on implementation. The broker is mainly responsible for receiving
    the messages, monitoring them, deciding who the subscriber to every message is,
    and then delivering the messages to the clients who have subscribed to the related
    topics. An MQTT broker acts as a server that delivers the messages received from
    the publishers (clients) to corresponding subscribers (clients). The clients are
    the devices that run the MQTT libraries and are connected to the broker through
    the network. Before sending messages to subscribers, an MQTT broker filters these
    messages based on their topic. As the MQTT protocol supports the publish-subscribe
    communication model, clients publish and subscribe to the topics through the broker.
    Although MQTT can use other bi-directional transports, its primary mode of transport
    is IP (Internet Protocol). Publishers and subscribers are not connected directly
    to each other. They always communicate with each other through an intermediary
    called a broker. They are entirely not aware of the existence of the other. The
    broker filters the messages received from the publisher and distributes them to
    the appropriate subscribers. All the clients can publish and subscribe to the
    service. The broker does not store the messages. While the MQTT client is connected
    to the server, publications can go in both directions. The publications are provided
    by the client when data is published there. Publishing aims to provide the right
    content to the right audience at the right moment. As businesses become increasingly
    data-driven, IoT will aid in the construction of information marketplaces that
    will provide the appropriate content. A subscriber may receive communications
    from multiple publishers on the same or different themes. A subscriber requests
    to receive messages on a particular topic. The agents represent the beginning
    and end of a conversation with this protocol are the publisher and the subscriber.
    The MQTT client that transmits the message is known as the publisher, while the
    MQTT client that receives the message is known as the subscriber. For these distributed
    applications, Publish/Subscribe communications deliver rapid event alerts. The
    Publish Subscribe method enables event-driven architectures and asynchronous parallel
    processing, improving scalability, performance, and reliability. Information is
    effectively disseminated to interested parties using the Publish/Subscribe communication
    model. The publish/subscribe server reduces network bandwidth by up to 50% by
    retransmitting information only once from the publisher to subscribers [27, 28]
    (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Communication architecture in MQTT Full size image 4.2 System
    architecture In communication, it is necessary to keep the transmitted data secure
    and confidential. Although MQTT protocol communication is secured by TLS/SSL cryptographic
    protocols, its authentication remains poor (Fig. 4). Hence, MQTT is not one of
    the most secure protocols. To enhance the security of IoT systems, MQTT needs
    additional features to protect against vulnerabilities. There is a need to modify
    the protocol to enhance authentication. One way to ensure the security of MQTT
    is through using encryption algorithms on the application level. In this paper,
    a 2-way authentication scheme is implemented in the application layer of MQTT,
    as shown in the block diagram (Fig. 5). Fig. 4 System architecture Full size image
    Fig. 5 Flow chart diagram Full size image An algorithm of proposed methodology
    is as given below: Dataset: The data recorded at the transmitter side is presented
    in Table 2. At transmitter side data transmission data and time is recorded. At
    receiver side data transmission date, transmission time, receiving date, receiving
    time, data received and weather the received data is authorized or not is recorded.
    Table 2 Logged data at the transmitter end Full size table A deep neural network
    is developed and used to evaluate the QoS parameters. It classifies the attack
    and suggests corrective measures. The neural network takes the features from the
    data collected from subscribers and publishers to predict results. Various algorithms
    such as: SVM, decision tree, and random forest applied to the collected data.
    The data collected at the transmitter and receiver end is recorded in the Excel
    sheet. The Table 3 represents the data recorded at the receiver side. Table 3
    Logged data at the receiver end Full size table In this research, a motor monitoring
    and control application (as shown in Fig. 6) is used. It consists of a temperature
    sensor, fire sensor, and vibration sensor. The data from the sensor is fed to
    the microcontroller to get the sensor readings. The microcontroller sends data
    to the MQTT publisher for data transmission purposes. The first task of the publisher
    is to read data from the sensor. Then, assign the device ID to it. Then, encrypt
    the data by using the public key. Then it sends data to the broker. The broker
    receives the data and transmits the data received from the publisher to the subscriber
    via the MQTT protocol. The subscriber receives the data and tries to decrypt it.
    If the data decrypted properly and comes from a trusted user, the subscriber passes
    the data to the microcontroller to activate the actuator. The data at the publisher
    and subscriber ends is recorded continuously in an Excel sheet. Then, this data
    based on data packet loss and time to deliver data is extracted, and then statistical
    features are calculated. Then, using a deep neural network, the system predicts
    the evaluation parameters. Fig. 6 Motor monitoring and control application (IoT
    application) Full size image The process of getting the numerical features from
    raw data, which stores the information in its original form during this processing,
    is called feature extraction. It gives better results than implementing machine
    learning directly on raw data. The statistical parameters, by definition, are
    linked to the major properties of the probability law-based distribution of random
    variables, such as mean, variance, etc. As a result, the methods for estimating
    the parameters are inextricably related to the computation of these quantities’
    estimates (which are also random variables). A neural network is a collection
    of algorithms that tries to identify the basic relationships in a batch of data
    through a technique that works like a human brain. Neural networks, in this case,
    introduce a system consisting of neurons, which can be either artificial or organic
    in nature. Parameter assessment is the process of mapping between formal and actual
    parameters when a subprogram is called; it also determines the data that controls
    the parameters’ transmission. The following are the steps followed in the developed
    system: 1. A broker is initialized. 2. The publisher and subscribers are initialized.
    3. Hardware pins are initialized at the subscriber and publisher end. 4. The readings
    from the sensors are extracted using the device ID. 5. Data is encrypted at the
    publisher end using the key and sent to the broker. 6. The broker transfers this
    data to the receiver, who then checks it and determines whether decryption of
    that data is possible. 7. If data decryption is possible, the data will match
    the device ID. 8. If data decryption is possible, the data matches with a device
    ID and actuators are activated as a result of data decryption process. 9. If data
    decryption is not possible, the data will reject. 5 Result and discussion The
    Motor monitoring and control application is used to test the developed algorithm.
    In this IoT application, three sensors, namely fire, temperature, and vibration
    sensors, are connected to three actuators, namely the motor, water pump, and fan.
    These sensors and actuators communicate through the MQTT protocol. MQTT publisher
    reads the sensor data and sends it to the broker. The broker then sends this data
    to the MQTT subscribers and then the actuators will be actuated accordingly. To
    ensure secure and seamless communication two-way authentication for MQTT communication
    has been implemented. A deep neural network with four hidden layers has been used
    to evaluate the multiple QoS parameters of MQTT communication in IoT applications.
    The system evaluates QoS parameters such as delay, data loss, packet loss, authentication,
    and unauthorized access to data. The system has implemented authentication twice
    to secure data transfers and can detect suspicious activity through a neural network.
    The system identified the suspicious activities using three classes: authentication,
    unauthorized devices, and unauthorized data publishers. The confusion matrix is
    as shown in Fig. 7. The system’s performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix,
    and the results are as shown in Fig. 11. The accuracy of the developed system
    is 99.97%. The confusion matrix is created by plotting true values against predicted
    values (Figs. 8, 9, 10). The confusion matrix displays three classes: authentication,
    unauthorized data publisher, and unauthorized device publisher. Figure 11 represents
    the performance of the developed system. The accuracy for authentication is 99.98%,
    for unauthorized data publication is 99.97%, and for unauthorized devices is 99.98%.
    The overall accuracy of the system is 99.97%. The developed system evaluates the
    performance as well as security-related QoS parameters. As a deep neural network
    has applied to the data logged at the publisher and subscriber end, the system
    evaluates the performance parameters like Delay, Data loss, Packet loss, etc.

    IoT comprises three main elements: computation, communication, and network-connected
    things. Evaluating the performance and quality of IoT systems involves assessing
    the QoS, which is a critical factor. Due to the significant impact of security
    breaches on IoT systems, evaluating QoS parameters for IoT applications is essential.
    To ensure secure and confidential data transmission in communication, MQTT needs
    to add extra features to enhance security and prevent vulnerabilities that could
    harm IoT systems. Hence, the 2-way authentication scheme is applied in the application
    layer of MQTT, which provides additional authentication for sending the data from
    sender to receiver in a secure environment. If any misactivity or security breach
    occurs, then system will detect it through the designed neural network. The neural
    network is designed to maximize accuracy in classifying security breaches in industrial
    IoT environments, such as authenticated data, unauthorized data, and data from
    unauthorized devices. In this paper, the motor monitoring and control application
    is utilized to evaluate QoS parameters and detect security breaches. The system
    can detect security breaches and evaluate QoS parameters of various IoT applications
    used in industries. The system provides better security and higher accuracy than
    existing systems. In the future, the scope is available for the development of
    a single system for the evaluation of QoS parameters and the detection of security
    breaches in the communication of multiple protocols like MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, and
    XMPP. Data availability statement My manuscript has no associated data. References

    paper PDF 1 Introduction Recent advancements in automation systems and the integration
    of Internet of Things(IoT) technology are revolutionizing maritime operations.
    This has enabled the development of new types of ship operations, including smart
    ships, remote operating ships, and digital twin ships [1, 2]. Recognizing these
    technological strides, the International Maritime Organization(IMO) has been actively
    engaging in discussions around the safe operation of autonomous ships. In 2018,
    the IMO introduced the concept of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships(MASS), defining
    them as vessels capable of navigating surface waters with minimal or no human
    intervention. They further categorized these into four stages, based on the degree
    of automation [3]. This recognition signifies the growing interest in leveraging
    autonomous technologies for enhancing maritime operations. As the MASS concept
    gains traction, addressing the legal and operational safety regulations for autonomous
    ship operations becomes imperative. The IMO has begun discussions to establish
    comprehensive guidelines to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of these
    vessels. Such regulations play a crucial role in creating a robust framework for
    autonomous ship operations, while also mitigating potential risks and concerns
    [4]. In this paper, designing platforms that bridge data and functions between
    ships and onshore is crucial. Such platforms allow efficient data management,
    real-time monitoring, and informed decision-making, thereby improving the safety,
    operation-al efficiency, and performance of autonomous maritime operations [5].
    The wireless communication technology of ships is being developed in various forms,
    from satellite communication to short-range communication [6]. However, due to
    the nature of the ship''s wireless communication, communication coverage problems
    or Line of Sight(LoS) problems may cause unstable communication connections. We
    propose an MQTT-based communication method, designed to ensure real-time reconnection
    after periods of communication instability between ships and onshore. 2 Related
    Work The recent decade has seen a considerable focus on the fusion of Information
    Technology(IT) and Internet of Things(IoT) technologies in the maritime field,
    primarily aimed at automating ship navigation and machinery control. An essential
    aspect of autonomous ship operation is collision avoidance. Consequently, numerous
    studies have strived to develop robust algorithms, guidance systems, and controls
    to address this challenge [7, 8]. Furthermore, the sector is leveraging IoT technology
    to share and analyze data, aiming to tackle prevalent issues in maritime operations
    [9]. 2.1 Ship Automation System Ship automation systems can be broadly divided
    into two main components: The Integrated Navigation System(INS) responsible for
    navigation and the Control and Monitoring System(CAMS) responsible for control
    and monitoring of various systems of the ship. Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual
    structure where ship automation systems are linked with the cloud. The IEC 61924–2
    standard defines the requirements and test methods for the operation and performance
    of INS [10]. CAMS, functions as a ship''s Distributed Control System (DCS), is
    crucial for the comprehensive control and monitoring of the ship''s control systems.
    In the past, CAMS on container carriers were relatively straightforward, focusing
    mainly on navigation and cargo control. However, with the advent of multifunctional
    eco-friendly vessels, such as LNG carriers, electric propulsion ships, and Dual
    Fuel engines, the control duties of CAMS have become increasingly complex and
    diverse [11]. Fig. 1. Conceptual diagram of ship automation system and cloud service
    Full size image To cope with these advancements, research efforts have been devoted
    to establishing an environment that enables the rapid and secure development of
    these sophisticated ships and control technologies using digital twin technology
    [12]. Additionally, studies are underway to integrate and optimize systems through
    virtual simulation environments [13]. For these research activities to yield practical
    results and be applied to real ships, a real-time data platform capable of seamlessly
    connecting and managing ship data is indispensable. 2.2 Ship Data Platform Various
    studies have been carried out to contribute to the development of autonomous ships
    by focusing on the collection of ship data onshore and the establishment of a
    data platform. In [14], research investigates the application of IoT technologies
    in unmanned ships, specifically intelligent recognition, sensor fusion, and communication.
    This study proposes an E-Navigation structure that interlinks the ship with onshore
    systems. In [15], suggests a Machine-Type Communication Framework, facilitating
    communication between peripheral ships or clouds through short-range or broadband
    connections. This is directed at developing the functional elements of MASS. The
    field of ship IoT technologies has advanced significantly, allowing for research
    to be conducted on implementing autonomous ship functions based on IoT technologies.
    However, the actualization of fully autonomous ships necessitates detailed investigations
    on how ship systems will operate within scalable cloud-based platforms that use
    IoT technologies. The research in [16] illustrates the complexities involved in
    deploying cloud-based ship IoT solutions. Cloud platforms are extensively utilized
    to develop large-scale IoT environments, offering advantages such as scalability,
    flexibility, security, and availability. In [17], major cloud-based IoT platforms
    like AWS IoT, Azure IoT, Watson IoT, PTC ThingWorx, and Google IoT are identified.
    The study confirms that these public clouds provide the necessary functions to
    build large-scale IoT environments. Among these platforms, AWS IoT is the most
    commonly used public cloud and has extensive references and ongoing research focusing
    on designing and implementing structures based on specific applications and purposes
    [18, 19]. Rules for accessing ship machinery and equipment data are currently
    being standardized and are in the draft document for the NP stage [20]. However,
    a wider data collection is necessary for MASS. As per [21], the Ship Software
    Logging System(SSLS), which documents the ship software version and operational
    status, has been standardized. The standardization of ship data management will
    continue to be explored on a cloud basis [22]. In [23] emphasizes the crucial
    role of Software Quality Assurance(SQA) performed alongside the development of
    ship technology. 3 Design of Data Platform The design of a cloud-based data platform
    holds significant importance in facilitating efficient data management and analysis
    in MASS. In this section, we will discuss the proposed cloud-based autonomous
    shipping platform, which comprises six layers. Moreover, we will focus on the
    design elements, which are instrumental in building the proposed envisioned platform.
    3.1 IoT-Based Cloud Data Platform This paper proposes a six-layered system architecture
    for a cloud-based data platform: The Application Layer, Data Exchange Layer, Data
    Process Layer, Integration Layer, Process Layer, and Instrument Layer, as depicted
    in Fig. 2. The system architecture design aims to achieve integrated collection
    and management of ship data from various sources. It provides users and machines
    with professional and accurate data services necessary for autonomous operations
    through data analysis, ship-to-ship data exchange, and the utilization of digital
    twin technology. The Application Layer serves as a configuration for data collection,
    analysis, and display. The Data Exchange Layer manages secure transmission of
    data between ships and onshore or between ships using certificate-based encrypted
    MQTT communication. The Data Process Layer handles the storage and distribution
    of data collected from lower layers or generated by upper layers. Onshore management
    ensures scalability for storing data from multiple ships and maintains the data''s
    lifecycle for sustainability. The Integration Layer integrates and operates the
    data generated and processed by each module, enabling the fusion of functions
    crucial for ship operations. Onshore acts as the INS and CAMS creating a digital
    twin environment that accurately describes and predicts the ship''s operating
    conditions based on real and simulated data. Fig. 2. Six-tier architecture for
    ship data and service interworking Full size image The Process Layer consists
    of modules that perform ship functions by interacting with sensors or actuators
    in the Instrument Layer. Onshore should generate equivalent data as the ship''s
    Process Layer modules through the Simulation Platform. Harmonizing with the Hardware-in-the-Loop
    Simulation (HILS) or Model-in-the-Loop Simulation (MILS) of the Instrument Layer,
    environments, models, and scenarios are configured to generate data similar to
    the actual ship environment. Compliance with established rules is essential for
    interconnecting the platform and data within the Integration Layer. 3.2 Ship Collision
    Avoidance The Integration Layer in the ship''s architecture is configured based
    on the INS and CAMS. Figure 3 the operational flowchart shows the real-time collection
    of planned route and navigation data from nearby ships using a data platform.
    The use of tools and technologies such as AIS, RADAR, GPS, cameras, Lidar, and
    others facilitates environment recognition to ensure collision avoidance. In the
    past, only a single planned route was used, but in autonomous ships, various routes
    are generated, including collision-avoidance regional routes to prevent collisions
    and economically optimized routes created onshore or by remote sources. ECDIS
    must prioritize delivering these routes to the TCS. Since the utmost priority
    is to operate without accidents, the collision avoidance route is given precedence,
    followed by the planned route determined by the navigator, and then the economically
    optimized route generated from onshore sources. ECDIS determines which route to
    operate through the Route Priority Check, collecting data to detect collision
    risks and assess potential collisions based on the chosen route. Because MASS
    is currently in the research phase, the Route Priority Check should be flexible
    according to the degree of autonomous. The data platform plays an instrumental
    role in providing planned routes and real-time navigation data from surrounding
    ships. The presence of nearby ships is identified by receiving Automatic Identification
    System(AIS) data, which is a legal requirement for vessels. Ships publish their
    planned navigation routes and navigation data to the data platform using the Maritime
    Mobile Service Identity(MMSI) as a topic. This allows the platform to collect
    and provide this information to subscribed ships simultaneously. Fig. 3. Collision
    avoidance flowchart of INS equipment associated with data platforms Full size
    image 3.3 Architecture of Onboard Edge The edge devices installed on ships fulfill
    the roles of the Application Layer, Data Exchange Layer, and Data Process Layer.
    Figure 4 demonstrates a module and data flowchart for an edge device responsible
    for these functions. The Transform component plays a vital role in converting
    the data model used on ships into a format compatible with the platform''s time
    series data model. Due to variations in equipment manufacturers and data types
    across different ship types, this conversion process is necessary as it ensures
    uniformity in accessing data from the platform. The transformed time series data
    is both displayed to users through the onboard Frontend and stored in a database.
    The Data Receiver component is responsible for receiving the data and forwarding
    it to the Integration Layer, while the Command Control component scrutinizes and
    delivers control commands based on authority and the prevailing conditions. Each
    module within the edge device is designed following the Micro Services Architecture(MSA)
    structure, allowing selective usage of onboard web services based on the ship''s
    specific requirements. This MSA architecture offers flexibility in utilizing different
    hardware configurations for the edge device [24]. Fig. 4. Edge architecture to
    interface with the cloud Full size image 3.4 MQTT-Based Retransmission Method
    To ensure real-time transmission of periodically generated ship data to the cloud,
    certificate-based encrypted MQTT communication is employed. However, due to the
    use of satellite communication by ships, there may be instances where the connection
    is unstable, and communication may be interrupted for several hours when entering
    shaded areas. To address this issue, the MQTT protocol offers QoS (Quality of
    Service) and Persistence session functions. QoS ensures reliable transmission
    of data. QoS0 transmits data once, QoS1 sends data at least once, and QoS2 ensures
    data is sent exactly once. QoS1 and QoS2 messages that occur during disconnection
    are stored in a queue, and upon reconnection, transmission resumes based on the
    QoS mechanism. Nevertheless, it''s important to note that if the communication
    is disrupted for an extended period, real-time data transmission may be delayed
    due to the lengthy retransmission time required by QoS1 and QoS2 to ensure ordered
    transmission. For periodically generated time series data, the total delivery
    delay time \\({TD}^{tot}\\) to the cloud service can be defined as follows: $${TD}^{tot}={TD}^{tr}+{TD}^{ag}+{TD}^{se}+{TD}^{cl}$$
    (1) \\({TD}^{tr}\\): Transformer delay, which involves data model transformation,
    is relatively small as it mostly consists of processing time. \\({TD}^{ag}\\):
    Aggregator delay is determined by user-defined period \\({P}^{ud}\\), as data
    is calculated and transmitted periodically based on aggregation functions. \\({TD}^{se}\\):
    Sender delay represents the time required to transmit data to the cloud using
    the QoS1 mechanism. \\({TD}^{cl}\\): Cloud delay represents the time needed to
    deliver the service based on the cloud service configuration. As the Transformer
    delay and Cloud delay are related to wired communication and processing time,
    they can be approximated as Eq. 2 when communication is unstable. The user-defined
    period \\({P}^{ud}\\) can be set in seconds, and \\({D}^{us}\\) is data stored
    without being transmitted during a period of communication loss. Equation 3 explains
    the time delay with QoS1 of sender for sending data at time t, where Nus refers
    to the total number of unsent data at that time and α means processing time for
    handling queue. If the message queue contains many unsent messages due to prolonged
    communication interruption, it may take a significant amount of time for all messages
    to be transmitted. $${TD}^{tot}={TD}^{ag}\\left({P}^{ud}\\right)+{TD}^{se}\\left({D}^{us}\\right)$$
    (2) $${TD}^{se}={\\sum }_{n=1}^{n={N}^{us}}\\left(RTT\\left({D}_{t-n}\\right)+\\alpha
    \\right)$$ (3) In this study, we address potential delays in data transmission
    as follows: QoS1 is employed for data transmission until a disconnection is detected.
    Upon detecting a disconnection, the application stores the unsent data and sends
    it separately to prevent any adverse effect on real-time data transmission. Figure
    5 shows the sequence diagram of the proposed packet slicing transmission method.
    To optimize the transmission process, the ReSender component updates the maximum
    payload function \\({f}^{mp}\\) based on the time taken by previously sent payloads.
    This allows for the calculation of the maximum payload that can be sent within
    a given time interval \\({T}^{in}\\) using the \\({f}^{mp}\\) function. Given
    that time-series data is generated periodically, the size of the payload can be
    minimized. This is achieved by representing multi-time domain data using only
    the start time and period information for each distinct time interval. After the
    real-time data Dt is transmitted, the remaining time interval \\({T}^{in}\\) is
    utilized to transmit the multi-time data \\({D}^{mt}\\). Fig. 5. Sequence diagram
    of packet slicing transmission method Full size image 4 Implementation and Simulation
    4.1 Implementation with AWS Cloud Architecture Fig. 6. Platform architecture consisting
    of AWS Component Full size image The architecture, shown in Fig. 6, was designed
    using various AWS Cloud components. The proposed Edge Server structure was implemented
    on Edge devices using AWS Greengrass, an edge runtime environment. We containerized
    the web service frontend and backend, and utilized Elastic Container Registry(ECR),
    a managed container image registry service, for registration and distribution.
    This allowed for improved scalability and flexibility in the cloud, with operations
    conducted on the serverless container engine service, Fargate, and on the Edge,
    employing the Docker engine. Real-time data collected through IoT Core was processed
    using Lambda, a serverless computing service, and directed to the Rule Engine
    based on the specified topic for Extract, Transform, Load(ETL) processing. To
    validate the consistency of data collection between the ship and the onshore,
    we employed a ship operation simulator. By simulating ship operations and generating
    periodically changing simulation data on the edge, we could verify the coherence
    of the collected data. Figure 7 illustrates the interface where ship navigation
    data is collected and displayed on the WEB GIS service. Through this setup, we
    could collect and monitor real-time AIS information, track the location and navigation
    details of ships. Figure 8 presents the results of the simulation data collection,
    highlighting data consistency. The left side portrays the data trends accessed
    through Edge Web Services, while the right side illustrates the data trends accessed
    and confirmed through the cloud-based web service. Fig. 7. WEB GIS Interface for
    Vessel Navigation Data Verification Full size image Fig. 8. Data consistency check
    interface between ship and onshore Full size image 4.2 Simulation of Retransmission
    Method In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed retransmission method,
    we utilized end-to-end delay values for QoS1 in a 3G wireless environment, as
    reported in [24], as our simulation data. The simulations revealed a delay of
    approximately 0.5 s for a payload of 1000 and around 0.8 s for a payload of 16000.
    Considering that each tag has a length of about 10 bytes, we assumed the aggregation
    and generation of 100 tags per second, resulting in a total of 60 s required to
    detect network disconnection. The simulation results are presented in Fig. 9.
    The conventional method, which solely relied on MQTT QoS1, demonstrated a linear
    increase in delay in line with the FIFO principle, as the quantity of unsent data
    piled up in the queue with the duration of the disconnection. On the other hand,
    the proposed method utilizes the QoS1 queue only until the timeout is recognized.
    This strategy effectively curtails the accumulation of messages in the queue,
    thereby managing the delay. Furthermore, by employing a compression technique
    that converts multiple data into a multi-time domain with a compression rate of
    approximately 70%, we can send three compressed \\({D}^{mt}\\) from \\({T}^{in}\\).
    This approach enables a reduction of approximately 34.6% in the time required
    to transmit all data, compared to the conventional method. Fig. 9. Simulation
    results of existing and proposed methods Full size image 5 Conclusion The paper
    highlights the significance of establishing platforms for MASS and propose 6-layer
    architecture. These platforms facilitate efficient data management, real-time
    monitoring, and well-informed decision-making, all of which contribute significantly
    to the overall success of autonomous maritime operations. Additionally, the paper
    proposes an MQTT-based communication method to assure reliable and real-time connectivity
    between vessels and the onshore platform. This method improves real-time by mitigating
    data delay issues in unstable wireless communication environments. The implementation
    and evaluation of the proposed data platform and MQTT communication method were
    conducted using AWS Cloud, demonstrating their feasibility and effectiveness.
    By addressing crucial aspects such as data integration, collision avoidance, real-time
    connectivity, and communication resilience, this paper contributes to the development
    and implementation of comprehensive solutions aimed at enhancing MASS. In future
    work, we will continue to investigate the implementation and performance evaluation
    of essential functions required for MASS via the platform. References Wróbel,

    along with resources may be distributed across numerous diverse places as well
    as accessed by different industries. As well, the internet of things (IoT) has
    pointedly upgraded since cloud computing was combined. Cloud computing is becoming
    a viable technological and financial option for supporting both real-time along
    with non-real-time data in an IoT environment. However, the cloud rapid shift
    brought up a several security issues. Old security actions don't instantly spread
    over to cloud-rooted systems along with can be inadequate. The online monitoring
    of security attacks is addressed in this work, and several machines learning along
    with deep learning algorithms. Additionally, a few cryptographic-related authentication
    methods are explored. This paper identifies key research needs in the IoT-based
    cloud architecture after presenting the technological obstacles noted in the earlier
    studies. This paper presents future research prospects to avoid and mitigate cybersecurity

    Air pollution has become a global issue due to rapid urbanization and industrialization.
    Bad air quality is Europe’s most significant environmental health risk, causing
    serious health problems. External air pollution is not the only issue; internal
    air pollution is just as severe and can also lead to adverse health outcomes.
    IoT is a practical approach for monitoring and publishing real-time air quality
    information. Numerous IoT-based air quality monitoring systems have been proposed
    using micro-sensors for data collection. These systems are designed for outdoor
    air quality monitoring. They use sensors to measure air quality parameters such
    as 𝐶 𝑂 2 , 𝐶𝑂 , 𝑃 𝑀 10 , 𝑁 𝑂 2 , temperature, and humidity. The data are acquired
    with a set of sensors placed on an electric car. They are then sent to the server.
    Users can subscribe to the list and receive information about local pollution.
    This system allows real-time localized air quality monitoring and sending data
    to customers. The work additionally presents a secure data transmission protocol
    ensuring system security. This protocol provides system-wide attack resiliency
    and interception, which is what existing solutions do not offer. Keywords: IoT;
    wireless cloud system; air pollution environment protection 1. Introduction This
    paper is an extended version of our conference paper: “Air pollution monitoring
    and information distribution system”, Proceedings of the CORES and IP&C Conferences
    2023 [1]. Rapid urbanisation and industrialisation have given rise to a global
    issue of air pollution. Exceeding recommended national limits is a common issue
    faced by many countries. Moreover, it should be emphasised that there are studies
    that suggest no level of exposure to single pollutants below which adverse health
    effects are not seen [2]. Bad air quality’s most significant environmental health
    risk significantly impacts Europe’s population. Bad air quality is known to cause
    various health problems, like lower respiratory infections, trachea, bronchus,
    lung cancers, ischemic heart diseases and strokes. Air pollutants can be divided
    into two categories: internal (indoor) and external (outdoor) air pollutants [3].
    Air pollution that affects the entire atmosphere is called outdoor air pollution.
    This pollution type is caused by various air pollutants emitted into the atmosphere
    from sources such as automobiles, chemical industries and the burning of fossil
    fuels. Such pollutants mainly consist of carbon monoxide 𝐶𝑂 , ozone 𝑂 3 , nitrogen
    oxides 𝑁 𝑂 𝑥 , sulfur dioxide 𝑆 𝑂 2 , and particulate matter of diverse particle
    measures [4]. According to the WHO [5], the number of ambient air pollution-attributable
    deaths in 2019 exceeded 4,100,000 worldwide, 500,000 in Europe and 36,000 in Poland.
    It should be emphasised that internal air pollution is as severe a problem as
    outdoor air pollution. Air pollution classified as indoor can be found in buses,
    metro, offices, hospitals, schools, libraries, etc. [6]. One common source of
    internal air pollution is using polluting fuels and devices in households. Significant
    indoor air impurities are 𝑁 𝑂 𝑥 , 𝑆 𝑂 2 ,  𝑂 3 , 𝐶𝑂 , PM and microorganisms. Exposure
    to indoor air pollutants can result in harmful health outcomes. Household air
    pollution deaths 2019 exceeded 3,200,000 worldwide and 150,000 in Europe [7].
    Since air pollution is a critical global issue, creating a system for monitoring
    and publishing real-time air-grade knowledge seems reasonable. The Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) is an approach that can be a suitable and effective solution to this issue.
    The IoT is a network that collects vast doses of data from diverse devices connected
    to more extensive schemes. The data gathered by this network are converted into
    useful information. More detailed knowledge about IoT can be found in [8]. The
    main contributions of this paper are as follows: project of an IoT system for
    air pollution monitoring, use of a data transmission security protocol, adaptation
    of MQTT and Amelia protocols for securing communication, automated and informal
    security analysis of the Amelia protocol adaptation. 2. Related Works In literature,
    many IoT-based monitoring systems use micro-sensors for data gathering [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].
    It should be mentioned that there are studies that propose a system for both internal
    and external air pollution, e.g., [9]. This work studies an IoT-based system implemented
    in a university area. The platform proposed in [9] offers individual course monitoring
    established on Wi-Fi tracking. Environmental monitoring refers to observing and
    measuring the environment to gather information about its condition and any changes
    that may occur. It involves using various tools and techniques to collect data
    on factors such as air quality, water quality, soil conditions, and weather patterns.
    The data collected through this process is used to identify potential environmental
    issues and to inform decisions regarding the management and protection of the
    natural environment. The system allows measuring multiple ecological parameters
    such as noise level, light, temperature, humidity, 𝐶𝑂 and 𝑁 𝑂 2 concentration.
    The monitoring system proposed in this paper is built based on the MiCS-4514 MicroElectroMechanicalSensor
    (MEMS) and popular hardware—Raspberry Pi and Arduino, which has a shallow level
    of safety data transmission. Most studies focus only on one type of air pollution:
    indoor [10,11,12] or outdoor [13,14,15,16,17]. One of the examples of the former
    can be found in [10]. This research proposes a real-time monitoring procedure
    for gauging ambient air quality, which is low-cost, portable and based on IoT
    without transmission protection. The detection unit measures air grade elements
    such as 𝐶 𝑂 2 , 𝐶𝑂 , 𝑃 𝑀 10 , 𝑁 𝑂 2 using the sensors GP2Y1010AU, MH-Z14, MICS-4514
    and DHT22. Another low-cost IoT system for real-time indoor air quality monitoring,
    without transmission protection, is proposed in [11]. This system uses the ESP8266
    module as an analysing and transmission unit and the MICS-6814 detector as a sensing
    unit. Such a sensor allows for collecting data about a few air rate notes, such
    as 𝐶𝑂 , 𝑁 𝑂 2 , 𝐶 3 𝐻 8 (propane), 𝐶 4 𝐻 10 (butane), 𝐶 𝐻 4 (methane), 𝐻 2 (hydrogen).
    Moreover, the system provides mobile software for constant announcements. Therefore,
    the user is alerted when the concentration of gases is exceeded. An attractive
    indoor air quality monitoring study is presented in [12]. The motivation for this
    research was that during the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent a lot of time in
    indoor environments. This paper proposes low-cost IoT sensor networks for indoor
    air quality assessment with standard unprotected data transmission. The presented
    system uses Plantower PMS5003 𝑃𝑀 sensors deployed in four rooms (bedroom, living
    room, kitchen and office). Based on the data collected in the experiment, it was
    concluded that 𝑃𝑀 levels exceeded WHO 2021 annual ambient particulate concentration
    guidelines in all rooms. An example of a system monitoring outdoor air pollution
    is proposed in [13]. In this work, the authors presented the innovation and implementation
    of an IoT detector instrument. Sensors adopted in this approach were both fixed
    and moving IoT sensor devices. To build the real-time air quality monitoring IoT
    sensing network, authors used i.a. Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi, GPS Sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, microdust sensor and carbon dioxide sensor. It should be
    mentioned that this study adopted a machine learning technique to design an air
    quality prediction model. A prototype of a low-cost IoT system for Air Quality
    Index (AQI) monitoring is proposed in [14]. This paper used a Raspberry Pi module,
    a low-cost PM sensor, and some environmental detectors to measure diverse parameters
    such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. Moreover, the same three-layered
    hierarchical distributed architecture for traffic flow monitoring was used. In
    the paper, [15], a Markov chain-based IoT approach is created to monitor, analyse
    and predict metropolitan air quality. The offered system is merged with an automobile
    to collect air quality data. As the microcontroller board, the authors used an
    Arduino Mini Pro. The sensing system operates an MQ2 gas sensor for counting 𝐶𝑂
    concentration and a GP2Y1010AU0F visual detector for 𝑃 𝑀 10 and 𝑃 𝑀 2.5 concentrations.
    Another air quality monitoring system employing IoT methods for outdoor air pollution
    is proposed in [16]. The authors used a low-power vast space network to transmit
    the real-time data collected by portable particle matter, humidity and temperature
    sensors. The data gathered in the urban area confirms the correlation of the 𝑃
    𝑀 2.5 concentration with many meteorological variables (e.g., the wind speed).
    An example of an IoT-based air pollution monitoring system can also be found in
    [17]. The system proposed by the authors employs multiple sensors (MQ135, MQ9
    and MQ2) capable of detecting various air pollutants or gases. Using these sensors
    in conjunction with ESP Microntoroller, they have created a system to monitor
    the collected data through the smartphone Blynk application with a standard security
    level. 3. Proposed IoT System 3.1. System Structure Air pollution can affect people’s
    life processes, deteriorate their health, and even cause death. In this case,
    air quality monitoring is a crucial part of daily life. The proposed system monitors
    air quality in some areas and alerts concerned locals to potential dangers. The
    system consists of four layers: data collection, end devices, central server and
    communication. Only autonomous vehicles (AVs) operate in the data collection layer
    [18]. These vehicles are equipped with air pollution sensors and high-performance
    computing servers. AVs move around specific urban areas to collect and process
    air quality data. The air pollution sensors communicate with servers via GSM modules.
    The processed data is automatically made available to customers through messages
    containing statistical data and a map of a given area with marked measurement
    points of air pollutant concentrations. After finishing AV work, they return to
    the base and connect with the central server to transmit all collected data. All
    IoT devices, like smartphones or tablets, work in the end devices layer. Users
    interested in air quality information can connect their devices and read shared
    information. Users should install a client application on their devices. The client
    application allows logging into the server and downloading air quality information.
    Figure 1 shows the air quality monitoring system’s main part structure that creates
    data collection and end device layers. Figure 1. Structure of air quality monitoring
    system main part. A central server works in the last system layer. This is also
    a high-performance computing server with different tasks than servers installed
    at AVs and with high memory resources. The central server manages all the work
    of autonomous vehicles through the server application. The first server’s task
    is defining routes where vehicles will move in a given area, and the server administrator
    can determine which streets will visit each car during the current route. The
    second server’s task is to collect and process all data about air quality. After
    finishing the route, AV must return to the base, connect to the central server,
    and send each collected information. Next, the central server will process each
    AV’s information, prepare statistics and charts, or determine dependencies. The
    third server’s task is to publish these statistics, charts or other summaries
    for the whole city on its website. Figure 1 summarises central server layer work.
    The communication layer controls and secures two types of communication: between
    AV and devices and between the central server and AV. For the first communication
    type, we use the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol [19,20]. This
    is a simple, secure and dependable data transmission protocol. Further, it is
    suitable for devices that can only communicate at a certain transmission speed.
    The MQTT supports and secures users’ (devices’) registration and authentication
    processes. Moreover, this protocol resists many attacks [20]. The MQTT base is
    the publish-and-subscribe model. The typical publish-and-subscribe model distinguishes
    three roles: Publisher, Subscriber and Broker. We assumed publisher, subscriber,
    main broker, and semi-broker roles in the proposed system. The main broker role
    performs the central server. It shares information about air quality in the whole
    surveyed area and Semi-Brokers in the network. In Semi-Brokers’ case, the Main-Broker
    shares information about the area they are visiting. The autonomous vehicle is
    a Publisher and Semi-Broker. The server installed in AV allows the performing
    of these two roles. AV collects data about pollution in a specific urban area.
    Next, the server processes them and publishes them for the user. Users can connect
    to the AV’s server to download information. The server publishes information on
    a specific topic, such as air quality on some street, the concentration of the
    selected substance in the air, or a mix of such information. Thus, the end device
    is a subscriber. It subscribes to a specific Publisher’s topic or topics. First,
    the user must connect to the Main-Broker to learn and subscribe to the appropriated
    Semi-Broker’s parameters. The user can connect to the nearest Semi-Broker or one
    of the Semi-Brokers in the network. In the first case, the Main-Broker will send
    them the parameters of the nearest Semi-Broker based on his geographical coordinates.
    In the second case, the user will choose one of the Semi-Brokers from the list
    in the application. We adopted the Amelia protocol mentioned in [21] for the second
    communication type. The protocol’s default version protects against false links
    to Internet events. The first phase of this protocol provides a user registration
    process with a trusted Distribution Centre. The second phase of this protocol
    provides the validation process of a link to an event with a trusted Authentication
    Centre. Further, during this phase, users received symmetric keys for further
    communication. We observed that the Amelia protocol is suitable for securing communication
    between AV and the central server, and we modified it. First, we combined a trusted
    Distribution Centre and Authentication Centre functionalities. The central server
    will generate necessary cryptographic objects, store information for communication
    and authenticate users (AVs, in the case of our solution). Hence, the scheme for
    the Amelia protocol’s registration phase in Alice–Bob notation will be as follows:
    𝛼 1 𝐴𝑉→𝐶𝑆: {𝑖(𝐴𝑉), 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 } 𝐾 + 𝐶𝑆 𝛼 2 𝐶𝑆→𝐴𝑉: {#ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ( {𝑈𝐼 𝐷 𝐴𝑉 ,𝑖(𝐴𝑉)} 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 ),
    𝑇 𝐴𝑉 𝐶𝑆 } 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 𝛼 3 𝐴𝑉→𝐶𝑆: { 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 𝐶𝑆 } 𝐾 + 𝐶𝑆 In this notation: {𝑀} 𝐾 means the
    message M encrypted by key K, 𝐴𝑉 means the autonomous vehicle, 𝐶𝑆 means the central
    server, 𝑖(𝐴𝑉) is a AV’s text identifier, 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 is a AV’s timestamp, 𝐾 + 𝑢 is the
    public key of u of the protocol participant, for example, the key 𝐾 + 𝐶𝑆 is the
    public key of the central server, 𝑈𝐼 𝐷 𝐴𝑉 stands for the numeric user identifier,
    #ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ( {𝑈𝐼 𝐷 𝐴𝑉 ,𝑖(𝐴𝑉)} 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 ) means the execution of the hash function on the
    ciphertext {𝑈𝐼 𝐷 𝐴𝑉 ,𝑖(𝐴𝑉)} 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 , 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 𝐶𝑆 means the timestamp generated by
    the central server for the unique user identifier 𝐴𝑉 . In the first step of this
    protocol, AV tries to register to CS by sending its text identifier and freshly
    generated timestamp. Next, the central server checks its database to see if there
    is no such identifier. If everything is correct, it generates a numeric user identifier
    ( 𝑈𝐼 𝐷 𝐴𝑉 ) and the timestamp 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 𝐶𝑆 and stores them with AV’s text identifier.
    In the second step, CS sends to AV hashed identifiers with the timestamp 𝑇 𝐴𝑉
    𝐶𝑆 . Note that, the #ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ( {𝑈𝐼 𝐷 𝐴𝑉 ,𝑖(𝐴𝑉)} 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 ) value will be used to recognize
    AV by CS. Otherwise, it will stop communication. In the last step, AV confirms
    that it received the earlier message by sending the timestamp 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 𝐶𝑆 to CS. The
    subsequent modifications we made were in the second phase of the Amelia protocol.
    In the protocol’s default version, the communication takes place between the user,
    the Authentication Center and the user who is the event organiser. In our system,
    AV will communicate only with the central server. We made the rest of the modifications
    in the message structures. Hence, the scheme of the authentication and communication
    phase of this protocol in Alice-Bob notation will be as follows: 𝛼 1 𝐴𝑉→𝐶𝑆: {#ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ(
    {𝑈𝐼 𝐷 𝐴𝑉 ,𝑖(𝐴𝑉)} 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 ), 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 𝐶𝑆 ,𝑖(𝐶𝑆)} 𝐾 + 𝐶𝑆 𝛼 2 𝐶𝑆→𝐴𝑉: { 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 𝐶𝑆 , 𝑇 𝐶𝑆
    , 𝐾 𝐶𝑆−𝐴𝑉 } 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 𝛼 3 𝐴𝑉→𝐶𝑆: { 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 ,𝐷 𝐹 𝐴𝑉 } 𝐾 𝐶𝑆−𝐴𝑉 In this notation: {𝑀} 𝐾
    means the message M encrypted by key K, 𝐴𝑉 means the autonomous vehicle, 𝐶𝑆 means
    the central server, 𝑖(𝑢) is the text identifier of the user u, 𝐾 + 𝑢 is the public
    key of u of the participant of the protocol; for example, the key 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 is the
    AV’s public key, 𝑈𝐼 𝐷 𝐴𝑉 stands for the numeric user identifier, #ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ( {𝑈𝐼 𝐷
    𝐴𝑉 ,𝑖(𝐴𝑉)} 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 ) means the execution of the hash function on the ciphertext
    {𝑈𝐼 𝐷 𝐴𝑉 ,𝑖(𝐴𝑉)} 𝐾 + 𝐴𝑉 , 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 𝐶𝑆 means the timestamp generated by the central
    server for the unique user identifier 𝐴𝑉 , 𝐷 𝐹 𝐴𝑉 means a data file with information
    about air quality, 𝐾 𝐶𝑆−𝐴𝑉 is a symmetric session key shared between AV and CS.
    In the first step, AV tries to authenticate to CS, sending its identifier with
    timestamp 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 𝐶𝑆 and CS’s identifier. The central server validates this data
    in the database. If the data are correct, it generates a symmetric session key
    shared between AV and CS. AV and CS will use this key later in the communication.
    Otherwise, it will stop communication. In the last step, the autonomous vehicle
    sends to the central server a data file with information about air quality with
    freshly generated timestamp 𝑇 𝐴𝑉 . AV encrypts this message using the session
    key 𝐾 𝐶𝑆−𝐴𝑉 . The first phase must be executed once for each vehicle, but the
    second phase must be completed after every end of the route in the proposed system.
    Further, the proposed system uses secure communication channels via WiFi standards
    [22,23] for communication between the central server and AV, or LTE/5G standards
    mention [20,21] for communication between AV and devices. Figure 2 shows the communication
    flow in the proposed system. We included here descriptions of each external and
    internal operation executed during the protocol’s steps and conditions for the
    subsequent steps executions. As mentioned, the MQTT network has a publisher, broker,
    and subscriber. The Publisher (autonomous vehicle in our solution, AV) must register
    on the Broker (central server, CS). In this case, it executes the first phase
    of the Amelia protocol. If the AV is registered correctly on CS, it can authenticate
    to CS, establish a session, and send data about air quality. Hence, it executes
    the second phase of the Amelia protocol. The sending of data to CS is equivalent
    to the publishing step performed by the publisher in the MQTT protocol. The Subscriber
    (user and his device) can subscribe to the published data. The Broker updates
    and publishes data for Subscribers regularly. Figure 2. Communication flow in
    the proposed system. We verified the adaptation of the Amelia protocol using a
    tool for automated security protocol verification mentioned in [24]. This same
    tool was used to verify the Amelia protocol’s full version. Thanks to this tool,
    we can consider different executions of security protocols, including various
    time parameters such as time of composing the message, encryption/decryption times,
    or delay in the network, and also different network conditions (with or without
    attacker). We performed analysis using a computer unit with the Linux Ubuntu operating
    system, Intel Core i7 processor, and 16 GB RAM. Further, we used various values
    of time parameters during tests. The tool uses an abstract time unit [𝑡𝑢] , which
    means some period. Thanks to the tool mentioned, we could execute two types of
    research: timed analysis and simulations of the delays in the network. During
    one part of the research, we assumed the following values of time parameters:
    mechanism and one-way hash functions eliminate impersonation attacks. time of
    generating confidential information: 𝑇 𝑔 =1[𝑡𝑢] , time of composing the message:
    𝑇 𝑐 =1[𝑡𝑢] , asymmetric encryption or decryption time: 𝑇 𝑒 =3[𝑡𝑢] , symmetric
    encryption or decryption time: 𝑇 𝑒 =2[𝑡𝑢] , minimal delay in the network: 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛
    =1[𝑡𝑢] , maximal delay in the network: 𝐷 𝑚𝑎𝑥 =3[𝑡𝑢] , execution time of the hash
    function: 𝐻=2[𝑡𝑢] . For the timed analysis, the tool calculated the values of
    timed parameters summarised in Table 1. We observed that for each protocol part,
    four executions were possible: one execution with honest users and three executions
    with an attacker. Only executions with real users and executions with an attacker
    (like himself) were likely to be performed. They were executed while maintaining
    the imposed time conditions. Further, we analysed the messaging and learning flow
    in executions with the attacker who tries to impersonate other users. These executions
    did not meet time conditions. If the attacker wants to execute a subsequent step,
    he tries to establish the next session with CS and acquire appropriate knowledge.
    The attacker cannot obtain it because he cannot gain the necessary cryptograms
    or cryptographic objects to prepare messages according to protocol structure.
    Table 1. Timed parameters used during research. Next, we execute simulations of
    this protocol. This type of research examines the influence of delay in the network
    on execution time. Additionally, it demonstrates the capabilities of the attacker
    in a time-constrained setting. It is feasible to generate network delay values
    randomly based on four different probability distributions. We examined this protocol
    using all probability distributions implemented in the tool. This research confirmed
    the results of the timed analysis. Only executions with honest users and executions
    with an attacker (like himself) were possible to perform. The rest of the executions
    did not meet time conditions because of the attacker’s lack of knowledge. Subsequently,
    an informal security analysis was conducted to validate our protocol’s attainment
    of the primary security features. We analysed such properties as anonymity and
    mutual authentication. Anonymity is achieved through asymmetric cryptography during
    the registration and authentication processes, which safeguards the user’s identity.
    In the context of mutual authentication, both the AV and the CS must possess a
    shared symmetric key to establish mutual authentication. The CS generates the
    key during the second authentication and communication phase step. AV and CS verify
    their identity during this stage by transmitting their shared timestamps and identifiers.
    Additionally, we conducted an ad hoc security study to ascertain potential vulnerabilities
    that could compromise the effectiveness of our protocol. We analysed the aforementioned
    offensive scenarios. Adapting the Amelia protocol effectively mitigates replay
    attacks through a timestamp mechanism. The initial step involves the verification
    of the timestamp by each recipient. The continuation of contact is contingent
    upon receiving the message within the prescribed limit; otherwise, the recipient
    will terminate the communication. Further, this protocol mitigates the risk of
    a man-in-the-middle attack by incorporating a session key, which is shared among
    the parties involved. The encryption key employed in this context renders it impossible
    for the attacker to extract any constituent elements from the encrypted messages.
    Suppose an attacker successfully intercepts a message and attempts to transmit
    it during a subsequent session. In that case, the recipient will decline acceptance
    of the message after verifying the timestamp. Using symmetric and asymmetric encryption,
    timestamp mechanism, and one-way hash functions eliminates impersonation attacks.
    3.2. Vehicle During research, the critical role is to ensure the correctness of
    the data. Wrong data give wrong results. Therefore, any interference should be
    eliminated during measurements. For this reason, we used a Nissan Leaf electric
    car for data collection in our experiment (see Figure 3). Its most significant
    advantage in this case is that it does not emit air pollution during testing.
    Figure 3. Vehicle used in experiment. 3.3. Instruments The measuring device consists
    of two modules built into one Peli-type case: a measuring module with a built-in
    suspended dust measurement system, a measuring module with gas sensors working
    in a pump system. Technical specification of the measuring instrument: 𝑃 𝑀 10
    dust range from 0 to 1999.9 μg/m3, sensitivity 0.3 μg/m3 𝑃 𝑀 2.5 dust range from
    0 to 999.9 μg/m3 𝑉𝑂𝐶 Volatile Organic Compounds PID 10.6 eV detection range: 0
    ppm to 50 ppm, photoionization method, 𝐶𝑂 range from 1 to 500 ppm, the electrochemical
    method 𝑁 𝑂 2 range from 0 to 20 ppm, the electrochemical method 𝑁𝑂 range 0 to
    20 ppm, the electrochemical method 𝑆 𝑂 2 range from 0 to 50 ppm, the electrochemical
    method temperature −40 °C to 85 °C, resolution 0.1 °C humidity from 0 to 100 pressure
    from 300 hPa to 1100 hPa, accuracy 100 Pa GPS position (GNSS) accuracy up to 1.5
    m GSM/3G/LTE module WiFi 2.4/5.8 GHz 802.11an. The integrated measuring instruments
    have been placed in a carrying case. Such a research set has been equipped with
    magnetic holders to place it on the car’s roof. Thanks to such placement, the
    measurement of air pollution takes place at a height comparable to the height
    of the human nose. This solution ensures the reliability of measurements and allows
    us to draw valid conclusions regarding the level of air pollution and the impact
    of individual gases and dust on human health. The power supply for the measuring
    set (grey cable in Figure 4) came from the cigarette lighter socket. The set had
    a GPS module (black cable in the Figure 4). Figure 4. Instrument used in experiment.
    3.4. Results The Table 2 and Table 3 present data collected by the pollution measurement
    system discussed in the article. Measurements were taken on two different days.
    Each row corresponds to information gathered at a specific time (first column)
    and location (second, third, and fourth columns). The subsequent columns contain
    data regarding harmful gases and particulate matter concentration in each location.
    The last columns provide information about temperature and humidity, which can
    influence the intensity of perception of pollution. Table 2. The data of air quality—day
    1. Table 3. The results of measurements—day 2. Upon analysing the obtained results,
    we concluded that atmospheric pressure affects the concentration of suspended
    particles 𝑃 𝑀 10 and 𝑃 𝑀 2.5 , although its influence is not direct. Atmospheric
    pressure can impact weather conditions, which, in turn, may affect the concentration
    of these pollutants. The primary ways atmospheric pressure may influence 𝑃 𝑀 10
    and 𝑃 𝑀 2.5 concentrations include weather cycles or thermal inversions. Regarding
    weather cycles, changes in atmospheric pressure are typically associated with
    various weather conditions. For instance, high atmospheric pressure often favours
    calmer weather with reduced wind, potentially leading to increased accumulation
    of 𝑃 𝑀 10 and 𝑃 𝑀 2.5 particles in the atmosphere. On the other hand, concerning
    thermal inversions, atmospheric pressure may influence their occurrence. Under
    conditions of high atmospheric pressure, thermal inversions might be more likely.
    Thermal inversions can trap pollutants in the lower atmospheric layers, leading
    to increased concentrations of suspended particles. Additionally, atmospheric
    pressure changes often coincide with humidity changes, corroborated by the obtained
    measurement data. High humidity may promote the accumulation of suspended particles,
    potentially resulting in increased concentrations of 𝑃 𝑀 10 and 𝑃 𝑀 2.5 . It is
    worth noting that the influence of atmospheric pressure on the concentration of
    suspended particles is often indirect and related to weather conditions resulting
    from these pressure changes. However, atmospheric pressure alone does not directly
    cause the increase or decrease in 𝑃 𝑀 10 and 𝑃 𝑀 2.5 concentrations. The data
    obtained by the system can subsequently be made available to subscribers of the
    service offered by the system. There are two possibilities for the graphical presentation
    of measurement results. The first option is to present data in a graphic form
    (Figure 5), where the circle size shows the degree of pollution, and the red colour
    informs about exceeding the standard concentration of gases or dust. This circle
    is the so-called heat map that enables data visualisation that shows the size
    of individual values in a data set as a colour. Colour differences may be due
    to shade or intensity. A more intense colour (red or close to red) indicates increased
    pollutant concentration in the air. The heat map considers the values of all pollutants
    for a specific geographic point. The second way to show the results is to display
    numerical values (Figure 6) in a given location, and standards violations are
    translated into a change in the font colour. In this way, people sensitive to
    dust can avoid moving in the area. Meanwhile, people with poor lung ventilation
    due to harmful gases may be informed of the danger. Monitoring air quality in
    city centres using professional mobile sensors offers real-time insights into
    pollution levels. These sensors provide accurate data, enabling prompt actions
    to mitigate health risks associated with poor air quality. Improved monitoring
    aids in identifying pollution sources, allowing authorities to take targeted measures
    for cleaner air. Deploying such sensors strategically across urban areas creates
    a comprehensive network for continuous assessment. Accessible data from these
    sensors empowers citizens to make informed decisions about outdoor activities
    and health precautions. Real-time alerts and data dissemination to users via apps
    or online platforms promote awareness and proactive measures. Mobile sensor networks
    facilitate community engagement, fostering collaborative efforts to address air
    quality concerns. Regular monitoring enhances policy-making by providing evidence-based
    information for effective regulations. The portability of these sensors allows
    for flexibility in relocation, catering to dynamic changes in pollution hotspots.
    Employing professional mobile sensors and distributing their data to users amplifies
    public awareness and drives collective actions towards cleaner, healthier urban
    environments. Figure 5. Results of measurement in the form of maps with heatmaps.
    Figure 6. Results of measurement in the form of maps and numbers. 4. Conclusions
    This article highlights the issue of air pollution, especially outdoors, and its
    severe impact on human health. IoT-based air quality monitoring systems are proposed
    as a practical solution to monitor and publish real-time air quality information.
    Several examples of IoT-based air quality monitoring systems using micro-sensors
    for data collection are presented for indoor and outdoor environments. The systems
    use various sensors to measure air quality parameters such as 𝐶 𝑂 2 , 𝐶𝑂 , 𝑃 𝑀
    10 , 𝑁 𝑂 2 , temperature, and humidity. The article emphasises the need for effective
    air quality monitoring and the potential of IoT-based systems to address this
    issue. An important issue raised in this work is the security of data transmission.
    A data transmission protocol has been proposed to ensure security and resistance
    to attacks related to the interception of transmissions in a public area. The
    main limitation of the system is its autonomy. Currently, fully safe and reliable
    autonomous vehicles have not been developed. Such a solution would allow the entire
    process to be automated. This will become possible when effective algorithms for
    vehicle autonomy are developed. Future work will focus on developing a user-friendly
    interface for multiple software platforms. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Network printers face increasing security threats from network attacks
    that can lead to sensitive information leakage and data tampering. To address
    these risks, we propose a novel Fibonacci-Diffie-Hellman (FIB-DH) encryption scheme
    using edge cloud collaboration. Our approach utilizes properties of third-order
    Fibonacci matrices combined with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt printer
    data transmissions. The encrypted data is transmitted via edge cloud servers and
    verified by the receiver using inverse Fibonacci transforms. Our experiments demonstrate
    that the FIB-DH scheme can effectively improve printer data transmission security
    against common attacks compared to conventional methods. The results show reduced
    vulnerabilities to leakage and tampering attacks in our approach. This work provides
    an innovative application of cryptographic techniques to strengthen security for
    network printer communications.

  description: The Internet of Things (IoT)’s rapid development is placing new demands
    on communication technology for power distribution. This paper proposes the application
    scheme of RSSI adaptive and dual-mode communication technology in the power distribution
    area, realizes the dual-mode networking technology adopted to improve communication
    quality, and verifies the reliability and superiority of the dual-mode communication
    technology scheme through analysis and application. The RSSI adaptive dual-mode
    communication module is designed, the RSSI model algorithm is modified, and the
    logical topology of the communication network and the data processing technology
    based on compressed sensing are analyzed. We focus on analyzing the performance
    of dual-mode communication networks for power consumption information collection
    and the information reception rate and real-time performance of MQTT protocol
    mapping for power distribution IoT. The average transmission delay was tested
    to be 198.5ms for QoS=0, 478.0ms for QoS=1, and 786.3ms for QoS=2 without encryption.
    When using SASL/TLS for transmission encryption, the average transmission delay
    is 992.7ms for QoS=0, 1203.6ms for QoS=1, and 1461.1ms for QoS=2.

  description: The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming society by connecting
    businesses and optimizing systems across industries. Its impact has been felt
    in healthcare, where it has the potential to revolutionize medical treatment.
    Conversely, healthcare systems are targeted by attackers and security threats.
    Malicious activities against such systems intend to compromise privacy and acquire
    control over internal procedures. In this regard, advanced analytics can enhance
    these attacks’ detection, mitigation, and prevention and improve overall IoT security.
    However, the process of producing realistic datasets is complex. There are critical
    aspects to consider when developing models that can be directly deployed in real
    environments (e.g., multiple devices, features, and realistic testbed). Thereupon,
    the main goal of this research is to conduct a review of Machine Learning (ML)
    solutions for IoT security in healthcare. Furthermore, this review is conducted
    from a dataset standpoint, focusing on existing datasets, resources, applications,
    and open challenges. Our primary objective is to highlight the current landscape
    of datasets for IoT security in healthcare and the immediate requirements for
    future datasets to support the development of novel approaches.

    by connecting businesses and optimizing systems across industries. Its impact
    has been felt in healthcare, where it has the potential to revolutionize medical
    treatment. Conversely, healthcare systems are targeted by attackers and security
    threats. Malicious activities against such systems intend to compromise privacy
    and acquire control over internal procedures. In this regard, advanced analytics
    can enhance these attacks’ detection, mitigation, and prevention and improve overall
    IoT security. However, the process of producing realistic datasets is complex.
    There are critical aspects to consider when developing models that can be directly
    deployed in real environments (e.g., multiple devices, features, and realistic
    testbed). Thereupon, the main goal of this research is to conduct a review of
    Machine Learning (ML) solutions for IoT security in healthcare. Furthermore, this
    review is conducted from a dataset standpoint, focusing on existing datasets,
    resources, applications, and open challenges. Our primary objective is to highlight
    the current landscape of datasets for IoT security in healthcare and the immediate
    requirements for future datasets to support the development of novel approaches.

    1. Introduction Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming society
    in various aspects of society. This technology connects businesses and enables
    the optimization of systems across multiple industries [1]. There has been an
    increase in deployed IoT services in the past few years, bringing much value to
    operations and society [2]. Several areas have benefited from the use of IoT.
    For example, in transportation systems, there is the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
    concept [3], [4]. Besides, several solutions have been proposed in the context
    of smart logistics [5]. Finally, there are other successful IoT applications in
    areas such as education [6] and agriculture [7]. IoT has been increasingly utilized
    in healthcare in recent years, attracting attention for potential medical treatment
    enhancements. In fact, specific procedures that were impossible in the past are
    becoming more common in medical procedures, e.g., continuous patient monitoring
    and more informed decision-making. Some areas, such as remote monitoring, electronic
    records, and preventive healthcare, have also been supported by IoT initiatives
    [8]. Conversely, healthcare systems are targeted by attackers and security threats.
    Malicious activities against such systems intend to compromise privacy and acquire
    control over internal procedures [9]. The challenging aspect is that it is not
    always simple to detect and mitigate these threats since they are becoming more
    sophisticated and exploiting multiple vulnerabilities in the IoT topology [4].
    In this regard, advanced analytics can enhance the detection, mitigation, and
    prevention of these attacks and improve overall IoT security [10]. To accomplish
    this, underlying patterns in the network traffic are identified in different ways
    and used for anomaly detection. Enhancing existing healthcare systems with the
    deployment of IoT technologies deeply depends on meeting security requirements,
    and ML powered by realistic datasets can offer many advantages to real applications.
    Moreover, generating realistic datasets is a complicated process that involves
    several steps [11]. Successful contributions are reviewed in this paper toward
    collecting data to train models, e.g., WUSTL EHMS [12], ICU [13], and BlueTack
    [14]. However, there are critical aspects to consider to develop models that can
    be directly deployed in real environments (e.g., multiple devices, features, and
    realistic testbeds). Furthermore, extending existing solutions depends on data
    resources with more extensive topologies and metrics. Thereupon, the main goal
    of this research is to conduct a literature review of Machine Learning (ML) solutions
    for IoT security in healthcare. Furthermore, this review is conducted from a dataset
    standpoint, focussing on existing datasets, resources, applications, and open
    challenges. Our primary objective is to highlight the current landscape of datasets
    for IoT security in healthcare and the immediate requirements for future datasets
    to support the development of novel approaches. The main contributions of this
    research are: • A comprehensive review of efforts on ML-Based solutions for IoT
    security in healthcare, their main contributions, methods, resources, future directions,
    data requirements, and supportive resources available (e.g., existing datasets,
    potential features, attacks, tools); • An extensive investigation of open challenges
    regarding the proposal of new IoT security datasets in healthcare based on the
    data requirements of new endeavors. These opportunities are categorized into diversity,
    threats, reproducibility, and behavior, and emphasize the current demand for extensive
    testbeds, realistic scenarios (e.g., collection and data transmission), execution
    of attacks, and profiling experiments. The paper is organized as follows: Section
    2 reviews related works and identifies the main aspects of this research. Secondly,
    Section 3 presents the main aspects of IoT applications in healthcare. Then, Section
    4 reviews various ML-based solutions for IoT security in healthcare and identifies
    future directions and data requirements. After that, Section 5 depicts existing
    resources available for developing new solutions, e.g., datasets, features, attacks,
    tools, and ML and DL methods. Finally, Sections 6 Opportunities and open challenges,
    7 Conclusion and future works present, respectively, the open challenges in developing
    new IoT security datasets in the healthcare context and the conclusion of this
    research. 2. Related works Several works have focussed on reviewing IoT applications,
    describing implementations, comparing contributions, and identifying open challenges.
    In fact, this Section presents works related to our contribution classified into
    three categories: ML & DL Evaluation of IoT Security in Healthcare, General Security
    Aspects of IoT in Healthcare, and Applications other than Healthcare. Table 1
    compares the related works, with columns representing the primary focus of these
    surveys. All of the papers focus on IoT and Security, and 14 out of 17 also cover
    Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) topics. Out of 17 papers, 10 also
    focused on aspects of healthcare. None of the papers focused on datasets — an
    important gap in the research that our paper will address. Table 1. Comparison

    Several works have focussed on reviewing IoT applications, describing implementations,
    comparing contributions, and identifying open challenges. Hathaliya et al. [25]
    review security and privacy issues in Healthcare 4.0, describing several relevant
    topics and open challenges. The authors focus on blockchain-based solutions and
    different taxonomies used in this context. The authors list previous surveys and
    highlight that this research was motivated by the vital importance of security
    and privacy in Healthcare 4.0, the lack of reviews on telehealthcare, policy-based,
    and processing-based solutions, and opening doors for other researchers. Furthermore,
    the authors present a background, architecture, and components of security and
    privacy in Healthcare 4.0. Finally, a taxonomy is presented alongside open challenges.
    In [17], a review on the role of ML in IoT applications in healthcare is presented.
    The authors focus on multiple aspects, including prognosis, diagnosis, and assistive
    systems. Security aspects are also considered alongside the constraints and drawbacks
    of each application. Then, the authors describe the areas of IoT in healthcare
    (diagnosis, prognosis and spread control, assistive systems, monitoring, and logistics)
    and technologies (Sensing, APIs, location, identification, and communication).
    A discussion on several topics, such as cardiovascular and neurological disorders,
    is conducted for diagnosis. Then, cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders are highlighted
    in terms of prognosis and spread control. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Surface
    Electromyography (SEMG) systems are then presented as part of assistive systems.
    Finally, the authors also emphasize aspects of monitoring and the importance of
    different areas in this ecosystem, e.g., emotion recognition, cognitive monitoring
    systems, infant health monitoring In [15], [32], the authors aim to present the
    current state-of-the-art ML-based solutions for IoT in healthcare. Several critical
    aspects are highlighted, focusing on specific healthcare requirements (e.g., medical
    imaging and diagnosis). THe authors in [32] present an overview of ML solutions
    in IoT medical data and suggest that model selection is vital to solve problems
    related to critical healthcare data. The authors present an in-depth review of
    ML methods and application areas (e.g., medical imaging, diagnosis of diseases,
    behavior modification or treatment, clinical trial research, smart electronic
    health records, and epidemic outbreak prediction). Similarly, the authors in [15]
    present and overview of health monitoring system using IoT and deep learning.
    Multiple sensors are listed alongside DL models, including the analysis of frameworks
    (e.g., tensorflow and keras). The authors in [18] focus on the implication of
    big data in IoT security in healthcare environments. A discussion on IoT applications
    in multiple fields is conducted followed by a layered architecture of a wireless
    body sensor network. It includes multiple layers, e.g., sensing, communication,
    processing, storage, and mining and learning. Finally, the authors list open challenges,
    e.g., Resource scarcity, security and privacy, interoperability, energy management,
    and big data analytics in the context of IoT in healthcare. Bhuiyan et al. [19]
    presents a review of applications, standards, protocols, and market opportunities
    from an IoT security standpoint in the context of healthcare. The authors classify
    existing IoT-based healthcare networks, analyze widely-used IoT healthcare protocols,
    investigate aspects of IoT healthcare security, and propose a model for IoT healthcare
    security. Thereupon, a list of opportunities for IoT-based technologies in the
    context of healthcare is presented and discussed. The authors in [21], [22] focus
    on describing important insights into current ML-based IoT security solutions
    in healthcare from different perspectives. In [21], the authors summarize IoT
    security issues, frameworks, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions to face
    such problems. Besides, a discussion on how AI can be used in different healthcare
    scenarios is also conducted. Furthermore, a list of IoT applications in healthcare
    is presented in [22], including patient monitoring, digital drugs, medical equipment,
    and medical institutions. A list of ML applications in this context is also discussed,
    e.g., health monitoring, prognosis, treatments, and decision support systems.
    All these contributions shed light on important aspects of IoT security in the
    context of healthcare. Considering the focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning,
    such approaches summarize the challenges intelligent solutions face, including
    the need for an extensive and realistic dataset. In this sense, our focus is to
    present a comprehensive investigation of datasets and resources available to foster
    the development of new solutions for IoT security in healthcare. 2.2. Applications
    other than healthcare Tahsien et al. [26] discuss the IoT security architecture
    from an ML standpoint alongside future directions. The authors summarize IoT devices’
    current and future presence in the global market and a detailed list of IoT security
    attacks (e.g., Dos, Man in the Middle, data tampering, and selective forwarding)
    and their characteristics (e.g., surfaces and effects). Finally, an extensive
    discussion is conducted on how ML plays an important role in such scenarios. In
    [27], the focus is on ML, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain solutions
    for IoT security. The authors present IoT security issues and multiple aspects
    of IoT operations, such as infrastructure, protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, REST,
    AMQP, TCP, UDP, DCCP, SCTP, RSVP, QUIC, CLNS, DDP, ICMP, DSI, and ISDN), and applications
    (e.g., smart farming, smart home, smart grid, smart hospital, smart city, smart
    transportation, supply chain, and smart retail). Security attacks are also discussed,
    including jamming, DoS, power analysis, and man in the middle. Ahmad et al. [24]
    and Al-Gardi et al. [28] present a review on ML approaches to IoT security. The
    authors in [24] introduce a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and an IoT attack
    taxonomy, including physical network attacks (e.g., encryption, DoS/DDoS, routing
    attacks, and middleware attacks), physical attacks (e.g., physical damage and
    node jamming), and application attacks (code attacks, privacy attacks, and malware).
    Finally, an overview of important aspects is presented, e.g., major security challenges
    in IoT, protection methods, large-scale attacks, ML and DL techniques, and attack
    mitigation. In [28], the authors review recent efforts in advanced methods to
    enhance the overall security of IoT systems. A tailored taxonomy of ML and DL
    solutions for IoT security is introduced, including IoT security threats (e.g.,
    types and surfaces), learning methods for IoT security (e.g., supervised approaches,
    RL methods, CNN, RNN, and GANs), ML and DL for layer security (e.g., perception,
    networks, and application), and other dimensions (e.g., data, learning strategies,
    and IoT systems). Besides, potential threats in the IoT system are also discussed,
    e.g., threats that comprise confidentiality, integrity, authentication, availability,
    authorization, and non-repudiation. Sarker et al. [16] focus on security intelligence
    for IoT. The authors describe IoT security challenges applicable to several areas
    as well as IoT system architectures and security issues. Then, they discuss IoT
    security problems, layers, and different ML and DL methods that can be used to
    mitigate them. Also, existing and potential issues and open challenges are reviewed.
    The authors review multiple (i.e., perception and sensing, networking and data
    communication, middleware or support, and application), emphasizing that attacks
    targeting different layers are engineered differently. In fact, important insights
    are highlighted, similar to those presented in [29], in which the authors present
    characteristics of IoT networks, challenges in the deployment, and ML solutions
    for security. In terms of attacks, several challenges are discussed, e.g., multi-layer
    attacks, physical level attacks, issues in the security architecture, transportation
    and application attacks, cloud concerns, and network-level attacks. The use of
    ML is also discussed from multiple perspectives, including the presentation of
    multiple techniques (e.g., DL and Deep Reinforcement Learning — DRL) and their
    limitations (e.g., processing power, energy, and hardware technologies. The authors
    also present how ML and DL can be integrated into IoT security solutions in areas
    such as malware analysis, authentication, intrusion detection, and attack mitigation.
    Finally, several future directions are identified and explained in detail.) Furthermore,
    the authors in [30] present a review of security-related challenges of IoT applications,
    focussing on security issues and emerging and existing technologies. In the context
    of IoT security, this paper introduces a classification of different IoT applications,
    security and privacy issues (e.g., injection, phishing, flooding, and data theft),
    and threat sources in for multiple layers (i.e., application, middleware, network,
    and sensing), recommendations, countermeasures, and open challenges. The authors
    also emphasize the importance of fog computing in this environment, considering
    its characteristics and solutions (e.g., Decentralization, data dissemination,
    real-time services, and transient storage). 2.3. General security aspects of IoT
    in healthcare Abouzakhar et al. [31] and Somasundaram et al. [20] review IoT risks
    and threats in healthcare, including aspects related to protocol, infrastructure,
    and possible impacts of cybersecurity attacks. The authors in [31] present a list
    of the most common protocols used in IoT (e.g., SOAP, CoAP, SSH, TCP, ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, NFC, and CDMA) alongside attacks and countermeasures (e.g., DoS, unauthorized
    access, ARP spoofing, VM backdoors, hypervision attack, and rootkit attack). In
    fact, the authors focus on the general aspect of security in IoT operations in
    healthcare and do not focus on ML and DL. Moreover, the authors in [20] review
    security challenges in healthcare related to IoT and assess the risk of devices
    considering multiple attacks. The authors assign different weights to the metrics
    considered: difficulty, awareness, and Impact (Less Medium and High). Additionally,
    risk factors are calculated based on multiple criteria. The authors also present
    concepts to mitigate current and future security threats, e.g., device-level security,
    continuous monitoring, prevention, detection, and response. Finally, Ullah et
    al. [23] review strategies to secure IoT regarding healthcare data transmission
    and aggregation. The authors illustrate the data aggregation process in smart
    healthcare devices and how the data can be securely transmitted and stored at
    FoG and cloud. In fact, the review focuses on secure fog-based data aggregation,
    secure healthcare data aggregation, and secure data aggregation using fog computing
    in healthcare. Regarding future directions, the authors emphasize the importance
    of new solutions for data aggregation security, data privacy in information exchange,
    scalability, resources management, data deduplication, and optimization. 3. IoT
    in healthcare The Internet of Things (IoT) concept has been widely adopted recently.
    Furthermore, healthcare IoT solutions can potentially enhance medical treatments.
    Although applications seem endless, the use of IoT in remote patient monitoring,
    electronic healthcare records, and preventive healthcare are the most promising
    efforts [8]. IoT supports healthcare solutions in several ways. This technology
    can improve the accuracy of procedures [33], improve the decision-making process
    [34], and create new models of healthcare solutions. Besides, the benefits also
    include the relationship between smart homes and the medical center. For example,
    using healthcare devices, real-time capturing, motion tracking, and emergency
    monitoring enable novel remote monitoring capabilities. It can also support the
    use of analytics and improve overall communication. Fig. 1 illustrates solutions
    enabled by IoT in Healthcare applications. The interaction between smart homes
    and health management & medical centers unveils underlying opportunities to enhance
    existing medical systems and treatments. For instance, several examples of how
    IoT has enabled new approaches in this field include: • Remote Monitoring: enabling
    a constant communication with medical centers, IoT fosters more informed, quick,
    and effective decision making in different treatments and procedures [35]; • Special
    Care: IoT enables healthcare solutions for children [36] and elderly people [37]
    to be continuous and more effective with remote monitoring; • Health Record: IoT
    can support healthcare systems by providing detailed information about patients
    through continuous and more comprehensive data collection approaches [38]; • Mobile
    Assistance: Through the presence of multiple devices, IoT can enable customized
    healthcare services [39] and availability [40] to patients; • Information Systems:
    IoT can support the optimization of storage, access, and use of primary healthcare
    data in different ways [41]; • Integrated Solutions: Multimodal scenarios can
    also be considered, in which healthcare IoT applications can be part of an ecosystem
    composed of other applications (e.g., transportation and logistics) [42], [43];
    • Knowledge Resources: In an IoT-enabled healthcare system, professionals can
    rely on wider awareness, short response times, and continuous data collection.
    This can improve the overall system performance [44]; • Telemedicine: remote procedures
    can also benefit from using IoT. Although different mechanisms can be adopted
    depending on the procedure considered, IoT can potentially transform telemedicine
    in the next few years [45], [46]. However, all these applications can be targeted
    by security threats. In fact, attackers can focus on compromising privacy or even
    acquire control over systems and communication. In this regard, advanced analytics
    (e.g., Deep Learning — DL) can strengthen the detection, prevention, and mitigation
    of such attacks and ensure secure IoT operations. Finally, enhancing existing
    healthcare systems with the several benefits of IoT deeply relies on meeting security
    requirements, and Machine Learning (ML) powered by realistic datasets can offer
    many advantages to real applications. Download : Download high-res image (537KB)

    applications [47], [48]. Moreover, there are similarities and differences between
    IoT and IoT in healthcare due to the specific context and requirements of the
    healthcare industry. Healthcare IoT has unique considerations related to data
    sensitivity, regulation, patient care, and ethical concerns that set it apart
    from IoT in other industries. It is a specialized and highly regulated field focusing
    on patient well-being and data security. Regarding data sensitivity, data produced
    by IoT devices in various industries may not necessarily contain confidential
    or personal details. But, in the healthcare industry, IoT devices handle highly
    sensitive patient data such as medical records, vital signs, and personal health
    information, making it crucial to ensure the security and privacy of such data.
    In healthcare IoT, inaccurate or unreliable data can pose life-threatening risks.
    Vital sign monitors and treatment devices must meet high accuracy and reliability
    standards. The consequences and impacts of IoT and IoT in healthcare are significantly
    different. Generally, IoT applications lead to efficiency gains, economic benefits,
    data analytics for business decisions and data security and privacy concerns.
    Their implications are not immediate and critical. On the other hand, IoT in healthcare
    has more immediate and life-critical consequences, directly affecting patient
    care and outcomes. Their impacts are focused on saving lives, monitoring patient
    health, and improving clinical decision-making. Data security breaches in healthcare
    IoT can lead to severe patient harm, privacy violations, and legal consequences.
    Regulatory compliance and ethical considerations are vital in healthcare IoT.
    Interoperability issues in healthcare IoT may disrupt medical device communication,
    potentially affecting patient safety. The consequences and impacts in healthcare
    IoT are particularly high-stakes and patient-centric. The consequences and impacts
    of IoT and IoT in healthcare are significantly different. Generally, IoT applications

    4. ML-based IoT security in healthcare: Applications Several contributions present
    in the literature depict Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions for IoT Security
    in Healthcare. Table 2 summarizes such efforts and highlights the main problem
    faced and the methods used. Then, we identify future directions and data requirements,
    either considering the authors’ statements or possible extensions to their works.
    These research endeavors focus on different problems in the security ecosystem
    and use different methods. However, their future steps rely on multiple extensions
    of existing datasets. This Section classifies these works into the following categories:
    Intrusion & Attack Detection, Data Transmission, and Efficiency, Mitigation, and
    Assessment. Table 2. Summary of ML-based IoT security applications in healthcare.

    Saif et al. [55] introduce an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT applications
    (e.g., healthcare) based on the combination of machine learning and metaheuristic
    algorithms. The authors focus on anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques
    applied to security attacks on cloud servers. The dataset adopted contains 125,973
    samples with 41 features and was used to evaluate the proposed strategy. Several
    attack classes were considered and the results showed this method’s effectiveness.
    Furthermore, Nandy et al. [61] identify attackers in the edge-centric IoMT framework
    using an Empirical Intelligent Agent (EIA) based on a Swarm-Neural Network (Swarm-NN)
    method. This novel Intrusion Detection System (IDS) detects attackers during medical
    data transmission through a wireless network. A new DL model is proposed by Anand
    et al. [64] to detect malware attacks in healthcare applications using CNN. The
    authors focus on 5G-IoT and unfold the discussion of generations and challenges
    of healthcare systems and emphasize the importance of confidentiality, integrity,
    and authentication in this field. The paper also depicts the attacks tailored
    to 5G-IoT healthcare environments, focusing on malware attacks. Experiments showed
    that the proposed approach presents an accuracy of 99%. The efforts presented
    in [63], [65] are dedicated to using DL models to secure IoT applications in healthcare
    contexts. The former aims to work with small datasets efficiently and presents
    a comprehensive evaluation of experiments using three small-scale publicly available
    benchmark datasets. The latter tackles the challenges related to the Bring Your
    Own Device (BYOD) concept in healthcare environments. In [51], a combination of
    Deep Learning (DL) and a nature-inspired optimization method is used as an intrusion
    detection approach for cloud and IoT environments. The authors use DL and the
    Capuchin Search Algorithm (CapSA) to obtain and select features from the IoT IDS
    data. The authors in [59], [60] propose solutions for SND-enabled IoT networks.
    The former introduces an Adaptive ML-based SDN-enabled Distributed Denial-of-Services
    attacks Detection and Mitigation (AMLSDM) framework, whereas the latter proposes
    a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based approach to detect and classify attacks using
    a GRU-based approach in the context of intrusion detection in the SDN-enabled
    IoT environment. 4.2. Data transmission The authors in [66] focus on secure data
    transmission using a Deep Q-learning-based Neural Network with Privacy Preservation
    (DQ-NNPP). Similarly, in [49], the authors present a Blockchain- orchestrated
    Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission (BDSDT) for IoT applications
    in healthcare. The main focus is to mitigate the problems related to potential
    cyberattacks that may be executed against the connectivity between IoT devices
    and servers in a healthcare setting. Then, a Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) with
    Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is used to design an effective intrusion
    detection system, achieving 99% accuracy in the evaluation process (CICIDS-2017
    and ToN-IoT). Blockchain-based solutions are also proposed in [52], [62]. In both
    efforts, the authors propose combinations of blockchain with Deep Learning (DL)-based
    methods to improve the overall security of IoT in healthcare applications while
    observing specific metrics (e.g., energetic efficiency and secure transactions).
    Finally, the authors in [58] proposed the Rooted Elliptic Curve Cryptography with
    Vigenère cipher (RECC-VC) centered security to enhance the security of the Internet
    of Medical Things (IoMT). Besides, a novel RECC-VC is proposed for secure data
    uploading to the cloud server. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed
    methods outperform existing methods. 4.3. Efficiency, mitigation, and assessment
    The authors in [53] review and discuss some potential risks of several image-based
    healthcare IoT systems regarding data security. The rising adoption of IoT technology
    in healthcare converged in developing new solutions and methods. In this sense,
    DNN-based automated diagnosis has created several possibilities for such systems,
    although posing some challenges. Throughout this work, the authors present many
    issues on data security in image-based Deep Learning (DL), e.g., poisoning and
    evasion attacks. Finally, the authors emphasize the importance of countermeasures
    and awareness of the impacts these threats could cause in IoT-based healthcare
    applications. In [54], the authors propose a security system that continuously
    authenticates legitimate users in a session, using data and authenticating them
    using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classification technique. In fact, the
    authors focus on internal IoT attacks rather than attacks coming from outside
    the network. The challenge relies on the fact that internal IoT devices can threaten
    the system’s security since an intruder can physically use and impersonate them.
    Pirbhulal et al. [68] focuses on developing a novel framework to protect medical
    information while observing resource consumption of low-powered medical devices.
    This initiative is also powered by ML-based techniques, targeting intelligent
    biometric security. The authors introduce a DL-based privacy preservation mechanism
    in [56]. With the primary goal of securing IoT healthcare architecture, the authors
    collect user data, separate data points based on sensitivity, and use a Convolutional
    Neural Network (CNN) alongside a secure access control module. The authors emphasize
    that increasing the training set improves overall performance. In fact, data augmentation
    can also be helpful. Privacy is a major concern in IoT security solutions for
    healthcare applications. The authors in [57] focus on this issue from different
    standpoints. This effort investigates the security risks in healthcare and how
    machine learning can mitigate them. The authors discuss important aspects of privacy-preserving
    Machine Learning (ML) and how ML-based attacks can be mitigated. Furthermore,
    the former focuses on designing a DL-based privacy-preserving system for IoT-enabled
    healthcare. Moreover, Rahman et al. [67] focus on adversarial attacks and test
    different COVID-19 diagnostic methods that rely on DL algorithms with relevant
    Adversarial Examples (AEs). The results obtained demonstrated that DL models remain
    vulnerable to such attacks when no defensive mechanism is adopted. This work demonstrates
    the importance of deploying specific countermeasures in the IoT topology to avoid
    misleading outcomes. Finally, in [50], the authors conduct a comparative analysis
    of on-device ML algorithms regarding energy consumption for intrusion detection
    in IoT. 5. ML-based IoT security in healthcare: Resources This Section highlights
    resources available for developing new IoT security solutions in healthcare. In
    this sense, the resources are related to existing datasets available and how they
    can be used in different scenarios. 5.1. Healthcare datasets In the past few years,
    there has been an increase in the interest in datasets comprising IoT traffic
    [69]. This is due to the rising challenges in securing current and future operations
    and the need for intelligent solutions built using Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    [70]. Different efforts have been made to provide the scientific community with
    realistic and extensive datasets to foster the development of novel security applications.
    Conversely, IoT devices are dynamic and present different networking behaviors
    depending on the application [71]. In fact, general-purpose IoT testbeds can differ
    from specific applications in many ways (e.g., requirements, data transmitted,
    and security capabilities). In this context, producing a realistic and extensive
    IoT security dataset for healthcare applications is challenging due to several
    factors. For example, the requirement of having multiple healthcare devices that
    are often expensive and unavailable, the need for a realistic environment that
    mimics the topology and operation of hospitals and healthcare organizations, multiple
    configurations of interaction between IoT devices and other medical equipment
    (e.g., multiple protocols), and the complex reproduction of realistic attacks
    (e.g., Mirai). Hady et al. [12] show that the combination of both network and
    biometric metrics as features can be beneficial in the context of Intrusion Detection
    Systems (IDS) for IoT in healthcare. Hence, the authors introduce a new dataset
    base on this combination to build a proper and realistic intrusion analysis. In
    this effort, the authors adopt a testbed composed of a PM4100 Six Pe Multi-Sensor
    Board, an Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), a Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), and
    a Windows Laptop (Gateway). Besides, there is also a clear separation of medical
    devices, gateway, network, and visualization as subcomponents of the topology
    adopted. Concerning the security aspect of this analysis, the authors execute
    spoofing and data alteration attacks assuming an attacker has established a new
    connection between the server and the medical gateway. In this case, spoofing
    may entail confidentiality violation [72], whereas data alteration may result
    in wrong treatment, based on false diagnostics. The dataset shared presented 4.4
    MB in size, 16 318 rows, and 42 features. The authors used several tools to produce
    this dataset, e.g., Argus and Scapy. Finally, Machine Learning (ML) models were
    used to evaluate IDS capabilities. In this process, the authors adopted multiple
    methods, e.g., Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine
    (SVM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The authors in [73] introduce the ECU-IoHT
    dataset, considering an Internet of Health Things (IoHT) environment and having
    different attacks executed to exploit various vulnerabilities. With the growth
    of the so-called IoHT devices, developing robust countermeasures is paramount.
    In this effort, the authors focus on helping the healthcare security community
    in analyzing attack behavior and developing effective security solutions. To produce
    realistic IoT traffic, several devices were used, e.g., Libelium MySignals, Temperature
    sensor, Blood pressure sensor, Heart rate sensor, Windows 10 laptop, Kali Linux
    laptop, wireless network adapter, and Bluetooth Adapter. Then, several attacks
    were executed, e.g., reconnaissance (Network scan), ARP spoofing, Denial of Service
    (DoS), Smurf, and Script Injection. The resulting dataset comprises 9 features
    and 111 207 rows (5.1 MB). Multiple supporting tools were used in the dataset
    development, e.g., Argus, nmap, Ettercap, Zenmap, Wireshark, MITMf, and Bettercap.
    Finally, the authors present a detailed description of the evaluation process,
    which was based on the use of several machine learning methods (i.e., k-Nearest
    Neighbors - k-NN, Local Outlier Factor — LOF, Connectivity-Based Outlier Factor
    — COF [74], [75], approximate Local Correlation Integral - aLOCI [76], Local Outlier
    Probability — LoOP [77], Influenced Outlierness — INFLO [78], [79], Cluster-Based
    Local Outlier Factor — CBLOF [80], Clustering-based Multivariate Gaussian Outlier
    Score — CMGOS [81], Local Density Cluster-Based Outlier Factor — LDCOF [82], Robust
    Principal Component Analysis — RPCA [83], [84], Histogram-based Outlier Score
    — HBOS, One Class Support Vector Machine — LIBSVM [85], [86]) to identify malicious
    patterns in the network operation. Zubair et al. [14] present a dataset for attacks
    against Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks based on Bluetooth. This effort
    focuses on developing a decentralized, predictive, Deep Learning (DL)-based process
    to detect malicious network traffic and provide defense against such attacks in
    IoMT devices. The authors explore and bring important insights into the technical
    details of Bluetooth technology and how it can be used in a Healthcare application
    of IoT. The data produced is based on the use of multiple IoT devices (e.g., SpO2,
    heart rate, and ECG) and comprises the execution of several attacks (i.e., DDoS,
    Bluesmack, MITM, and DoS), presenting a total size of 2.8 MB, 30 628 rows, and
    21 features. Finally, the authors also evaluated different ML algorithms using
    the proposed dataset, i.e., Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support
    Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Isolation Forest (IF),
    K-Means (KM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). A framework
    to enable the development of context-aware solutions for IoT security to detect
    malicious traffic in Healthcare use cases is proposed by Hussain et al. [13].
    This initiative is based on IoTFlock, a data generator approach that enables the
    development of an IoT use case including both normal and malicious IoT devices
    and generating traffic. Besides, the authors generate an IoT healthcare dataset
    comprising normal and IoT attack traffic. Then, ML techniques are trained to detect
    cyber-attacks and protect IoT healthcare systems. This dataset, namely ICU and
    comprising 52 features and 188 694 rows (107.8 MB), used a range of IoT devices
    in the healthcare context: Air Humidity Sensor, Air Temperature Sensor, CO Sensor,
    Fire Sensor, Smoke Sensor, Barometer, Solar Radiation Sensor, Remote Electrocardiogram
    (ECG) monitoring, Infusion Pump, Pulsoximeter (SPO2), Nasal/Mouth AirFlow Sensor,
    Blood pressure monitor Sensor, Glucometer, Body Temperature Sensor, Electromyography
    (EMG) Sensor, and Galvanic skin response (GSR) Sensor. There is also a variety
    in the attacks executed, including MQTT DDoS, MQTT publish flood, brute force,
    and SlowITE. Finally, the authors in [87] focus on a protocol widely adopted in
    industrial healthcare systems called IEC 60 870-5-104. Due to the lack of available
    datasets for this protocol, the authors introduce a new IEC 60 870-5-104 intrusion
    detection dataset. Then, an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) is
    proposed to discriminate and mitigate cyberattacks, leveraging ML and Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN) capabilities. Several attacks are performed against an Industrial
    Healthcare equipment testbed, including Man-In-The-Middle, Capturing and Dropping,
    Traffic sniffing, Counter Interrogation, Single Command, Setpoint, Read command,
    Reset command, and DoS. This dataset presents 3 775 534 rows and 203 features
    (1810 MB), which were extracted using CICFlowMeter [88] and an adapted parser.
    Finally, several ML techniques were used in the evaluation process. Table 3 summarizes
    and compares the datasets reviewed in this section, highlighting testbeds, goals,
    attacks, tools, ML methods used, and dataset specifications. Moreover, the WUSTL
    EHMS [12] and ECU-IoHT [73] datasets can be considered realistic datasets, and
    network flow and biometrics information are used to create realistic intrusion
    analysis. This dataset contains real devices such as PM4100 Six Pe Multi-Sensor
    Board, and Libelium MySignals. PM4100 Six Pe Multi-Sensor Board is a Medical Expo
    product that senses a patient’s biometric data using a series of sensors attached
    to their body. The board has four sensors; Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) sensor,
    Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) sensor, a temperature sensor and the blood pressure
    sensor; however, this dataset utilizes one device [12]. Libelium MySignals is
    a healthcare kit that provides a development platform for eHealth applications
    and medical devices. The MySignals kit includes several components and multiple
    sensors, such as a Temperature sensor, Blood pressure sensor, and Heart rate sensor,
    which can be used to monitor various biometrics [73]. Table 3. Summary of datasets

    it is a Bluetooth-based attacks against IoMT networks. they developed a Bluetooth
    (BR/EDR and BLE) dataset using realistic traffic generated using the smart healthcare
    testbed. In this dataset, three real IoMT devices utilizing, which were easily
    available in the market (SpO2, heart rate, and ECG), which operated wirelessly.
    In ICU dataset [13], devices are categorized into two groups, environmental monitoring
    devices and patient monitoring devices. Environmental monitoring devices utilized
    for maintaining a good environment in the ICU are; Air Humidity Sensor, Air Temperature
    Sensor, CO Sensor, Fire Sensor, Smoke Sensor, Barometer and Solar Radiation Sensor.
    Patient monitoring devices are Remote Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, Infusion
    Pump, Pulsoximeter (SPO2), Nasal/Mouth AirFlow Sensor, Blood pressure monitor
    Sensor, Glucometer, Body Temperature Sensor, Electromyography (EMG) Sensor and
    Galvanic skin response (GSR) Sensor. It can be considered as realistic as many
    real devices analyzed. IEC dataset [87] was constructed utilizing three main components
    which are: (1) seven VMs with IEC-Test Server representing the field devices,
    (2) a VM with Qtester104 playing the role of a human–machine interface, and (3)
    three VMs equipped with Metasploit, OpenMUCj60870, and Ettercap representing the
    cyber attackers. 5.2. Supplementary resources A combination of several features
    used is listed in Table 4, Table 5. These attributes can be categorized into multiple
    categories, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Device Identification features provide information
    about the IoT entities involved in the particular data flow, assuming the roles
    of source and destination devices. All datasets use them since future work can
    easily filter the data in order to perform analysis on single or specific devices.
    These features are presented in different formats, depending on factors such as
    the protocol used. Examples of such features are Source and Destination IP and
    MAC addresses. Connection features refer to the description of how communication
    is established among devices and how it can be used. As these features refer to
    higher-level protocols, they are vital aspects of these datasets since they can
    help identify different services and applications running through the IoT network.
    Examples are source port and destination port. Additional Info describes special
    information that can be useful for certain applications. In some cases, it may
    require Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights automatically.
    For example, the ECU-IoHT dataset [73] provides a feature named , which is available
    through Wireshark exports [89]. Quality of Service (QoS) relies on the quality
    of the communication established. In fact, abnormal communication patterns can
    present unusual QoS aspects, highlighting the importance of these features for
    different datasets. Examples of QoS features are loss (and percentage of loss)
    and jitter. Download : Download high-res image (440KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Feature categories in IoT healthcare datasets. Moreover, Flags indicate
    the presence or absence of particular characteristics to the traffic. Flags are
    paramount to identify the current configuration of the communication established
    and can be adapted to the protocol used. Examples of flags are TCP flags (i.e.,
    ACK, FIN, PUSH, RESET, SYN, and URG). Furthermore, temporal dependencies are critical
    to detect and mitigate malicious activities in IoT and healthcare. For different
    protocols, temporal features include insights such as the interval between packets,
    interval since the communication was established, and duration. Examples of temporal-related
    features are Duration, Time Delta, and Time Relative. To successfully execute
    cyber attacks, malicious actors can manipulate the network traffic in different
    ways. In fact, healthcare-based features can be useful for detecting abnormal
    patterns in traffic and help to detect and mitigate attacks. In this sense, healthcare-specific
    features (e.g., Pulse Rate, Resp Rate, and SYS) are important to consider in an
    IoT Healthcare dataset. Finally, Traffic Identification features refer to the
    traffic labeling that identifies if a particular sample belongs to a benign or
    malicious stream. These features are used by supervised ML methods since they
    distinguish traffic classes and enable the identification of underlying patterns
    for each category. Examples of these features are label, type of attack, and class.
    Moreover, several attacks threaten IoT operations in healthcare. Fig. 3 illustrates
    major attacks from the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) perspective.
    In this context, there are general attacks, e.g., Spoofing [90], Scan [91], DoS
    [92], DDoS [93], Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) [94], and Brute Force [95]. Download

    Major attacks against IoT in health from the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity,
    Availability) perspective. Additionally, there are attacks that consider the application
    aspects. Data Alteration is intentionally or unintentionally changing, modifying,
    or manipulating information in a data set. It can have significant consequences
    on the data’s accuracy, dependability, and usefulness. Data alteration may happen
    at any point in the data lifecycle, including data collection, processing, storage,
    or transmission. It could be caused by various factors such as human error, system
    failure, or malicious attacks. To ensure data integrity, appropriate measures
    must be taken to detect, prevent, and correct data alteration [96]. Furthermore,
    a Smurf attack is a type of cyber attack that inundates a targeted server by using
    Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) requests that appear to come from a fake
    Internet Protocol (IP) address. The ICMP is a protocol normally used by network
    devices, such as routers, to report on the status of requests they send or receive.
    Smurf attacks can have serious consequences, as the large traffic volume can consume
    all available bandwidth and prevent legitimate traffic from reaching its destination
    [97]. Script injection relies on an injection attack that exploits vulnerabilities
    in software applications to execute unauthorized code or commands. The attack
    aims to access sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data.
    Script injection attacks, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, are security
    vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a website or
    web application that other users view [98]. Additionally, Bluesmack is a Bluetooth-based
    attack that targets mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, and is designed
    to disrupt Bluetooth connections. The attack is performed by sending a series
    of malformed packets to the target device, which causes it to crash or reboot.
    The name “Bluesmack” derives from the fact that the attack is similar to a denial-of-service
    (DoS) attack, specifically targeting Bluetooth devices [99]. MQTT DDoS is a type
    of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that targets the MQTT (Message
    Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. MQTT is a popular lightweight messaging
    protocol used for IoT devices and is designed to be efficient in low-bandwidth,
    high-latency environments. In an MQTT DDoS attack, multiple compromised IoT devices
    are used to flood the MQTT broker with a large volume of messages, overwhelming
    the server and causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users. This attack
    can significantly disrupt IoT devices relying on the MQTT communication protocol
    [100]. Thereupon, MQTT flood refers to a type of cyber attack that targets the
    MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol by flooding it with a high
    volume of traffic. In an MQTT flood attack, an attacker floods the MQTT broker
    with many messages, overwhelming the server and causing it to become unresponsive
    or crash. This type of attack can significantly disrupt IoT devices that rely
    on the MQTT protocol for communication [101]. The SlowITE attack falls under the
    Slow Denial of Service (SDA) attacks, aimed explicitly at the MQTT protocol. This
    attack uses a low-rate strategy, typical of other types of slow DoS threats. In
    a SlowITE attack, the attacker sends traffic that appears to be legitimate but
    is designed to consume resources on the targeted devices gradually. This attack
    can cause the devices to become unresponsive, allowing the attacker to carry out
    further attacks or bypass security measures [102]. Finally, Sniffing is the process
    of sniffing is a crucial technique used by attackers to gather information on
    potential vulnerabilities within a network, its devices, protocols, and applications
    that can be exploited. This technique involves passively analyzing the traffic
    that flows within the network. Since this activity is passive, it is challenging
    to detect it. Traffic sniffing can be accomplished using specialized software,
    often called a packet sniffer or network analyzer, which allows an attacker to
    capture and analyze data packets as they pass through a network. This technique
    can be especially effective when network traffic is not encrypted or weak encryption
    methods are used [103]. Finally, the process of generating, collecting, and analyzing
    IoT traffic in healthcare applications is supported by several techniques and
    frameworks. Table 6 lists several tools used in this process, whereas Table 7
    depicts various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques used in
    different IoT security solutions in healthcare applications. Several solutions
    have been produced regarding using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)
    to mitigate attacks against IoT Operations in Healthcare. The authors in [148]
    use deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and supervised machine learning models
    (random forest, decision tree, KNN, and ridge classifier) to detect cyber attacks
    in IoT operations in the healthcare environment. The authors also employ the Particle
    Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique for Feature Selection (FS) and extensively
    discuss the results obtained. In [149], the authors present a cyber attack detection
    system using Deep Learning. Several attacks are considered (e.g., ARP Spoofing,
    DoS, Port Scan, and Smurf) in the context of IoT in healthcare. The authors use
    the ECU-IoHT dataset to identify these four classes alongside benign traffic and
    indicate that the proposed system can used in a real-time IoHT environment in
    future works. Table 6. Tools used to generate and collect IoT data in healthcare

    Deep Learning (DL) methods used in different IoT security solutions in healthcare
    applications. Method Description Random Forest (RF) This technique involves using
    a set of un-pruned classification or regression trees that are generated using
    random samples from the training data. In addition, random combinations of features
    are utilized during the process, and the ultimate predictions are determined by
    using the combined results of the group [116], [117]. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
    Straightforward instance-based technique operates by assessing the distance between
    training examples in the feature space that produces classifications using measures
    of similarity between two instances (or categories) [118], [119], [120] Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) Prediction tool that maximizes predictive accuracy while
    avoiding overfitting. SVMs rely on the use of high-dimensional feature spaces
    and assign training examples to points to optimize the gap between different categories
    [121], [122], [123] Local Outlier Factor (LOF) By analyzing the variation in the
    density of data points within a specific dataset, anomaly detection by considering
    outliers the samples presenting low-density [124], [125] Histogram-based Outlier
    Score (HBOS) Technique that assumes independence of the features [126] to calculate
    outlier scores through the creation of normalized univariate feature histograms.
    The calculated values show anomalies as high score outputs while normal instances
    have a low score output [127] Logistic Regression (LR) One approach involves analyzing
    a group of variables to determine the likelihood of a data point fitting into
    a specific category. This method, known as logistic regression (LR), has proven
    successful in various studies due to its straightforwardness [128], [129] Decision
    Trees (DT) Classification technique that logically combines a sequence of simple
    tests [130] and defines hierarchical features thresholds encoded as a tree. Ultimately,
    these thresholds define the classes of instances in the classification process
    [131] Naive Bayes (NB) Method based on Bayes’ rule assuming that the features,
    given a specific class, are conditionally independent [132]. Regardless of the
    violations of this assumption, this method often yields competitive classification
    performance [133] Isolation Forest (IF) This anomaly detection algorithm separates
    instances using random features and split values, and assigns higher scores to
    instances with fewer splits to be isolated [134], [135] K-Means (KM) Clustering
    method involves the division of data points into k clusters [136], classification
    of instances is determined by their proximity to the cluster mean. The primary
    objective of this approach is to minimize dissimilarities among clusters. “.”
    [137] AdaBoost (AB) Algorithm based on the combination of various weak classifiers
    [138] and adopting a weighted sum to estimate final outputs [139]. The main concept
    involves enhancing wrongly classified data points during the training phase to
    reinforce and improve the accuracy of future classifiers. Deep Neural Networks
    (DNN) This highly effective method relies on processing units divided into multiple
    layers [140] connected to synaptic weights to yield the result of an activation
    function [141]. The goal of DNN is to frame a given problem into a function approximation
    problem that maps the inputs (features) to the outputs, targeting the estimator
    error reduction [142] Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) This architecture relies
    on feedback connection and memory to enable information flow and temporal processing.
    It has been successfully used in different efforts focussed on detecting patterns
    in sequences [143], [144]. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Designed for organizing
    information in a grid-based format, this structure commonly comprises convolutional,
    pooling, and fully connected layers [145], [146]. Throughout the process, the
    convolutional layers ascertain crucial features, the pooling layers simplify the
    complexity related to these features, and the fully-connected layers generate
    classificationslayers [147] The authors in [150] propose a framework to store
    the collected IoT data in healthcare and to detect attacks using quantum deep
    learning. This effort is focused on privacy and uses the WUSTL-EHMS-2020 and ICU
    datasets, considering multiple attacks (e.g., MQTT publish flood, MQTT authentication
    bypass attack, MQTT packet crafting attack, and COAP replay attack). The authors
    highlight key parameters used in the experiments to enable reproducibility. Lahmadi
    et al. [151] investigate how machine learning can be used to detect Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks against BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices. The authors combine
    supervised and unsupervised techniques and use a well-described set of parameters
    and the transformation process of time series into training samples. The confusion
    matrix presented depicts that the proposed approach is highly accurate with promising
    results, enabling new research efforts to be considered in the future (e.g., DoS
    detection). Furthermore, the authors in [152] use Deep Learning to detect multiple
    cybersecurity attacks (e.g., DoS, malevolent operation, data type probing, spying,
    scanning, brute force, and web attacks) with results that outperform many state-of-the-art
    methods for IoT security. In fact, the main focus of this effort is on the Industrial
    Internet of Things (IIoT), and many configurations are tested. For example, multiple
    activation functions are considered (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, softplus, softsign,
    SELU, and SReLU). Finally, the authors indicate that evaluating the proposed approach
    with other IoT devices is considered in the scope of future directions. Similarly,
    the authors in [14] use Deep Learning (DL) to protect edge nodes of the smart
    healthcare IoMT system while considering several attacks (e.g., Bluesmack, DoS,
    DDoS, and BLE-based attacks). 5.3. Attacks against IoT operations in healthcare
    Authors in the WUSTL EHMS dataset [12] used Man-in-the-middle cyber-attacks to
    create a dataset of over 16,000 records of normal and attacked healthcare data.
    The proposed system applies various machine learning techniques to train and test
    the dataset against cyber attacks. The results indicate that the performance has
    enhanced by 7% to 25% in certain cases. This demonstrates the effectiveness and
    robustness of the system in detecting intrusions accurately. Four ML methods have
    been selected for attack detection: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN),
    Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). A Kali-Linux-based
    computer is used to simulate dangerous scenarios in healthcare monitoring systems
    by initiating attacks on the system. During network transmission, biometric data
    of a patient can be spoofed and altered, leading to potential security breaches.
    To execute the attack, the system uses a man-in-the-middle (MITM) technique, where
    the attacker acts to be a router, intercepts, spoofs or alters packets, and shifts
    them to the server. Spoofing attacks can cause a breach of confidentiality and
    privacy in healthcare systems as attackers intercept packets. However, data alteration
    attacks can compromise patient data when the attacker changes information that
    has been redirected from the gateway computer. This can severely harm the patients
    as they may get inaccurate treatment based on wrong diagnostics due to the attacker’s
    modifications. The medical IoT gateway is responsible for transmitting patient
    information to medical professionals. However, this process can also create a
    potential security risk. Attackers can manipulate information by targeting the
    gateway before it reaches the healthcare provider. Additionally, attackers can
    launch DoS/DDoS or MITM attacks that may result in manipulated or unavailable
    information. Authors of [14] released the BlueTack dataset to test Bluetooth-based
    attacks on IoMT networks. They also developed an intrusion detection method using
    deep learning techniques based on this dataset. The BlueTack dataset contains
    various attacks against Bluetooth BR/EDR or classic Bluetooth protocols, including
    DDoS, Bluesmack, DoS and other similar attacks like DDoS and MITM attacks on the
    BLE protocol. These attacks are harmful and potentially endanger the patient’s
    life. The dataset can be used to train an IDS model to recognize DoS, DDoS, and
    Bluesmack attacks on medical IoT devices that utilize Bluetooth. Different vulnerabilities
    enable intruders to conduct a broad range of attacks, such as denial of service
    (DoS), distributed denial of service (DDoS), man-in-the-middle (MITM), data leakage,
    and spoofing. These attacks can cause harm to patients who are in transit by ambulance
    or at a hospital, as well as lead to system resource unavailability. In their
    study published as the ICU dataset [13], the authors created an IoT healthcare
    dataset that contained both normal and IoT attack traffic. They then utilized
    various machine learning techniques to analyze the generated dataset and identify
    cyber-attacks in order to safeguard the healthcare system against them. The authors
    also established an invader network comprising ten attacking devices that carried
    out four types of attacks: MQTT distributed denial-of-service, MQTT publish flood,
    brute force, and SlowITE attack. Ensuring the security of IoT healthcare systems
    is of utmost importance, as any security breach or cyber-attack can severely impact
    human life and sometimes lead to death. In light of this, the authors have proposed
    a comprehensive framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions.
    This framework aims to detect any malicious traffic in IoT healthcare environments,
    thereby enhancing the security of these systems. The healthcare industry has been
    embracing digitization, and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has been playing
    a crucial role in this regard. However, the legacy healthcare systems are quite
    vulnerable to cyber attacks, which puts the security of healthcare data at risk.
    To address this issue, the IEC dataset [87] can be used to monitor and control
    the electrical operations of healthcare infrastructure, including substations.
    The authors conducted an analysis of various types of cyberattacks, including
    MITM, Traffic Sniffing, DoS, and unauthorized access attacks. A cyberattack using
    IEC 60 870-5-104 on a substation that supports healthcare infrastructure can have
    disastrous consequences, including fatal accidents. Therefore, the healthcare
    and energy sectors are interdependent and are both vulnerable to IEC 60 870-5-104
    cyberattacks. The healthcare sector widely adopts the IEC 60 870-5-104 protocol
    in their industrial systems. 6. Opportunities and open challenges Developing new
    security strategies for IoT operations in healthcare is pivotal for society nowadays.
    A fundamental resource for such initiatives relies on the design and production
    of novel datasets. Based on the insights depicted in Sections 4 ML-based IoT security
    in healthcare: Applications, 5 ML-based IoT security in healthcare: Resources,
    the main open challenges to be tackled in the next few years are illustrated in
    Fig. 4 and described in this Section. Download : Download high-res image (287KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Major open challenges in the context
    of IoT security datasets in healthcare. 6.1. Operational diversity Real IoT operations
    comprise hundreds of devices. In fact, in a healthcare environment, there are
    several devices for different treatments and monitoring applications, remote connections,
    and data transferring. The development of a dataset based on a topology that replicates
    a real-world topology will enable solutions to be more accurate and more deployable.
    Conversely, this endeavor entails the acquisition of several devices, which demand
    a financial investment. Thereupon, building an IoT lab focussed on healthcare
    applications and collecting data from internal and external transactions will
    contribute to the scientific community towards building a more secure IoT landscape
    in healthcare applications. Furthermore, most datasets are focused on networking
    features. These critical attributes provide insights into advanced models and
    enable the detection of malicious activities. In addition, future datasets need
    to include healthcare-specific attributes to describe the overall system behavior.
    Engineering new features can be valuable since anomalies can be detected meaningfully
    and domain knowledge can play an important role in operational security. Conversely,
    there are challenges to address, e.g., the trade-off between feature engineering
    and privacy preservation. 6.2. Threats against IoT operation in healthcare systems
    In a realistic scenario, malicious actors can target the system operation and
    multiple attacks can be executed. General-purpose IoT datasets provide data on
    different types of attacks (e.g., DDoS, spoofing, and Mirai) and have been used
    in many security solutions. Thereupon, future datasets should consider including
    multiple attacks against these devices. This would enable researchers and developers
    to better their approaches towards more secure operations. In fact, these attacks
    can include traditional threats but also consider healthcare-specific threats,
    compromising required constraints in this area (e.g., privacy). Some efforts have
    focused on analyzing malware in networks [153], [154]. In healthcare, malware
    can be tailored to exploit specific vulnerabilities and affect the devices’ operation
    (e.g., control and device status). Future datasets should also concern existing
    and new malware threats affecting healthcare systems. Besides, data collection
    from normal operations and operations under the execution of such threats would
    enable the development of new solutions to foster IoT security. 6.3. Iot operational
    behavior in healthcare systems Some applications reviewed in this research target
    the trade-off between security and resource usage (e.g., power consumption). In
    addition to all the security aspects described in this section (e.g., attack,
    vulnerabilities, malware, and profiling), data describing the status of the overall
    device is also important in future endeavors. These metrics may include power,
    memory usage, processing levels, and response time. Moreover, the authors in [54]
    emphasize the importance of protecting healthcare systems from internal attacks.
    In this sense, it can be challenging to identify abnormal behaviors from internal
    connections throughout the network. Building IoT profiling datasets in healthcare
    is necessary to provide security solutions with communication patterns and behavior
    patterns of different device types and categories. Indeed, this requirement also
    relies on producing an extensive and realistic dataset. However, the experiments
    and procedures to collect data should be tailored to profiling. IoT profiling
    is a research problem focused on the standard communication of IoT devices and
    involves the understanding of underlying communication patterns [155], [156],
    [157]. The analysis of IoT features, profiling, and behavioral aspects in IoT-based
    attacks, and how ML techniques can detect anomalous behaviors are topics to be
    further explored in future works. 6.4. Reproducibility IoT devices are used in
    healthcare environments with several different goals. Multiple sensors and actuators
    produce data and communicate with other general-purpose IoT devices and processing
    infrastructures (e.g., edge serves). However, including all these aspects is an
    open challenge for several reasons. Future datasets should include various devices
    from different types (e.g., healthcare and general purpose) connected to represent
    a real operation. One possible approach that can be considered relies on replicating
    a real healthcare IoT application with the same (or similar) devices and topology.
    This would foster the development of new solutions and support the validation
    of current solutions before deployment. Finally, there has been an increasing
    concern regarding the security of data transmission of IoT applications in healthcare.
    The data transferred from devices to other systems (e.g., edge servers) has been
    demonstrated to suffer from privacy issues that can compromise the adoption of
    these new technologies. Future datasets focussed on such communications can contribute
    to improving IoT security, make data transfer secure and efficient, and foster
    the development of policies and standards; Thereupon, these challenges can lead
    to greater opportunities regarding IoT datasets in healthcare applications. Firstly,
    establishing an extensive testbed is an important constraint of future efforts.
    This also enables the collection and analysis of multiple descriptive features.
    Secondly, the topologies considered should mimic a real scenario, including connections
    and data transmission. Another paramount aspect relies on designing strategies
    to execute various attacks and behavioral experiments towards IoT profiling. Finally,
    the interaction of such devices should be analyzed based on malicious aspects
    (e.g., malware) and operational constraints (e.g., operational metrics). 7. Conclusion
    and future works Nowadays, IoT is becoming more present across multiple industries
    and enabling the development of new solutions. There have been several efforts
    to use this technology in healthcare, and new solutions are expected to further
    enhance the existing systems in the next few years. This research presented a
    literature review of Machine Learning (ML) solutions for IoT security in healthcare.
    The main focus was on existing datasets, resources, applications, and open challenges.
    Finally, the current landscape of datasets for IoT security in healthcare was
    depicted and immediate and long-term requirements for future datasets were highlighted.
    Future work should consider multiple devices, multiple descriptive features, and
    different attacks. In the long term, there is a need to investigate attacks tailored
    to the operation of such devices in the healthcare domain. Besides, an in-depth
    analysis of how realistic testbeds can be replicated is a pillar for profiling,
    malware analysis, further integrations, and collection of operational metrics.

    Fabric; storage security 1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes
    our interaction with the surrounding objects, forming a network of diverse devices
    such as computers, sensors, intelligent gadgets, and smartphones. These devices
    are interconnected through various technologies to access the internet [1]. In
    upcoming years, through sixth-generation (6G) networks, the capacity to facilitate
    interactions among billions of interconnected devices and applications, all at
    remarkably elevated data speeds, emerges as a notable prospect which leads us
    to the Massive IoT (MIoT) concept [2]. These facts give rise to demanding attention,
    including rapid real-time data processing, scalability, storage security, availability,
    and latency. Therefore, the impetus to create this model arose from the requirement
    for fast information exchange and processing among IoT components, underpinned
    by a scalable, secure, and available framework with minimal latency. IoT-based
    frameworks require key characteristics to function effectively. These include
    (i) connectivity among devices to enable collective intelligence, (ii) accurate
    and timely sensing for detecting environmental changes, (iii) intelligent analysis
    of gathered data with minimal latency to extract meaningful insights, (iv) dynamic
    adaptability to accommodate evolving systems, (v) scalability to handle increasing
    device and data volumes, (vi) ability to manage heterogeneity among devices and
    data types, (vii) and robust security measures to protect against cyber threats
    and data breaches. These attributes collectively shape a reliable and efficient
    IoT ecosystem [3]. According to the aforementioned characteristics, a framework
    that can satisfy requirements is necessary for supporting all the features [4].
    The data generated by IoT sensors can be managed within a centralized environment
    such as a cloud. To effectively manage massive data from intelligent devices,
    it is necessary for the data to be efficiently and flexibly transmitted from the
    devices to the cloud [5]. IoT encompasses energy-efficient devices, often characterized
    by limited processing power, computation capacity, and battery capacity [6]. The
    publish/subscribe concept, offering event-triggered, asynchronous communication
    between publishers and subscribers, is well suited for extensive, distributed
    IoT services with limited energy, due to its thorough separation of publishers
    and subscribers across space, time, and synchronization [7]. In the domain of
    Massive IoT, numerous challenges require careful consideration for successful
    implementation. Foremost among these challenges is efficiently processing massive
    and heterogeneous data in real time with minimal latency. Simultaneously, ensuring
    network availability and establishing a secure, immutable data storage mechanisms
    remain paramount. Our research endeavors revolve around the development and validation
    of a novel approach, harnessing the power of a publish/subscribe method for real-time
    data processing in the realm of MIoT, while leveraging blockchain technology for
    the secure storage of data. The core contributions of this research paper are
    as follows: We introduce a comprehensive architectural framework, rooted in the
    publish/subscribe methodology, tailored for real-time data processing within the
    expansive domain of MIoT. To tackle the intricacies of real-time data processing,
    we employ the robust capabilities of Apache Kafka version 3.6.1 and Apache Druid
    version 28.0.0. Recognizing the significance of data storage security and immutability,
    we incorporate Hyperledger Fabric, a cutting-edge blockchain technology, to fortify
    our system’s data storage capabilities. In pursuit of network availability and
    efficiency, we employed two Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) based on LTE as our
    “Network-in-a-box” through two distinct implementations, showcasing the potential
    for robust network connectivity. Furthermore, we substantiate the effectiveness
    of our proposed model through a series of meticulously designed experiments. These
    experiments are aimed at quantifying latency and assessing the overall performance
    of our blockchain-integrated solution. In doing so, our research not only offers
    a comprehensive architectural framework but also provides empirical evidence of
    its practicality and efficiency, thus contributing substantively to the field
    of MIoT. Related Work The authors in [8] conducted a comprehensive state-of-the-art
    review, shedding light on how the microservice-based architecture is leveraged
    to enhance non-functional characteristics, specifically reliability and availability,
    in IoT ecosystems. Their pioneering work outlines several critical challenges
    addressed by MAs, including IoT device integration, heterogeneity, interoperability,
    fault tolerance, scalability, and system deployment and configuration. Moreover,
    they provide insights into the techniques proposed for handling non-functional
    requirements (NFRs) within MAs for IoT systems. Notably, for improving availability,
    reactive architecture, circuit breaker patterns, orchestration, and machine learning
    have emerged as prominent techniques, while messaging protocols have been favored
    for addressing interoperability challenges. Furthermore, for scalability, orchestration
    and load balancing techniques have been explored. However, they highlight that
    MAs have not been universally explored across all IoT domains, and most notably,
    another study identified a critical gap in the literature concerning end-to-end
    availability and reliability, emphasizing that this surpasses the mere availability
    of individual components within a system [9]. In [10], the proposed hybrid centralized
    and blockchain-based architecture addresses critical challenges encountered by
    resource-constrained IoT devices. The author believes that traditional cryptographic
    approaches have been extensively explored but are ill suited for the resource
    limitations of IoT devices, a concern that aligns with the findings of the study
    in [11]. The incorporation of blockchain technology for IoT authentication, as
    introduced in that study, has been a growing area of interest in recent years.
    However, that study’s emphasis on minimizing computational costs and addressing
    real-time requirements distinguishes it from existing blockchain-based approaches
    that often incur significant overhead. The novel hybrid architecture proposed
    herein, combining centralized and blockchain-based elements, represents a promising
    direction for efficiently bolstering IoT security while mitigating the resource
    and scalability challenges faced by IoT systems. In the landscape of publish–subscribe
    systems, the article in [12] sheds light on the critical design features and performance
    metrics for several open-source systems such as Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ. The
    present work contributes by offering a rigorous evaluation of seven open-source
    systems, establishing common criteria for comparison, and providing insights into
    functionality and performance under real-world conditions. However, this study
    needs to further explore alternative systems like ActiveMQ, Apache Pulsar, ZeroMQ,
    Redis, and others, which would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding
    of publish–subscribe systems’ capabilities and limitations. The author in [13]
    in the realm of fog computing contributes a valuable lightweight authentication
    scheme tailored for resource-constrained IoT devices and fog gateways. On the
    other hand, pre-shared key (PSK) authentication methods have been proposed as
    a solution for low-resource devices, although they have faced questions about
    their security robustness [14]. That study introduced an innovative approach by
    combining the Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) key exchange algorithm
    with PSK authentication within a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) publish–subscribe
    framework in the context of distributed fog computing. However, that study’s focus
    on ECDHE-PSK authentication within the MQTT publish–subscribe architecture may
    limit its applicability to other fog computing and IoT contexts. The article by
    [15] proposes the RTID framework by utilizing Apache Spark for efficient data
    processing, RESTful API, and OAuth 2.0 for secure access management. In the realm
    of real-time IoT data processing, prior research has delved into addressing the
    multifaceted challenges associated with efficiently managing massive data [16].
    Traditional approaches, including 6LoWPAN [17] and IoT with Cloud system (CCS)
    [18], have been fundamental in shaping the IoT landscape but have faced limitations
    in terms of flexibility and data management efficiency. Although it contributes
    to enhancing real-time Massive IoT data processing, more comprehensive comparative
    studies with existing frameworks are necessary to firmly establish the RTID framework’s
    suitability and feasibility in practical deployment scenarios. Contrary to previous
    efforts in the field of data processing in IoT, which often tackled individual
    challenges using various methods and architectures like publish/subscribe and
    microservice-based approaches, some of which did not consider the big scale in
    MIoT, our research takes a holistic approach. Our primary objective is to present
    a comprehensive framework that integrates all these challenges into a unified
    architecture. This paper aims to provide an intricate overview of real-time data
    processing in MIoT and to address these formidable challenges collectively. The
    remainder of this paper unfolds as follows: in Section 2, we firstly present our
    pioneering proposed architecture—a comprehensive and robust publish/subscribe
    architecture designed to handle real-time data processing in the MIoT ecosystem.
    Moreover, each layer of this architecture and the data flow are detailed, offering
    a comprehensive understanding of its inner workings. Finally, we delve into the
    mechanics of our chosen publish/subscribe methodology, employing Apache Kafka
    and Druid, elucidating how these components synergize to facilitate efficient
    data processing. Section 3 explores experimental analysis, illuminating both the
    capabilities and limitations of our model. Section 4 initiates a thoughtful discussion,
    while Section 5 highlights a few key conclusions to the paper. 2. Materials and
    Methods A five-layer architectural framework has been designed and implemented
    to accommodate the demands of the MIoT platform, as shown in Figure 1. This design
    facilitates connectivity for a wide range of IoT devices such as sensors and actuators,
    demonstrating a profound efficiency. In order to reach an efficient platform,
    we tried to emphasize retention, processing, and secured storage capabilities
    in this architecture, which, respectively, are provided by Apache Kafka, Apache
    Druid, and blockchain technology. Figure 1. Architecture for MIoT with distinct
    domains. 2.1. Domains and Data Flow Recognizing the need to tackle diverse challenges,
    we opted to structure the model into five distinct domains. This approach was
    chosen to optimize our solution. The initial domain, comprising sensing and actuating
    devices, plays the role of data acquisition. To ensure availability, domain 2
    (connectivity and gateway) employs dual mobile network operators (MNOs) and automatic
    switchover, thereby safeguarding framework availability in case of failure. As
    mentioned earlier, we use two LTE-based SDNs. The subsequent domain not only delivers
    scalability, real-time data processing, and minimal latency but also incorporates
    data retention capabilities. Storage security measures are established within
    the fourth domain. A concise overview of these domains and their respective functionalities
    is provided in Table 1. Table 1. Brief description of the domains. To illustrate
    the data flow intricacies, a three-zone framework was employed to depict the entire
    process, from data collection to its secure storage on the blockchain. The process
    initiates with data collection by sensors, followed by its transmission to gateway
    devices and subsequently network simulators. The network simulators, represented
    by our simulated dual SDRs, namely Pico LTE acting as a Network-in-a-Box, establish
    connectivity to Kafka. Employing protocols outlined in Figure 2, they function
    as publishers or producers, facilitating data transfer to Kafka. Meanwhile, Hyperledger
    Fabric subscribes to specified Kafka topics via socket.io, ensuring secure access
    for end-users. Additionally, Apache Druid, functioning as a real-time data analytics
    tool, serves as another consumer in the chain. Figure 2. Data flow featured with
    three zones and two phases in the middle zone: 1. Data retention 2. Data pre-processing.
    2.1.1. Sensor and Actuator Domain As implied by the domain’s name, it hosts a
    variety of devices such as sensors, actuators, and board computers for capturing
    environmental data. For our study, we utilized BL654 and ibNav sensors to execute
    data collection. PinnacleTM 100 DVK devices from Laird Connectivity manufacturing
    company in Akron, OH, USA, were adopted as gateway elements which were equipped
    with a SIM card for connectivity purposes. Notably, we harnessed Wi-Fi for ibNav
    and Bluetooth for Pinnacle to facilitate data transmission from sensors to gateways.
    This, in turn, enabled onward transmission to the network layer, housing two SDR
    devices from Nutaq. Leveraging BL654 sensors, we effectively captured temperature,
    humidity, and pressure readings. With ibNav, our scope expanded to encompass position
    data alongside the aforementioned metrics. The devices in use are depicted in
    Figure 3. Figure 3. Devices used as sensors and gateways: (a) BL654; (b) ibNav
    sensors; (c) Pinnacle 100 DVK. 2.1.2. Gateway and Connectivity Domain With the
    inclusion of network simulators, we can emulate LTE-M, an optimal connectivity
    protocol, to achieve fast, high-rate data transfer with minimal latency [19].
    The network domain ensures the smooth transition of data from the sensor/actuator
    domain to the storage and processing domain. Our experimental configuration incorporated
    two Nutaq PicoLTE second-generation devices, skillfully simulating two mobile
    network operators (MNOs), as shown in Figure 4. Leveraging the capabilities of
    PicoLTE, we established a dynamic and robust simulation platform. This enabled
    the creation of an LTE-centric network environment for our MIoT experiments and
    streamlined the assessment of our MIoT system’s performance and behavior. Figure
    4. Two PicoLTEs and their antennas. Nutaq’s first-generation PicoLTE showcases
    a range of attributes, making it a compelling solution for various LTE needs.
    Characterized by its compact and portable design, this all-in-one integrated solution
    offers support for LTE Cat 0, Cat 1, Cat M1, Cat NB1, and Cat NB2, ensuring compatibility
    across multiple LTE generations. The cost-effectiveness and affordability of this
    solution stands out, providing an accessible option for diverse deployments. Configuration
    support is offered for all LTE bands, encompassing both the Frequency Division
    Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) modes. 2.1.3. Data Retention and Processing
    Domain Within our envisioned model, this specific domain assumes the critical
    role of preserving and performing real-time analytics on the massive amount of
    data generated by IoT devices. By utilizing data retention regulations in Apache
    Kafka, we achieve the dual advantage of customized data storage duration and the
    capability to execute various data manipulations. These manipulations encompass
    aggregation, filtering, data-type transformation, field redaction, etc. Simultaneously,
    Apache Druid facilitates real-time data processing, enhancing the framework’s
    capacity for instantaneous analytics. In data analytics, the choice between a
    data warehouse and a real-time analytics database hinges on the task at hand.
    Snowflake, a notable example of a data warehouse, excels at reporting and data
    consolidation. Its cost-efficient architecture prioritizes low-cost storage and
    allows for concurrency through clustering, making it ideal for periodic reports
    and insights. In contrast, Apache Druid represents the domain of real-time analytics
    databases, specifically designed for interactive data conversations with sub-second
    response times, high concurrency, and flexibility. Moreover, Druid’s dynamic schema
    approach adapts to changing data, while its focus on low-latency querying and
    real-time analytics makes it a powerful solution for swiftly processing large
    volumes of streaming data. Table 2 provides a comparison in this regard. Table
    2. Summary of Apache Druid advantages vs. data warehouse. 2.1.4. Secured/Immutable
    Storage Domain In this domain, the blockchain and database collaborate to establish
    a decentralized and secure ledger. This partnership guarantees data integrity
    and immutability by preserving hashed versions of the transmitted data. Serving
    as a conduit, Kafka receives data from devices and conveys it through the pipeline
    to the database. Following this, the data undergo a secure hashing process, and
    the resultant hash is archived within the blockchain, creating an immutable history
    of the initial data. In our research, we incorporated the Inter Planetary File
    System (IPFS) to assist the blockchain. This integration facilitates the hosting
    of produced MIoT data, improving the overall system’s performance. IPFS serves
    as a valuable complement to blockchain since it functions as a decentralized peer-to-peer
    network for file sharing and storage, relying on unique resource addresses to
    locate and retrieve data through Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs). The IPFS efficiently
    minimizes redundancies and conserves storage space using file hashes. It is essential
    to note that IPFS operates differently from blockchain. Once a file is uploaded
    to the network, it is impossible to be removed intentionally. However, IPFS necessitates
    periodic cache clearing, gradually phasing out less popular files from the network
    [20]. 2.1.5. End-User Domain Within IoT ecosystems, the end-user domain delivers
    significant value to its designated users. This domain offers a user-friendly
    interface for users that allows them to log in and to monitor their IoT devices.
    In other words, in a smart device ecosystem, this domain is responsible for analyzing
    sensor data, generating visual representations of device performance, and providing
    a user interface for initiating firmware upgrades. These upgrades ensure that
    devices remain equipped with the latest features, security enhancements, and performance
    improvements. Users can effortlessly initiate firmware updates through the application
    interface, ensuring device maintenance and feature enhancement. Consequently,
    the end-user domain in the IoT ecosystem serves the dual purpose of data visualization
    and firmware management. User authentication within this domain is paramount to
    enable communication with the blockchain. To ensure secure access, a two-layer
    authentication mechanism is employed. The first layer handles the initial user
    authentication, while the second layer leverages the blockchain’s inherent authentication
    procedures. Both layers work in tandem to verify the user’s identity. The data
    presented to the user are based on their specific needs and access credentials.
    This layer acts as the gateway for user interaction with the blockchain, enabling
    users to submit requests and to receive responses. Additionally, this layer offers
    the flexibility to develop other applications, specified for individual user requirements
    [19]. 2.2. Publish/Subscribe Method for Data Retention and Processing The publish/subscribe
    messaging approach is characterized by the sender (publisher) of the data which
    is not explicitly targeting a particular recipient. Instead, the publisher categorizes
    the message in some manner, and the recipient (subscriber) subscribes to receive
    specific categories of messages. Typically, publish/subscribe systems employ a
    broker, a central hub where messages are published [21]. Figure 5 depicts the
    logic behind the publish/subscribe system architecture. Within this system, numerous
    producers and consumers are at play. Each producer corresponds to an application
    or device responsible for generating diverse data types—such as temperature, humidity,
    pressure, position tracking data, etc.—which are then transmitted to the central
    broker. On the other side, consumers have the flexibility to asynchronously subscribe
    to specific data types as needed. This approach greatly surpasses the traditional
    request/response or point-to-point methods. To effectively organize and manage
    messages within the broker, a system of topics is employed, and these topics are
    further divided into partitions. Figure 5. The logic behind publish/subscribe
    system architecture. Apache Kafka as Stream Processing Platform Apache Kafka,
    a platform which uses the publish/subscribe method, emerged as a solution to the
    challenges posed by traditional request/response messaging systems. A database
    commit log in Kafka serves the purpose of maintaining customized durations so
    that the data can be read consistently. Furthermore, Kafka’s data can be distributed
    across the system, offering increased safeguards against failures (availability)
    and substantial potential for performance improvement. The current state of Apache
    Kafka is undeniably exciting. Kafka has been adopted by numerous organizations
    all around the world. This open-source platform has rapidly ascended as one of
    the fastest-growing projects in the open-source community [22]. At its core, Kafka
    drives the trend of efficiently handling and analyzing data streams. Illustrated
    in Figure 6, Apache Kafka comprises fundamental components, namely producer, cluster,
    broker, topic, partition, and consumer. Broker: Within Kafka, a multitude of brokers
    exist in the ecosystem. Their primary responsibility is to accept messages from
    producers and to subsequently commit them to a designated Kafka topic. Producer:
    Producers are responsible for creating new messages and delivering them to a Kafka
    topic in a specific broker. Consumer: Consumers subscribe to one topic or sometimes
    multiple topics and read messages. Since consumers store the tracking history
    of the consumed data, they can pause and resume their consumption progress without
    losing their position. Cluster: In the Kafka ecosystem, clusters can house multiple
    brokers within them. Within each cluster, there exists a broker tasked with the
    crucial duty of monitoring broker failure. This broker is called the controller.
    Figure 6. Apache Kafka fundamental components. Topic: In the Kafka system, messages
    are neatly categorized into topics, functioning much like database tables. These
    topics play the role of maintaining data, ensuring its retention over a pre-defined
    time frame. Each broker has the capacity to host one or multiple topics. Partition:
    Within each topic, multiple partitions serve as containers for logging messages.
    When messages are sent to these topics, they are written to partitions using an
    append-only approach, signifying that the data remain unaltered and immutable
    during the reading process. The data generated by IoT devices, serving as producers,
    is initially routed to Kafka brokers. Within the broker infrastructure, the data
    are directed to a queue. Subsequently, the broker ensures the data’s persistence
    by allocating them to a specific partition within a designated topic. On the consumer
    side, which, in our project, is represented by the blockchain component, subscriptions
    are made to the broker’s partition or topic, and data are consumed from the queue
    asynchronously. Vital metadata, indicating which data have already been processed
    and which remain, are maintained in Kafka Zookeeper. Any necessary actions are
    relayed back to the broker, subsequently reaching the IoT devices. In this context,
    the blockchain serves as the producer, while IoT devices function as consumers
    in our system. Latency is measured using the equation below: Ttotal = TDB + WTDB
    + TB + TBC + WTBC + RTBC + RTBD (1) This equation accounts for the various time
    components involved in the data processing latency, including the time for publishing
    data by IoT devices (TDB), the wait time in the queue for data processing at the
    broker (WTDB), the processing time in the broker layer (TB), the time required
    to transfer the data processed by the broker to the blockchain component (TBC),
    the wait time in the queue for data processing at the blockchain component (WTBC),
    the time required to transfer the processed data back to the broker by the blockchain
    component (RTBC), and the time required to transfer the information back to the
    IoT devices through the broker (RTBD). The latency metrics observed within the
    queue are detailed in the corresponding Table 3. Table 3. Broker’s queue properties
    and description. 3. Results and Analysis The research presented in this article
    focused on addressing the challenges of data processing and communication within
    MIoT using the publish/subscribe method and leveraging blockchain for secured
    data storage, with a specific emphasis on latency. Throughout the experimentation
    and analysis, several key findings regarding latency were observed, shedding light
    on the system’s performance and effectiveness. With reference to latency measuring,
    we employed Kafka’s Confluent Center, as well as Apache Druid, a built-in feature
    for showing statistics along with predefined use cases. In terms of hardware,
    we utilized a Ubuntu machine with the configurations detailed in Table 4. Table
    4. Simulation parameters. 3.1. Latency of Apache Druid without Apache Kafka In
    Figure 7, we present the latency measurements for Apache Druid in an environment
    where Apache Kafka is not in operation. The graph illustrates how latency changes
    under varying message rates. Notably, we observe a significant increase in latency
    when Apache Druid is subjected to a message rate of 100,000 messages per second.
    It is essential to note that the messages in this context consist of temperature,
    humidity, and pressure values, which are not typically high in volume. Figure
    7. Apache Druid’s latency without Kafka. 3.2. Latency with Apache Kafka in Operation
    In Figure 8, we explore the impact of incorporating Apache Kafka with different
    numbers of topics in a single-broker setup. Here, we observe that the latency
    remains consistently low, reaching less than 25 milliseconds even when processing
    100,000 messages per second. When compared to [5], their results reveal an average
    latency of approximately 25 ms for a workload of 60 messages per second for a
    message size of 10,000 KB. It is noteworthy that their scale may not be indicative
    of MIoT, emphasizing the distinction in the performance evaluation between the
    two studies. This fact demonstrates the efficiency and reliability of our utilization
    of Kafka to handle data streams with diverse topics, ensuring minimal latency
    for real-time data processing. Figure 8. Apache Druid latency with Kafka. To sum
    up, our systems are designed to efficiently manage up to 100,000 sensors, each
    capable of transmitting low-volume measurements every second, when accommodating
    500 topics. All of these conditions apply when we are operating within a framework
    of consistently low latency. 3.3. Request Pool Usage As previously discussed,
    each broker features a dedicated queue. When a producer dispatches a message,
    it enters the queue, where it predominantly remains in an idle state, occasionally
    transitioning to an active state. Request pool usage represents the average capacity
    utilization of request handlers across all brokers. In other words, it quantifies
    the percentage of time that the request handler threads are actively engaged and
    not in an idle state. Figure 9 illustrates that, at a data rate of 100,000 messages
    per second, the request handler is active for just 2.06 percent of the time, highlighting
    an exceptionally efficient utilization of resources. Figure 9. Request pool usage.
    3.4. Throughput and Availability Trade-off: One Broker vs. Two Brokers In this
    section, we explore the crucial trade-off between throughput and availability
    in our system. Our investigation uncovers an intriguing dynamic: a single-broker
    configuration yields superior throughput, while introducing two brokers may result
    in a slight degradation. In a dual-broker configuration, one broker assumes the
    role of the leader while the other acts as the follower. This setup ensures the
    replication of partitions from the leader broker to the follower broker in the
    event of a broker failure, guaranteeing continuous data availability. Notably,
    with the introduction of two brokers, there is a marginal, albeit not substantial,
    decrease in throughput, as depicted in Figure 10. Figure 10. Throughput comparison
    with one and two brokers. 3.5. Blockchain Performance We utilized Hyperledger
    Caliper, a freely available open-source tool, to assess the performance of our
    blockchain platform. Our testing involved Hyperledger Fabric utilizing hardware
    identical to that of the Kafka test. In Figure 11, we present the performance
    results for writing and reading transactions during our evaluation. The figure
    vividly demonstrates a positive correlation between Transactions Per Second (TPS)
    and the number of transactions, underscoring the efficiency of the proposed platform.
    Figure 11. Performance of Hyperledger. Furthermore, our findings, as depicted
    in Figure 11, reveal that as the transaction count escalates, the success rate
    of accepting read transactions remains consistently high. This observation underscores
    the network’s robust capability to handle massive read requests while maintaining
    the accuracy and reliability of the data retrieval process. 4. Discussion In this
    section, we will elaborate on positive aspects associated with adopting the proposed
    MIoT framework which empowers enterprises to access a variety of valuable results
    and to elevate their overall functioning. In this evolving landscape of the Internet
    of Things, our paper champions the use of the publish/subscribe approach, integrating
    Apache Druid and Apache Kafka for enhanced scalability and low latency in MIoT
    applications, which reaches less than 25 ms for 100,000 sensors in contrast to
    existing works that report 25 ms latency for significantly fewer devices. Supporting
    such a number of sensors, bolstered by dual mobile network operators for connectivity
    resilience and, on the other hand, utilizing Hyperledger Fabric for storage security,
    for which its performance remained high with more than 800 successful TPS in 14,000
    transactions, our model signifies a breakthrough in MIoT innovation, opening avenues
    for future research and advancements. The positive aspects can be divided into
    six sections, as follows: Low latency: Utilizing Kafka’s publish/subscribe architecture
    eliminates the need for real-time app control and data allocation since data are
    available for subscription from any IoT application in Kafka topics asynchronously.
    This attribute significantly contributes to our framework’s low-latency performance.
    Data retention with Kafka: Kafka’s data retention feature is a crucial asset in
    our framework. It guarantees that data remain accessible even in situations where
    latency or disruptions may occur. By retaining data over extended periods, Kafka
    ensures the reliability and resilience of the system, enabling historical data
    analysis and auditing capabilities. Scalability: The framework’s scalability stems
    from Kafka’s ability to deploy brokers across diverse clusters within various
    cloud services. Indeed, partitioning is crucial because when a partition is scaled
    in multiple brokers, various consumers can concurrently consume from the same
    partition across diverse clusters, particularly beneficial during high message
    traffic periods for a given Kafka topic. Availability: Our framework places a
    significant emphasis on ensuring uninterrupted service availability. Kafka’s inherent
    fault tolerance, achieved through data replication and distributed architecture,
    plays a pivotal role in this regard. Additionally, the introduction of multiple
    brokers and leader–follower configurations, as discussed earlier, contributes
    to high availability, as it guarantees data continuity even in the event of a
    broker failure. Last but not least, having two MNOs guarantees connectivity availability
    in case of connection failure. Integrity and security: Leveraging blockchain technology,
    our framework secures data with a high commitment to integrity. Blockchain’s inherent
    immutability ensures that data remain tamper-proof, maintaining the trustworthiness
    of stored information. Robust security measures, including multi-layered authentication
    protocols and encryption, further fortify our system against potential threats,
    providing a shield for the protection of sensitive data. Monitoring and insights:
    Administrators can harness our framework to gain profound insights from the massive
    data flow. With the ability to monitor data in real time and to conduct in-depth
    analyses, administrators can make informed decisions, identify trends, and proactively
    address issues, enhancing the overall efficiency of IoT operations. In summary,
    our study not only combines advanced technologies effectively to address challenges
    in the realm of MIoT but also opens avenues for further research and innovation.
    While the publish/subscribe method proves robust for many scenarios, it is important
    to note its limitations, particularly in synchronous communication scenarios such
    as media streaming. However, by integrating blockchain, Kafka, and robust security
    measures, we have constructed a framework that excels in terms of low latency,
    scalability, availability, data integrity, and data retention, making it a powerful
    solution for various IoT applications. 5. Conclusions As the landscape of the
    Internet of Things continues to evolve, the proliferation of Machine-Type Devices
    (MTDs) has given birth to the concept of MIoT, a significant trend in the realm
    of connected devices. In this paper, we have championed the use of the publish/subscribe
    approach for data storage, delivering notable improvements in scalability and
    latency for the interconnected world of IoT. By incorporating Apache Druid, an
    analytical database software, into our framework, we have empowered real-time
    data processing, further enhancing the capabilities of MIoT applications. Our
    strategic choice of Apache Kafka as the data transmission platform has streamlined
    the flow of data from sensors to brokers, creating an efficient subscription ecosystem
    that caters to the dynamic needs of IoT applications. With our proposed architecture,
    we have projected that the system could effectively support an IoT network comprising
    a minimum of 100,000 sensors, each transmitting low-volume messages per second,
    across a network featuring 1 broker and 500 topics. Moreover, we have bolstered
    the resilience of our connectivity by simulating the presence of two mobile network
    operators (MNOs) through Software-Defined Radio (SDR) devices, providing a reliable
    backup for uninterrupted data transmission, even in the face of connection failures.
    Notably, our commitment to data security is unwavering, exemplified by our deployment
    of Hyperledger Fabric, a cutting-edge blockchain technology celebrated for its
    robust security and data integrity features. The results of our comprehensive
    analysis underscore the model’s core attributes, highlighting its remarkable scalability,
    unwavering availability, robust security protocols, and minimal latency, positioning
    it as a formidable solution in the ever-evolving area of MIoT. Furthermore, it
    is essential to recognize that while the publish/subscribe approach proves to
    be robust for numerous MIoT scenarios, its effectiveness in synchronous communication
    scenarios, such as media streaming, may have limitations. These aspects, among
    others, open doors for future research and innovation, inviting further exploration
    into the dynamic and multifaceted world of MIoT. As the MIoT ecosystem continues
    to expand and diversify, our approach not only pushes the boundaries of what is
    currently achievable but also sets a new standard for the future of connected
    devices and data processing. This paves the way for ongoing advancements and innovations
    in the exciting field of MIoT, providing a solid foundation for building smarter,
    more responsive, and highly efficient IoT applications that cater to the diverse
    needs of our connected world. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.A.; Methodology,

    of ThingsMachine-type communicationsMobile networks 1. Introduction The cellular
    Internet of Things (CIoT) refers to using cellular networks, such as fourth and
    fifth-generation (4G and 5G) networks, to connect IoT devices to the Internet.
    These devices can range from simple to complex, from smart thermostats and surveillance
    cameras to agricultural monitoring systems. The concept of CIoT is derived from
    an interest in a wide coverage area, massive connectivity, security, trustworthiness,
    ultralow latency, throughput, and ultra-reliability. One of the main benefits
    of using cellular networks for the IoT is their wide coverage area and ability
    to connect to the Internet, even in remote or hard-to-reach locations. Compared
    to other types of wireless networks, cellular networks typically offer greater
    reliability and lower latency, making them ideal for applications that require
    real-time data transfers or remote control [1]. Moreover, because many IoT applications
    are mission critical and demand more than 99.99% reliability with less than 1
    ms end-to-end latency, cellular connectivity is considered the most appropriate
    option because it has access to the licensed spectrum, ensuring the security and
    reliability of the communication service [2]. Due to their global and standardized
    nature, cellular technology is required for the connection of billions of devices
    in IoT applications. The cellular network offers a variety of attributes that
    makes it a good choice for various IoT applications, including good quality of
    service (QoS) and experience (QoE), the ability to support mobility and service-level
    agreements, fast data rates, and worldwide coverage [1]. To support massive connectivity,
    the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization has standardized
    three new types of technology: the extended coverage (EC) global system for mobile
    communications (GSM) IoT (EC-GSM-IoT), long-term evolution (LTE) for machine-type
    communications (LTE-M), and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), known as the CIoT, since
    Release (Rel.) 13. Additionally, Rel. 17 introduced the fourth category of CIoT
    technology, called reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR), which is specifically
    designed to offer cellular services to a vast number of IoT devices planned for
    use in the 5G licensed spectrum [3]. The improvements made by 3GPP from Rel. 13
    [4] to 15 [5] are on their baseline deployment; however, since Rel. 16, LTE-M
    and the NB-IoT can share the 5G NR channels with 5G devices. 3GPP is working on
    a technology that assures better coverage for a large number of inexpensive, low-throughput
    devices with low power consumption in applications that can tolerate delays. The
    CIoT is being applied as a new approach to global connectivity and remote device
    management. Moreover, given the enhanced data rate and capacity, 5G networks are
    expected to drive numerous IoT connections. Thus, cellular networks should be
    optimized to support low-power and low-data-rate use cases to satisfy IoT demands
    [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Machine-type communication (MTC) applications can be
    delay-tolerant (tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g., utility meters)
    or delay-sensitive (cannot tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g.,
    remote robotics surgery), certain applications, such as smart cities, fall in
    the middle of these two opposite ends. Considering these categories, as per Ericsson’s
    mobility report [11], by 2023, 3.5 billion CIoT connections are expected to be
    deployed, and by 2026 [12], the NB-IoT and LTE-M are expected to comprise 45%
    of all CIoT connections. Consequently, research has been conducted to provide
    a review of the CIoT with various scopes and themes, as detailed in the subsequent
    section (Section 2). However, the existing studies have covered only a subset
    of the CIoT technology or were limited to a specific focus area. Table 1. Definitions

    Fig. 1. Paper organization. 2. Related work Since the introduction of the CIoT,
    various research has been conducted from different perspectives to provide an
    overview of the related use cases, key enablers, and challenges. A comparative
    study [13] evaluated the NB-IoT against other technology regarding latency, QoS,
    battery lifetime, capacity, and cost, applying some application scenarios. In
    other studies [14], [15], authors have analyzed the indoor coverage, low power
    consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection support of NB-IoT-targeted
    technical features, such as resource allocation, energy-efficiency techniques,
    and latency-energy performance evaluations. In addition, some applications, such
    as smart agriculture and smart health, have been analyzed with future research
    directions. In [16], the authors detailed and analyzed possible security attacks
    on NB-IoT-enabled devices and proposed various approaches and techniques for smart
    home and smart healthcare applications. Standardization efforts employed on the
    security aspects of the NB-IoT and security requirements of IoT applications with
    an extensible combination of the NB-IoT to the 5G are addressed in [17]. In [18],
    basic factors, such as the modulation scheme selection and channel coding that
    affect the energy consumption of the NB-IoT from the perspective of resource management,
    were analyzed and synthesized, and future work suggestions were offered. In [19],
    the physical layer, specifically the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE)
    of the NB-IoT system, was presented in detail, exploring the radio resource control
    (RRC) and medium access control (MAC) layers in the physical design of channels
    as well. In [20], the power consumption and communication range of self-powered
    NB-IoT in remote monitoring applications were evaluated. However, these studies
    [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] considered only the NB-IoT technology
    in the CIoT. The authors of [21] focused on integrating low-power wide-area network
    (LPWA) technology to preserve an affordable low-battery device and a wide geographical
    area while enhancing power consumption and providing future research directions.
    In [22], channel control procedures and massive MTC (mMTC) standard guidelines
    with NB-IoT and LTE-M features, including wide coverage, low power consumption,
    and massive connectivity, were explored along with future challenges and innovative
    ideas. A comparative study on the performance of CIoT technology was conducted
    in [23], focusing primarily on the NB-IoT and LTE-M. Coverage (i.e., coverage
    enhancements (CEs)), power consumption, module cost, connection count (i.e., number
    of connections per cell), supported features (i.e., voice support), and service
    modes have been compared. In [24], the authors provided comprehensive guidance
    on the IoT localization methods of NB-IoT and LTE-M devices, which is vital for
    ultra-dense devices that result in IoT positioning problems. Power consumption
    is the primary concern in IoT applications. Hence, improving battery life and
    message latency is essential, especially in rare data transmission cases, because
    it has a large signaling overhead in LTE-M and the NB-IoT due to the process of
    establishing a connection. In [25], the authors clarified early data transmission
    (EDT) mechanisms introduced by 3GPP to transmit data during the random-access
    procedure (triggers the connection to a cell) to enhance the power efficiency
    of the device and minimize message delay, which is vital in a wide coverage scenario.
    The authors of [26] evaluated mMTC features and QoS provisioning issues with critical
    enablers for mMTC in cellular networks. A detailed overview is presented on the
    channel access mechanisms and radio access network (RAN) congestion problems in
    the NB-IoT and LTE-M with machine learning (Q-learning approach) solutions for
    congestion relief, including future research directions. However, these surveys
    [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] reviewed only the NB-IoT and LTE-M. In [7],
    the authors investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M as licensed LPWA technologies,
    focusing on their low power consumption, low data rate, and broad coverage area
    features. Their study had a limited scope and aimed to facilitate LPWAN-5G integration
    to support a more extensive range of industrial applications, including process
    control and high data-rate multimedia applications. The authors of [27] compared
    the cost of EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT in urban and rural deployments and key
    cost factors from the perspective of profitability in employing the CIoT in firms.
    A broad survey on energy-saving solutions in EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT was
    conducted, including analyzing critical factors that affect power usage, such
    as data reporting frequency, discontinuous reception cycles (DRX), and RRC timers,
    [28], directing future energy consumption reduction techniques. However, these
    studies [7], [27], [28] investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M within limited
    key enablers. Table 2. Summary of recent surveys on the CIoT. Reference Year CIoT

    In [29], the authors provided the primary features of the RedCap device standardized
    by 3GPP to support mid-range IoT applications with complexity reduction, coverage

    assessment of coverage for RedCap UE in various settings, including rural, urban,
    and indoor scenarios. In [30], a comprehensive overview of 3GPP Rel. 17 RedCap
    regarding cost reduction, and power-saving results were presented with design
    guidelines with future expected 3GPP RedCap release specifications. These surveys
    [9], [29], [30] focused on RedCap with some feature components based on the 3GPP
    standard specifications. In [31], the authors analyzed EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap and verified that they are proven as 5G IoT standards employed in various
    real-time applications when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI). However,
    the research focuses on AI and IoT integration in the CIoT with future research
    directions. Hence, considering the various surveys conducted, the surveys and
    studies address various aspects with limited focus. However, this survey provides
    comprehensive all-in-one information on coverage, power consumption, cost, device
    complexity, and device connection analysis. Furthermore, this review covers the
    general architecture, applications, release enhancement, development analysis,
    focus area explorations, and future challenges based on previous studies and on-hand
    survey results. Table 2 summarizes related studies to illustrate the difference
    from this survey. 3. General network architecture of the CIoT This section discusses
    the general network architecture of the CIoT. The cellular network standards organizations,
    such as 3GPP and its member companies: Ericsson, Huawei, Qualcomm, and Vodafone
    endorse the cellular-network-based architecture of CIoT. Cellular-network-based
    architectures connect IoT devices to the cellular network’s IoT infrastructure
    and allow them to access the Internet through middleware provided by the operators.
    Various requirements, such as bandwidth, energy efficiency, coverage, mobility,
    and reliability, are considered when network architecture is developed and deployed.
    The network architecture of the CIoT is designed to be scalable and flexible to
    support a wide range of devices and applications. Its ultimate goal is to transition
    from inflexible network structures, where all devices communicate directly with
    a network access point, to a more flexible architecture. This new approach allows
    devices and the network to dynamically form interconnected sub-networks, resembling
    a mesh, as and when needed [32]. It can support low-power, low-bandwidth, and
    high-power, high-bandwidth devices and can be easily integrated with existing
    networks and systems. Integration with existing networks and systems allows organizations
    to leverage the advantages offered by IoT without having to completely overhaul
    the existing infrastructure. Fig. 2 presents the general network architecture
    of CIoT, facilitating communication between IoT devices and the Internet. A CIoT
    network architecture focuses on increasing network robustness against dynamic
    resource availability and providing ubiquitous connectivity. For instance, to
    meet the requirements of CIoT, existing legacy network architectures need to undergo
    substantial changes, such as enabling non-orthogonal access to increase the number
    of connected devices, implementing grant-free UL communication for fast and reliable
    communication, and adopting a multihop mesh network to support low-power devices
    in challenging locations [33]. As CIoT operates within existing cellular infrastructure,
    it facilitates interoperability between devices and harvests communication and
    computing resources across the network [34]. As depicted in the figure, the architecture
    comprises four main components: the IoT devices, BS, network stack (user plane
    and control plane), and Internet (CIoT applications). The first layer, the IoT
    devices include sensors, actuators, and other connected devices that collect and
    transmit data. Using these nodes, sensor data will be collected and transmitted
    to the access point, or they will receive data from it, to perform the response
    associated with the actuators. These devices communicate with the next layer,
    the BS, using CIoT technology (EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap), which connects
    the IoT devices to the network. Download : Download high-res image (761KB) Download

    layer is the network stack, comprising the user and control planes responsible
    for the efficient and effective data delivery between IoT devices and applications
    which are the two optimizations for the CIoT. The user and control planes form
    two distinct layers of the network stack and serve distinct functions, with the
    user plane carrying the data and the control plane managing the network resources
    [35]. Specifically, the user plane manages the data transmission and chooses the
    best path for control data packets for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) [36], and
    the control plane manages the overall network. In addition, the user and control
    planes work together to ensure an efficient and reliable exchange of information
    among IoT devices and the Internet. Finally, CIoT applications are at the top
    layer, which includes the applications and services that use the data collected
    by IoT devices. These applications can include everything from smart home systems
    to industrial automation systems [37]. The CIoT network architecture allows for
    the seamless integration of IoT devices and applications, making it an essential
    part of the IoT and plays a significant role to enable massive CIoT applications.
    Some of the CIoT technology (e.g., LTE-M and the NB-IoT) operates over a shared
    spectrum of LTE architecture with certain optimization techniques [38]. Some features
    were removed to reduce the complexity, equipment cost, and battery consumption
    in the shared LTE architecture, including handover for fast connection, carrier
    aggregation, and channel quality measurements [39]. In the CIoT network, two dedicated
    machines are used for communication: the MTC device and the MTC gateway. An MTC
    device is an endpoint that can communicate directly with a BS or connect via two
    hops to MTC gateways, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In this way, MTC gateways help
    increase data transmission efficiency by relaying data to the BS [40]. In fact,
    gateway utilization is feasible in numerous instances, but certain regions and
    circumstances lack such infrastructure. Consequently, in such scenarios, it becomes
    imperative to establish direct communication. 4. CIoT application use-case classifications
    The development of CIoT results from collaboration and innovation from multiple
    companies and researchers [11], [41], [42]. It has emerged as a way to extend
    the capabilities of cellular networks to establish connectivity for a diverse
    range of devices to enable a broad range of new use cases and applications, such
    as smart cities, industrial automation, and remote monitoring, to mention a few,
    by offering low-cost, low-power, and reliable connectivity. Globally, the standards
    of the CIoT have been developed by 3GPP and Ericsson, among others, which have
    different methods of classifying CIoT application use cases, as presented in Fig.
    3. Accordingly, this section discusses the application use classification by 3GPP
    and Ericsson. 4.1. 3GPP classification 3GPP is a collaboration between telecommunications
    standard organizations to develop global standards for cellular communication
    technologies [43]. Specifically, 3GPP is working on the development of 5G technology
    and standardization of IoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices [44]. They also work on developing new features and functionalities
    for cellular networks, such as network slicing, improved security, and reduced
    latency, to support the growing demands of IoT and other emerging technologies.
    This section focuses on their classifications from the application perspectives
    that 3GPP defines three usage scenarios of 5G: mMTC, ultra-reliable and low-latency
    communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) [45], [46]. 4.1.1.
    mMTC Specifically, mMTC is designed to enable numerous low-power, low-cost IoT
    devices to connect to cellular networks where many devices infrequently transmit
    small volumes of data. It is designed to connect numerous low-cost devices (e.g.,
    about 1,000,0000 devices/km ) with sporadic, low-throughput data transmissions
    within a 10-s latency [47]. The focus is on low power consumption with up to 10
    years of battery life and high reliability to efficiently use the network resources.
    It is intended for use cases requiring high device density, such as smart cities,
    industrial automation, smart homes, smart metering, and asset tracking, where
    many devices must connect to the network simultaneously. In Rel. 13, 3GPP proposed
    LPWA cellular technology that specified long-range coverage of 164 dB, inexpensive
    and extremely energy-efficient devices that necessitate intermittent and periodic
    connectivity, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT [45]. 4.1.2. URLLC Higher
    reliability and lower latency are the most important design standards in wireless
    communications. From Rel. 14 to the present, reliability and latency have been
    the focus requirements, such as new data center interconnect formats, enhanced
    physical DL control channel (PDCCH) monitoring capability, hybrid automatic repeat
    request acknowledgment (HARQ ACK) feedback based on sub slots, enhanced inter-UE
    transmitter (Tx) multiplexing, physical UL shared channel (PUSCH) enhancements,
    and a variety of active configuration grants [48]. It is intended for IoT applications
    that are mission-critical, such as emergency services, which demand high availability
    and coverage with a low response time of fewer than 1 ms. It is intended for use
    cases, such as factory automation, autonomous driving, and remote surgery [46]
    for which NR-RedCap is a complement. 4.1.3. eMBB The eMBB is designed to provide
    high-bandwidth and low-latency media streaming applications [49], such as virtual
    and augmented reality, smart offices, and 4k and 8k video streaming with ultra-high
    speed Internet access. The eMBB is intended for use cases, such as smart cities
    and entertainment. Although eMBB and CIoT differ, they can work together to offer
    more comprehensive and reliable connectivity solutions. The purpose of organizations
    in the CIoT regarding eMBB is to work to integrate them to share the capabilities
    of the trending wireless development in 5G. These categories are not mutually
    exclusive and can overlap. For example, an IoT application may require both mMTC
    and URLLC capabilities (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart grids, industrial automation),
    or an IoT device may require mMTC and eMBB capabilities (smart cities, healthcare,
    and smart agriculture). 3GPP aims to establish a framework that can cater to the
    varied needs of IoT applications and devices and ensure seamless interoperability
    among devices and networks. 4.2. Ericsson classification Ericsson [50], a leading
    information communication technology network provider, working on developing solutions
    for connecting a large number of devices to the network, improving network coverage,
    and increasing the efficiency and security of IoT applications. Involved in the
    standardization and development of CIoT technology and refined the IoT applications
    incorporated into the CIoT into four divisions: massive IoT, broadband IoT, critical
    IoT, and industrial automation IoT [32], [51]. Download : Download high-res image
    (580KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. 3GPP and Ericsson’s CIoT use-case
    classifications. 4.2.1. Massive IoT Massive IoT is focused on low-cost devices,
    small data volumes, and extreme coverage. It is intended to enable increased network
    coverage, longer device lifespan, and high connection density, which is known
    as mMTC. Ericsson identified the massive IoT as LPWA technology, as classified
    by 3GPP, employed on licensed spectrum bands. Massive IoT is employed when low-complexity
    devices, long battery life, extensive coverage, and massive deployments are necessary.
    Massive IoT applications (i.e., smart building, retail, shopping, and manufacturing;
    smart home systems; personal IoT devices; etc.) tend to tolerate delays at various
    levels in operation [52], [53], [54]. Hence, LTE-M, EC-GSM-IoT, and NB-IoT were
    developed by 3GPP to support the massive IoT [55] in which according to Ericsson’s
    projection massive IoT will make up 51 percent of CIoT connections by 2027 [56].
    4.2.2. Broadband IoT The broadband IoT provides significantly faster data transfer
    speeds and reduced latency compared to the massive IoT, which was released based
    on mobile broadband [50]. The broadband IoT is evolving due to the requirements
    of accessing multimedia information with high throughput, low latency, and large
    data volumes for communication purposes. The broadband IoT is designed for high-bandwidth
    applications, such as video surveillance and remote health monitoring. Due to
    its capability of supporting high-speed data transfer, it enables devices to transmit
    numerous data quickly and efficiently, which is relevant in healthcare applications
    (e.g., where high-resolution images and data-intensive information is transmitted
    in real-time). 4.2.3. Critical IoT The critical IoT is necessary when the industrial
    IoT (IIoT) and mission-critical applications that require ultrahigh performance,
    very high availability (99.999%), ultra-reliability, and ultralow latency are
    in demand [57]. Unlike the massive IoT, applications of the critical IoT that
    require a minimal delay, such as smart healthcare (e.g., remote surgery), industrial
    automation in smart manufacturing [22], autonomous driving, asset tracking, traffic
    safety and control, and remote control of the sensitive components of a smart
    grid automation [58], are particularly sensitive to delays. Critical IoT applications
    are technically known as URLLC, comprising industrial control, robotic machines,
    and autonomous vehicles [32] that require real-time data transmission. Ultra-reliable,
    very low latency, and very high availability are the key performance indicators
    of the critical IoT [54]. 4.2.4. Industrial automation IoT The IIoT targets improving
    the operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability of industrial processes
    and systems that require unique network deployments. The IIoT is designed for
    applications in manufacturing and industrial process automation [46], achieving
    increased reliability, reduced latency, higher data transfer rates, greater flexibility,
    and secure communication. The IIoT is the focus and enabler of Industry 4.0 [32],
    [59], [60], enhancing the controlling capability with remote monitoring applications,
    such as smart factories, agricultural monitoring, and industrial assets [61].
    The IIoT is primarily applied in IoT applications that demand Ethernet protocol
    integration, time-sensitive networking, clock synchronization services, and other
    requirements. Furthermore, in these industrial real time applications proper implementation
    and effective design of deep learning algorithms are necessary aiming for high
    performance in terms of reliability, speed, and security. Deep learning provides
    a dynamic optimization of the warehouse facilities, enhances assembly line performance,
    improves the generative design, predicts future demands, and reduces errors [62].
    Moreover, low cost and complexity are the most important factors in the IIoT [63].
    5. CIoT technologies This section discusses CIoT technology from various perspectives.
    Initially, 3GPP collated cellular network technology for the IoT in Rel. 13 included
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and in Rel. 17 the NR-RedCap. As illustrated in Table
    3, we summarize the fundamental parameters of the first Rel. 13 for the three
    types of CIoT technology and the first NR-RedCap Rel. 17 technology. 3GPP worked
    on the EC-GSM-IoT (a complete backward-compatible solution for CIoT that builds
    upon the existing GSM or enhanced-GPRS (eGPRS) deployments) under the 850–900
    MHz and 1800–1900 MHz frequency bandwidth with the aim of achieving extended battery
    life and lower device costs compared to general packet radio service (GPRS) or
    GSM devices. It also has extended coverage of up to 164 dB maximum coupling loss
    (MCL) for 33 dBm UE and 154 dB MCL for 23 dBm UE, with variable rates using Gaussian
    minimum shift keying (GMSK) ranging from approximately 350 bps to 70 kbps, and
    eight-phase shift keying (8PSK) up to 240 kbps. The technology can handle a large
    number of devices, with around 50,000 per cell, and provides enhanced security
    compared to GSM orEDGE. It can be installed through a software update to the GSM
    infrastructure [66]. Table 3. First release parameter values of the CIoT (LTE-M,

    Moreover, as shown in the table, the first release of LTE-M, Cat-0, was out on
    Rel. 12 in March 2015 to be configured as a UE Cat-0 (Cat-0 MTC) IoT version.
    In Rel. 13 in March 2016, LTE enhanced MTC or Cat-M1 (Cat-1 MTC) IoT, and the
    NB-IoT was released to afford IoT applications. In the combined Cat-0 and Cat-M1,
    LTE-M was introduced to contribute a 1 Mbps data-rate capacity, supporting full
    mobility features with a battery life exceeding a duration of 10 years, which
    can be configured easily with a software update to the LTE infrastructure. In
    the multiple access techniques, both Cat-0 and Cat-M1 in the UL transmission scenario
    support the single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) methods,
    and in the downlink scenario, they both employ orthogonal frequency-division multiple
    access (OFDMA). However, Cat-0 and Cat-M1 have differences in terms of the UL
    and DL bandwidth coverage. The former has a 20 MHz bandwidth, and the latter has
    a 1.4 MHz bandwidth derived from the legacy LTE. The coverage or link budget of
    Cat-0 is around 141 and is 156 dB for Cat-M1 [43]. In contrast, the NB-IoT was
    developed from an LTE or GSM network with 200 kHz of physical resource blocks
    (PRBs) and a clean sheet format of 180 kHz that can be compatible with a software
    update to the existing legacy LTE or GSM systems under the 700, 800 and 900 MHz
    frequency bandwidth. Because the NB-IoT utilizes many of the same design aspects
    as LTE, including channel modulation, coding schemes, and higher-layer protocols,
    it provides deployment flexibility and is primarily designed to address ultralow-end
    IoT applications [65], [68]. The NB-IoT introduces two modes of operation types,
    different from the LTE, where the whole PRB is assigned to a single piece of UE
    in the UL and DL. In the single-tone mode, the NB-IoT utilizes one PRB that has
    a bandwidth of 180 kHz in both the DL and UL of the LTE spectrum. However, in
    the multitone mode, the resource units are allocated to multiple pieces of UE
    to attain the massive device deployment objective of the CIoT, specifically for
    the NB-IoT. The NB-IoT system assigns each tone a transmission bandwidth of either
    3.75 or 15 kHz for UL transmission using the SC-FDMA scheme. For DL transmission,
    15 kHz transmission bandwidth is used with the OFDMA scheme similar to LTE. Using
    15 kHz spacing, NB-IoT can allocate either one or multiple tones (three, six,
    or twelve) to different UE with durations of 4, 2, and 1 ms, respectively. However,
    with 3.75 kHz spacing, only a single-tone allocation is supported for various
    users, with 48 sub-carriers of 32 ms duration [69], which allows the NB-IoT for
    increased deployment flexibility and higher system capacity. From the Rel. 13
    specifications, the data rate in the single-tone allocation is 48 kbps for the
    UL, 64 kbps for the multitone mode, and 128 kbps in the single- and multitone
    modes in the DL, with a 20 dB link budget from the legacy LTE of 144 dB supporting
    more than 10 years of battery life but without mobility support [70]. In addition,
    3GPP introduced RedCap on 5G device specifications with reduced features in Rel.
    17, designed objectively to simplify the standard NR technology. In the 5G technology,
    it is insufficient to reuse traditional existing frequency bands for high-end
    5G requirements, so another new and varied frequency band is needed. For 5G NR,
    frequency band 1 (FR1) is below 6 GHz or 4.10 to 7.125 GHz, and frequency band
    2 (FR2) is above 6 GHz or 24.250 to 52.600 GHz [71]. Hence, RedCap is supposed
    to use 20 MHz for FR1 and 50 and 100 MHz for FR2 in the UL and DL bandwidths,
    respectively [67]. The multiple access method is FDMA or time division multiple
    access (TDMA), where frequency or time slot is employed. The peak data rate varies
    based on the use cases (e.g., 2 Mbps is expected for wireless industry sensors,
    25 Mbps for wearables, and 150 Mbps (DL and UL) for surveillance applications).
    Moreover, after Rel. 13, 3GPP added subsequent enhancements to the current releases.
    The subsequent sections discuss these CIoT technologies in detail, considering
    their focuses, features, and applications. Following is a detailed explanation
    of each CIoT technology, including their unique features, applications, focuses,
    and review state of the art. In this section, we will explore the different CIoT
    technologies available, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, and discuss
    how they are being used in various industries and sectors. Download : Download

    5.1. EC-GSM-IoT 3GPP standardized it to support IoT applications in Rel. 13 using
    the Technical Specifications Group GSM RAN using LTE-advanced pro [7], [75], [76].
    Its development can be considered a great success because it only requires design
    reuse and software upgrades to deploy EC-GSM-IoT in the existing 2G GSM or eGPRS
    network without needing new network infrastructure. It plays a pivotal service
    in M2M or IoT communications in the form of voice, data, and SMS. Moreover, most
    sub-Saharan African subscriptions are still GSM or EDGE, which is vital for MTC
    and global IoT deployment [77]. In particular, the EC-GSM-IoT technology is intended
    to facilitate the use of IoT devices in areas with difficult radio coverage and
    can operate in frequency deployments as narrow as 600 kHz. Operators and companies,
    such as Broadcom Corporation, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Gemalto NV, Intel Corporation,
    KDDI Corporation, LG Electronics, MediaTek, Nokia, Oberthur Technologies, Ooredoo,
    Orange, Samsung Electronics, Saudi Telecom Company, Sierra Wireless, Telit Communications,
    and VimpelCom, are also trying to use it with 3G and 4G mobile networks [78].
    As shown in Table 4, the maximum UL-DL instantaneous peak data rates from the
    Rel. 14 to Rel. 17, in the 8PSK modulation, is 489.6 kbps both in DL and UL, 153.6
    kbps in GMSK modulation in the UL [45], [72]. The channel bandwidth is 200 kHz,
    and the device capacity (i.e., devices/km ) is around 60,000. Additionally, the
    technology uses CE through message repetitions [31], [73]. Indeed, the GSM technology
    is well-established, and it still plays an important role in the deployment of
    IoT. With the upgrades implemented by 3GPP in Rel. 13, GSM offers advantages in
    terms of time, coverage footprint, and cost that are crucial for IoT development.
    In addition, spectrum availability is an essential controlling factor of the CIoT
    and its innovation capability, growth rate, and development paths. Backward compatibility
    has been applied to use the existing devices and network in the EC-GSM-IoT deployment.
    As illustrated in [79], only new synchronization, the broadcast control channel,
    and common control channels on time slot 1 of the broadcast control channel carrier
    are required for EC-GSM-IoT functioning. The extended Discontinuous Reception
    (eDRX) with radio control level enhancements provides several advantages, including
    extended battery life, lower device cost in comparison to GPRS or GSM devices,
    improved coverage, and variable rates. The technology can accommodate a large
    number of devices while offering improved security features. As shown in Fig.
    4, the 3GPP did efforts to enhance the EC-GSM-IoT service levels to cope with
    the requirements of IoT application requirements. Enhancements on EC-GSM-IoT have
    been done including achieving reduced complexity, low device power consumption,
    ensuring support of a massive number of CIoT devices and backward compatibility
    with GSM, securing low-device cost, improving end-user security, and so on. In
    the consequent release, Rel.14, fundamentally, they developed three enhancement
    requirement objectives including improving the positioning of devices, coverage
    for 23 dBm devices, and new time slots (TSs) mapping in extended coverage for
    improved resource handling [45]. In EC-GSM-IoT, there are four coverage classes,
    namely CC1, CC2, CC3, and CC4, that are assigned to different channels. Each coverage
    class determines the number of blind repetitions in the DL channel, which are
    1, 8, 16, and 32 respectively. Similarly, in the UL channel, the coverage classes
    determine the number of blind repetitions as 1, 4, 16, and 48 respectively that
    can help to attain the MCL [28]. In Rel.15, feature enhancements such as supporting
    multicast to operate in extended coverage in both UL and DL, incorporating coverage
    class CC5 and CC6 to attain 33 dBm, mobility support, and power consumption reduction
    techniques (e.g., eDRX, paging) were employed. In Rel.16, enhancements in localization,
    power consumption reduction (eDRX, WUS, paging, Preconfigured UL Resources (PUR)),
    and improved multicarrier operation. The PUR is employed to allocate radio resources
    to a UE in advance, enabling the transmission of UL data without requiring a connection
    setup process. In Rel.17, enhancements have been incorporated into EC-GSM-IoT
    to better meet the requirements of application scenarios. These enhancements focus
    on improving the battery lifecycle, device density, and link budget. Download

    countries, after Rel.15, since the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. They are shifting to
    5G and confirmed the LTE-M and NB-IoT are a candidate for CIoT technology in addition
    to RedCap. Instead of EC-GSM-IoT, they are focused on LTE improvements and 5G
    NR so that no further EC-GSM-IoT feature enhancement is applied. However, in the
    Middle East, South-East Asia, and Africa, 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile networks are still
    applicable, know that it can co-exist with 3G, and 4G mobile networks, EC-GSM-IoT
    is serving well even though demand for 5G is getting high. In spite of the relatively
    lesser attention the EC-GSM-IoT network receives than the LTE-M and NB-IoT networks,
    EC-GSM-IoT still offers some promising applications. In fact, it is a good solution
    for IoT deployment in developing countries, where cellular networks are primarily
    used for voice and other locations where GSM coverage exceeds LTE coverage. 5.2.
    LTE-M Under the 3GPP feasibility study titled “Study on Provision of Low-Cost
    MTC UEs Based on LTE”, LTE-M started in September 2011, earlier than the EC-GSM-IoT
    and NB-IoT [84]. The main objective was to enhance the LTE device capabilities
    in the low-end MTC domain, present an option for the GPRS and EGPRS devices, and
    roam GSM networks to LTE. At the time, eGPRS was incompatible with supporting
    more devices and was not cost-effective for MTC devices. They aimed to provide
    a solution with device complexity and cost to facilitate better requirement satisfaction
    regarding data rates, spectrum efficiency, and power consumption than the eGPRS.
    In 2012, in addition to the mentioned requirements, the group extended coverage
    improvement over the normal LTE coverage capacity by at least 20 dB to support
    deep indoor coverage, as summarized in as shown in Table 5. Furthermore, LTE devices
    were more expensive than GSM or eGPRS, so it was worth reducing the device cost
    to address the low-end mMTC use cases. The LTE-M release feature enhancements
    increased the number of supported devices per cell, from 361,000 to 1,000,000
    devices/km allowing for more IoT devices to connect to a single BS, enabling better
    use of the available spectrum and improved scalability. New CE techniques (i.e.,
    Mode A, a moderate number of retransmissions with 32 repetitions, and Mode B,
    a high number of repetitions with 2,048 repetitions, from Rel. 14 forward) are
    introduced to improve the QoS for IoT devices operating in remote or challenging
    environments [85]. Through shorter transmission time intervals, the latency is
    reduced from 50 to 100 ms in Rel. 12 to 10 to 15 ms in recent releases [82]. The
    LTE-M release enhancements increased the maximum number of HARQ processes from
    eight to 10 to improve the reliability of data transmissions, reducing the number
    of retransmissions needed to deliver data to IoT devices, improving overall system
    efficiency and reliability, and reducing latency. The HARQ allows for more flexibility
    in determining the type and amount of retransmitted data, as explained by [86].
    Compared with other CIoT components, LTE-M has important features (see Fig. 5).
    LTE-M is considered the most suitable LPWA technology for IoT applications that
    need high data rates, low latency, and full mobility, including voice, under standard
    coverage conditions. It is also an ideal choice for IoT applications that require
    deep coverage, where the demands for latency, mobility, and data speed are less
    rigorous. Indeed, LTE-M is a highly adaptable LPWA technology that can cater to
    both lower and higher data rates, with its system bandwidth being flexible and
    capable of accommodating 1.4 MHz or more. It can handle real-time traffic, full
    mobility, and voice features. In general, in the form of low-cost devices and
    coverage improvements, Rel. 14 and Rel. 15 further developed the standard, as
    shown in Table 5. In addition, MTC was further enhanced for LTE [82], commonly
    referred to as the “feMTC” work item in Rel. 14, which brought further enhanced
    improvements for supporting higher data speeds, improved voice over long-term
    evolution (VoLTE) support, improved positioning, multicast support, and the new
    LTE device, Cat-M2. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat-M2, unlike the normal LTE UE for
    IoT applications that require a higher data rate (e.g., wearables, such as smartwatches)
    but lower device cost. The UE Cat-M2 has a UE bandwidth of 5 MHz and can achieve
    peak rates of around 4 Mbps for the DL and 7 Mbps for the UL, assuming it supports
    FD-FDD operations [87]. For UE that supports HD-FDD, these peak rates are roughly
    half of the aforementioned figures, and for UE that supports time division duplex,
    the peak rates depend on the DL/UL subframe configuration, as stated in [82].
    The Cat-M2 UE supports larger maximum TBSs for unicast transmission than Cat-M1
    UE. Valuable enhancements have been provided in each release, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. Rel. 13 enhanced by employing coverage enhancement modes (CE mode A and
    B), improved device type having lower complexity and cost, enabled VoLTE in HD
    mode and introduced additional power saving features (eDRX) than Rel. 12 that
    was featured as lower complexity (a single receive antenna) and low-cost devices
    (Cat-0), HD operation, supports a lower data rate requirement (Max: 1 Mbps) and
    PSM enhancements for the UE. Rel. 14 further enhanced LTE-M, offering further
    developments than Rel. 13 regarding mobility, data rate, HARQ processing, new
    Cat-2 specifications, supporting positioning features, and additional power consumption
    management techniques [82]. The other power-saving mechanism developed in Rel.
    14, the Release Assistance Indication (RAI) feature is employed to conserve power
    by permitting the network to terminate a connection that is no longer required.
    By turning off the device radio and freeing network resources sooner, RAI can
    help to minimize battery consumption. A Rel. 15 work item that added use cases,
    increased spectrum efficiency, and additional benefits even further enhanced MTC
    (efeMTC) for LTE [88] while reducing latency and power consumption. Particularly,
    LTE-M is suited for industry operations with mobility features that must be tracked
    and monitored while moving. In Rel. 15, the central objective was to improve latency,
    spectral efficiency, and power consumption further. Potential enhancements to
    enhance latency include reducing the system acquisition time (e.g., improving
    the BS search or system information acquisition performance) and supporting EDT.
    To increase system capacity, spectral efficiency was improved in the DL by introducing
    higher-order modulation (64 QAM), and in the UL by enabling more precise resource
    allocation using sub-PRB granularity, as stated in [89]. To reduce power consumption,
    several possible enhancements could help including the implementation of EDT,
    sub-PRB resource allocation, WUSs, novel synchronization signals, improved HARQ
    feedback, and less stringent measurements for cell reselection [81], [88], [90].
    Rel. 15 offered even further enhancements of increased spectral efficiency, latency
    improvement, and lower power class. In Rel. 16, 5G integration has been realized
    to share 5G capabilities, CE for non-bandwidth reduced low complexity, standalone
    development, and mobility improvements. Rel. 17 [91], [92] introduced a maximum
    DL TBS of 1736 bits, 14 HARQ processes, and traffic management capabilities. In
    each release, enhancements in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient
    solutions have been integrated. Download : Download high-res image (465KB) Download

    [44] 5.3. NB-IoT The NB-IoT is a promising technology for the massive IoT specifically
    designed for low data-rate applications [14]. Improving the design of the UL/DL
    Rx to function effectively in situations where the signal-to-noise ratio is extremely
    low is pivotal [96]. The latency is enhanced between 1.6 and 10 s [97] with a
    maximum of one or two HARQ techniques. The maximum TBS in Rel. 14 was enhanced
    to 2536 b in the DL and UL by applying the HARQ process [65]. The NB-IoT has three
    deployment options and can be deployed inside an LTE carrier (in-band in 3, 5,
    10, 15, and 20 MHz LTE bandwidths), in its guard-band (in 10 MHz LTE carriers),
    or its own designated spectrum (standalone, 200 kHz in the GSM band) [65], [98],
    [99], [100]. When a guardband is applied, NB-IoT devices transmit data with great
    performance and efficiency while avoiding interfering with regular voice or data
    traffic on cellular networks. It can be considered a new radio access technology
    that is different from EC-GSM-IoT and LTE-M with no backward compatibility [101].
    In Rel. 14, it was intended to optimize the battery efficiency for up to 35 years
    with extended coverage of 164 dB [27] with transmission repetitions, power boosting,
    software modifications enhancing transport layer protocols [102], low complexity,
    support for a massive number of devices, improved power efficiency, and 10 s or
    less latency with positioning and multicast features [103]. The ITU and 3GPP’s
    mMTC performance criteria are further met by NB-IoT Rel. 15 (2018), which can
    fulfill 5G IoT requirements. It provides IoT connectivity with high data rates
    and reliable communication, boosting the 5G capacity while increasing IoT connectivity
    [104]. These requirements comprise high-performance and low-complexity features
    with an improved spectral efficiency and data rate [8]. Recently, 6G IoT has been
    studied extensively regarding the convergence of the 6G and IoT on five key domains:
    healthcare IoT, vehicular IoT and autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), satellite IoT, and IIoT [105] in which 3GPP must work on the CIoT to support
    these stringent requirements. CIoT is also envisioned to support monitoring real-time
    applications in UAVs under the circumstances of Age of Information (AoI) handling
    status. As shown in Table 6, the same way as LTE-M, in each release; enhancements
    in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient solutions are recorded.
    As shown in Fig. 6, enhancements made available in each release including low
    device power consumption, higher density, improved indoor coverage, reduced complexity,
    ultra-low device cost, optimized network architecture, cell reselection in the
    idle state, and Cat-NB1; power consumption and latency reduction (DL and UL for
    2 HARQ processes and larger maximum TBS), new power class of 14 dBm, Cat-NB2,
    multicast, higher data rate, location and positioning protocol OTDOA, non-anchor
    PRB enhancements, mobility, and service continuity enhancements; improved latency,
    improved power consumption(WUS, EDT), improved cell range, support TDD, higher
    spectral efficiency, improved load control, enhance cell acquisition, D2D communication;
    reduced control-signaling overhead, coexistence with NR, better UE energy efficiency,
    scheduling enhancement, better UL or DL transmission efficiency, improved multi-carrier
    operation, 2-step PRACH; enabling data transmission in RRC inactive mode, intra-UE
    multiplexing, positioning enhancement targeting factory automation, extend peak
    data rate, time synchronization enhancements, 2-HARQ process enhancement, CSI
    enhancements in the subsequent releases. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat. NB2 has developed
    with lower device cost and supports a massive number of IoT devices 8̃0,000 in
    an urban environment. In resolving energy-consumption problems, they employed
    solutions including PSM, I-eDRX, C-DRX, and cell reselection in addition to the
    eDRX. In Rel. 15 [95], 3GPP introduced the RRC-connected inactive state, which
    can benefit low data transmission optimization for devices operating for a short
    period. It is because of the substantial battery consumption, high demand for
    specialized resources, and high measurement reports and handovers, keeping the
    device in the RRC-connected state without active data transfer is not financially
    advantageous. The NB-IoT shortens the network monitoring duration for UE in idle
    mode, reduces the unnecessary startup of receiving cells, and reduces power consumption.
    Furthermore, Rel. 15 introduced the following energy efficiency solutions, as
    illustrated in Table 6. Wake-up signaling for IDLE mode (FDD) is served in an
    energy efficiency solution, reducing energy consumption. In communications, UE
    must frequently determine whether a paging message is from the core network when
    in DRX or eDRX. When paging is available, the UE mostly does not receive a message,
    and power is saved. With this capability, the BS can advise the UE to watch the
    narrowband physical DL control channel for paging by sending it an NB-IoT WUS
    (NWUS) introduced in Rel. 15 [106] to enhance the device energy efficiency, but
    otherwise, the UE is free to ignore the paging operations. NWUS enables the UE
    to potentially keep some of its hardware off for longer periods while saving the
    energy required to decode the narrowband physical DL control channel and shared
    channel for paging. The time the network allows the UE to “wake up” after receiving
    an NWUS determines whether the UE can maintain only one Rx switched on for WUS
    detection, leaving most of the UE conventional hardware in a very low-power state.
    The other viable solution is scheduling requests, included in the Rel. 13 and
    Rel. 14 NB-IoT as a higher-layer procedure that causes a random-access process
    to request enough UL resources to send a buffer status report. In addition, Rel.
    15 has provided new, more resource and power-effective methods to accomplish this
    goal that the BS can configure, the EDT. The EDT is an idle mode with a bitrate
    of 328 to 1000 bits. For example, UE can send data in msg 3 of the random-access
    procedure [107]. The random-access operation ends if a BS successfully receives
    a signal and the UE does not switch to connected mode. If the UE waiting data
    are less than the maximum permissible size established by the BS, the UE requests
    a grant for EDT by transmitting its preamble using a preconfigured set of narrowband
    physical random-access channel resources. To save energy on transmitting padding
    bits, the BS can authorize the UE to transmit fewer data than the maximum allowed
    size [106]. Due to minimizing the signaling overhead and message latency, the
    battery life is prolonged [19]. 5.4. RedCap The RedCap approach was created to
    address use cases (IIoT, video surveillance, and wearables) in IoT requirements
    that cannot be met using the EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, or LTE-M [44], [108] operating
    at a higher data rate and reliability with lower latency than LTE-M and the NB-IoT.
    It offers a lower cost, lower complexity, and longer battery life than NR eMBB
    and wider coverage than URLLC. Some requirements often necessitate higher reliability
    and quicker response time than those offered by LTE-M and the NB-IoT, while still
    maintaining lower complexity and expenses, as well as longer battery life compared
    to eMBB and URLLC services. The RedCap interface is designed to bridge the gap
    between the intricate and expensive 5G-NR interface that caters to eMBB and URLLC
    services and the lower data rates and increased latency of NB-IoT and LTE-M interfaces
    that support mMTC services. Under the study item “Low complexity NR devices” [67],
    in June 2019, 3GPP introduced RedCap NR devices in Rel. 17 with lower cost, lower
    complexity, and longer battery life compared to regular NR devices. In addition,
    RedCap was introduced to meet the low-cost, large-bandwidth, medium data rate,
    and no latency no delay tolerance IoT service requirements [31]. Hence, RedCap
    inherits the majority of the key advantages of NR. These include the ability to
    connect to the 5G core network, which is a cloud-based platform with a service-based
    architecture, support for a very broad range of frequency bands (FR1 and FR2 and
    millimeter-wave bands), network energy efficiency due to the ultra-flexible design,
    forward-compatible and beam-based air interfaces, and support for millimeter-wave
    bands [30]. As depicted in Fig. 7, enhancements have been incorporated in each
    release of RedCap. The applications use cases that are targeted include wearables,
    medical sensors, remote surgery, industrial sensors, surveillance cameras, and
    others. Rel. 17 of RedCap offers a multitude of enhancements that make it a cutting-edge
    solution for IoT applications. One of the most notable features is its ability
    to provide slicing capabilities, creating virtual networks within a single physical
    network, increasing network efficiency, and ensuring optimal resource utilization
    [67]. The positioning component of Rel. 17 has also been improved, providing more
    accurate location-based services and enabling new location-based applications.
    Furthermore, this release boasts a large capacity for storing and processing data,
    making it ideal for handling large volumes of IoT data. The UE energy-efficient
    operation component ensures that the end-user experience is optimized for energy
    efficiency, reducing the overall carbon footprint of IoT devices [30]. In addition,
    Rel. 17 is highly cost-effective and offers low latency, making it an attractive
    solution for a wide range of IoT applications and budgets [109]. In Fig. 7, one
    of the key advancements in Rel. 18 is supporting higher transmission rates, providing
    faster data transfer, and enabling new applications that require higher bandwidth.
    Another major improvement is the support for the unlicensed spectrum, which expands
    the available spectrum for IoT devices and enables new use cases. Advanced positioning
    technology has also been incorporated, further improving location-based services
    and enabling new location-based applications [29]. Integrating side-link near-field
    communications allows for direct communication between devices, providing a new
    level of convenience and enabling new use cases. In addition, it takes steps to
    reduce the complexity of RedCap UE further, making it even more user-friendly
    and accessible. Finally, the addition of device-to-device (D2D) communication
    expands the communication options for IoT devices, making it easier to connect
    and communicate with other devices in a local network. These enhancements and
    new features make Rel. 18 of RedCap CIoT necessary for anyone aiming to remain
    at the forefront of IoT technology. RedCap has unique features incorporated with
    5G NR services and was objectively designed to maintain lower complexity devices
    with 20 or 100 MHz maximum bandwidth in sub-7 or millimeter-wave with one or two
    Rx antennae. Additionally, 3GPP introduced this standard [61] due to RedCap’s
    ability to coexist with URLLC features, use higher frequency bands, and apply
    other 5G features, such as network slicing. For instance, RedCap is designed to
    provide significantly faster data rates than previous CIoT technology compared
    to the data rate specified in Rel. 17 using a higher frequency band, multiple-input
    multiple-output technology, advanced modulation techniques, advanced beamforming
    features, and network slicing. Use cases for RedCap are less battery-life-intensive
    than mMTC use cases, but they are more demanding for throughput and latency. However,
    a higher data rate of up to 100 Mbps is required to accommodate live video feed,
    visual production, and process automation [30]. This approach enables new use
    cases and applications that were previously impossible [9]. In addition to the
    transmission rate, in machine-to-machine collaboration and real-time remote control,
    ultra-low communication latency is expected at around 1 ms. Communication latency
    can be raised from the physical layer latency and scheduling latency problems
    [112]. However, for the time being, in the higher requirement scenario, it is
    possible to achieve a latency of 10 to 30 ms to support applications like remote
    drone operation, cooperative farm machinery, time-critical sensing and feedback,
    and remote vehicle operations. Higher communication reliability in mission and
    time-critical applications, for example, autonomous vehicles, remote surgery,
    and smart factories, is not an option to compromise but should be kept stable
    [9]. In IIoT, data transmission security is the top demand to make sensitive information
    extremely secure and highly available on demand. For Rel. 17 RedCap features [111],
    3GPP also added extra features in future Rel. 18 work, depicted in Fig. 7. Download

    [31], [109], [110], [111] Furthermore, localization or positioning increases network
    complexity, potential overhead, and accuracy degradation and can include power,
    time, and space domain localization [66]. Positioning or localization in the MTC
    has become difficult due to the complication of environments, sensor errors, and
    device motions, as Le et al. [24] investigated. Supporting location-based service
    applications is crucial for some IoT applications, such as tracking items. Although
    a smaller BS density has an advantage in the IoT scenario, a higher BS density
    is an important factor in localization with small BSs. In addition to environment
    complexity, other problems in positioning are end device-related errors, environment-related
    errors, BS-related errors, and data-related errors [24]. Hence, positioning accuracy
    can be supported by different mechanisms, including received signal strength (RSS),
    time difference of arrival [24], and channel-state information [113]. Regarding
    the D2D Protocol, communication between devices, such as wearables, that can directly
    communicate with nearby smartphones or connected vehicles is supported by RedCap
    [114]. It is enabled via sideline communication over a shared RF channel in which
    the cellular BS provides a synchronization signal that enables direct D2D communication,
    which can also improve communication efficiency, reduce latency, and extend network
    coverage and capacity. Most importantly, RedCap supports the Unlicensed Spectrum.
    In 3GPP’s EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, there is no support for sub-GHz license-free
    frequency bands (unlicensed spectrum). There have been efforts, such as MulteFire
    Alliance [115] that have been working on expanding IoT services with LPWAN support
    in the 800/900 MHz band (902 to 928 MHz band in the United States and 863 to 870
    MHz band in the European Union) with NB-IoT unlicensed and 2.4 GHz with extended
    MTC unlicensed. RedCap uses unlicensed spectrum bands under both licensed and
    unlicensed standards and regulatory requirements to address spectrum scarcity
    issues. Due to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming
    manifested in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require
    low latency, ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. RedCap
    contributes to services that require more capabilities than the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    and NB-IoT but are lower than URLLC and eMBB machines including process monitoring
    (pressure sensors, humidity sensors, and thermometers), self-diagnosis and maintenance
    (motion sensors, accelerometers, and actuators), and video-assisted applications
    (asset monitoring and augmented reality) [108]. According to TR 22.832, TS 22.104,
    and TR 22.804, [110] as summarized in Table 7, reference use cases and requirements
    are as follows. End-to-end latency is less than 100 ms, and communication services
    are 99.99% available. For all usage situations, the reference bit rate is less
    than 2 Mbps, and the device is immobile. This reference bit rate may be asymmetric,
    such as in high UL traffic [111]. At least a couple of years should pass between
    charges. Safety-related sensors, such as smart factories, require less delay (5
    to 10 ms). Generally, time-critical sensing and feedback, augmented reality, safety-related
    sensors, and remote drone operations are applications in industrial sensors. For
    instance, the goal of the smart grid is to create a more sustainable and efficient-energy
    infrastructure that can meet the needs of an increasingly connected and energy-intensive
    world. In IIoT, a specific application known as the power IoT focuses on smart
    grids to attain automatic optimized data collection and exchange of information,
    as well as smart energy management [116]. 6. Focuses of CIoT technologies One
    of the focuses of the CIoT is to provide extended coverage in areas where traditional
    cellular networks may not reach, including indoor and underground locations and
    remote or rural areas. This reach is achieved using a narrowband frequency for
    better signal penetration and greater range. Another key role of the CIoT is to
    offer efficient and cost-effective connectivity for a broad scope of IoT applications,
    from smart cities and homes to agriculture, transportation, and healthcare. With
    its low-power consumption and ability to facilitate numerous connected devices,
    the CIoT enables a broad range of use cases, including asset tracking, remote
    monitoring, and sensor networks [38]. For instance, international roaming can
    be considered one important focus of the EC-GSM-IoT, minimizing device complexity
    and cost. Because the EC-GSM-IoT has coexisted with 2G mobile networks, it has
    benefited significantly from all the security and privacy features provided by
    mobile networks including various measures to ensure user confidentiality and
    privacy, such as the protection of user identity, authentication protocols, data
    encryption to ensure confidentiality, measures to maintain data integrity, and
    identification of mobile equipment [73]. LTE-M, on the other hand, targets medium-sized
    IoT applications supporting voice and video services. Therefore, it is a better
    candidate technology for over-the-air firmware updates during the life span of
    IoT devices [26]. Unlike the NB-IoT, LTE-M is better suited for mobile devices
    to avoid connection and data loss and provides higher data rates that would enable
    more use cases, such as VoLTE vehicles, fleet management, tracking devices, and
    related use cases [117]. Moreover, LTE-M can be used in video surveillance systems
    because it supports higher data rates and can transmit real-time video data. In
    addition, the NB-IoT is primarily designed for ultralow-end and latency insensitive
    or delay tolerant IoT applications [68]. It focuses on fixed indoor coverage in
    areas where signal loss and multitiered layers have posed problems. NB1 UE, for
    example, operates only in the 200 kHz bandwidth with IoT devices imposing ultralow
    complexity for services without strict data rate, latency, or mobility requirements
    but that requires a massive deployment of low-cost devices [65]. Lastly, according
    to 3GPP and Ericsson [44], [51], RedCap has many use cases and is highly necessary
    to work in extremely harsh environments. RedCap was introduced with lower hardware
    complexity at more affordable prices. It aims for terrestrial coverage and targets
    exchanging data over the satellite with the aim of ubiquitous coverage area (referred
    to as NTN communication) [109]. It is possible to run a RedCap device on an NR
    carrier optimized for eMBB or time-critical communications. The objective of the
    study group on the NR-RedCap has been emphasizing reduced UE complexity, such
    as a reduced number of antennae, reduced UE bandwidth, HD-FDD, and other aspects.
    Compared to high-end eMBB and URLLC devices of Rel. 15/16, the primary driving
    force of the new device type is to reduce device cost and complexity, which is
    true for industrial sensors [109]. The standard must allow for a device design
    with a compact form factor to support most use cases, and all FR1/FR2 bands for
    FDD and time division duplex should be supported by the system [110]. As shown
    in Table 7, video cameras, for instance, lead to higher data-rate requirements
    than can be satisfied by the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT. Smart cities, smart
    farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly installed
    surveillance cameras. According to TR 22.804, a reference economic video bitrate
    would be 2 to 4 Mbps with a latency of 500 ms or less and a reliability of 99%
    to 99.9% [110]. High-quality video, for example, for farming, would require 7.5
    to 25 Mbps [30]. As explained in [3], reference bitrates for smart wearable applications
    can range from 5 to 50 Mbps in the DL and 2 to 5 Mbps in the UL. The device’s
    peak bit rates can reach 150 Mbps in the DL and 50 Mbps in the UL [30]. The battery
    should last one to two weeks for wearables, as reviewed in Fig. 7. Rel. 17 for
    RedCap devices introduced power-saving techniques to extend battery life and enable
    longer usage times. These are; eDRX for RRC idle and inactive states and RRM relaxation
    for stationary devices. In eDRX, when DRX cycles are utilized, it can achieve
    up to 10 485.76 s, almost 3 h when the RRC is idle, and up to 10.24 s when the
    RRC is inactive. In demanding RedCap use cases, such as industrial wireless sensors,
    eDRX proves to be a valuable solution in meeting the battery lifetime requirements.
    Regarding the RRM relaxation, in RRC idle and inactive states, the device is required
    to regularly conduct RRM measurements. These measurements are necessary to determine
    and select the best available cell for the device to establish a connection. In
    spite of this, the battery will be depleted even if there is no active data transmission.
    Thus, skip performing RRM measurements under certain thresholds of reference signal
    received power (RSRP) and reference signal received quality (RSRQ) values are
    employed [30]. In addition, the other optional power-saving features, standardized
    in Rel 15 and Rel. 16, are also made available for RedCap devices which offer
    power-saving capabilities to enhance the battery performance. Because of the fast-growing
    need for personal care devices and diagnostics, such as sports, healthcare, and
    fitness devices, wearables have garnered more attention. Devices that are too
    small in size, such as smartwatches, rings, e-health-related devices, and medical
    monitoring devices, are supported by RedCap, which can collect and relay health
    information. The CIoT plays an immense role in healthcare, and healthcare IoT
    (HIoT) is developed and supported by AI, big data, software-defined networks,
    and blockchains [118] with the driving technology; the Internet of Nano Things
    and tactile Internet. The HIoT is implemented in the form of wrist-worn smart
    wearables [119]. As with other IoT application requirements, HIoT prompts low
    latency that can be obtained through edge computing implementation using a large
    volume of data through cloud and edge computing. As most medical applications
    are private, the blockchain has been a solution to secure patient data from third-party
    access risks [120]. In healthcare-based medical operations, it is highly recommended
    to securely transmit sensitive healthcare data to the fog and cloud for processing.
    Ullah et al. [121] recommended fog and cloud-assisted computing as the appropriate
    candidate solutions for these issues. RedCap has an immense role in remote surgery
    applications by integrating wearables, medical sensors, industrial sensors incorporating
    surveillance cameras, and more. For more, we briefly present their detailed features
    in the following sections. 7. Features of CIoT technologies To guarantee that
    CIoT technologies can efficiently provide connectivity solutions for various use
    cases ranging from Massive IoT to Critical IoT, this section outlines essential
    requirements that must be met for the large-scale deployment of these services.
    These include extended coverage areas, low deployment costs, extended battery
    life, affordable device costs, support for a vast number of connected devices
    (scalability), and robust security and privacy measures, we discuss in detail
    as follows. Wide Coverage: Delivering a wider and more extended coverage area
    is one of the main aims of the CIoT. In a wide coverage area, the path range is
    an important parameter that varies inversely with frequency, offering tens of
    kilometers of coverage. Carrier frequency has a significant effect on CE. Although
    the path loss is directly dependent on the size of the carrier frequency, if the
    carrier frequency is high, the propagation loss becomes high. Maintaining a lower
    carrier frequency is important to maximize the coverage in the CIoT to lessen
    propagation loss. For instance, the EC-GSM-IoT is based on the GSM; thus, the
    frequency band of the GSM is highly globally deployed with the four known global
    frequency bands 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz, where coverage is ultimately enhanced
    [73]. Ericsson, Orange, and Intel have tried extending coverage on smart agriculture
    use cases using the EC-GSM-IoT, confirming that it is possible to enhance indoor
    coverage by deploying new software on the existing cellular networks [122]. Moreover,
    CE techniques should be implemented to achieve a wide or deep coverage area (it
    is primarily accomplished by sacrificing the data rate for coverage), which is
    required for two reasons. Implementing reduction techniques in device complexity
    (e.g., minimizing to a single-antenna Rx and lower maximum transmission power)
    may result in performance degradation that directly produces coverage loss. The
    loss of coverage can be maintained by scaling transport block size (TBS), HARQ
    re-transmissions for the physical DL shared channel (PDSCH), PUSCH, physical UL
    control channel (PUCCH), and PDCCH [9], [67]. Second, some CIoT devices could
    encounter extremely difficult coverage circumstances. Hence, transmission time
    interval bundling, sending a limited, predefined number of transmissions without
    feedback instead of sending a block of transmissions once, and narrowband retuning
    are key feature techniques to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. In widening
    the coverage, the objective is to attain a CE of 15 dB compared to GSM and LTE
    [123]. The 3GPP measures CE using the MCL standard, which is the discrepancy between
    the power levels transmitted and received before the signal is lost. Coverage
    can be measured as “kilometers of coverage” but according to the analysis presented
    in [124], it is not adequate since it heavily relies on the carrier frequency
    and environmental factors such as the type of location, whether it is indoors,
    outdoors, urban, suburban, or rural. In contrast, MCL is an appropriate measure
    because it is not influenced by the frequency and environmental aspects. At extreme
    coverage, it is expected to attain 20 dB from the normal LTE or GSM coverage,
    and it is very important to determine exactly how much coverage the CIoTs can
    provide. Apparently, for evaluation, Ericsson, AT and T, KT, SK Telecom by Korea,
    Nokia, Verizon, Altair, Docomo, Sony, SoftBank, TELKOMSEL by Telecom Indonesia,
    Virtuosys, Sequans Communications, KDDI, and Orange conducted a thorough link-level
    simulation inspection to assess the actual coverage performance of 3GPP’s LTE-M
    technology. Their findings discovered that LTE-M is capable of achieving a coverage
    gain of 21 dB compared to older LTE devices, which is higher than the 3GPP target
    of 18 dB. This increase of 21 dB corresponds to a data rate of 1400 bps in the
    DL and 250 bps in the UL. If IoT applications can tolerate slower data rates and
    longer acquisition times, it is possible to achieve a coverage gain beyond 21
    dB without using the BS power spectral density (PSD) boosting [124]. With a 21-dB
    gain with 23 dBm UE (the maximum coverage) and less conservative noise figures,
    LTE-M is a strong competitor for IoT applications that require extensive coverage,
    with a maximum MCL of 164 dB, and where the demands for low latency, high mobility,
    and fast data transfer are less stringent. Moreover, LTE-M has two specifications
    in its CE strategy: Modes A and B. The former mode is mandatory and supports only
    moderate CE, whereas the latter mode, B, supports deep and extended coverage that
    can be considered optional. Common coverage techniques are employed to provide
    CE for the LTE-M specification. The Tx power (e.g., Class 3 power amplifier 23
    dBm and Class 5 power amplifier 20 dBm) is increased by considering the increasing
    cost management, repetition by optimizing accurate channel estimations, and frequency
    tracking to manage the downside of repetition in linearly increasing the latency.
    In addition, PSD boosting improves the DL coverage and reduces the power by employing
    a maximum amount of PSD boosting to 4 dB. These methods are the most feasible
    in CE, as illustrated in [124]. In B5G CIoT [125], a programmable metasurface
    can significantly improve coverage with an intelligent reflecting surface. Through
    the IoT non terrestrial network (NTN) work item in Rel. 17 [91], 3GPP has already
    addressed NTN support for LTE-M and the NB-IoT [114]. Overall, LTE-M can support
    extensive IoT deployments, covering the maximum distance and beyond with the approved
    QoS and minimum maintenance provisions. From the 3GPP standard specification,
    the range of the NB-IoT covers urban and rural areas, outlined as 1 to 2 and 10
    to 15 km, respectively [126], enabling better signal propagation in basements
    (aiming for 20 dB improvement over legacy cellular systems) [127]. A transmission
    time interval bundling, repetition (retransmission, such as 128 and 2,048 times
    in the UL and DL, respectively [89]), and narrowband retuning are employed as
    key features to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. The number of repetitions
    of a transmission is determined by the desired CE level (CEL) for a given set
    of devices. The CEL is the signal strength at a particular location and can be
    influenced by the distance between the Tx and Rx, the transmit power, the Rx sensitivity,
    and interference. The number of tones and sub-carrier spacing, which are the number
    of different frequency components used to transmit data and the distance in frequency
    between adjacent sub-carriers, respectively, also affect the CEL and spectral
    efficiency of a wireless communication system [22]. The increased number of retransmissions
    lowers the spectral efficiency [128], which requires reducing the number of retransmissions.
    However, three CELs are supported by NB-IoT devices: CEL-0 for 0 dB with an MCL
    of 144 dB with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, CEL-1 for 10 dB with an MCL of
    154 dB with 15 kHz spacing, and CEL-2 for 20 dB with an MCL of 164 dB with 3.75
    kHz carrier spacing [79]. In the CE of the NB-IoT, the objective is to attain
    a coverage capacity of 164 dB [123], [129] and guarantee that it can enhance the
    164-dB coverage achieved through repetitions in time, with power amplification
    in in-band and guard-band operation modes [65]. In general, this is preserved
    by implementing repetition, boosting the PSD, reducing the system acquisition
    time, and random-access range enhancement. Based on the findings in [21], the
    coverage of NB-IoT [882 MHz] can be boosted by up to 398% with a mere 10% enhancement
    in Rx sensitivity. Enhancing the coverage by implementing machine learning methods
    using reinforcement learning-based dynamic spectrum access [130] is also feasible.
    The NB-IoT increases the link budget by over 20 dB, significantly enhancing penetration.
    Although reducing the device capabilities can lower the device cost and reduce
    the device size, it has an adverse influence on coverage. For instance, in RedCap,
    reducing the number of antennae and limiting the number of spectrum bands can
    affect device coverage. It is vital to secure the device cost and lower complexity
    simultaneously to enhance the coverage. In RedCap, it is expected to extend 10
    to 15 dB compared to URLLC. Low Power Consumption: Most IoT devices are powered
    by batteries. Therefore, conserving energy to extend their lifespan is vital.
    It is exceptionally demanding to reserve the main power supply by implementing
    longevity in the battery life of the device before recharging is mandated. Devices
    that support lower power consumption have a longer device battery life. In many
    use cases, the CIoTs are supposed to achieve a battery life of up to 10 years.
    The battery usage directly relates to how long the device spends sending and receiving
    data. As research [58] has noted, to maintain a battery life of 5 years, for example,
    a device with a 5000 mAh battery capacity should use no more than 2.74 mAh per
    day. This limit can be achieved by restricting daily battery consumption to below
    5000 mAh/5/365 [58]. Achieving long battery life and reducing maintenance costs
    are critical in applications and equipment with limited battery capacity, which
    makes low energy consumption essential. However, the battery life depends on coverage
    [131]. The objective of 3GPP standards for battery life in the CIoT is to achieve
    10 years of service life in most extreme coverage situations at 164 dB MCL [47]
    (11.9 years is achievable) and 35.7 years at normal coverage (144 dB MCL) [84].
    This feature can also save costs in areas where replacing batteries can be a challenging
    task, such as basements or subterranean tunnels. In minimizing power consumption,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT utilize techniques including the power-saving mode
    (PSM) [132], [133], [134], long periodic tracking area updates (TAU), and eDRX
    which are developed by the 3GPP standards to reduce energy consumption and enable
    an extended life for these devices [80]. The PSM allows modules to enter a sleep
    mode that consumes very little energy (only a few microamps) while sending TAU
    messages at long intervals to remain registered on the network. This approach
    eliminates the need for reregistration when the module wakes. The eDRX feature
    allows devices to enter a low-power paging mode for an extended period of time,
    during which they can receive data from the server but do not need to send data,
    saving power when the device does not need to transmit. In eDRX, an extension
    of 52 min is possible. The PSM can use paging in the DRX or jointly use paging
    and routing area updates (via incoming SMS, voice call, or data) to reach the
    CIoT devices on the network. For devices that prefer a lower periodicity of reachability,
    using eDRX is more advantageous; however, for devices that can tolerate longer
    intervals of inaccessibility, the PSM emerges as an appealing alternative. Furthermore,
    implementing GMSK modulation in the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, influences power
    and energy efficiency. The enhanced coverage common control channel (eCCCH)can
    also contribute to energy efficiency, providing long battery life. Other energy-saving
    techniques besides PSM and eDRX have been developed and employed, such as energy-efficient
    TAU, user and control plane optimizations, energy-efficient paging reception,
    wake-up signal (WUS) calls, and techniques for monitoring cells less frequently.
    Furthermore, RedCap power consumption is anticipated to be significantly (2 to
    4 times) lower than that of Rel. 16 eMBB, resulting in minimized power usage.
    The battery life is expected to span 1 to 3 years. In Rel. 17, 3GPP suggested
    improvements for UE power conservation in the idle or inactive mode while considering
    system performance factors to address the power consumption problem. They studied
    and specified improvements to power-saving methods for connected UE, with the
    least possible influence on system performance [3]. Based on power-saving techniques
    proposed in Rel. 17 for RedCap devices, in the idle and inactive state, eDRX cycles
    are almost 3 h and 10.24 s, respectively. This approach better extends the battery
    life [67] in the stringent use case of industrial wireless sensors, for example.
    In addition to eDRX, the relaxation of frequent radio resource management (RRM)
    to secure the exact camping in its idle and inactive state can avoid the drainage
    of batteries, primarily in stationary devices. In general, potential power consumption-saving
    techniques include reducing the duration the device spends checking the control
    channel for scheduling, lengthening the device sleep time by extending the DRX
    period, and allowing for less frequent measurements for stationary devices. In
    the long run, a very high energy-efficiency technology is expected, supporting
    battery-free IoT devices, such as self-driving cars, drones, and auto-robots [135].
    The most important area of research in the IoT is energy efficiency, especially
    in IIoT, to preserve moderate power consumption [136]. According to [28], energy-saving
    methods can be maintained in three ways: configurations (including traffic models,
    connectivity periods, and DRX cycles), software modification (comprising improved
    radio layer protocols, changes have been made to the scheduling request procedures
    for accessing radio channel resources, as well as the introduction of new software
    entities in the core network to improve communication in both the UL and DL directions),
    and hardware integration (embedding a low-power Rx by deactivating the main Rx).
    In [137], energy efficiency or low power consumption can be achieved by eliminating
    transmission between nodes using the star topology, maintaining a straightforward
    node design, and using narrowband channels for reduced noise and an extended transmission
    range. Based on [138], the joint optimization of user selection, power allocation,
    and antenna selection while fulfilling the QoS requirements has a prior role in
    maximizing energy efficiency under imperfect channel state information. In most
    IoT devices, the channel state information is imperfect due to the functional
    limitations and mobility, as stated in [139]. In addition, an advanced energy-harvesting
    technique called simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is another
    promising solution to achieve energy-efficient green communication. Chen et al.
    developed a two-layer iterative algorithm to manage inter- and intra-beam interferences
    by leveraging the Dinkelbach method [140] for energy maximizing by allocating
    power at the base station and splitting power at each IoT node. The other promising
    solution is HARQ feedback. Transmitting a positive HARQ-ACK over MPDCCH in a UL
    data center interconnect is now possible [141]. This approach enables early termination
    of the UL (PUSCH) transmission or early termination of the DL (MPDCCH) monitoring
    (for FD-FDD or time division duplex but not HD-FDD). It allows the BS to notify
    the UE that UL data have been successfully received using two HARQ processes and
    10 HARQ processes with a beneficial effect. In addition, cell reselection with
    relaxed monitoring is a good option. When enabled, the UE can reduce neighbor
    cell measurements to once every 24 h [25]. This approach can significantly lower
    power usage, especially for fixed UE in difficult coverage situations. Moreover,
    resynchronization signal (RSS) better improves energy economy when a device needs
    to regain synchronization with a cell’s time and frequency [5]. Researchers from
    academics and industry have been studying solutions and techniques to address
    power consumption issues, including energy harvesting [142], [143], [144], sporadic
    transmission, resource allocation, clustering, zonal thermal pattern analysis
    for smart agriculture, and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring system
    for smart health applications [14]. In [145], RF energy harvesting on the strength
    of RF signals was cheaper to implement and available in difficult-to-reach places
    where other popular sources, such as solar or wind, may not be accessible. Moreover,
    accurate computation and efficient communication are critical for numerous devices
    to reduce power usage. Developing communication systems that are energy-efficient,
    both in terms of system design and hardware is vital to mitigate power problems
    [146]. Over-the-air computation was proposed as a promising solution [147]. In
    [148], energy-harvesting strategies for operating low-power network devices using
    long-lasting IoT devices and sensors were studied, enabling them to be self-powered
    and providing devices with long standby intervals. Network parameter settings
    affect energy consumption and network performance, and [149] found that the paging
    interval set by the BS has the greatest effect on energy consumption when the
    device is connected. Low Cost: In the CIoT, installing or maintaining local networks
    or gateways is unnecessary. The sensor can connect directly to the desired system
    or network, which maintains the cost [27]. Maintaining low power consumption facilitates
    low device costs, which can be achieved by reducing Tx and Rx bandwidths. Current
    costs run between $10 and $15 per module, with a long-term goal of reaching $5.
    The GSM, for instance, is the main player in machine-to-machine communications
    because of its reduced cost compared to other technology. As a result of the expiration
    of the device module patents in GSM networks, compared to other 3GPP-defined technology,
    the cost of the EC-GSM-IoT module is the most economical in developing countries
    [27], [52], less than $10, where 2G, 3G are deployed. The EC-GSM-IoT module cost
    is $5.5 and $2.9 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151], respectively. It is because of
    the overall cost of deployment, network coverage (which can balance the economy
    of vendors, particularly in the Asian and African continents), maturity (the presence
    of a more mature ecosystem comprising a wide range of compatible devices, and
    applications), lower complexity, and lower frequency band specificity. The other
    player in achieving ultralow-cost devices is the implementation of a GMSK-only
    modulation. Moreover, for cost reduction, according to the analysis of [152],
    the trend reveals a 10-times reduction in 1G and 2G, respectively, and a 1000-times
    reduction from 3G to 6G. In contrast, the NB-IoT has many design trade-offs to
    achieve low-cost goals, resulting in a simplified, low-complexity system with
    a lower data rate. One of these trade-offs is the lack of carrier aggregation,
    a technique that combines multiple carriers (or frequency bands) to increase the
    available data rate. Carrier aggregation requires additional hardware and processing
    resources, increasing the cost and complexity of NB-IoT devices. Similarly, NB-IoT
    does not support voice services or multi-stream transmissions in the DL/UL direction.
    These features would also require additional hardware and processing resources,
    which would be incompatible with the low-power and low-cost requirements of the
    NB-IoT. Instead, the NB-IoT provides simple, low-data-rate communication for IoT
    applications that do not require high-bandwidth or real-time services [80]. However,
    the NB-IoT can operate alongside the existing GSM and LTE networks, which can
    help lower deployment costs. The device cost is related to the complexity of baseband
    processing, memory consumption, and RF requirements. Valuable cost reductions
    can be achieved from various modifications associated with narrowband operations,
    power reduction mechanisms, and the simplification of a physical layer [14]. The
    NB-IoT module cost is achieved $4 and $2-3 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151] per module,
    respectively which is more effective in urban environments where 5G requirements
    are in hand. Regarding LTE-M devices, they could achieve a similar cost to GSM
    devices by simplifying the design of the end devices. Due to its compatibility
    with existing LTE radio systems, LTE-M can be easily deployed through a simple
    software upgrade to meet the cost optimization needs of IoT applications, building
    upon the foundation of LTE technology. Taking into consideration the market scale,
    the module cost for LTE-M is less than $10, making it an affordable option [153]
    by incorporating various optimizations to enhance efficiency and reduce complexity.
    These optimizations include incorporating half-duplex operations (i.e., less complex
    and less costly), reduced transmission mode (TM) support, minimizing the number
    of blind decodings required for control channel reception, and eliminating simultaneous
    reception. As elaborated in [150], [151], the LTE-M module cost achieved $5 in
    2016 and $3.3 in 2020. On the other hand, compared to standard NR UE, RedCap UE
    is substantially simpler due to the half-duplex operation, which means that the
    UE is not required to transmit and receive simultaneously, a smaller number of
    radio RX antenna branches (reducing the antenna configuration, can reduce the
    device size), and a smaller radio Tx bandwidth. As a result of the projected decreased
    complexity, devices are expected to be more affordable, enabling the use of NR
    in novel applications, such as industrial sensor networks [44]. In conclusion,
    these requirements are achieved through careful configurations, properly adjusting
    the traffic profile (the frequency and number of data transmitted and received
    by the UE), coverage situation (under normal, robust, and extreme coverage scenarios),
    and network settings [154]. Low Complexity: Simplified network topology and deployment
    is one component of the CIoT that the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, highly fulfills.
    It only requires software upgrades in the existing GSM networks [122]. In addition,
    by simplifying the modulation scheme used for transmitting data over the air instead
    of using more complex modulation schemes, such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation
    (QAM) or 64 QAM used in traditional GSM networks, the low-complexity mode of EC-GSM-IoT
    employs a simpler modulation scheme called GMSK. This approach reduces the complexity
    of the transceiver hardware required to implement the technology. Keeping the
    device complexity ultralow to secure a low-cost device is expected to support
    the large-scale deployment of millions of devices. Indeed, the EC-GSM-IoT technology,
    for example, is an advanced version of the EGPRS technology, which already satisfies
    the necessary requirements without any need for further complexity reduction [73].
    The goal of LTE-M, for example, was to drastically reduce the complexity and cost
    compared to the preceding LTE device categories. In addition to reducing complexity,
    LTE-M aims to handle a broad range of mMTC use cases, including demanding high-throughput
    and low-latency applications. Under the 3GPP cost reduction analysis and techniques
    [155], employing the following methods can provide remarkable complexity reductions
    in LTE-M: reduction of the maximum bandwidth (from 20 to 1.4 MHz), a single-receive
    radio frequency (RF) chain (from 2 to 1), a reduction of the peak rate (from 10
    to 1 Mbps), a reduction of transmit power (from 23 to 20, or 14 dBm), half-duplex
    instead of a full-duplex operation, and a reduction of supported DL transmission
    modes. Furthermore, securing low device complexity is required to boost the QoE
    and QoS in IoT applications. The device complexity is related to the complexity
    of baseband processing, memory consumption, and transmit-and-receive antenna (RF
    requirements). In NB-IoT, for instance, low complexity can be secured by reducing
    the TBS, accommodating only single-stream transmissions, supporting only a single
    HARQ process for both the DL and UL, adapting only one redundancy version in the
    DL, applying a low sampling rate due to lower UE bandwidth NB-IoT support, and
    allowing only HD-FDD operation [68]. Additionally, synchronization in the modulation
    and demodulation process requires higher computation. However, the NB-IoT has
    been specifically designed to facilitate low-complexity Rx processing in such
    operations. The RedCap, in addition, is also developed to be lower in complexity
    compared to the standard NR via narrowing the bandwidth, reducing the number of
    DL MIMO layers, the transmit antennas, the receive antennas, and so on. Mass Device
    Connection and Global Deployment: Massive connectivity is the key component in
    IoT applications to provide and offer the intended services to society. Mass device
    connectivity pertains to the number of devices that meet a specific QoS within
    a given area, typically measured in terms of square kilometers. As a result of
    the CIoT’s low complexity features and high demands and expectations, deploying
    a massive number of IoT devices is demanded. As concluded in [147], the present
    CIoT technology is efficient, and developing 6G CIoT is essential. Massive numbers
    of device connections are vital when expanding coverage is needed. According to
    [101], low-orbit satellites have been identified as an efficient option for delivering
    long-range IoT services with good coverage and latency by supporting numerous
    connections. Furthermore, the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication
    Sector (ITU-R) [41] has established a firm requirement for International Mobile
    Telecommunications (IMT) 2020 systems that mandates a connection density of one
    million devices per square kilometer. For instance, the GSM has been deployed
    for over 30 years. A round 50% and 25% of subscriptions are made in developing
    countries in Africa and the Middle East, respectively, according to Ericsson’s
    November 2022 report [156]. The GSM networks are widely covered and deployed worldwide,
    making connecting devices feasible, which means that the EC-GSM-IoT can be deployed
    in most regions without significant additional infrastructure. Hence, the deployment
    of the EC-GSM-IoT is feasible worldwide. It can also accommodate massive device
    connections with at least 50,000 nodes per cell [66]. 3GPP has been developed
    enhancements to support more devices per cell. For instance, optimizing resource
    allocation in IoT communication systems is critical in supporting many IoT devices.
    In [157], the authors devised a two-step optimization technique for UL transmission
    using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on deep learning. This approach
    is capable of optimizing the assignment of sub-bands and controlling transmit
    power with outcomes of low complexity, and it can accommodate a large number of
    devices. Moreover, regarding enabling numerous IoT device connections, [158] introduced
    leveraging the unlicensed spectrum in addition to exploiting the licensed spectrum.
    From the Technical Specifications Group RAN work group of TR-45.820 [32], [43],
    [159], for only one PRB (12 × 15 kHz), the NB-IoT, for example, can hold more
    than 52,500 pieces of UE per cell, in some scenarios, it also supports 72,000
    devices [160]. NB-IoT enables the connection of up to 100,000 end devices at the
    expense of complexity and cost [28], [75], [134] within single-cell, and its capacity
    can be obtained by incorporating multiple NB-IoT carriers of 200 kHz. In this
    configuration, one anchor carrier is dedicated to carrying the always-on broadcast
    signaling, while additional carriers (non-anchor carriers) are utilized for offloading
    data traffic and enhancing capacity. Moreover, enhancement objectives include
    designing positioning support (horizontal) targeting at least 50-m accuracy; extending
    the single cell point to multi-point network to support the CIoT for multicast
    DL transmissions (namely firmware or software updates and group message delivery);
    specifying new UE power classes (e.g., 14 dBm) to enable lower maximum transmit
    power suitable for small form-factor batteries, mobility, and service continuity
    enhancements; UL enhancements to reduce device power consumption further; and
    enhancements to support voice [93]. Improved Security: Given the growing importance
    of IoT devices in various industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation,
    ensuring the security of things is critical to protecting sensitive data and ensuring
    the safe operation of these devices. Every CIoT technology option necessitates
    that both the network and the mobile station employ an enhanced and strong security
    framework. They have got a significant benefit from all the security and privacy
    mobile network features comprising user identity confidentiality, authentication,
    confidentiality, data integrity, and mobile equipment identification since it
    is operating in the licensed spectrum sharing all the advantages of standards-based
    technologies. For instance, EC-GSM-IoT has an LTE-grade security to improve end
    user security for the sake of removing any security concerns. The security measures
    currently in place for GSM technology have significantly contributed to enhancing
    security in EC-GSM-IoT. These procedures involve mutual authentication of both
    the device and the network during connection establishment, employment of 64-bit
    long encryption and 128-bit ciphering algorithms for better encryption, rejection
    of incompatible networks, and protection of control plane integrity [75]. Most
    importantly, the integration of existing CIoT technologies with 5G is done. This
    integration allows for enhanced security mechanisms across the network, addressing
    issues of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for a wide range
    of interconnected IoT devices. In general, in CIoT, extending coverage, reducing
    power consumption, lowering device complexity, reducing device cost, enhancing
    massive connectivity, and enhancing positioning are the foremost required features
    to maintain during CIoT communication by all mobile network operators, organizations,
    and companies. As shown in Fig. 8, coverage extension techniques can be incorporated,
    such as repetition and bundling, direct interface side-links or relays, and reducing
    the subcarrier spacing. For example, asset tracking, fleet management, and smart
    cities all rely on accurate positioning data to function effectively and maintain
    position enhancement. Hence, observed time-difference-of-arrival positioning,
    enhanced cell-ID positioning, UL time difference of arrival positioning, location
    positioning protocol, assisted global navigation satellite systems, and centimeter-level
    positioning techniques have been integrated. Solutions for reducing power consumption
    include lowering the transmit power by introducing new classes of UE, enhancing
    power-saving modes (PSM, eDRX, and WUS), and limiting mobility and handovers.
    Narrowing the bandwidth and reducing the number of DLs, multiple-input multiple-output
    layers, and Tx or Rx antennae minimize device complexity. Moreover, reducing signaling
    overhead, simplifying the core network architecture (network elements, interfaces,
    and protocols), and employing better resource management techniques can enhance
    network efficiency. Further, reducing device costs and Tx and Rx bandwidths, minimizing
    the device complexity, reusing the available spectrum and technology, and lowering
    order modulations can play a vital role in using the devices and removing marketing
    barriers. Download : Download high-res image (678KB) Download : Download full-size

    CIoT technologies CIoT technologies have a wide range of applications and can
    be used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of life in
    various industries and sectors. Table 8 presents applications better suited for
    the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap. The EC-GSM-IoT is fundamentally designed
    to offer coverage for machine-to-machine communications (direct communication
    with each other without the need for human involvement) in areas with challenging
    radio coverage conditions. However, the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. The EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap can be employed in areas of applications including; smart cities (waste
    and traffic management), smart environments (building automation; urban safety;
    and intelligent environment monitoring), smart metering (electricity, water, gas,
    and parking spot meters), asset tracking and smart logistics [154], localization,
    farming (monitoring livestock), forestry, industry pallets and pipelines [18],
    [161], and intelligent transportation (e.g., logistics services, and traveling
    time estimation) [23]. Moreover, the LTE and NB-IoT can work with the low and
    geostationary earth orbit satellites to support NTN, studied in Rel. 17 on the
    NB-IoT and LTE-M for NTN [31]. Under the IoT over NTN projects [91], for instance,
    UAVs [162] can use LTE-M to develop low-latency energy-efficient communication
    techniques and power-efficient computing modules [163] in military applications
    to track enemy locations. The feasibility of integrating the NB-IoT into the NTN
    [70] was investigated to extend the coverage in challenging environments like
    mountains, deserts, and oceans [164]. In the same objective, NR-RedCap is designed
    based on the 5G NR requirements, so its application is vital. The 5G is becoming
    prominent in the healthcare industry, automotive industry, smart cars, manufacturing
    sector, smart factories, smart grids, and smart cities [53], which substantially
    affects the IoT but has high costs and complexity issues compared to RedCap. Due
    to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming manifested
    in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require low latency,
    ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. Hence,
    these envisioned use cases have specific requirements regarding data rate, latency,
    battery life, reliability, and other factors. As of today, CIoTs are being applied
    in the following application areas. Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture is one
    of the key application scenarios in the IoT industry [165]. Via CIoTs connectivity,
    farmers and cities can capture data from environmental sensors for management.
    The reason is that they can access places that are hard to reach, such as remote
    areas where agriculture or infrastructure sensors are installed. Due to this,
    monitoring the soil temperature and humidity and tracking the existing land features,
    rain, and pollution are some of the activities farmers can perform using EC-GSM-IoT,
    LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap [24], [166]. In Africa, specifically, farmers are utilizing
    multiple interconnected sensors in their fields to identify the optimal planting
    and harvesting periods for specific crops by leveraging EC-GSM-IoT technology
    [76], [167]. LTE-M and NB-IoT have a role in smart agriculture. Moreover, RedCap
    is expected to be used in cooperative farm machinery in the near future. Minimizing
    water waste will be vital to advancing agricultural processes based on real-time
    monitoring and predictive data analytics via remote sensing [13]. Smart Grid and
    Meter: CIoT technologies play a significant role in application areas, such as
    smart metering, smart grid management with strong coverage requirements, and low
    power use scenarios (e.g., water and gas) since they can access places that are
    hard to reach, such as deep basements where smart meters are installed. They are
    well-suited for connecting many remote smart meters to a central data collection
    point, allowing utility companies to remotely monitor energy consumption and manage
    their networks more efficiently, leading to cost savings and improved customer
    service [168]. Through the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, in smart grid
    applications; electricity is efficiently transmitted and distributed, power is
    recovered rapidly after a fault occurs, maintenance costs are reduced, and security
    and protection. They can remotely control and monitor energy-consuming devices,
    such as air-conditioning and heating systems, to reduce energy consumption during
    peak demand periods [37], [169], [170], [171] with the support of numerous (more
    than 10,000 devices in a cell) smart grid devices. Indeed, a smart grid management
    system is the main operational demand for power control, enabling two-way communication
    between providers and consumers. For instance, according to the investigation
    in [171], demand–response techniques are pivotal to addressing power outage problems,
    reducing cost, and increasing reliability. Intelligent Transportation: Tracking
    and monitoring vehicles intelligently is crucial for transportation companies
    and vehicle owners. Hence, 3GPP identified the vehicle-to-everything communication
    types [33]: vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure, vehicle to pedestrian,
    and vehicle to network. In intelligent transportation, vehicle-to-vehicle communication,
    vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, autonomous/semi autonomous driving, and
    in-car infotainment systems emerged [57]. The CIoT technologies can also assist
    drivers in various ways, such as providing real-time traffic and weather information,
    route planning, and parking assistance; improving the driving experience; and
    reducing the risk of accidents. In intelligent transportation, fleet management
    applications are most in demand [172] including; monitoring fuel consumption and
    scheduling maintenance and repairs. Moreover, LTE-M is well-suited for applications
    requiring voice and data communications, such as telemetry and remote control
    systems. Hence, LTE-M is well-suited for fleet management applications because
    it supports voice and data communication and can track the location and status
    of vehicles in real-time. For transportation systems to be effective, they need
    to be quick, dependable, and adaptable. By implementing the CIoT-based Internet
    of Vehicles, drivers can receive real-time traffic updates, monitor speed limits,
    and subsequently reduce traffic congestion and accidents. In smart parking, for
    instance, data can be transmitted and received in real-time, enabling immediate
    updates to park availability and other information. The available CIoTs can improve
    efficiency, reduce parking costs, and improve the overall user experience [173].
    For some IoT use cases with stationary mobility in intelligent transportation,
    for instance, all CIoT technologies are applicable. NB-IoT, despite its limited
    mobility characteristics, can be considered applicable for smart transportation.
    The devices are often deployed in fixed locations, such as road sensors, infrastructure
    components, or stationary objects along roadways. These devices collect and transmit
    various transportation-related data including real-time tracking, traffic analysis
    (traffic conditions, environmental factors), parking space reservation (often
    involves parking in the basement), location navigation, vehicle management, and
    enable communication between vehicles [174]. Overall, using EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    NB-IoT, and RedCap for intelligent transportation systems helps reduce travel
    time, fuel consumption, and environmental effects and can improve the overall
    travel experience for passengers and drivers. Smart City: Smart cities have a
    high level of technology integration and are distinguished by the extensive use
    of information and communication methods [175]. Due to the current urbanization
    demands worldwide, the smart city concept has been extended from smart offices
    and smart homes to smart buildings. In the framework of smart cities, applications,
    such as environmental sensors, smart grids, predictive maintenance, utility meters,
    high-definition security cameras, smart parking, smart traffic management, smart
    city sensors system for irrigation, and smart street lighting are included, and
    supported by CIoT systems [153], [176], [177]. A smart city cuts costs, increases
    resource consumption efficiency, engages with inhabitants more actively during
    emergencies, and greatly reduces labor costs. Controlling street lights, assessing
    free parking spaces, monitoring environmental conditions, and inspecting road
    conditions are some of the daily administrative tasks performed by city bodies.
    Furthermore, in each layer of IoT applications (i.e., in smart cities), security
    and privacy are daily concerns for safety [178]. Noteworthy to know a smart city
    can be considered a package comprising applications, including intelligent environmental
    monitoring, intelligent transportation, smart street lighting, smart grid, smart
    metering, smart homes, and the like. These applications are demanding the use
    of deep learning-based techniques, for example, in smart lighting [24], [179]
    of smart garbage detection systems that can recognize garbage more accurately,
    reducing the necessary deployment costs and material resources. Smart Homes and
    Buildings: One of CIoT’s rapidly expanding markets is smart homes. The primary
    focus behind the smart home philosophy is preserving energy [79]. Recently, the
    CIoT has offered a powerful and flexible way to control and monitor various aspects
    of the home, providing convenience, energy reduction, and enhanced security [180].
    Various ECG-SM-IoT, LTE-m, NB-IoT, and RedCap devices can be deployed in the living
    room, kitchen, bathrooms, and other rooms. In addition, the devices can be used
    for video surveillance monitoring [177]. For example, homeowners can access remote
    lighting controls, monitor their children, and turn devices on and off while commuting
    to and from work. In emergencies, such as smoke and hazard incidents, installing
    CIoT devices in a smart home is beneficial. Examples of applications that can
    utilize these CIoT’s building penetration capability include monitoring utility
    usage (e.g., smart heat), enhancing security in residential properties, smoke
    detectors, and managing energy consumption in household appliances [24]. Smart
    Environmental Monitoring: Environmental monitoring is a wider concept comprising
    both natural and human environmental phenomena involving rural-agricultural and
    urban-city-oriented monitoring. It includes monitoring air, soil, water, traffic
    volumes, city infrastructure, and other aspects. The existing CIoT cellular network
    can provide intelligent services [181] by incorporating a wireless sensor network
    to automate data acquisition for easy data analysis. These intelligent services
    optimize resource usage, reduce waste, and increase energy efficiency by providing
    real-time data on environmental conditions [182], [183]. It can also be used for
    monitoring the location of wild animals, observing their habitats, and recognizing
    their behaviors. Furthermore, the role of the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    in intelligent environment monitoring involves public health and safety in identifying
    and mitigating possible environmental hazards and extreme weather conditions.
    Smart Tracking: Vertical industries, including transportation, logistics, and
    manufacturing, have a high demand for tracking and monitoring the location and
    movement of physical assets, such as vehicles, equipment, and inventory. Installing
    or attaching global positioning system trackers or RF identification tags onto
    assets and communicating their location and status to the central system optimizes
    operations (e.g., routes in logistics companies) by delivering real-time updates
    on the location, movement, and condition of the assets (e.g., temperature). Hence,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap are useful in tracking shipping, monitoring
    drivers and goods, and obtaining diagnostics and reports across moving operations
    in industry [153], [184], contributing to efficiency improvement, cost reduction,
    and customer service enhancement. Note that when continuous tracking is not required
    NB-IoT can be taken as a good method. In addition to enabling real-time tracking
    and monitoring, they can also provide other benefits in asset tracking systems,
    such as the ability to monitor the condition of the assets and alert maintenance
    personnel when repairs are needed, reducing downtime and improving the overall
    efficiency of the tracking system. Smart Hospitals: Healthcare is the most important
    concern in the era of smart life projects, with a high priority [177]. Wearable
    devices, such as fitness trackers or sports wearables, smartwatches, and smart
    clothing, can track and monitor location and movements and provide identification,
    authentication, data collection, and sensing, including patient vital signs, such
    as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Moreover, implantable devices,
    such as pacemakers and defibrillators, can monitor the heart, or sensors can monitor
    a segment of an organ (i.e., the lungs or kidneys). A periodic update of training
    data and message reception is possible with the NB-IoT and LTE-M in normal conditions
    [190]. Similar to LTE-M and NB-IoT, EC-GSM-IoT is also suitable for low data rate
    healthcare applications. To enhance patient outcomes and lower healthcare expenses
    through the implementation of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring systems,
    EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap are suggested for healthcare applications.
    These technologies offer swift data transfer, energy efficiency, broad communication
    coverage, dependable performance, the ability to handle large data volumes, and
    human tissue safety. Their accurate localization capabilities enable them to address
    clinical care in the hospital and remote patient care. Furthermore, they can be
    utilized to acquire medical reports at regular intervals and receive alerts triggered
    by specific events. Additionally, it enables real-time, two-way medical control
    and monitoring of health conditions through live video feeds. General applications
    in health care systems, including remote patient monitoring, medical asset tracking,
    wellness-tracking wearables, and secure data collection protecting patient data
    privacy [16], can be supported by the current CIoT technologies. Table 8. CIoT

    as well. Smart city [24], [76], [117], [167], [168], [175] ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ The EC-GSM-IoT,
    LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap can be utilized for broad smart city applications including

    play a pivotal role in tracking and monitoring assets and their states in industries
    (transportation, logistics, and manufacturing). Smart hospitals [61], [66], [167],
    [188] ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Because of their fast data transfer, optimized energy consumption,
    rapid data transfer, wide-ranging communication reach, high reliability, capacity
    to handle significant data loads, and safety for human tissue, the EC-GSM-IoT,
    NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap are recommended for healthcare applications to improve
    patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by implementing telemedicine and
    remote patient monitoring systems. Video surveillance cameras [110], [153] ✓ ✓
    LTE-M and RedCap are used for remote monitoring and surveillance applications
    in various industries, in cooperative farm machinery for example, to assist in
    monitoring crops, livestock, and so on. Industry IoT [8], [66], [111] ✓ ✓ ✓ NB-IoT,
    LTE-M, and RedCap are used in monitoring equipment status, controlling processes,
    and ensuring factory safety. Wearables [1], [189] ✓ ✓ ✓ LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    have the ability to provide assistance for wearable devices, such as smartwatches,
    which typically necessitate voice functionality, portability, and fast data transfer
    rates for connectivity to the Internet. Wearables: Devices equipped with NB-IoT
    technology enable real-time monitoring of energy consumption, enabling utilities
    to enhance energy management and improve the efficiency of health monitoring.
    Moreover, in the context of wearables, the ability to support mobility and high
    data rates is critical, as is the ability to support VoLTE. For this reason, LTE-M
    and RedCap are emerging as strong candidates for powering the next generation
    of wearable devices. In applications such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and
    medical wearables, crucial data can be extracted based on various metrics, including
    heart rate, sleep patterns, and activity levels. These real-time data are sent
    over LTE-M and RedCap networks to be analyzed by the responsible authorized individuals
    (e.g., doctors and caregivers) or organizations [118]. Importantly, LTE-M and
    RedCap support movement so that it is possible to monitor users anywhere in motion,
    such as runners, to track their well-being [189]. The utilization of wearable
    devices potentially simplifies self-care for elderly individuals, for instance.
    Hence, wearable devices equipped with NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap technology have
    the capability to track and record an individual’s physical activity, heart rate,
    body temperature, and other health-related data. Video Surveillance Cameras: Due
    to their support of high data rate and video capturing, LTE-M and RedCap are the
    candidate CIoT technologies in video surveillance camera services. Smart cities,
    smart farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly
    installed surveillance cameras. In LTE-M, for example, the Cat-M2 UE category
    supports multimedia IoT applications such as voice and video which have a maximum
    TBS of 4008 bits in the DL and 6968 bits in the UL good for video surveillance
    applications. Moreover, for high-quality video, RedCap plays a significant role.
    Industry IoT: The LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap sensors can be used in the prediction
    of machine failure in the factory. Note that the NB-IoT is not suitable for moving
    objects, so the device is assumed to be battery-powered in a fixed location in
    the factory, requiring two-way communication to upgrade the firmware and software
    [191]. It has a significant role in real-time applications and is more suitable
    for industrial systems that require real-time communication without mobility requirements.
    Even though the NB-IoT supports only up to QPSK modulation that limits its data
    rate, spectral efficient frequency division multiplexing has been proposed, which
    uses higher modulation formats; however, it has drawbacks in energy consumption.
    The authors of [192] developed a two-dimensional channel-aware adaptive modulation
    scheme that improves network performance while maintaining energy efficiency to
    solve this problem. On the other hand, LTE-M and RedCap are the prominent technologies
    for IIoTs since they support mobility and high data rates. Moreover, RedCap is
    objectively developed for such use cases including wearables and video surveillance
    cameras, which we discuss under the RedCap section in detail. 9. Future challenges
    The proposed solutions are explicitly explored as part of the CIoT use-case specifications
    by the 3GPP working group. Most requirements set by the study groups in various
    release versions have been met as promised and planned. Indeed, CIoT has gained
    attention globally due to its cost-effective, ubiquitous coverage with ease of
    deployment of massive MTC and URLLC and several feasible reasons. However, there
    are further challenges that need to be resolved. Congestion Problems: Overcrowding
    or congestion is a significant challenge in the CIoT with a very high concentration
    of devices, as there are limited resources available to handle the numerous sporadic
    access attempts made by a diverse range of MTC devices [26]. With a massive number
    of devices, an enormous number of simultaneous access requests occurs, causing
    congestion in the physical random-access channel, resulting in network access
    delays [193]. For instance, if multiple machine-type devices transmit the same
    preamble simultaneously, they cause the access requests to fail so that access
    efficiency decreases and the number of supported devices reduces. Hence, optimized
    node clustering and data aggregation have been employed as candidate solutions
    to address congestion [194]. Kim and Bang [195] proposed a random-access parallelization
    technique to support multiple preambles, enabling each IoT device to attempt multiple
    instances of random access in parallel to mitigate collisions. In addition, the
    preamble (re)transmission limit [196] is adopted in the UE MAC layer. In contrast,
    network slicing is another promising method to improve the efficiency of resource
    utilization [57], [197] by allocating resources dynamically between slices, providing
    QoS in congestion situations and end-to-end communication. Furthermore, a study
    [198] introduced a recursive access class barring technique to use the available
    resources optimally, obtaining an optimized service time and average access delay
    compared to the conventional access class barring schemes. Despite these solutions,
    as the massive number of devices expands, the reliability of access, data transmission,
    and energy consumption are inevitably questioned. Very High Signaling Overhead
    per Data Packet: In the CIoT, signaling overhead becomes a significant issue when
    considerable signaling is required for each data packet a device sends. Very high
    signaling overhead per data packet can occur when frequent updates or small amounts
    of data are sent from the device. Cellular networks are optimized for larger data
    packets, and when small data packets are sent frequently, the overhead required
    to establish and maintain the connection becomes a significant proportion of the
    overall communication. However, it is particularly problematic in scenarios where
    devices are battery-powered and have limited energy resources, such as IoT devices
    where a device sends small data packets infrequently. The signaling required to
    establish and maintain the connection can become a bottleneck. It can significantly
    increase network traffic, causing issues, such as network congestion, increased
    latency, and energy consumption [52] on the device and network sides, and reduced
    overall performance. Although data packets transmitted by IoT devices are typically
    small, the high signaling overhead required per packet can always become a significant
    issue for IoT devices [199]. Various signaling reduction techniques can address
    these issues, such as message queuing, efficient protocols, and optimized network
    coverage [200]. Studying more appropriate methods is crucial for scheduling transmissions
    and reducing signaling overhead in extremely dense environments using advanced
    techniques, such as machine learning to overcome these challenges in the ultra-dense
    CIoT to meet service requirements, such as latency, battery life, and accuracy.
    Scalability/Massive Connection: There has been a surge in demand for CIoT connectivity,
    especially in the healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing industries, according
    to the future market insight projections [201]. Hence, numerous connected devices,
    sensors, and machines must be handled simultaneously. The main challenge facing
    the CIoT is the need to support numerous devices with a broad range of capabilities
    and requirements to mitigate problems, such as network congestion, power consumption,
    security, and cost. This challenge requires significant investments in network
    infrastructure and management systems to ensure that the network can scale to
    meet the demands of the IoT. Providing connectivity for many devices can be a
    challenge for CIoT networks, where the system scalability [112] comprises the
    network capacity, processing power, data storage, and security. In [202], mobile
    edge computing (MEC) based CIoT (MECIoT) is taken as one of the promising solutions
    for scalability. Thus, techniques including developing low-power devices, designing
    and implementing smart system architecture involving leveraging distributed computing,
    cloud-based infrastructure, and other advanced technology, such as edge computing
    and AI might help and should be further investigated. Privacy and Security: Security
    cameras, biometric sensors, and authentication devices, electronic door locks
    and access control systems, fire alarm and detection systems, intrusion detection
    and prevention systems, industrial control systems used in critical infrastructure
    such as energy, water, and transportation systems, medical devices such as pacemakers
    and insulin pumps are security-sensitive devices that could harm owners if their
    security is threatened by intruders [118]. It is because, the limited resources
    of CIoT devices can make it challenging to implement robust security measures,
    leaving them vulnerable to attacks [203]. CIoT devices are often deployed in physically
    vulnerable locations, making them susceptible to tampering. In addition, the low
    power and low data rates of CIoT devices can make it difficult to implement strong
    security protocols, leaving them open to network-based attacks. Moreover, the
    lack of uniform standards for security in CIoT can lead to inconsistencies in
    security measures across different devices and networks, potentially exposing
    vulnerabilities. To address these risks, it is essential to implement strong security
    measures such as encryption, secure authentication, and access control, while
    also establishing industry standards for securing the devices [204]. Moreover,
    Ni et al. [205] proposed a security authentication system to protect device security
    during network slicing by isolating IoT applications. Savic et al. [206] proposed
    a deep learning-based anomaly detection, the anomaly detection module (ADM) for
    IoT devices (ADM-EDGE) and the ADM at the mobile core network (ADM-FOG), to enhance
    the CIoT security and the mobile core network, respectively, by demonstrating
    it on smart logistics use cases. However, the trial is on small-scale real-world
    use cases that should be examined on a large scale. In [161], quantum resistance
    access authentication is developed to achieve privacy protection and anti-quantum
    attacks. However, numerous IoT devices with high-speed mobility still have security
    issues relating to moving from one cell to another. Interoperability and Integration
    Issues: Enabling different IoT devices and applications to communicate with each
    other and with the CIoT networks seamlessly is another barrier facing the CIoT.
    Due to the requirements for the device, network, standardization, and security
    and the heterogeneity of the protocols, there are a variety of interoperability
    types, including infrastructure (device interoperability), architecture (network
    interoperability), design (syntactical and semantic interoperability), and platform
    interoperability [207], in which intelligent algorithms should be implemented.
    However, ensuring seamless and interoperable communication among numerous devices
    is challenging because of its various data formats, protocol interfaces and application,
    and the complexity increases if two or more devices communicate simultaneously
    [208]. It is necessary to create a multifaceted technology approach to handle
    the interoperability concerns. This approach requires the development of standards,
    protocols, software tools and interfaces, data formats, and more that can be used
    across networks and devices. Energy Efficiency/Power Consumption: One of the most
    critical constraints for CIoT devices is battery life. Most CIoT devices are battery-powered
    require constant sources of power and need low power consumption with many years
    of deployment lifecycle in remote locations where supplying power is spectacularly
    difficult. The reason why many years of deployment are employed is that activities
    include charging batteries regularly, devices that are hard-wired to maintain
    electricity, and a complete device replacement which causes human interaction
    too costly for the business case. For battery-powered IoT devices, energy efficiency
    is a highly critical factor [154]. Often, IoT devices are designed to be low-power
    and energy-efficient, but this is not easy to achieve with cellular networks,
    which requires new approaches to network design and management to ensure the network
    can support low-power devices while providing the necessary performance and coverage.
    However, there are still compromising power consumption issues in the CIoT. One
    method of saving energy in the age of AI is applying the recommended deep neural
    network techniques. However, due to frequent memory access, executing power-intensive
    deep neural networks on low-resource IoT devices increases power consumption.
    To address these problems, a study [209] suggested that reducing the number of
    MAC operations and data precision saves energy. In addition, the recursive access
    class barring technique provides resource-efficiency and energy-efficiency solutions
    [198]. However, a trade-off occurs between energy efficiency and other performance
    factors, such as high data transfer rates, poor network coverage, and complex
    data processing (to mention a few that could be balanced), and further investigation
    is required. Cost: As the deployment of numerous IoT devices increases exponentially,
    it can result in high costs for network providers and end users. Network providers
    and IoT device manufacturers explore partnerships and collaborations to reduce
    costs, share resources, and leverage each other’s expertise and capabilities.
    Among other solutions, significant factors of the CIoT to make IoT devices more
    accessible and affordable for a wider range of applications and use cases are
    using low-cost devices and employing technology that stabilizes the costs for
    the device, network, maintenance, data management, and others [27], [30], [155].
    Often, IoT devices are designed to be low cost, which requires new approaches
    to network design and management to ensure that the network can be deployed and
    maintained at a low cost. However, a low-cost design negatively affects CIoT performance,
    spectral efficiency, and energy consumption. In [210], the authors proposed a
    time allocation algorithm to avoid the problem. Nonetheless, the support for a
    massive number of devices can become limited. Spectrum Efficiency: As IoT devices
    use a small amount of bandwidth, the spectrum is a limited resource that must
    be shared among a massive number of connecting devices. Efficient spectrum allocation
    is vital for connecting many IoT devices and preventing network disruptions. The
    author [211] investigated power-domain nonorthogonal multiple access as the best
    multiple access technique for efficiently utilizing the existing spectrum resources
    in IoT networks from the multiple-user scenario by assigning different power levels.
    However, the number of frequency blocks in the IoT network in the framework is
    limited. Al-Dweik et al. [212] mentioned that power-domain nonorthogonal multiple
    access could be a prominent solution for spectral efficiency from the same user
    perspective in which nonidentical power values can be assigned. However, in large-scale
    IoT networks, spectral efficiency requires new robust approaches to spectrum management
    to ensure that the network can support numerous low-power devices. Quality of
    Service: The level of services and performance of a network provider guarantees
    its customers to make the IoT devices reliable is a highly important factor in
    the CIoT. The technical challenges in the CIoT regarding the bandwidth, power,
    delay, and error rate should be optimized to attain the various QoS requirements,
    including reliability, low latency, high throughput, low power consumption, security,
    scalability, cost-effectiveness, and more. Indeed, IoT devices require low-latency
    and high reliability communication, which is challenging to provide in cellular
    networks. Network optimization, traffic management, and service-level agreement
    strategies are good for preserving QoS [199]. Furthermore, deploying fixed and
    mobile small cells due to the reduced Tx-to-Rx distance is expected to improve
    the QoS with the ever-increasing data demands [213]. However, challenges still
    exist, such as interference and resource management. Hence, new and robust approaches
    to network design and management are required to ensure the network can support
    low-latency, high-reliability communication to achieve QoS. 10. Conclusion In
    recent years, the CIoT has emerged as a promising solution for providing a scalable,
    reliable, and secure infrastructure connecting a broad range of devices and applications.
    The CIoT enables billions of devices to connect and share information, creating
    new services and applications. With the ongoing full deployment and integration
    of 5G networks, CIoT is poised to gain further significance. The fact that 5G
    offers higher data rates, lower latency, and massive device connectivity, which
    unlock new possibilities for CIoT applications, 3GPP and Ericsson have been working
    on standardization of CIoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices. The LTE-M and NB-IoT have confirmed that they can efficiently
    be integrated into the 5G and share its ultimate benefits. The URLLC capabilities
    of 5G enable mission-critical CIoT use cases, such as autonomous vehicles, remote
    surgery, and industrial automation, that require real-time, reliable connectivity
    is now achieved. Moreover, the CIoT is valuable because it reduces the cost and
    complexity of deploying and maintaining IoT networks, provides a global and standardized
    solution for connecting IoT devices, and enables interoperability while ensuring
    the security and privacy of data transmitted over the CIoT network. To this end,
    in this paper, we have compared the existing literature on CIoT technologies and
    discussed their general network architecture. Moreover, we have elaborated on
    the existing CIoT technologies with a complete overview from the perspectives
    of their features and current state-of-the-art including release enhancements,
    focuses, and applications. Finally, we have identified the major challenges in
    CIoT technology that researchers, academics, and industry operators might find
    interesting for further studies and efforts. Declaration of competing interest

  description: In a medical emergency situation, real-time patient data sharing may
    improve the survivability of a patient. In this paper, we explore how Digital
    Twin (DT) technology can be used for real-time data storage and processing in
    emergency healthcare. We investigated various enabling technologies, including
    cloud platforms, data transmission formats, and storage file formats, to develop
    a feasible DT storage solution for emergency healthcare. Through our analysis,
    we found Amazon AWS to be the most suitable cloud platform due to its sophisticated
    real-time data processing and analytical tools. Additionally, we determine that
    the MQTT protocol is suitable for real-time medical data transmission, and FHIR
    is the most appropriate medical file storage format for emergency healthcare situations.
    We propose a cloud-based DT storage solution, in which real-time medical data
    are transmitted to AWS IoT Core, processed by Kinesis Data Analytics, and stored
    securely in AWS HealthLake. Despite the feasibility of the proposed solution,
    challenges such as insufficient access control, lack of encryption, and vendor
    conformity must be addressed for successful practical implementation. Future work
    may involve Hyperledger Fabric technology and HTTPS protocol to enhance security,
    while the maturation of DT technology is expected to resolve vendor conformity
    issues. By addressing these challenges, our proposed DT storage solution has the
    potential to improve data accessibility and decision-making in emergency healthcare
    settings.

    Data Redundancy Article 05 May 2022 1 Introduction In contemporary emergency healthcare,
    there is a scarcity of effective methods for sharing patient information between
    physicians in the Emergency Department (ED) and paramedics in an ambulance. Consequently,
    patient demographics, chief complaints, vital signs, treatment responses, and
    other medical data are typically transmitted through verbal or written reports.
    This mode of communication could potentially result in miscommunication or the
    omission of crucial medical information, particularly in time-sensitive situations
    such as myocardial infarctions. Traditional Electronic Health Record (EHR) and
    Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems can store and share static medical records
    but lack the capability to process and share real-time medical data, such as electrocardiograms
    (EKG) and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2). Employing patients''
    Digital Twins (DT) could address this challenge, as DT can store, process, analyze,
    and share data in real time. Moreover, paramedics might leverage patients’ DTs
    to simulate treatment and medication responses. Although the definition of digital
    twins varies according to different authors'' perspectives, the fundamental concepts
    remain consistent. Digital twins represent virtual replicas of physical objects
    that facilitate sharing, analyzing, optimizing, and predicting the performance
    of their real-world counterparts [1]. Fundamentally, digital twins comprise the
    digital model of a physical object, historical data, and real-time data. Real-time
    data processing (unidirectional or bidirectional) is a critical element that differentiates
    DT from other digital approaches, such as simulation and digital modeling. DT
    enables bidirectional human-out-of-the-loop communication between the physical
    system and the virtual model. Data transfer from a physical object to the DT is
    processed, analyzed, and evaluated, potentially offering predictions for the object’s
    performance and status. Additionally, data feedback from the DT to the physical
    object can facilitate notifications or control actions. Within an emergency healthcare
    context, DT could be employed to store and share a patient''s real-time vital
    sign data from the ambulance and static medical records, including demographics,
    chief complaints, treatments, and medications. Furthermore, DT offers potential
    simulation and estimation capabilities, which could be pivotal in determining
    patient treatment and medication choices. Before embarking on any medical treatment
    or therapy, one key aspect of healthcare involves understanding how the patient''s
    body will react to the proposed intervention. This can entail evaluating the patient''s
    current health status, taking note of any pre-existing conditions or allergies,
    and considering their medical history. This initial analysis is paramount as it
    can help to predict potential side-effects and adverse reactions to the therapy,
    especially those that could worsen the patient''s condition or impair their recovery.
    With thorough understanding the patient''s physiological condition and potential
    reaction with the proposed treatment, healthcare providers can make more informed
    decisions. They can tailor the therapy to the patient''s specific needs and circumstances,
    potentially altering dosages, delivery methods, or even opting for different treatments
    entirely based on their analysis. In turn, this individualized approach to treatment
    can improve patient outcomes, reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions, and
    increase overall patient satisfaction with their care. In emergency healthcare,
    digital twins can be used to share real-time condition for patient''s vital signs
    or individual body systems such as cardiovascular system with other emergency
    caregivers. When integrated with other patient data—such as previous medical history,
    genetic information, lifestyle factors, and physiological condition—these digital
    replicas can provide invaluable insights for healthcare providers. Digital twins
    of a patient can be created at many levels. A digital twin at the level of the
    entire human body would be a comprehensive, integrated model encompassing all
    of the body’s systems and organs. This would ideally involve extensive data collection
    to capture as much detail as possible about the individual’s health, including
    medical history, genetic data, lifestyle factors, and current physiological status.
    A full-body digital twin could be used to simulate the effects of a wide range
    of treatments and interventions, allowing clinicians to predict and prevent potential
    complications or adverse reactions. Furthermore, it could be utilized for monitoring
    overall health and predicting potential health risks, contributing to preventative
    care. Creating digital twins at the level of body functions or systems, such as
    the respiratory, nervous, or urinary systems, allows for the detailed analysis
    of how these systems function and interact with one another. For instance, a digital
    twin of the respiratory system could be used to study the progression of diseases
    like COPD or asthma and to predict how the system might respond to various treatments.
    Similarly, a digital twin of the nervous system could be used to study neurological
    disorders, and a digital twin of the urinary system could help in understanding
    and managing conditions like kidney disease. Creating digital twins at the organ
    level involves modeling individual organs such as the heart, kidney, or liver.
    This can be especially useful for predicting the outcomes of organ-specific treatments,
    including surgeries, medication regimens, or innovative procedures like organ
    transplantation. For example, a digital twin of a patient’s heart could help physicians
    better understand how the heart might respond to different types of cardiac surgeries
    or medications, helping to optimize patient outcomes. At the lowest level, digital
    twins can be created to represent the smallest components of the body, such as
    cells and molecules. This can be particularly useful in the field of oncology,
    where understanding the behavior of cancer cells and their interaction with various
    drugs is crucial. Similarly, a digital twin at the molecular level could be used
    to study the effects of genetic variations on disease development and response
    to treatment. It could also assist in drug development by simulating how different
    molecules interact with each other and with biological targets. Creating digital
    twins at various levels of the human body allows for a highly personalized and
    detailed understanding of individual health. By providing precise, individualized
    models of different parts of the body, they offer significant potential for enhancing
    the accuracy of diagnoses, the effectiveness of treatments, and the overall quality
    of patient care. This reflects the broader move in healthcare toward precision
    medicine, which aims to tailor medical treatment to the individual characteristics
    of each patient. A DT model can also belong to one of two categories: Healthy
    Baseline Models or Abnormal Disease Models. A healthy baseline digital twin model
    represents the ideal or normal state of health for a specific individual. This
    model is created based on comprehensive data collected from the individual when
    they are in a state of good health, including genetic data, physiological data,
    lifestyle factors, and other relevant health indicators. The healthy baseline
    model serves as a benchmark or standard against which future health status can
    be compared. Regular updates to the model ensure that it evolves as the individual''s
    health changes over time, thus maintaining its accuracy and relevance. The main
    purpose of this model is to understand what constitutes ''normal'' for that individual
    and identify any deviations from this norm. This can help detect potential health
    issues at an early stage, allowing for proactive interventions and preventative
    care. Furthermore, the model can be used to simulate how the individual''s body
    would react to different treatments or lifestyle changes, aiding in personalized
    healthcare. An abnormal disease digital twin model represents the state of health
    of an individual who is affected by a specific disease or medical condition. This
    model is created based on extensive data collected from the individual, including
    the nature and severity of their illness, their medical history, genetic data,
    and current physiological status. The abnormal disease model provides a detailed
    picture of the disease process within the individual''s body, helping clinicians
    to understand how the disease is likely to progress and how the body may respond
    to different treatments. This type of model can be particularly useful for complex
    or chronic diseases where treatment needs to be highly personalized, such as cancer
    or heart disease. It allows for the simulation of different treatment options
    and their likely outcomes, enabling more informed decision-making and potentially
    improving patient outcomes. In addition, the model can be used to monitor the
    effectiveness of treatment over time and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
    Both healthy baseline models and abnormal disease models are critical in modern
    healthcare. They enable a highly personalized approach to care, facilitating early
    detection of health issues, informed treatment decision-making, and effective
    monitoring of treatment progress. Digital twins represent an exciting development
    in the field of precision medicine, with the potential to significantly enhance
    the quality and effectiveness of healthcare. One of the primary benefits of using
    digital twins in healthcare is their potential to increase efficiency and precision
    in patient treatment, thereby reducing the incidence of medical errors. Through
    simulations, clinicians can explore different treatment options and predict their
    outcomes before applying them to the actual patient. For instance, a digital twin
    can help simulate the effects of a new drug on a specific patient, or how a surgical
    intervention might impact the patient''s body. This reduces the risk of unforeseen
    complications or adverse reactions, as potential issues can be addressed before
    the actual therapy or procedure is implemented. Moreover, digital twins can facilitate
    more proactive and preventative care by predicting potential health issues before
    they become severe. For example, by monitoring changes in the digital twin over
    time, healthcare providers may be able to detect the early stages of a disease
    that has yet to manifest noticeable symptoms in the patient. As a result, treatment
    can commence sooner, often leading to better outcomes. In addition, the use of
    digital twins can enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery. By providing
    a clear and comprehensive overview of a patient''s health status, they enable
    healthcare providers to make quicker, more accurate diagnoses, devise more effective
    treatment plans, and monitor patient progress more closely. This not only leads
    to improved patient care but also optimizes the use of healthcare resources. Overall,
    the integration of digital twins in healthcare represents a significant stride
    toward more personalized, efficient, and accurate care, underpinning the move
    toward precision medicine. Their use can help to reduce medical errors, improve
    patient outcomes, and enhance the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.
    This paper presents a cloud-based DT solution to address the challenges of storing
    patients'' medical information (both real-time and static) in emergency healthcare
    settings. The subsequent sections of the paper encompass a review of related works,
    an examination of the enabling technologies, a discussion of the proposed solution,
    and a conclusion. 2 Related Works 2.1 Digital Twins and Healthcare Although Digital
    Twins (DT) represent a relatively nascent technology, researchers have already
    investigated its application within the healthcare domain, yielding promising
    outcomes. Song et al. [2] conducted a survey on the utilization of DT in personal
    healthcare, proposing its use for assessing and maintaining individual health.
    They argued that the quality of a DT is contingent upon the completeness, update
    frequency, and accuracy of the observed data, which encompasses personalized risk
    factors such as behavior, vital signs, or symptoms. Xie et al. [3] applied DT
    and data mining techniques to electroencephalogram (EEG) data and medical history
    from the SEER database of patients, subsequently providing health status and feedback.
    Rivera et al. [4] outlined their vision for implementing DT in precision medicine,
    developing a reference model that capitalizes on DT capabilities, self-adaptive
    systems, and autonomic computing to engineer intelligent and flexible software
    systems for healthcare. The authors also delineated internal structures for DT
    to support precision medicine methodologies in the context of continuous monitoring
    and personalized, data-driven medical treatments. 2.2 Digital Twins and Healthcare

    currently are verbal over radio and written through designated forms. Studies
    suggest that the handover of information can be diluted due to the stressful environment
    the paramedics are communicating with the ED. Additionally, the progress and/or
    changes of patient’s appearance from the very first instance observed by paramedics
    to the point of hospital admission must be recorded, which is occasionally disregarded
    by current communication system. A primary solution proposed by Troyer et al.
    [5] is integrated medical record shared between medical center and EMS, which
    has not been studied and does not eliminate real-time data transfer, whilst some
    of the problems such as the effect of environment on data recording will remain
    in place. EMS utilizes two channels of data communication for handing over the
    patient to ED. Firstly, Transfer of Care (TOC) form is filed when transferring
    the patient to ED. The latter is a Patient Care Report (PCR), which is filed up
    to 72 h after care is concluded. On average, there is 25% discrepancies (such
    as allergies, used medications, etc.) between the two reports. In specific, numerical
    data such as heart rate and blood pressure were mismatched between TOC and PCR,
    and major data losses in both reports, with TOC missing around 40% more data than
    PCR [6]. This is concerning as TOC should be as precise as possible for urgent
    medical care. Improving data accuracy and assuring its completeness at the point
    of transferring patients to ED can be clearly seen to be an improving factor in
    providing faster medical service with higher quality inside the hospital. Additionally,
    EMS data recording and its communication with ED faces numerous more challenges
    such as difficulty of obtaining an unconscious patients’ information, paramedics’
    hardship in multi-tasking for providing care and passing information to hospital,
    radio signal instability, and communication overload at peak hours [7]. A solution
    proposed in this paper, adopting technology to overcome these challenges, is developing
    a mobile app to communicate with ED through captured videos (this was suggested
    to be through smart glasses) and photographs of patients alongside voice notes
    of paramedics. However, the mobile app will not be sending real-time data and
    their synchronization with any given medication to the patient. 2.3 Use of Digital
    Twins (DTs) The novel concept of digital twins has been considered/deployed in
    different applications ranging from industrial manufacturing [8] to ED [9] and
    human body [10]. The level of DT’s sophistication varies through each application
    due to the incompleteness of real-time and detailed data obtainable from Physical
    Twin (PT) in certain applications such as the human body as a whole. With our
    focus being on human body DT development, data and measurements associated with
    different body organs must be collected, this can be through real-time sensor
    data, medical history, observations, and genetic information [10]. An example
    of developed DT model on human heart using continuous obtainable data (ECG, blood
    pressure and heart rate) alongside uniform data such as heart geometry obtained
    through MRI, has been proposed by Kayvanpour et al. [11]. Sahal et al. [10] propose
    a framework to combine DT, AI and blockchain to improve physician–patient communication,
    facilitate shared decision-making and data privacy protection, respectively. A
    range of probable benefits in developing human body DT ranging from digital patient
    model, personalized treatment, rapid diagnosis, predicting response to surgical
    interventions, joint research opportunities and ultimately, human immortality
    through data were discussed. However, this paper can be seen as a general guidance
    and doesn’t attempt to solve a specific problem in healthcare, such as EMS patient
    flow, or methods of DT creation and their data storage. 2.4 Digital Twin Data
    Structure Singh et al. [12] proposed method of data structure that utilizes ontology
    for relational database management and transformation. They specifically use ontology
    to database mapping to overcome issues related to continuous update of data, easing
    the data query on the user’s side. Ontology to database mapping assumes the pre-existence
    of database and ontology, which produces a set corresponding mapping between the
    two schemas. Additionally, they have chosen relational database over graph-based
    data representation to support multi-user environment and standardized query language,
    whilst the graph-based approach has been admitted being more suitable for dynamic
    data modeling that are highly connected and complex, which is the case for DT
    data representation. Digital twin technology explored in healthcare, has provided
    little findings on practical approach for data structure [13] but detailed framework
    in how to store big data in different layers in cloud has been found in literature
    [14]. 2.5 Digital Twin Data Storage and Transmission Digital twin data storage
    varies based on its application. Glancing through industrial and healthcare applications,
    if data storage topic was touched on, cloud-based models were proposed [8, 15].
    Although, there are different cloud platforms that can be used, and the suitability
    varies based on the application’s requirements. In developing a DT of human heart,
    Edge storage and computing platform was proposed [15] to reduce latency to a minimum
    in data analytics. The significance of reduced latency would be highlighted in
    urgent scenarios. Other forms of data storage such as distributed file storage
    (DFS), NoSQL and NewSQL databases are proposed in literature [16], which impose
    little emphasis on data security and focus on available methodologies that can
    be used in different applications. In the same paper, the writers propose Aspera
    tool for data transmission, with underlying secure communication protocols such
    as HTTPS, SSL or SFTP. Hence, it is thought to be more suitable for real-time
    data flow. Other similar communication technologies such as LoRaWAN, 6G have been
    mentioned for data communication over the internet [17], whilst the implementation
    of lower layer protocols such as MQTT and ensuring its security for DT has not
    been found in literature. 2.6 Internet of Things and Cloud Computing Various technologies
    can facilitate DT implementation, including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud
    computing platforms, edge computing, APIs and integration platforms, machine learning
    and AI, and blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. This paper specifically
    concentrates on IoT and cloud computing as enablers of DT storage. Khaled et al.
    [18] designed a motor and wind turbine DT model using Simscape and Simulink, subsequently
    deploying the DT model on the Amazon AWS cloud. Saad et al. [19] proposed a cloud-based
    DT solution for power grid distribution systems, importing DT models into the
    AWS Lambda function and employing AWS Greengrass at the edge to extend cloud system
    functionality to IoT devices. Wang et al. [20] suggested an AWS-based Mobile Digital
    Twin (MDT) solution for personalized adaptive cruise control. The MDT (Fig. 1),
    comprising multiple DTs and interactions among them, represents a relatively comprehensive
    IoT and cloud solution for DT. The concept of cloud-based DT was validated and
    tested, with results demonstrating the feasibility of real-time DT implementation
    based on IoT and cloud computing technologies. Fig. 1 MDT cloud solution proposed
    by Wang et al. [20] Full size image 3 Enabling Technologies The focus of this
    paper is on identifying a practical and viable solution for storing Digital Twins
    (DT) in emergency healthcare. To this end, several technologies pertinent to DT
    cloud storage are surveyed, including cloud platforms, data transmission formats,
    and file storage formats. 3.1 Cloud Platforms Table 1 presents the results of
    the cloud platform survey. The table juxtaposes DT storage-related technologies
    from three major cloud service providers. In terms of services for medical file
    storage and processing, Amazon offers Healthcare Lake services, Microsoft Azure
    features Azure API for FHIR, and Google Cloud provides the Google Cloud Healthcare
    API. These services facilitate the storage, management, and analysis of health
    data in the cloud while adhering to standards such as FHIR, DICOM, and HL7. Table
    1 The survey of cloud services Full size table Regarding DT services, Amazon introduces
    AWS IoT TwinMaker, Microsoft supplies Azure Digital Twins and Digital Twin Definition
    Language, and Google offers Supply Chain Twin. These services enable the creation,
    visualization, and management of digital twins for IoT devices and systems, allowing
    for real-time synchronization, enhanced analytics, predictive maintenance, and
    improved decision-making. Real-time data stream processing is a vital component
    for storing and processing real-time data generated by medical devices in emergency
    healthcare settings. Amazon provides Kinesis data streams/analytics, Microsoft
    offers Azure Stream Analytics, and Google features Cloud Streaming Analytics.
    These services ensure efficient and reliable data processing and analysis, empowering
    data-driven decision-making and rapid response to changing conditions. In emergency
    healthcare environments, all data transmission and storage must comply with HIPAA
    regulations. This necessitates the encryption and validation of data generated
    by medical devices. While none of the surveyed cloud platforms offer specific
    IoMT services, they all assert that their IoT services comply with HIPAA. Each
    cloud platform has signed a standard Business Associate Addendum (BAA), implying
    that the services listed under the BAA adhere to HIPAA regulations. 3.2 Data Transmission
    Format In emergency healthcare settings, the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
    (MQTT) protocol ensures real-time transmission of data streams generated by medical
    equipment. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed
    for efficient and reliable communication between IoT devices, even in constrained
    or low-bandwidth environments. 3.3 Storage File Format Upon arriving at the cloud
    platforms, the real-time medical data stream is subjected to various processing
    steps and directed to two distinct destinations. The first destination entails
    immediate real-time processing and transmission to the Emergency Department (ED)
    of the recipient hospital. Conversely, the second destination involves the storage
    of the data within the Digital Twin (DT) residing in the cloud. The real-time
    medical data may be stored in one of two file formats within the DT. 3.3.1 HL7
    C-CDA Health Level Seven Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (HL7 C-CDA)
    is a standard for the exchange of electronic health information in a structured,
    interoperable format. It builds upon the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)
    standard, which defines the structure and semantics of clinical documents, such
    as discharge summaries, progress notes, and history and physical reports. C-CDA
    is a part of the broader HL7 framework, a set of international standards for the
    exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information.
    HL7 C-CDA provides a unified approach to structuring clinical documents by consolidating
    multiple CDA implementation guides into a single, harmonized standard. 3.3.2 HL7
    FHIR HL7 FHIR, an acronym for Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability
    Resources, embodies a contemporary, web-centric standard dedicated to facilitating
    the exchange of healthcare information between disparate systems. It is characterized
    by its emphasis on secure, efficient, and interoperable data transmission. Its
    development is anchored in the recognition of the paramount importance of data
    sharing in the modern healthcare landscape, particularly given the proliferation
    of digital health records and advancements in data-driven care. The FHIR standard
    is engineered to confront and navigate the myriad complexities and challenges
    intrinsic to the field of healthcare data exchange. The idiosyncrasies of healthcare
    data—its diversity, sensitivity, and the imperative for accuracy—make its handling
    a uniquely challenging endeavor. FHIR, as a standard, is designed to address these
    very challenges, bringing about a simplified, standardized, and interoperable
    approach to healthcare data exchange. One of the core features of FHIR is its
    resource-oriented architecture, which encapsulates discrete healthcare concepts
    into individual ''resources''. Each resource contains a specific, well-defined
    chunk of healthcare data, such as a patient''s demographic information, medical
    history, or laboratory results. This modular design enables the individual resources
    to be combined and used in various contexts, fostering a high degree of interoperability.
    Moreover, FHIR is built with the modern web in mind. It adopts many of the design
    principles and technologies commonly used in contemporary web services, such as
    RESTful APIs, JSON, and XML. This design choice not only ensures compatibility
    with current technologies but also provides developers with familiar tools and
    methodologies, facilitating the adoption of the standard. An additional strength
    of FHIR is its flexibility. It supports a wide range of use cases, from simple
    data retrieval to complex clinical decision support, making it suitable for a
    variety of healthcare scenarios. Furthermore, its extensible design allows for
    the incorporation of new data types or modifications to existing ones, ensuring
    the standard can evolve alongside advancements in healthcare and technology. The
    importance of security in healthcare data cannot be overstated, and FHIR addresses
    this need head-on. The standard includes built-in provisions for data security
    and privacy, supporting a range of security models and authorization protocols.
    It ensures that patient data can be securely exchanged between systems while adhering
    to relevant privacy regulations and standards. Through FHIR, healthcare organizations
    can share and integrate patient data more easily, making it a pivotal enabler
    of interoperability in healthcare. It facilitates the fluid exchange of information,
    thereby fostering a more connected and cohesive healthcare ecosystem. This capability
    is crucial in the era of digital health, where timely access to comprehensive
    and accurate patient data can significantly enhance clinical decision-making and,
    ultimately, patient outcomes. 4 Discussion on Our Proposal Upon examining the
    enabling technologies discussed in the preceding section, several observations
    can be made. All three cloud platforms demonstrate their suitability for constructing
    DT storage in emergency healthcare. However, since our study primarily focuses
    on the storage of real-time data within DT, Amazon AWS offers more sophisticated
    and powerful real-time data processing and analytical tools compared to Microsoft
    Azure and Google Cloud. Consequently, we have selected AWS as the cloud platform
    upon which we will construct our DT storage solution. AWS was selected as a platform
    to create temporal digital twin also due to several other factors explained below.
    4.1 Zone Availability Due to higher market share of AWS compared to its competitors
    (Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud), has led this service to have greater availability
    in different zones [21]. Holding a prosperous insight in this project, which means
    its expansion to different geographical locations, would require a service with
    highest availability in different zones. Hence, AWS is advantageous in this aspect.
    4.2 Security HIPAA compliancy for data transmission between different modules
    of AWS is/can be implemented. For instance, certain AWS services such as CloudTail
    and Amazon CloudWatch can be used to set logging requirements to ensure sensitive
    data sent through API Gateway are captured by HIPAA-eligible services. Additionally,
    storage modules (such as S3 and Glacier) are encrypted using management keys to
    ensure data privacy [22]. Microsoft Azure can provide layered security architecture
    for different application tiers to restrict public access to API applications
    as well as the existence of role-based access control and data encryption for
    transit and storage [23], which overall allows HIPAA compliancy. Similar security
    measures are implementable on Google Cloud [24], showcasing a competing scenario
    between cloud service providers from security perspective. Although, AWS has a
    higher reputation in security for addressing exact industrial needs such as HIPAA
    [22, 25]. 4.3 Cost The cost comparison for strongest instances that AWS and Microsoft
    Azure have on offer are analyzed and concluded that AWS’s processing engine is
    a cheaper service provider than Azure and Google Cloud [25,26,27], whilst AWS’s
    IoT platform is more expensive than its competitors due to greater range of cloud
    services it provides [28]. The MQTT protocol is deemed appropriate for transmitting
    real-time medical data, and as for the medical file storage format, FHIR is better
    suited for emergency healthcare scenarios due to its granularity, flexibility,
    and efficient API, which makes it an optimal choice for real-time data storage
    and exchange in most situations. Figure 2 provides a detailed visual representation
    of the proposed cloud-based Digital Twin (DT) storage solution, specifically designed
    to cater to the needs of emergency healthcare. This system incorporates an efficient,
    end-to-end process of data capture, processing, transmission, and storage. The
    utilization of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, which is known for
    its robustness and scalability, forms the backbone of this solution. Fig. 2 Proposed
    cloud-based DT storage solution Full size image In this sophisticated system,
    the initial data are captured by a diverse array of medical equipment aboard an
    emergency vehicle, such as an ambulance. The information gathered from these medical
    devices ranges from basic vital signs to more complex data, all of which contribute
    to painting a comprehensive picture of the patient''s health status. This collected
    data are subsequently transmitted to a Raspberry Pi device on the ambulance. The
    Raspberry Pi, a small but versatile computer, performs the function of transforming
    the captured data into Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) messages (Fig.
    3). MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for low-bandwidth, high-latency
    networks, making it particularly suitable for transmitting data from medical devices
    in emergency settings. Fig. 3 The MQTT messages received by a test program that
    subscribes to our AWS IoT Topic Full size image Following this transformation,
    the MQTT messages are relayed to the IoT Gateway of AWS IoT Core (Fig. 4) located
    within the larger AWS Cloud infrastructure. The IoT Gateway serves as the entry
    point for these messages into the cloud, effectively bridging the gap between
    the data source (the ambulance) and the cloud storage and processing system. Fig.
    4 The MQTT messages received by AWS IoT Core Full size image The IoT gateway,
    based on the rules established by IoT Act Rules, then distributes the incoming
    messages to the Simple Notification Service (SNS) Topic and AWS Kinesis (Fig.
    5). The former is a web service that coordinates the delivery or sending of messages
    to subscribing endpoints, while the latter is a real-time data streaming service
    offered by AWS. Fig. 5 The messages distributed to AWS SNS and AWS Kinesis Full
    size image Upon receiving the data, AWS Kinesis generates a tabular representation
    of the information, creating a structured format that is amenable to further analysis.
    This data can then be scrutinized through Kinesis Data Analytics (Fig. 6), a feature
    that provides insights into the processed data. Fig. 6 The output stream after
    AWS kinesis analytics processing. We can see that the AWS kinesis analytics extracts
    the data and make the data structured Full size image Simultaneously, a web server
    deployed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) receives the data stream
    from Kinesis Data Stream. This information is displayed on a web portal that can
    be accessed by handheld devices in the Emergency Department (ED) of the recipient
    hospital, allowing healthcare professionals to view real-time patient medical
    data. Additionally, the SNS messages are routed to an AWS Lambda function, a serverless
    compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages
    the compute resources (Fig. 7). This function transforms the data stream into
    Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) files, a standard for exchanging
    healthcare information electronically. Fig. 7 The Python code of AWS lambda function
    Full size image The resultant FHIR files (Fig. 8) are then stored in an Amazon
    Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, providing secure and scalable object storage.
    The stored data can be subsequently queried using AWS HealthLake, a HIPAA-eligible
    service for healthcare providers, health insurance companies, and pharmaceutical
    companies to store, transform, query, and analyze health data at scale. The insights
    derived from these queries are stored back in the S3 bucket, providing a comprehensive
    data record for future reference and ongoing patient care. Fig. 8 The real-time
    data is stored as FHIR files in a AWS S3 bucket Full size image In conclusion,
    the proposed cloud-based DT storage solution offers an integrated, efficient,
    and robust system for managing critical patient data in emergency healthcare settings.
    By harnessing the power of cutting-edge technologies and the AWS infrastructure,
    this system can significantly enhance real-time data availability, processing,
    and analysis, potentially improving patient outcomes and the overall efficiency
    of emergency medical services. Although the proposed solution appears viable,
    several challenges must be addressed before practical implementation can occur:
    Inadequate access control may allow unauthorized and potentially malicious actors
    to gain control of a cloud-based DT. This issue may be resolved in future work
    by incorporating Hyperledger Fabric technology. The absence of encryption may
    lead to unintentional personal health data leakage, potentially violating HIPAA
    regulations. This issue can be addressed by implementing the HTTPS protocol. A
    lack of vendor conformity may impede the adoption of the solution. While DT is
    a rapidly evolving technology, its maturity has not yet been fully realized. As
    the technology readiness level of DT becomes more established, this issue is expected
    to resolve itself. About the problems of medical data transmission security, various
    methods have been proposed in literature on how to encrypt data (specifically
    medical images) before its transmission to cloud. Several algorithms have been
    tested and implemented to encrypt images and texts to ensure data privacy and
    security [29,30,31] before it reaches AWS, that are worth to be considered in
    future work for complete data security (from a medical system to cloud and vice
    versa). About using AWS Healthlake with DT in the environment of emergency healthcare,
    we discuss as follows. AWS HealthLake is a highly scalable and secure cloud-based
    data service that is part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. It is designed
    to manage, process, and analyze vast amounts of structured and unstructured health
    data. Its core function is to transform health data from various sources and formats
    into the standardized Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format,
    which is a globally recognized and utilized standard for health data exchange.
    Once the data is in the FHIR format, it is much easier to analyze and can be readily
    utilized in machine learning and other analytical applications. The comprehensive
    nature of AWS HealthLake allows it to store, curate, query, and share data across
    an entire healthcare organization. This includes electronic health records (EHRs),
    wearable fitness trackers, clinical trials, and other relevant health data sources.
    HealthLake''s data lake architecture and serverless design make it capable of
    handling petabytes of health data, making it suitable for complex, large-scale
    health analytics tasks. In the context of utilizing a Digital Twin (DT) in an
    emergency healthcare environment, AWS HealthLake can provide a significant edge.
    The continuous stream of patient data generated by a DT, which replicates the
    patient''s physiological state in real-time, can be processed and stored using
    AWS HealthLake. The FHIR-based structured data can be queried to glean valuable
    insights about the patient''s current health status, possible treatment options,
    and the potential outcomes of different therapeutic interventions. This could
    include the real-time analysis of vital signs, predicting the body’s potential
    responses to different treatments, or estimating the recovery trajectory given
    the current interventions being applied. HealthLake''s compatibility with machine
    learning (ML) models and AI services offered by AWS, such as Amazon SageMaker,
    allows the development of predictive models that can significantly enhance patient
    care. Machine learning algorithms could analyze patterns in the patient''s DT
    data to predict the likely progression of their condition. This could range from
    simple predictions like heart rate or blood pressure trends, to complex forecasts
    such as the likelihood of a cardiac event or stroke. Moreover, these models could
    be continually refined over time. As the DT continues to generate data, the model
    could incorporate this new data to improve its accuracy and predictive capabilities.
    Over time, this could lead to more precise prediction models that can alert healthcare
    providers to potential health risks before they become critical, contributing
    to improved patient outcomes. In a nutshell, AWS HealthLake provides a scalable,
    secure, and robust data management system for health data. Its use in analyzing
    and predicting data from a Digital Twin in an emergency healthcare setting can
    lead to more informed decision-making, timely interventions, and improved patient
    outcomes. By facilitating the integration of advanced technologies such as machine
    learning and AI into healthcare, it represents a significant step toward the realization
    of precision medicine and personalized healthcare. 5 Conclusion This paper provides
    an in-depth, critical review of the existing literature at the confluence of digital
    twins (DT), healthcare, the internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing. These
    domains, while individually vast and complex, collectively contribute to a rapidly
    evolving ecosystem that holds significant potential for transformative change
    in healthcare systems across the globe. The review encompasses a broad spectrum
    of technologies that enable the effective functioning of digital twins within
    the healthcare space. Such technologies range from services provided by cloud
    platforms that host digital twins, to the intricate data transmission protocols
    that ensure the seamless transfer of information between digital twins and other
    systems, and even the storage file formats that help manage and safeguard this
    crucial data. Based on this in-depth evaluation and synthesis of the literature,
    the study proposes a novel, cloud-based digital twin storage solution, specifically
    designed for emergency healthcare scenarios. Recognizing the pressing need for
    real-time, accurate, and secure access to patient data during emergencies, the
    study underscores the development of a practical, viable, and scalable solution.
    The proposed system leverages state-of-the-art cloud computing technologies, coupled
    with innovative digital twin applications, to provide healthcare professionals
    with real-time, actionable insights that can significantly improve patient outcomes.
    6 Future Work Looking toward the future, this paper outlines a roadmap for further
    research endeavors. One of the main focal points of these endeavors will be refining
    and optimizing the proposed digital twin storage solution. This refinement process
    will emphasize stringent adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) regulations. Given the sensitive nature of healthcare data, ensuring
    compliance with these regulations is of utmost importance, guaranteeing the security
    and confidentiality of patient information. Beyond HIPAA compliance, the future
    iterations of this solution may incorporate cutting-edge security technologies.
    One such technology under consideration is the blockchain-based Hyperledger Fabric,
    a permissioned blockchain infrastructure known for its robust security features
    and scalability. The incorporation of such advanced security measures would add
    an additional layer of protection, further enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness
    of the solution. The long-term vision for the proposed solution is its evolution
    into a Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) offering. In this scenario, the digital
    twin technology would be offered as a service over the cloud, enabling healthcare
    providers to leverage the benefits of digital twins without the need for substantial
    upfront investment in infrastructure or expertise. Availability of Data and Materials

    workload is crucial for optimizing human performance and ensuring operational
    efficiency. Using an EEG-based Bi-directional Gated Network (BDGN) approach, this
    study tries to figure out how to classify cognitive workload in Industry 5.0 applications.
    The proposed approach incorporates LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated

    reveal an impressive accuracy of 98% in cognitive workload classification, validating
    the efficacy of the suggested BDGN approach. This study emphasizes the significance
    of leveraging EEG-based approaches in Industry 5.0 applications for cognitive
    workload management. Keywords: cognitive workload; Industry 5.0; electroencephalogram;

    1. Introduction Industry 5.0 is set to usher in a new era of seamless integration
    between advanced technologies and human–machine interactions [1], increasing productivity
    and efficiency [2]. This paradigm shift emphasizes the optimization of human–machine
    interactions to improve overall performance [3]. A key aspect of this optimization
    is managing the cognitive workload placed on individuals [4] during their interactions
    with machines. Cognitive workload refers to the mental effort and resources required
    to accomplish a task or process information [5] effectively. It is influenced
    by task complexity [6], time pressure, and environmental demands [7]. Excessive
    cognitive workload can decrease performance and lead to errors and safety hazards
    [8]. Therefore, accurately assessing and managing the cognitive workload is crucial
    for optimizing human performance and ensuring safety in Industry 5.0 applications
    [9]. For real-time cognitive workload classification, various methods have been
    explored [10], including physiological measurements such as electroencephalography
    (EEG), which is a test that records the electrical activity of the brain using
    scalp electrodes [11]; electrocardiography (ECG), a medical test to measure the
    electrical activity of the heart [12]; electromyography (EMG), which is used to
    evaluate the electrical activity of muscles [13]; and eye tracking, which is technology
    that monitors and records the movement of the gaze of a person [14]. Task performance
    metrics [15], functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) [16], and multimodal
    integration contribute further. Among the array of methods, electroencephalography
    (EEG) emerges as both a widely adopted and valuable approach [17]. EEG signals
    provide insights into the temporal dynamics of cognitive workload [18], enabling
    accurate assessment and classification in real-time scenarios [19]. Notably, EEG
    excels as a premier technique for real-time cognitive workload classification
    due to its direct brain activity measurement, high temporal resolution that captures
    rapid changes, noninvasiveness, portability, and sensitivity to nuanced cognitive
    states. These inherent advantages position EEG as a valuable tool to unravel the
    intricate neural dynamics of cognitive processes, making it pivotal for accurate
    and timely workload assessment across diverse real-world applications. In the
    field of cognitive workload classification, there is a need for more research
    on how to combine EEG-based methods with more-advanced neural network architectures.
    While the significance of cognitive workload management is acknowledged, the existing
    methods often lack the precision and real-time capabilities required to meet the
    intricate demands of Industry 5.0 interactions. Most of the potential synergy
    between EEG signals and recurrent neural networks like LSTM and GRU is not being
    used. This leaves a hole in the field of efficient and accurate assessment of
    cognitive workload. A research gap emerges in the realm of cognitive workload
    classification, specifically concerning the amalgamation of EEG-based methodologies
    with advanced neural network architectures. While the significance of cognitive
    workload management is acknowledged, the existing methods often lack the precision
    and real-time capabilities required to meet the intricate demands of Industry
    5.0 interactions. The potential synergy between EEG signals and recurrent neural
    networks like LSTM and GRU remains largely untapped, leaving a void in the domain
    of efficient and accurate cognitive workload assessment. In this study, we specifically
    focus on EEG as the primary method for cognitive workload classification. By leveraging
    EEG signals, we aim to extract meaningful features and patterns that correlate
    with different levels of cognitive workload. EEG allows us to capture the neural
    activity associated with cognitive processes [20], providing valuable information
    for real-time cognitive workload classification. Furthermore, EEG-based classification
    models have demonstrated promising performance in previous studies, showcasing
    their effectiveness in accurately assessing cognitive workload levels. Artificial
    intelligence techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [21], Long
    Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [22], and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)
    [23], have shown promise in processing and analyzing EEG signals for cognitive
    workload classification. These models capture temporal dependencies and extract
    meaningful features from EEG data [24]. This research article presents a novel
    real-time cognitive workload classification approach in Industry 5.0 applications.
    We leverage Bi-Directional Gated Networks (BDGNs) to accurately and efficiently
    classify cognitive workload levels. We intend to develop a hybrid methodology
    integrating deep learning models, including LSTM and GRU [25,26], as a BDGN framework.
    By leveraging these models and the STEW dataset [27], our goal is to attain high
    accuracy in classifying various levels of cognitive workload. To enable real-time
    classification in an industrial environment [28], our intended model is deployed
    alongside the MQTT [29] protocol. MQTT ensures efficient data transmission [30],
    facilitating timely cognitive workload classification. The north gateway receives
    EEG data forwarded to the server for cognitive workload classification. The resulting
    predictions are then transmitted to the south gateway for comprehensive analysis
    and informed decision-making. The remarkable effectiveness of the BDGN approach
    in real-time cognitive workload classification is emphasized by the findings of
    this research. Achieving a high classification accuracy of 98% demonstrates the
    potential of this approach to optimize industrial processes and enhance human–machine
    interactions. These findings underscore the significance of cognitive workload
    classification in industrial applications, emphasizing its impact on operational
    efficiency and safety. Effective cognitive workload classification in Industry
    5.0 can enhance human–machine interactions and efficiency in applications like
    manufacturing lines (task optimization) and telemedicine (accurate diagnostics),
    ensuring safer and more-productive operations [31]. By leveraging the power of
    EEG signals and the capabilities of the BDGN model, this research contributes
    to advancing cognitive workload classification and provides a solid foundation
    for designing and implementing intelligent systems that can adaptively respond
    to the cognitive demands of Industry 5.0 applications. The remainder of this paper
    is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work in cognitive
    workload classification. Section 3 describes the materials and methods, including
    the EEG data acquisition process, preprocessing techniques, and the architecture
    of the recommended BDGN model. Section 4 presents the results and discussion.
    Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and provides future research directions.
    2. Literature Review Cognitive workload classification is crucial for optimizing
    human–machine interactions in various domains, including Industry 5.0 [32]. The
    reviewed studies highlight the field’s advancements, methodologies, and limitations,
    providing valuable insights for developing our research. Shao et al. [33] proposed
    an EEG-based mental workload classification framework utilizing a combination
    of Bi-LSTM and ResNet models in an IoT scenario. They employed the STEW dataset
    and performed time–frequency analysis to extract informative features. The scheme
    achieved an accuracy of 90.64% for different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
    of their approach. Additionally, the authors evaluated the scheme for mental workload
    valuation and achieved an accuracy of 82.85%. Gupta et al. [34], in their study,
    presented a subject-specific cognitive workload classification approach using
    EEG and deep learning models, specifically conv-LSTM. Their study involved 19
    participants, and an accuracy of 93.75% was achieved. The researchers organized
    their own experiment at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of
    Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Delhi, India, showcasing the feasibility
    of their advocated approach in a controlled setting. Keeping in view the importance
    of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Chakladar et al. [23] introduced a novel
    framework for estimating different levels of mental workload using the gray wolf
    optimizer algorithm and a deep BLSTM-LSTM neural model. Their experiments involved
    “No task” and “multitasking activity” scenarios, achieving classification accuracies
    of 86.33% and 82.57%, respectively. However, it is worth noting that their approach
    did not incorporate transfer learning to other types of tasks, limiting its generalizability.
    Kwak et al. [35] proposed an LSTM-based temporal attention technique to extract
    both local and global structure information from EEG data for mental workload
    classification. Their approach demonstrated remarkable accuracy, achieving 90.8%
    on their own dataset. Although their study did not focus specifically on IoT scenarios,
    the findings highlight the potential of temporal attention mechanisms for effective
    mental workload classification. In another study, Wójcik et al. [36] focused on
    a three-class classification of cognitive workload using EEG data. They conducted
    their own experiment with 12 participants, analyzing the data from 11 subjects.
    Employing SVM, decision tree, k-NN, and random forest models, they achieved accuracies
    of 82.9%, 70.4%, 91.5%, and 84.6%, respectively. While significant progress has
    been made in EEG-based cognitive workload classification for IoT scenarios, several
    research gaps need to be addressed. Firstly, there is a limited focus on cognitive
    workload classification in industrial applications, highlighting the need for
    tailored approaches to address the unique challenges and requirements of Industry
    5.0. Additionally, existing models such as CNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM may not be efficient
    for real-time EEG data processing in resource-constrained IoT devices. Furthermore,
    the transferability of models to different tasks and achieving high accuracy for
    industrial deployment require further investigation. Challenges related to varying
    environmental conditions, electrode placement variability, and subject-specific
    factors in industrial scenarios also need to be explored to enhance the practical
    implementation of cognitive workload classification systems. 3. Materials and
    Methods 3.1. The Proposed Framework This research study presents a deep learning
    model for real-time data transmission and classification. We utilized a publicly
    available dataset using IEEE DataPort [27] and conducted preprocessing steps to
    enhance the data quality and prepare the data for training our model [37]. Furthermore,
    we leveraged the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol to enable
    end-to-end data transmission and classification with the deployed deep learning
    model. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, preprocessing,
    time domain analysis, power spectral density (PSD) analysis, and the deployment
    process, highlighting the critical steps involved in our research methodology.
    Figure 1 depicts the proposed cognitive workload classification framework. The
    process initiates with the acquisition of raw EEG data, followed by preprocessing
    involving artifact removal, filtering, and segmentation. Post-preprocessing, the
    data undergo time domain and power spectral density (PSD) analysis to extract
    valuable characteristics. The preprocessed data are then fed into the BDGN model
    for classification. The model is deployed on a server. Simultaneously, the North
    gateway obtains EEG data from the STEW dataset, forwarding the data to an MQTT
    broker. The broker transmits the data to the server for live classification, and
    the results are relayed back to the broker. Finally, the broker shares the results,
    linking with the South gateway. Figure 1. A framework of the proposed cognitive
    workload classification. 3.2. Dataset Description The STEW (Simultaneous Task
    EEG Workload) is a publicly available dataset comprising EEG signals from 48 male
    subjects collected at Nanyang Technological University [23]. EEG data were captured
    using the Emotive EEG device. The recruited participants had no history of neurological
    or brain-related conditions and had not participated in prior EEG studies. The
    dataset encompasses EEG recordings in two distinct states: the rest state and
    the task execution state. The rest state indicates periods when no specific tasks
    were performed, while the task execution state involved engaging in a multitasking
    test called SIMKAP. Each subject in the dataset comprises 19,200 samples in both
    rest and task execution states. During SIMKAP, the participants were instructed
    to compare numbers in two windows, cross out matching numbers, and answer accompanying
    questions simultaneously. Participants were also requested to provide subjective
    ratings of their perceived workload during the rest state and SIMKAP tasks. Equal
    task completion was ensured among all subjects during EEG data acquisition. SIMKAP,
    widely adopted for assessing multitasking stress [38], serves as a valuable component
    of this dataset. 3.3. Preprocessing Each subject in the STEW dataset recorded
    14 channels of EEG signals and sampled at a rate of 128 Hz, with a total recording
    time of 3 min per subject. To mitigate the influence of intertask activity, the
    initial 15 s and final 15 s of each signal were discarded, resulting in a final
    signal length of 2.5 min. The EEG signals dataset is preprocessed using the Python-based
    jupyterlab toolbox, and only signals within the frequency range of 0.5–100 Hz
    were retained for psychological load analysis [39]. The dataset categorized the
    EEG signals into two distinct tasks: the rest mode and the SIMKAP task. Ratings
    of mental workload levels, obtained from the subjects themselves, were used as
    labels for the different task phases. The ratings were classified into three levels:
    low workload (ratings 1–3), average workload (ratings 4–6), and high workload
    (ratings 7–9). The classification performance was assessed by comparing the predicted
    workload ratings with the actual labels of the unseen data. 3.4. Time Domain Analysis
    Time domain analysis serves as a critical component of our study, involving an
    in-depth examination of EEG data acquired during both low-mode and high-mode conditions
    [40]. This analytical approach delves into the temporal intricacies of the EEG
    data, facilitating an exploration of distinctive patterns and fluctuations over
    time. To comprehensively understand the underlying dynamics, EEG data from both
    low-mode and high-mode conditions were leveraged for this analysis. Particularly,
    this method was applied across all 14 channels, offering a holistic overview of
    the temporal aspects and revealing potential insights into the intricate neural
    responses characteristic of these distinct cognitive states. This rigorous time
    domain analysis provides a foundation for elucidating the temporal dynamics of
    EEG data and contributes to our comprehensive investigation of cognitive workload
    classification. Figure 2a,b depict the outcomes of our time domain analysis conducted
    on EEG data. We chose to focus on two specific channels, namely Channel 1 and
    Channel 14, as representative examples. While our comprehensive analysis encompasses
    all 14 channels, the selection of these two channels is intended to offer a succinct
    overview of the overarching trends observed in our study. Channel 1 represents
    the initial channel, while Channel 14 signifies the final channel in our dataset.
    This selection is not meant to diminish the significance of the other channels
    but serves to illustrate key findings within the constraints of this presentation.
    The analysis involved a comparison between two distinct conditions: Low-Mode and
    High-Mode cognitive workload conditions. In these figures, the x-axis corresponds
    to time, measured in seconds, while the y-axis represents the amplitude of the
    EEG signals. Figure 2. (a,b) Time domain analysis. The purpose of this analysis
    was to investigate how the EEG signals from these two channels vary over time
    under different cognitive workload conditions. Channel 1 and Channel 14 were selected
    as representative examples to showcase the observed patterns. By comparing the
    EEG signals between the Low-Mode and High-Mode conditions, we aimed to identify
    any notable differences in terms of signal amplitude and fluctuations. 3.5. Power
    Spectral Density (PSD) Analysis The power spectral density (PSD) analysis is performed
    to understand EEG data’s frequency characteristics and power distribution [41].
    The raw EEG data for the low and high modes were obtained, and relevant channels
    were selected for further analysis. The sampling frequency of 128 Hz was used
    to process the data. Frequency bands of interest, including Delta (0.5–4 Hz),
    Theta (4–8 Hz), Alpha (8–13 Hz), Beta (13–30 Hz), and Gamma (30–100 Hz), were
    defined to explore brain activity patterns. The FFT algorithm was applied to compute
    the frequency components and their magnitudes. The power spectrum was then calculated
    by taking the absolute value squared of the FFT output [42], representing the
    distribution of power across different frequency components. Analysis was performed
    within each frequency band to quantify the power present in each respective range.
    Here is the equation for the PSD of EEG signals: 𝑃𝑆𝐷(𝑓)=|FFT(x(t))|^2/(T∗Fs) (1)
    where PSD(f) is the power spectral density at frequency f, FFT(x(t)) is the Fast
    Fourier Transform of the EEG signal x(t), |FFT(x(t))|^2 represents the squared
    magnitude of the FFT, T is the total duration of the EEG signal in seconds, Fs
    is the sampling frequency of the EEG signal in Hz. In Figure 3a,b, the power spectrum
    distribution analysis of EEG data is presented for both the Low-Mode and High-Mode
    cognitive workload conditions. The x-axis of these figures denotes different frequency
    bands, encompassing the Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma ranges. Meanwhile,
    the y-axis signifies the corresponding power values associated with each frequency
    band. This analysis unveils how the power of EEG signals is distributed across
    different frequency components, offering insights into the distinctive neural
    activity patterns between the two cognitive workload conditions. Figure 3. (a,b)
    Frequency bands. 3.6. Deep Learning Model for Cognitive Workload Classification
    The Bi-directional Gated Network (BDGN) introduces an innovative framework that
    effectively harnesses the synergistic capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks to achieve precise cognitive workload
    classification. In BDGN, the LSTM and GRU components play pivotal roles in capturing
    and processing intricate temporal patterns within the EEG data. 3.6.1. BDGN Architecture
    The architectural design of the BDGN model is meticulously sculpted within the
    Keras framework, where layers are carefully sequenced to optimize the performance.
    Beginning with an input layer, the architecture evolves into a 64-unit LSTM layer,
    adept at capturing intricate long-range dependencies courtesy of its inherent
    memory mechanism. After that, a GRU layer with 32 units is added without any problems.
    This makes the model better at figuring out complex temporal relationships, which
    are key to cognitive workload analysis. Culminating the architectural journey
    is a dense layer armed with a SoftMax activation function, which translates into
    predicted class probabilities for the distinct “low”, “normal”, and “high” workload
    categories. This architecture balances complexity and efficiency, making it suitable
    for real-time cognitive workload assessment and demonstrating competitive performance
    in experiments. The architecture of our hybrid LSTM–GRU model for cognitive workload
    classification is depicted in Figure 4. It shows the input layer, the hidden layers,
    and the output layer. Figure 4. BDGN neural architecture. 3.6.2. BDGN Model Process
    The input EEG data for the BDGN model consist of 96 files, divided into 48 low-mode
    and 48 high-mode data files. Each data file is structured as a matrix with dimensions
    of 19,200 rows (samples) and 15 columns. These columns encompass 14 EEG channels,
    and one additional column is allocated for ratings. The BDGN model processes the
    input EEG data ( 𝑋 𝑡 ) through the LSTM and GRU components step by step. Each
    step is defined by a mathematical equation as follows: Input Gate ( 𝑖 𝑡 ): The
    input gate ( 𝑖 𝑡 ) controls which values from the current input ( 𝑋 𝑡 ) and the
    previous hidden state ( 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡−1 ) should be incorporated into the cell state
    ( 𝐶 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 ). 𝑖 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑖  ·[ 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡−1  , 𝑋 𝑡 ]+ 𝑏 𝑖 ) (2) Here, σ represents
    the sigmoid activation function, 𝑊 𝑖 is the weight matrix for the input gate,
    and 𝑏 𝑖 is the bias vector for the input gate. 2. Forget Gate ( 𝑓 𝑡 ): The forget
    gate ( 𝑓 𝑡 ) determines what information from the previous LSTM cell state ( 𝐶
    𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡−1 ) should be retained and what information should be discarded. 𝑓 𝑡 =𝜎(
    𝑊 𝑓  ·[ 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡−1  , 𝑋 𝑡 ]+ 𝑏 𝑓 ) (3) 𝑊 𝑓 is the weight matrix for the forget
    gate, and 𝑏 𝑓 is the bias vector for the forget gate. 3. Output Gate ( 𝑜 𝑡 ):
    The output gate ( 𝑜 𝑡 ) determines what the next hidden state ( 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 ) should
    be. It decides which parts of the current cell state ( 𝐶 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 ) should be revealed
    as the output. 𝑜 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑜 ·[ 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡−1  , 𝑋 𝑡 ]+ 𝑏 𝑜 ) (4) 𝑊 𝑜 is the weight
    matrix for the output gate, and 𝑏 𝑜 is the bias vector for the output gate. 4.
    Update Cell State ( 𝐶 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡 ): The update cell state ( 𝐶 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡 ) represents
    the candidate values that could potentially be updated in the cell state ( 𝐶 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀
    𝑡 ). 𝐶 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡 =𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑊 𝑐  ·[ 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡−1  , 𝑋 𝑡 ]+ 𝑏 𝑐 ) (5) Here, 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ is
    the hyperbolic tangent activation function, 𝑊 𝑐 is the weight matrix for the candidate
    cell state, and 𝑏 𝑐 is the bias vector for the candidate cell state. 5. Update
    Cell State ( 𝐶 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 ): The update cell state ( 𝐶 𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡 ) is combined with
    the forget gate ( 𝑓 𝑡  ) and the input gate ( 𝑖 𝑡  ) to compute the updated cell
    state ( 𝐶 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 ): 𝐶 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑡  · 𝐶 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡−1 + 𝑖 𝑡 · 𝐶 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡 (6) 6.
    Hidden State ( 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 ): The final step in the LSTM layer computes the hidden
    state ( 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 ) by applying the output gate ( 𝑜 𝑡 ) to the cell state ( 𝐶 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀
    𝑡 ) after applying the hyperbolic tangent activation function: 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 = 𝑂 𝑡  ·tanh
    ( 𝐶 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 ) (7) Now, using 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 as the Input to the GRU Layer to Compute
    𝐻 𝐺𝑅𝑈 𝑡 , we obtain the following: 7. GRU Update Gate ( 𝑧 𝑡 ) and Reset Gate (  𝑟
    𝑡 ): The GRU component employs the update gate ( 𝑧 𝑡 ) and the reset gate (  𝑟
    𝑡 ) to control how much of the previous hidden state ( 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 ) is retained
    or updated and how much is forgotten when computing the candidate new hidden state.
    𝑧 𝑡 ,  𝑟 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑧  ·[ 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡  , 𝑋 𝑡 ]+ 𝑏 𝑧 ,  𝑊 𝑟  ·[ 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡  , 𝑋 𝑡 ]+ 𝑏
    𝑟 ) (8) 8. GRU Candidate Hidden State ( 𝐻 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡 ): The candidate hidden
    state ( 𝐻 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡 ) is calculated by applying the hyperbolic tangent activation
    function ( 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ ) to a weighted sum of 𝑟 𝑡 · 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 and 𝑋 𝑡 . 𝐻 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡
    =tanh ( 𝑊 ℎ ·[ 𝑟 𝑡 · 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡  , 𝑋 𝑡 ]+ 𝑏 ℎ (9) 9. Updated Hidden State of GRU
    ( 𝐻 𝐺𝑅𝑈 𝑡 ): The final updated hidden state ( 𝐻 𝐺𝑅𝑈 𝑡 ) of the GRU layer is computed
    as a linear combination of (1− 𝑍 𝑡 )· 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 and 𝑍 𝑡 · 𝐻 𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡 : 𝐻 𝐺𝑟𝑢
    𝑡 =(1− 𝑧 𝑡 )· 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 + 𝑍 𝑡 · 𝐻 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑡 (10) The input EEG data 𝑋 𝑡 are
    initially processed by the LSTM layer to obtain 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 , and then 𝐻 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 𝑡 is
    used as input to the GRU layer to compute the final updated hidden state 𝐻 𝐺𝑅𝑈
    𝑡 . 10. Output Prediction ( 𝑌 𝑡  ): The final prediction ( 𝑌 𝑡  ) is computed
    using the updated hidden state ( 𝐻 𝐺𝑅𝑈 𝑡 ) as input, followed by a SoftMax activation
    to obtain class probabilities. 𝑌 𝑡 =Softmax( 𝑊 𝑦 · 𝐻 𝐺𝑅𝑈 𝑡 + 𝑏 𝑦 ) (11) These
    LSTM and GRU gates work synergistically in the BDGN, allowing the network to capture
    and process temporal dependencies at various time scales. The LSTM gates enable
    the model to manage long-term dependencies, while the GRU gates excel at capturing
    shorter-term patterns. The collaborative operation of these gates enhances the
    network’s capacity to precisely classify cognitive workload levels based on EEG
    data, making the BDGN a promising advancement in cognitive workload assessment.
    3.6.3. Data Partitioning and Model Training To ensure both impartial evaluation
    and effective model training, a meticulous dataset partitioning scheme was devised,
    demarcating distinct subsets for dedicated training, validation, and rigorous
    testing. The partitioning strategy thoughtfully assigns 60% of the dataset to
    training, allocates 20% for validation, and carefully reserves 20% for the critical
    testing phase. For the training, we employed the Adam optimizer with a learning
    rate of 0.001, a popular choice for optimizing deep learning models. The sparse
    categorical cross-entropy loss function was used, which is well suited for multiclass
    classification tasks. Minimizing this loss function allows the model to assign
    high probabilities to the correct workload category during training. During the
    training process, the model was exposed to the training data for 50 epochs, this
    iterative learning process facilitates the model’s progressive mastery of accurately
    classifying cognitive workload levels, resulting in heightened precision. The
    culmination of this iterative training led to the model’s comprehensive evaluation,
    executed with rigor on the meticulously reserved testing set. 3.7. Evaluation
    Metrics and Measures This research employed multiple evaluation metrics, including
    the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix provided a tabular representation of
    the model’s performance, consisting of true labels (low, average, high) and predicted
    labels (low, average, high) obtained from the BDGN model. To assess the performance
    of the learning models, we employed key evaluation metrics, including accuracy
    [43], precision [44], recall [45], and F1-score [46]. These metrics provide comprehensive
    insights into the effectiveness of the models in classifying cognitive workload
    levels. Accuracy is measured as follows: 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦= 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠+𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑁𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠
    𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (12) Precision can be calculated as follows: 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒
    𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠+𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 (13) To calculate the Recall, the below
    equation is used: 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙= 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠+𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝑁𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 (14) The
    F1-Score is measured as follows: 𝐹1𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒=2∗ 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛∗𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
    (15) 3.8. Real-Time Cognitive Workload Classification To achieve a comprehensive
    end-to-end solution encompassing data transmission and classification, the deployment
    seamlessly integrated the MQTT protocol with the BDGN model, harnessing MQTT QoS
    version 0, MQTT protocol 3.1.1, and the MQTT version EMQ X Broker Version 4.3.5.
    Through the MQTT protocol, efficient and reliable data communication [47] was
    facilitated between the North Gateway and South Gateway. The process unfolds as
    follows: the North Gateway acts as the data source, publishing EEG data to the
    MQTT broker, which, in turn, forwards the data to the AI script for real-time
    classification. Subsequently, the MQTT broker receives the classification results
    from the AI script. Concurrently, the South Gateway subscribes to the relevant
    topic, thereby receiving the classification results. Figure 5 shows the classification
    workflow, ensuring seamless data exchange across the network. Figure 5. Illustration
    of real-time cognitive workload classification using BDGN model and MQTT protocol.
    In the experimental scenario, the North Gateway continuously collected real-time
    EEG data at 128 Hz. These data were transmitted to the MQTT broker for immediate
    processing and classification using the deployed BDGN model. The resulting classification
    labels, representing the cognitive workload levels (low, average, high), were
    sent to the South Gateway, enabling real-time access to the classified cognitive
    workload information. This experimental setup allowed for the real-time monitoring
    and analysis of cognitive workload levels using the BDGN model and MQTT broker
    integration. By leveraging the BDGN model’s power and the MQTT protocol’s efficiency,
    this approach provided a robust and scalable solution for end-to-end cognitive
    workload classification in industrial applications. 4. Results and Discussion
    This section presents the results obtained by implementing the BDGN model for
    real-time cognitive workload classification. Our study investigates the performance
    and effectiveness of the BDGN model in this specific task. We utilized performance
    metrics to evaluate the model’s classification accuracy. Additionally, we compared
    our results with existing studies to assess the novelty and effectiveness of our
    approach. The presented findings contribute to our understanding of the BDGN model’s
    capabilities and its potential for practical implementation in real-time cognitive
    workload classification. 4.1. Performance of Bi-Directional Gated Network (BDGN)
    Model The BDGN (Bi-directional Gated Neural Network) model, which combines the
    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) architectures, was
    implemented and evaluated for cognitive workload classification in real-time industrial
    applications. The model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a remarkable
    accuracy of 98%. Figure 6 presents the model accuracy plot, which provides insights
    into the performance of the BDGN model during training. The plot showcases consistently
    high accuracy across the training epochs, indicating the model’s ability to classify
    cognitive workload levels accurately. The model achieved and maintained a remarkable
    accuracy level of 98%, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the underlying
    patterns and characteristics of the data. Figure 6. BDGN model accuracy. Figure
    7 depicts the model loss plot, demonstrating a steady decline in loss over the
    training iterations. The descending trajectory of the loss curve signifies the
    model’s ability to learn effectively and minimize errors. The model loss reached
    a minimal value of 0.5%, highlighting the robustness of the BDGN model in capturing
    intricate patterns and optimizing cognitive workload classification. Figure 7.
    BDGN model loss. The confusion matrix provides valuable insights into the BDGN
    model’s classification performance across the different cognitive workload classes.
    The matrix comprises both diagonal elements, representing correctly classified
    instances, and off-diagonal elements, indicating misclassified instances. The
    confusion matrix is shown in Figure 8 to further evaluate the model’s performance.
    Figure 8. Confusion matrix showing all the labels. Analyzing the specific values
    of the confusion matrix, we observe the following: The BDGN model accurately classified
    96,086 instances as “Low Workload”. For the “Medium-Workload” class, the model
    correctly classified 172,263 instances. In the “High-” class, the BDGN model achieved
    accurate classifications in 91,416 instances. The confusion matrix values reveal
    the misclassifications as follows: The model misclassified 392 instances, assigning
    them to the neighboring “Medium-Workload” class, which should have been classified
    as “Low Workload”. Similarly, there were 271 instances misclassified as “Low Workload”
    when they should have been classified as “Medium Workload”. Additionally, the
    model misclassified 3558 instances as “Medium Workload” that should have been
    classified as “High Workload”. Lastly, there were 475 instances misclassified
    as “Low Workload” instead of being classified as “High Workload”. The evaluation
    metrics presented in Table 1 provide a comprehensive analysis of the BDGN model’s
    classification performance. These metrics include precision, recall, and F1-score,
    which offer insights into the model’s accuracy, ability to capture relevant instances,
    and the balance between precision and recall. Table 1. Evaluation metrics. The
    precision values obtained for each class are as follows: For the “High” class,
    the model achieved a precision of 0.96, indicating that 96% of instances classified
    as “High” were correctly identified. Similarly, the “Low” class attained a precision
    of 0.99, suggesting that 99% of instances classified as “Low” were accurately
    identified. For the “Normal” class, the model achieved a precision of 0.96, indicating
    that 96% of instances classified as “Normal” were correctly identified. The recall
    values obtained for each class are as follows: The “High” class achieved a recall
    of 0.96, indicating that the model correctly identified 96% of the actual “High”
    workload instances. The “Low” class achieved a recall of 1.00, indicating that
    the model successfully identified all “Low” workload instances. The “Normal” class
    attained a recall of 0.95, signifying that 95% of the actual “Normal” workload
    instances were correctly identified. The F1-scores obtained for each class are
    as follows: The “High” class achieved an F1-score of 0.96, indicating a balanced
    performance in terms of precision and recall. The “Low” class attained a perfect
    F1-score of 1.00, highlighting the model’s ability to achieve a harmonious balance
    between precision and recall. The “Normal” class achieved an F1-score of 0.96,
    signifying a balanced performance similar to that for the “High” workload class.
    4.2. Comparison with Existing Studies We conducted a comparative analysis with
    existing studies in the field, as summarized in Table 2. Our study surpasses previous
    works in terms of accuracy, demonstrating the superiority of the BDGN model for
    cognitive workload classification. This comparison provides strong evidence of
    the model’s effectiveness and reinforces its potential for practical implementation.
    Table 2. Comparison with existing studies. 4.3. Real-Time Transmission and Classification
    We implemented a data transmission system utilizing the MQTT (Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport) protocol, maintaining a precise 1- to 3-millisecond transmission
    latency. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol offers low-latency
    data transmission, typically with latencies ranging from 1 to 5 milliseconds,
    depending on network and implementation factors [48]. Our classification process
    involves accurately analyzing 128 signals across 14 channels, with each signal
    introducing a 1 s delay. The classification model operates within a 3 to 5 s timeframe.
    Thus, the entire classification procedure spans 132 to 134 s, showcasing our commitment
    to efficient and accurate analysis within this system. The system consisted of
    a North Gateway, an MQTT broker, a Server, and a South Gateway. Figure 9 illustrates
    the MQTT Explorer with the Predicted Label set at high. Figure 9. MQTT Explorer
    displays 9 segments of EEG data in separate windows with predicted classification
    as “High”. In Figure 10, the North Gateway shows the live reception of EEG (electroencephalography)
    data, ensuring a continuous flow of real-time data for classification. Figure
    10. North Gateway showing live reception of EEG data. The Server is a vital system
    component for performing real-time classification of cognitive workload levels.
    Leveraging the trained BDGN model, the Server processes the incoming EEG (electroencephalography)
    data and generates accurate predictions in real time. Figure 11 presents the integration
    of the Server within the MQTT-based system, which enables efficient cognitive
    workload classification. It receives live EEG data transmitted by the North Gateway
    and applies advanced algorithms to classify the cognitive workload levels of the
    users in real time. Figure 11. Server receiving live data from MQTT broker with
    transmission latency. The South Gateway presents the classification results received
    from the server. Figure 12 visualizes the successful transmission of real-time
    classification information from the server to the South Gateway. The displayed
    results facilitate timely decision-making and intervention based on the user’s
    cognitive workload level. Figure 12. South Gateway showing real-time classification
    results from server with classification time in seconds. These visualizations
    collectively illustrate the effectiveness and real-time nature of the proposed
    system. Integrating the BDGN model with the MQTT infrastructure enables continuous
    data transmission, real-time classification, and efficient dissemination of classification
    results. The real-time classification process ensures the prompt identification
    and monitoring of cognitive workload levels, enabling proactive measures to optimize
    performance, ensure safety, and enhance overall productivity in various Industry
    5.0 applications. This simulation-based framework, uniting the BDGN model with
    MQTT technology, presents an avenue to practical implementation in real-world
    scenarios. While our study unfolds within a simulated environment, it beckons
    an exploration of its viability beyond digital confines. Our simulation identifies
    key metrics that extend their significance from simulation to reality. Table 3
    provides a way of comparison and metrics including latency, classification accuracy,
    speed, and message loss rate serve as pivotal benchmarks for feasibility. Table
    3. Way to compare with real-world scenarios. Our simulation reveals a latency
    of 1 to 3 milliseconds, whereas real-world latencies could surpass 100 milliseconds
    due to network dynamics. Classification accuracy at 98% in simulation aligns with
    real-world potential, though classification speed may change due to transmission
    delays. Additionally, our simulation reports a zero message loss rate, even though
    real-world rates hinge on factors like distance and signal strength. These metrics
    illuminate our framework’s initial potential, while further validation through
    real-world data, comparative analysis, and sensitivity testing will bridge the
    gap between simulation and reality. 5. Conclusions and Future Research In this
    study, our successful attempt at the classification of cognitive workload using
    EEG data yielded an impressive accuracy of 98% through the implementation of the
    BDGN model. The STEW dataset underwent preprocessing and was subjected to both
    time domain and power spectral density (PSD) analysis to enhance its suitability.
    Employing the MQTT protocol, the BDGN model was deployed to achieve real-time
    cognitive workload classification. These results underscore the potential of EEG-based
    cognitive workload classification utilizing the BDGN model. The achieved high
    accuracy substantiates the effectiveness of this approach in precisely discerning
    cognitive workload levels. Notably, our comparative analysis against state-of-the-art
    methodologies highlights the superiority of the recommended approach. This research
    significantly advances the field of cognitive workload assessment and simultaneously
    unveils a roadmap for future exploration. Among the potential avenues, one promising
    trajectory involves deploying this classification system within industrial settings.
    We advocate for the integration of EEG devices endowed with Bluetooth-based wireless
    communication capabilities [49] for continuous real-time EEG data collection.
    In this envisioned direction, Raspberry Pi modules emerge as optimal hardware
    gateways [50], facilitating the streamlined transmission of EEG data from the
    source to the MQTT broker. Subsequently, the BDGN model deployed on the server
    effectively classifies the EEG data, and predictions are relayed by the MQTT broker.
    These predictions serve as the basis for instructing machines or robots via gateways,
    thus orchestrating work tasks in response to cognitive workload dynamics. This
    solution presents an economical means to implement cognitive workload classification
    within the Industry 5.0 context, promising enhanced operational efficiency and
    adaptability. As we embark on these promising trajectories, the fusion of advanced
    technology and cognitive assessment holds the potential to reshape industrial
    processes in impactful ways. However, this study acknowledges several limitations.
    Firstly, the reliance on a specific dataset could limit the broader applicability
    of findings across diverse populations and contexts. Variations in electrode placement
    during EEG data collection may introduce inconsistencies, impacting model robustness.
    While the focus is on cognitive workload, external factors influencing EEG signals,
    like environmental conditions, remain underexplored. The hybrid architecture of
    the BDGN approach, while accurate, might pose implementation and interpretability
    challenges due to complexity. Although emphasizing Industry 5.0 relevance, the
    direct transferability of findings to other domains necessitates further investigation.
    Addressing these limitations in future research could yield a more universally
    applicable cognitive workload classification approach. Additionally, exploring
    BDGN model generalizability and scalability across diverse datasets, domains,
    and populations, as well as integrating other physiological and contextual features,
    will enhance the understanding of cognitive workload. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Sensor Networks 1. Introduction and research background The digital twin is a
    revolutionising technology in the industry 4.0 era. The advent of the concept
    can be traced back to Grieve''s presentation for a Product Lifecycle Management
    module at the University of Michigan in 2002 [1]. The concept was not conclusive
    at the time but elaborated the components of a digital twin to be a ‘physical
    product in real space’, a ‘virtual product in virtual space’ and a connection
    between both the physical and virtual products for data exchange. It became more
    evident in 2010 when it was published in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) modelling, simulation, information technology processing roadmap where
    a digital twin was defined as “an integrated multiphysics, multiscale, probabilistic
    simulation of an as-built vehicle or system that uses the best available physical
    models, sensor updates, fleet history, etc., to mirror the life of its corresponding
    flying twin” [2]. Several definitions of the concept have been made in the following
    years. For example, a digital twin has been referred to as a “realistic model”
    [3], “digital representation” [4], “dynamic virtual model” [5] that possesses
    the properties and behaviour of a system in the physical world. This study adopts
    the early definition of digital twins by Grieves [1]. The digital twin was first
    practically applied in NASA''s Apollo program in 2010, and its application has
    evolved and has spread to other industries since then. Digital twin applications
    have been mainly investigated in manufacturing, aviation, and healthcare [6].They
    have been reported to improve, automate and enhance the efficiency of various
    activities in those industries. The promising abilities of digital twins and the
    rapid advances in emerging smart technologies have attracted interest in their
    application for the construction industry. The term ‘digital twin’ is relatively
    new in the construction research literature. However, there is quite some lack
    of clarity in the concept because of its confusion with the term ‘BIM’. Some authors
    use the two terms interchangeably while others consider them to be different.
    For example, the digital twin has been referred to as BDOs (BIM Digital Objects)
    [7] and as a BIM model with lifecycle data and the ability to carry out simulations
    [8] . The confusion in the usage of the terms might hinder the acceptance of digital
    twins as a new concept in the construction industry [9] . Therefore, it is essential
    to differentiate between digital twins and BIM. BIM has been defined by the UK
    BIM task group as “a collaborative way of working, underpinned by the digital
    technologies which unlock more efficient methods of designing, delivering and
    maintaining physical built assets” [10] . A key feature of BIM is the 3D model
    commonly known as the BIM model which is realised with object-oriented software
    [11]. The BIM model acts as a rich data repository that contains information on
    geometric and functional aspects of an asset [12] and other related data like
    time schedules (4D) [13], cost (5D) estimation [14], asset management [15], etc.
    It can be used to integrate multi-disciplinary information from different project
    lifecycle phases to promote communication [16]. When properly developed and managed,
    the BIM model can provide a wealth of accurate geometric, descriptive and operable
    metadata that can be used to enhance project delivery practices [17]. However,
    the BIM model is limited in providing dynamic real-time data of the physical environment.
    Construction projects and assets are both implemented within a dynamic physical
    environment generating a vast amount of non-geometric data. A significant volume
    of this data is not fully taken advantage of yet it is critical for informed decision-making
    [18] .Thus, the need to collect this data by monitoring assets and projects in
    real time is required. Also, the BIM model has limited capability to process large
    sets of dynamic and multi-form data that require advanced technologies for storage
    and processing. These limitations of BIM models can lead to underutilisation of
    data, ineffective decision-making and inefficient practices with significant cost
    implications. The emerging concept of the digital twin offers an opportunity to
    address the limitations of BIM. In a digital twin system, the physical entity
    is connected to its equivalent virtual model by a data connection that allows
    data exchange between both entities. This implies that a BIM model is a merely
    starting point for the development of a digital twin in construction. With digital
    twin technology, the BIM model is connected to the physical environment to enable
    the bi-directional transfer of data between both entities. This enables the BIM
    model to be updated with real-time data which facilitates improved decision-making
    in the implementation and management of assets. Moreover, digital twins leverage
    advanced data analytics techniques like artificial intelligence for processing
    large sets of data to enable condition monitoring, predictions, diagnostics, prognostics
    and system optimisation . These digital twin capabilities have the potential to
    significantly improve information management and decision-making in various construction
    practices which in turn enhances the efficiency of construction and asset management
    activities. The application of digital twins in the construction industry is a
    growing area of research. Five systematic literature reviews that include Boje,
    et al. [19], Jiang, et al. [20], Opoku, et al. [21], Deng, et al. [22] and Ozturk
    [23] on digital twin applications in construction already exist. Ozturk [23] conducted
    a bibliometric analysis to provide an overview of the research landscape for digital
    twins in the AECO-FM industry. Boje, et al. [19] analysed the perceived abilities
    of a digital twin as applied across various engineering domains and identified
    potential areas in BIM application in the construction phase that can be enhanced
    by a digital twin. Opoku, et al. [21] investigated digital twin applications in
    various project lifecycle phases while Deng, et al. [22] examined the built areas
    that concern digital twins and the capabilities of current state-of-the-art digital
    twins. Jiang, et al. [20] investigated the applications of digital twins in the
    civil engineering sector. None of the reviews has focussed on establishing the
    state of the art of existing technologies for digital twin development in the
    literature. It has been reported that digital twins present significant challenges
    in their development from a technological perspective [[24], [25], [26]]. A wide
    variety of emerging technologies are being used in their development for various
    applications but it is not immediately clear from the literature which ones are
    key to their successful development, necessitating a systematic literature review
    with a focus on technologies. Although the focus here is on technologies, it has
    to be acknowledged that the application and adoption of digital technologies in
    the AEC industry is affected by several organisational challenges such as inadequate
    expertise [27,28], financial constraints [29], cultural barriers [30], resistance
    to change [31] and competing initiatives [32,33] etc., which are out of the scope
    of this study. This paper aims to identify the key technologies used in the development
    of digital twins in construction in the existing literature, the research gaps
    and the potential areas for future research. Typically, the development of a digital
    twin requires a data connection between a physical entity and its equivalent virtual
    model. Modelling technologies are used to generate a virtual model which mirrors
    the parameters of the physical environment such as the geometric structure, functionality,
    state, location, process, and performance [25]. The Internet of Things (IoT) technologies
    enable data connection, which allow for the bi-directional flow of data between
    physical and virtual entities [34]. The IoT technologies collect data from the
    physical environment which is then transmitted to the virtual model using communication
    transmissions in application layer protocols. The collected data is of high volume
    and can be multi-source, requiring big data storage technologies. The dynamic
    data from the physical environment is then integrated and fused into the virtual
    model to provide human-understandable abstractions and inferences [35]. The digital
    twin data can be processed using advanced data analytics technologies to provide
    various services to the users. The processed data is finally available to the
    end users straightforwardly and interactively through data visualisation which
    is supported by visualisation technologies [36]. These technologies collectively
    form the basis for implementing a viable digital twin consisting of a high-fidelity
    model with bi-directional data transfer and data processing capabilities. The
    technologies have been conceptualised into a digital twin system architecture
    with five development layers that include data acquisition, data transmission,
    digital modelling, data/model integration and the service [37]. The data acquisition
    layer consists of technologies for data collection and the collected data set.
    The transmission layer consists of the networking, communications and transmission
    protocols technologies. The digital modelling layer considers the technologies
    for measuring the parameters of the physical entity and for modelling the virtual
    model. The data/model integration layer consists of technologies that support
    data storage, data/model integration and fusion, data processing and analysis,
    visualisation and AI, machine learning and simulation engine. For this study,
    four broad categories that include data storage, data/model integration and fusion,
    data processing and analysis and data visualisation are treated as sub-categories
    of the data/model integration layer. The study uses this architecture as a guiding
    framework to identify the various technologies used in the five development layers
    of digital twins. The study adopts a systematic literature review methodology
    of selected digital twin application studies with construction-related demonstrative
    case studies and experimental setups. Firstly, the generic composition of digital
    twins in the studies is examined. This is followed by the elicitation of data
    about the technologies against the five conceptual digital twin development layers
    by [37]. Moreover, gaps and research issues for digital twin applications are
    discussed in this paper. Following this introduction, the research design is presented
    in Section 2 followed by data collection in Section 3 and data extraction in Section
    4. This is followed by Section 5 which presents the findings and discussions and
    Section 6 that presents the research gaps and future research. Finally, the conclusions
    and limitations are presented in Section 7. 2. Research design 2.1. Research methodology
    A systematic literature review (SLR) is applied in this paper because it follows
    a rigorous and explicit procedure to identify, evaluate and synthesise the existing
    body of knowledge on a specific subject [38]. This approach helps in establishing
    the current state of the art on a subject which aids in identifying research gaps
    and determining future research directions in that subject field. Kitchenham,
    et al. [39] propose that an SLR comprises three stages which include: planning,
    implementation and reporting. The planning phase involves framing the research
    questions and creating criteria for locating the material and search methods.
    This is followed by the implementation phase where the material is collected and
    selected for the study. Lastly, the literature is combined and analysed in the
    reporting phase. This paper applies the preferred reporting items for systematic
    reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method for collecting data for the systematic
    review. The PRISMA method is widely used in systematic reviews since it clearly
    describes the rationale and procedures for identifying, selecting, excluding and
    including literature to improve the accuracy of the systematic review [40]. The
    methodology of the study consists of 1) framing the research questions, 2) data
    collection and processing, 3) data extraction and analysis and 4) summary of findings
    and discussions. 2.2. Research questions To define the scope of interest of the
    SLR, the following research questions were addressed: Q1: What are the components
    of digital twins in digital twin applications in construction? Q2: What are the
    existing technologies used in the development of digital twins? Q3: What are the
    research gaps and potential areas for future research? 3. Data collection for
    the literature This section describes the steps taken to collect the relevant
    literature for the study. A PRISMA workflow diagram for the study is shown in

    image Fig. 1. PRISMA workflow diagram. 3.1. Performing the search process An initial
    literature search was conducted in the ScienceDirect database because it is one
    of the biggest databases covering a wide range of scientific publications. Moreover,
    it possesses desired attributes for conducting search queries like advanced search
    fields where systematic searches can be conducted [41]. An advanced search with
    keywords executed in the ScienceDirect database with a search string set to (“digital
    twin OR “virtual twin“ OR “cyber-physical system“) AND (“construction industry”
    OR “AEC” OR “construction management” OR “construction engineering“), for publications
    between 2015 and September 2022 and set to only research and review articles.
    The period selected for the search is appropriate because there are very few publications
    on digital twins before 2015. This search yielded a result of 508 records. A similar
    search using the keywords of “digital twin” and “construction industry” was run
    in similar databases like Web of Science and Google Scholar. An additional 153
    records were identified by reading through the titles of the papers in the databases
    and selecting only those that had not been found in ScienceDirect. 3.2. Inclusion
    and exclusion criteria The study gathered a total of 661 articles from both ScienceDirect
    and other additional databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied
    in three phases. The screening phase began by removing 51 records that were duplicates
    and studies that are not construction-industry related leaving a total of 610
    articles. The second phase of screening involved reading of titles and abstracts
    of the publications and 343 articles were excluded because they were BIM application
    studies and on other related technologies in the construction industry. This left
    behind a total of 267 records. In phase three, 142 records were excluded of which,
    25 were conceptual papers, 92 focused on one feature or technology of the digital
    twin and 25 records emphasised the service or function area for which the digital
    twin is developed. A total of 125 records remained for full-text assessment. An
    inclusion criterion was applied to the remaining 125 records. The inclusion criteria
    considered having 1) a detailed systematic architecture for a digital twin application
    2) a methodology for the implementation 3) the technologies used for the implementation
    and 4) the demonstrative case studies and laboratory setups presented. The introduction,
    methodology and figures of the remaining studies were assessed and scored up to
    4 in terms of those 4 criteria. The eligible papers obtained for the review were
    38 in total and these are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Selected practical studies

    Warning alerts for potential failures 5. Findings and discussions This section
    presents the findings from the data extraction and analysis of the selected studies
    (Table 1) that is indicated in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4. 5.1. Components of
    digital twins in construction applications The digital twin applications consisted
    of various physical entities. Most of the studies used buildings and the associated
    building spaces [44,50,51,59,61,64,67,68,70,71,73,[75], [76], [77]]. Some studies
    focused on specific building components and systems such as lighting and surveillance
    system [43], air handling unit [47], fan coil [52], building systems [37], centrifugal
    pumps [60], chiller for an HVAC system [62] and building façade [66,72]. Other
    studies considered the construction and assembling sites for buildings [45,48,49,[53],
    [54], [55], [56],58,63,65,74,78] and road construction sites [46,57,69]. In these
    environments, various resources such as machinery, materials, and workers were
    monitored. Pregnolato, et al. [42] used an existing suspension bridge as their
    physical entity. All the studies contained a 3D model of the physical entity with
    the BIM model being the commonest virtual model. A 3D FEM (Finite Element Model)
    was used for the suspension bridge. The (IoT) Internet of Things sensors were
    the most used devices for creating a data connection between the physical entities
    and their corresponding virtual models. Other technologies that were used include
    RFID (Radio frequency identification), image sensors and image recognition artificial
    intelligence, vision and component-based sensing systems, satellite positioning
    and recognition devices, laser scanning and Restful APIs. 5.2. Technologies in
    digital twin applications The data elicited in Table 3 and Table 4 for is categorised
    under five layers that include data acquisition, data transmission, digital modelling,
    data/model integration and service layers. The data/model integration layer is
    further classified into data storage, data/model integration and fusion, data
    processing and analysis and data visualisation. 5.2.1. Data acquisition layer
    Dynamic data from the physical environment is collected depending on the intended
    functionality of the digital twin. IoT sensors and technologies were the technologies
    used for data acquisition from the physical environment. The IoT sensor networks
    use sensing nodes to communicate the status of a parameter in a surrounding in
    a wireless manner [79]. They measure changes in physical, chemical and electrical
    properties of a surrounding and generate a response in the form of an electrical
    output. Various types of intelligent sensors are used to measure environmental
    parameters that include temperature, humidity, air quality, motion, pressure,
    airflow rates, air velocity, CO2, lux levels, gas, particulate matter (PM) 10,
    smoke and acoustic levels. A wide range of sensors is available to collect data
    on various environmental parameters. For example, DHT11 sensors [50,76] and Monnit
    wireless sensors [64] were used for measuring temperature and humidity. Other
    types of sensors used include Rev. P wind sensors (MD0555 category) for air velocity
    [50], DHT22 sensors for ambient temperature, humidity and a light-dependent resistor
    (LDR) [52], TA465-X sensor system for airflow, temperature and humidity [70],
    Texas Instruments (TI) Sensortag CC2650 light sensors [72] and PT550 light sensors
    [76]. In other cases, sensor data is obtained from already existing monitoring
    systems of buildings. [47] used a Restful API (Application Programming Interface)
    over a conventional BMS (Building Management System) to collect data of the BMS
    hard-wired sensors that include NTC-12 K-sensors for temperature, TTH-6040–0 for
    the outdoor temperature and the IVL10 temperature-sensitive airflow transmitters
    and PTH-3202-DR for pressure. Similarly, a RESTful API was applied to collect
    sensor data from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for
    HVAC plants with temperature, humidity and CO2 sensors [51]. Cheng, et al. [62]
    obtained sensor data from a direct digital control (DDC) system in an IoT sensor
    network consisting of temperature sensors, humidity sensors, flow rate sensors
    and pressure sensors. IoT sensor technologies are also used to collect mechanical
    data in various applications. For a suspension bridge, temperature sensors were
    used to measure the temperature of the chain links while displacement transducers
    measured the displacement of the saddles [42]. The piezoelectric acceleration
    sensor was used to acquire the vertical acceleration of the vibration wheel to
    monitor the quality of road compaction [46]. To monitor the safety of a scaffolding
    system Yuan, et al. [78] and cables on a prestressed steel structure Liu, et al.
    [56], a column tension-compression sensor and accelerometer with a displacement
    sensor were used respectively. Lu, et al. [60] applied vibration sensors to monitor
    the mechanical condition of a chiller pump. To monitor the mechanical condition
    of a fan coil, SCT-013-000 current sensor, EU:77DE-06-09 voltage sensor, and DS18B20
    and PT100 temperature sensors were used [52]. Meža, et al. [57] used various sensors
    that included temperature sensors, inductive displacement network sensor, soil
    moisture sensors, asphalt strain sensors, horizontal inclinometers network sensors
    and surface sensor pressure pads to obtain real-time data on a road construction
    project. Load cells, switch sensors, an accelerometer and displacement sensor
    were used to monitor the safety of a scaffolding system [78]. The IoT sensor technologies
    can also be used to obtain positioning data in dynamic environments. For example,
    the ultrasonic sensor and gyroscopic sensors were used to collect positioning
    data of resources to detect clashes and accurate placement [49] and track locations
    of resources on site [63]. Zhou, et al. [69] used both ultrasonic sensors and
    laser ranging sensors to track the location of machinery during tunnel operations.
    Akanmu, et al. [65] used vision and wearable IMUs (Inertia Measurement Units)
    with a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer as well as Velcro vive
    trackers to obtain body kinematic data. Another use of IoT sensors involved the
    application of cameras and laser scanners. Tan, et al. [43] used a building surveillance
    system to obtain video streams of scenes which were processed by an algorithm
    to detect pedestrians and perceive ambient brightness. A FLIR lepton 2.5 thermal
    imaging module was connected to the Raspberry Pi microprocessor to measure surface
    temperatures to monitor MRT (Mean Radiant Temperature) values at different points
    in the building enclosure [50]. Smart cameras provided video streams recording
    the wearing of safety equipment on site and uploaded to the cloud storage for
    analysis [55]. Seghezzi, et al. [59] used high-quality Bullet Pro Camera sensors
    to capture image data of occupant movement which was registered as a human by
    the deep learning algorithm embedded in the camera sensors to provide a count
    of occupants. Three Microsoft Kinect cameras acquired image data of a robot''s
    workspace environment in Gazebo which was then converted to point clouds [67].
    Antonino, et al. [71] used cameras with image sensors coupled with image recognition
    (Im) artificial intelligence to detect users'' movements in an office building.
    Two overhead cameras were applied to record the entrance and exit events of occupants
    in a room which were then translated into counts of occupants [70]. On the other
    hand, 3D point clouds for a construction site were obtained using a UAV (Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicle) equipped with a LiDAR scanner [53]. To obtain positioning and
    location data, identification and tracking technlogies that include RFID tags,
    UWB tags and the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) were used. RFID systems
    consist of one or more readers and several RFID tags that contain a unique identifier
    which is applied to objects. A tag transmission is triggered by the readers using
    electromagnetic fields to automatically query for the possible presence of tags
    in the surroundings to receive their IDs (identifications) [80]. This enables
    the RFID systems to track or monitor physical objects in real time. On the other
    hand, UWB is a short-range and high-bandwidth communication technology that uses
    radio signals [81]. It can be used to locate and track human beings and objects
    in real time. The GNSS is an outdoor localisation system that uses a satellite-based
    navigation system at a global level. From the analysis, RFID and UWB tags were
    used to collect positioning data of prefabricated components on an assembling
    site (UWB) [48] and smart objects on a construction site [45]. Lee, et al. [54]
    used RFID tags and the GPS (Global Positioning System) to track and locate prefabricated
    blocks on a mock-up bridge site. RFID and UWB tags were used to locate precast
    building components [74] and the position of a ladder [68] respectively. UWB anchors
    and tags provided the position and orientation data on appliances in an office
    room [73]. The real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system (RTK – GNSS)
    was used to obtain location data for construction machinery [46]. The use of sensors,
    RFID and UWB devices, cameras and laser scanning in the construction industry,
    is growing and is well covered in the literature [[81], [82], [83], [84], [85]].
    To be able to collect and transmit useful data, sensor systems consist of various
    functional layers like sensing and transduction, signal processing, data processing,
    signal transmission, etc., [86]. This follows that a high-level sensor system
    architecture can include a microcontroller, wired or wireless interface, memory,
    sensors, display and power. Examples of sensor platforms indicated in some studies
    include NodeMCU micro-controller Böke, et al. [66], Aurdino Mega 2560 R3 microcontroller
    board [75], Raspberry Pi 3B+ [72] and Raspberry Pi 3 [77]. The details on sensor
    architectures and platforms can be found in various studies such as [[87], [88],
    [89]] etc. 5.2.2. Data transmission layer Data transmission involves the processing
    and transporting of raw data from the data acquisition layer. The collected data
    is generally transmitted through the wire and wireless transmission technologies.
    The Wi-Fi wireless short-range technology was used in several applications [44,45,48,52,55,63,69,70,77].
    Wi-Fi is a common communication technology that connects devices in a local area
    network using radio waves. Other examples of short-range wireless technologies
    included wireless local area network (WLAN) [66], Bluetooth [46,63,72,74] and
    ultra-wide-band (UWB) radio communication [68,73]. On the other hand, one study
    used Ethernet wired transmissions [37] while another study by Pregnolato, et al.
    [42] used a hybrid of both wired and wireless networks. In the case of sensor
    data obtained from a Building Management Systems (BMS), the internet and the BACnet
    (Building Automation and Control Networks) protocols were used for data communication
    among the various equipment, devices and sensors as indicated by [47]. The transmission
    of data must conform to communication layer protocols. These protocols are defined
    by different groups such as IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers),
    IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), etc., and are officially used as standards
    in the industry. They can be categorised into file transfer protocols and messaging
    protocols which are best suited for web applications and IoT frameworks respectively
    [90]. The most commonly used transmission protocol was MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport) [42,[44], [45], [46],48,52,66,68,76]. MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe
    messaging transmission protocol that connects remote sensors to other software
    layers of an application [91]. It is characterised by high latency and suitable
    for restricted equipment, unreliable networks and low bandwidth. It uses a client-server
    architecture whereby the MQTT client publishes messages to an MQTT broker to be
    subscribed to by other clients or retained for future use [92]. The HTTP (Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol) was the other mostly used transmission protocol [37,50,61,63,64].
    The HTTP is a web messaging protocol that supports request/response RESTful web
    architecture [92]. It uses the Universal Resource Identifier (URI) to send data
    from the servers to the client who receives the data through a specific URI. In
    Hosamo, et al. [47] study, a specific URL from the sensor data API was used for
    data transfer to the BIM model. Jiang, et al. [63] used both the HTTP and socket
    protocols for their study. A socket protocol is a standard protocol for transferring
    data from one machine to another [93]. On the other hand, Lee, et al. [54] applied
    an Azure blockchain platform to provide an IoT hub for receiving the GPS data
    from the IoT sensors which was then later sent to the as-built BIM model. Seghezzi,
    et al. [59] stored sensor data in an online database and downloaded it as CSV
    files which was then visualised in the SophyAI online platform. The gazebo_ros_pkgs,
    a set of robot operating software, was used to create a communication interface
    between the Gazebo platform with sensor data and the ROS (Robot Operating Software)
    [67]. 5.2.3. Digital modelling layer This layer involves the development of the
    corresponding virtual model of the physical entity. This process is generally
    done by modelling the digital model. Modelling is the process of “representing
    a physical entity in digital forms that can be processed, analysed, and managed
    by computers” [24]. Through modelling, the physical entity and related information
    are represented in a digital environment. To be able to model the physical entity,
    the parameters of the physical environment such as the geometric structure, functionality,
    state, time, location, process, performance [25] etc. are measured to produce
    a virtual replica that mirrors the physical environment. From the analysis, laser
    scanning was used to obtain the 3D point cloud model of the physical assets [37,53,56,61].
    Other measurement methods included laser tape measurement [73], Mixed Reality
    (MR) [61] and photogrammetry [37]. Modelling parametric design software is used
    to develop the virtual model that mirrors the features of the physical entity.
    Most of the studies used a 3D model (BIM model) to represent the virtual equivalent
    of the physical entity. Autodesk Revit was the most used software for 3D modelling
    of buildings as indicated in these studies [43,47,50,52,60,62,71,75,77].Other
    3D geometric software tools that were applied include Autodesk Navisworks [78],
    Solidworks and 3D Max [45], Sketchup 3D [49] and Rhinoceros 6 software [66].To
    create a BIM model of a road, Autodesk Civil 3D and Autodesk Revit were used [57].
    The former was used to generate the road model while the latter was used to model
    sensors to create the BIM model. Autodesk Revit and AECOsim building designer
    were used to develop geometry models at the system, building and city levels Lu,
    et al. [37]. On the other hand, game development software is also used to develop
    the virtual entity of the digital twin application. A human avatar was modelled
    using the Unity game engine and Autodesk 3D Max [65]. Four studies imported geometric
    data into Unity 3D to develop 3D models [48,54,58,73]. A Virtual Reality (VR)
    environment was created using the Unity 3D platform, Oculus Rift S VR headset
    and the Oculus touch controllers [67].To create a human-robot construction system,
    the Robot arm model was developed using the Unified Robotics Description Format
    (UDRF) and sent to Robot Operating Software (ROS) to be loaded as a game object
    in VR. Moreover, BIM components for the construction site were also loaded into
    the VR environment. Other 3D modelling platforms that were used include Three.js
    program [46] and Midas Gen software [42]. 5.2.4. Data/model integration and fusion
    layer 5.2.4.1. Data storage In the data/model integration layer, the digital twin
    data undergoes a series of stages that include data storage, data/model integration
    and fusion, data processing and analysis and data visualisation to produce useful
    information. Digital twin data is multi-source and of high volume requiring big
    data storage technologies [24]. The selection of a storage database depends on
    the accessibility, scalability, high-performance and management capability of
    massive data. The studies mostly used cloud-based computing platforms for data
    storage. Cloud databases provide adaptable and exceptional backend access for
    computing applications [94]. Examples of the cloud-databases from the studies
    include Internet my openHAB cloud [44], Google cloud platform [50], web database
    [45], BIM cloud database [53], Azure Microsoft for cloud storage [54], cloud servers
    [55,59,66,74], Alibaba cloud server [69], Microsoft Azure SQL cloud database [71],
    Cloud database and SQL server [77], Heidi SQL [78], Amazon Web service (AWS) DynamoDB
    [60,64], MSSQL [47,77], MySQL [43,46,52,61], ArangoDB database [68] and influx
    database [76]. To collect data from already existing building systems like the
    BMS (Building Management System) with security firewalls, a mirrored database
    was used to store all data sets in the protected BMS into DynamoDB NoSQL schema
    [37]. Data was also stored on-premise in Mongo database [76] and using a PHP interpreter
    server and Apache web service [52]. 5.2.4.2. Data/model integration and fusion
    The various digital twin data from the physical and virtual spaces are integrated
    through data fusion techniques to provide human-understandable inferences [35].
    This involves integrating sensor data like environmental data, mechanical data,
    and image and video data into the BIM models to reflect the real-time status of
    the physical entity in the virtual model. This requires the use of technologies
    to provide a platform for hosting the digital twin with both sensor and model
    data. To enable this data integration, customised APIs are built into the 3D model
    software platforms. Therefore, API add-in plug-ins were developed for Autodesk
    Revit [47,62,77], Midas Gen software [42], Bexel Manager [57], Dynamo into Revit
    [75], Autodesk Navisworks [78], Autodesk forge [37,52,60] and Three.js program
    [43,46]. The Unity game engine platform by Unity technologies was used by eight
    studies as the data/model platform [45,48,49,54,58,65,73]. Shahinmoghadam, et
    al. [50] used the Datasmith tool to import geometric data for building spaces
    into an Unreal Engine 4 game engine using Oculus Rift S headsets. Other platforms
    used for data/model integration and fusion included the ‘Processing’ development
    environment [66] and SophyAI online platform [59]. Peng, et al. [61] used data
    processing frameworks that include Apache Kafka and Flink and Scheduled ETL (Extract,
    Transform and Load) to integrate sensor data from 13 subsystems into a virtual
    environment. To integrate the multi-form sensor data and data from other systems
    into the BIM model, the data can be modelled into formal data structures to allow
    for seamless fusion of the data into the model. Four studies provided details
    on the data structures for the integration of the sensor data and 3D models. Hosamo,
    et al. [47] used the Brick schema for the semantic description of the metadata.
    Three studies used semantic data description to map the BIM model data in the
    IFC schema with the sensor systems and asset management systems [37,60,62]. 5.2.4.3.
    Data processing and analysis The digital twin data is processed and analysed using
    advanced technologies to obtain useful information. Table 4 analysis consists
    of both simple and advanced data analysis techniques. Examples of simple data
    analysis techniques include the comparison of measured values against target values/thresholds
    [42,46,50,54,66,68,72,78], visibility analysis [49,59,69,71,74], numerical models
    [48,75] and rule-based reasoning [44,45,52,65]. The other studies applied artificial
    intelligence techniques that include machine learning, deep learning and artificial
    intelligence algorithms for data analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) involves
    programming a machine to behave in an intelligent manner [95]. Machine learning
    was the most used technique in the studies. Various machine learning techniques
    that include the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and support vector machine (SVM)
    [47,62], Markov model preparation and ANN (artificial neural network) training
    [51], Apriori algorithms and complex network analysis [55], Markov chain [55],
    Cumulative sum charts and machine learning [37] and ensemble learning algorithms
    [70] were applied. Tan, et al. [43] applied deep learning to convert video stream
    data into text data to analyse the pedestrian trend, time and determine the most
    saving energy saving option. Artificial intelligence models using popular frameworks
    like TensorFlow, Keras and Pytorch deep learning were used for event identification,
    fault diagnosis and automated decision making [61]. Algorithms were developed
    for face recognition, personnel positioning and mechanical attitude positioning
    [63], anomaly detection [64], Bayesian online change point detection [60], planning
    rescue paths [77] and positioning [73]. Pan and Zhang [53] applied data mining
    techniques to produce process models, diagnose bottlenecks, and predict progress
    of works. Other studies analysed data using Python and Chronograf tool [76], Bexel
    manager [57], computation mechanical analysis [69], Robot Operating Software (ROS)
    [67] and 3D simulations [58]. 5.2.4.4. Data visualisation The visualisation of
    temporal sensor data in a virtual environment is one of the powerful aspects of
    digital twins. From the analysis, the 3D modelling software platforms are used
    for data visualisation. Examples of these include Autodesk Revit [47,56,62,[75],
    [76], [77]], Midas Gen software [42], Autodesk Navisworks [78], and Autodesk Civil
    3D [57]. Some studies used Autodesk forge [37,52,60] for visualising the sensor
    data in the BIM model. Gaming environment platforms like Unity 3D game engine,
    which possess powerful visualisation capabilities are also used for visualisation
    [45,48,54,58,67,68,73]. Furthermore, game engine platforms can be used to create
    VR (Virtual Reality) environments as indicated by Akanmu, et al. [65] Wang, et
    al. [67] and Shahinmoghadam, et al. [50]. Akanmu, et al. [65] applied a VR environment
    using the Unity game engine. Wang, et al. [67] created a Virtual Reality (VR)
    environment in Unity 3D and Oculus Rift S VR headset that was connected to the
    ROS (Robot Operating Software). Similarly, Shahinmoghadam, et al. [50] used Unreal
    Engine 4 game engine with Oculus Rift S headsets for the VR environment. On the
    other hand, AR (Augmented Reality) was used for visualisation [49,64]. An AR mobile-based
    application was applied to allow the users to interact with the application for
    remotely operating of construction machinery [49]. This was developed using Unity3D
    in the form of a server with AR interfaces and marker images that were uploaded
    as assets. Other software that were used for visualisation include the Three.js
    program [43,46], SophyAI online platform [59] and a Node-RED dashboard in the
    ‘Processing development’ [66]. The processed digital twin data is finally availed
    to the end users straightforwardly in various visualisation forms. The two most
    used methods of visualisation for the digital twin data were colour coding in
    2D and 3D schematics, performance dashboards, and time series graphs supported
    by the visualisation platforms. Other forms of visualisation included trend graphs
    [43,59,61,70], pie charts [43], line graphs [48,55,56,61], real-time status Kanban
    [48], thermal comfort charts [50], S curves [37] and cumulative sum control charts
    [60]. In many studies, the values for monitored parameters like pedestrian count
    and sensor readings for ambient temperature and humidity were indicated on the
    visualisation platforms. Other forms of visualisation involved the use of anonymous
    virtual agents [59,67,77] and real-time animations [61]. Most studies had more
    than one form of visualisation of the data. 5.2.5. Service layer The last layer
    represents the service that digital twin offers to the users. Digital twin offers
    a diverse range of service depending on the context within which it is applied.
    The most common service offered in the studies was real-time monitoring of assets
    and activities. This included monitoring a suspension bridge [42], building façade
    [66], façade brightness [72], pedestrian trends and time [43], construction site
    activities [48], compaction progress and quality [46], smart objects [45], machine
    and worker operations [49,63], construction progress [53,54,74], structural health
    [55], the safety of materials [57], occupancy trends and movements [59], ambient
    environment monitoring [37], working conditions [60], energy consumption [61],
    chiller condition [62], workers'' postures during operations [65], tunnel operations
    [69] and room occupancy [70,71]. Another functionality of the digital twin involved
    early detection: of potential failures in a scaffolding system [78], faults in
    building AHUs [47,61], bottlenecks in on-site construction [53], anomalies in
    a pump''s operations [37] and indoor environment [64], and fires in a building
    [77]. Moreover, digital twins were applied for the prediction of faults in building
    systems [37,47], the condition of a chiller system [62], and comfort and CO2 levels
    in spaces [51]. Also, some applications used digital twins to provide early warnings
    about potential accidents [69] and alarm signals when thresholds are exceeded
    [52]. Some studies showed that digital twin enabled the visualisation of environmental
    and thermal comfort levels [50], fan coil status [52], space use [61], construction
    progress [74] and indoor ambient conditions [75,76]. Other studies showed that
    digital twins can be used for simulations [44,53,56,58,68], real-time control
    of robotic operations [45,67] and home appliances [73]. 5.3. Summary of findings
    The existence of the three components of a physical entity, its virtual model
    and the data connection between both entities highlights a shift away from static
    BIM models to the emerging technology of digital twins in construction. The studies
    show the diverse application of digital twins to various entities in the physical
    environment from building components, buildings, workers, machinery, site resources,
    civil engineering structures, and even at the city level. This implies that digital
    twins can be applied at different levels of granularity of the construction industry
    ecosystem. Data from the physical environment was mainly acquired using IoT sensor
    technologies. Other technologies that include vision and component-based sensing
    devices, RFID and UWB tags were also used. In some cases, sensor data was acquired
    from already existing monitoring systems like the BMS. For the transmission of
    the data, the applications mostly relied on wireless technology. MQTT protocol
    was most used standard communication protocol followed by the HTTP protocol. MQTT
    protocol is favoured for IoT networks because it is designed for use in low bandwidth
    and high latency networks. Moreover, its publish-subscribe strategy that allows
    for one-to-one and one-to-many connections makes it useful for digital twin development
    as it allows for several subscriptions to the sensor data. Also, it is considered
    to be faster than other transmission protocols [91]. On the other hand, the HTTP
    protocol uses a specific Universal Resource Identifier (URI) to send data from
    the servers to the client [92]. However, there was lack of emphasis on the technologies
    for networking, communication and transmission protocols under the data transmission
    layer as over 18 studies did not provide these details in their system architectures.
    For the digital modelling layer, most of the studies used a 3D model, mostly a
    BIM model and four studies used 3D point cloud models. Various parametric design
    software was used to generate the 3D models, with Autodesk Revit being the most
    used modelling software. Four studies imported geometric data into the Unity 3D
    software. One study used a VR environment. For the storage of digital twin data,
    studies mostly used cloud-based computing platforms that exist on the market.
    Customised plug-ins were added to the geometric software platforms for data integration
    and fusion. The Unity cross-platform by Unity technologies was the most used platform
    for data/model integration. However, most of the studies did not provide the details
    of the integration of the sensor, model and other digital twin data in the data/model
    layer. Only four studies provided some details on their data structures for the
    sensor and model data integration. Both simple and advanced data analysis techniques
    were used in the processing and analysis of data, with machine learning being
    the most applied technique for data processing. The visualisation of the data
    was done using the data/model integration platforms. Four studies used VR/AR technologies
    for visualisation and interaction with the users. The presentation of the digital
    twin data was done using 2D graphical methods mostly in form of performance dashboards,
    colour-coding and time-series graphs. 6. Research gaps and future research Through
    the analysis, some challenges and opportunities were identified in three areas
    namely 1) data transmission 2) interoperability and data integration and 3) data
    processing and visualisation, as discussed in this section. 6.1. Data transmission
    The use of wireless technology for creating the network was the most commonly
    used approach in the studies. However, the focus was on the use of short-range
    wireless technologies that included Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and UWB. The use of long-distance
    wireless transmission technologies like digital radio and satellite communication
    needs to be investigated. This is essential for the future of digital twins to
    be expanded to city digital twins, country digital twins and the worldwide scale.
    The most applied standard transmission protocols for data transfer in the studies
    were the MQTT and HTTP protocols. These two protocols are popular in IoT technologies
    [91].However, over 20 studies did not state the details of their communication
    protocols for their applications. It is also the case that the acquisition of
    digital twin data from heterogeneous systems, networks and devices increases the
    complexity of data transmission. Transmission protocols create mediums for data
    transmission using standardised formats. This is essential for achieving a two-way
    data synchronous transmission channel in a digital twin application and enabling
    machine to machine communication. Therefore, the use of standard communication
    protocols for data transmission in digital twins of varying complexity should
    be further investigated. It is the case that digital twins use a diverse range
    of data, some of which is confidential in nature to people and organisations.
    The transmission of such data is prone to cyber-attacks which can essentially
    become a security threat to people''s lives and the infrastructure that is monitored.
    Therefore, it is necessary to consider security requirements and secure transmission
    protocols for the network and communication layer. From the analysis of the studies,
    three studies considered the security and privacy aspects in their digital twin
    monitoring systems. In their proposed digital twin for management of a hospital
    facility, Peng, et al. [61] used only private HTTP APIs inside hospital firewalls
    to address the safety issues about the use of security monitoring videos and visiting
    records of patients. Shahinmoghadam, et al. [50] opted to use a marker-based registration
    method to obtain orthogonal thermal image mosaics taken by a FLIR lepton thermal
    camera instead of using visual cameras to avoid undermining the privacy-preserving
    aspect of their system. Smart contract and block chain technology were integrated
    in a digital twin prototype to increase network security and traceability of data
    [59]. Thus, the issues of privacy-preserving networks and context-aware privacy
    policies are some of the areas that need to be researched [96]. 6.2. Interoperability
    and data integration in digital twins The integration and fusion of the virtual
    model and IoT sensor data are core to the functioning of a digital twin. As indicated
    from the studies, digital twin data is diverse and is collected using different
    types of sensors resulting in heterogeneous data sets like image data, video data,
    positioning data, environmental data, mechanical data, etc. that have to be integrated
    with the BIM model. This data is obtained from disparate and heterogeneous systems
    like the BMS and Asset management system. These systems operate on different software
    platforms with different syntax and schematics. This increases the complexity
    of digital twin models creating integration and interoperability issues at both
    syntax and semantic levels. From the analysis of the studies, most of the studies
    did not provide the details pertaining to the structure of the digital twin data
    for the purpose of data integration. Only four studies provided details for the
    data architecture for integrating the various digital twin data. To integrate
    BIM and FM data, the IFC data of the AHU was mapped onto the relevant COBie and
    FM using an ontology-based strategy in GraphDB [47]. Moreover, a single Brick
    schema model describing the metadata for the AHU, its components and sensor data
    points was developed. Cheng, et al. [62] imported BIM data into COBie spreadsheets
    and then the COBie data was mapped onto the facility data in FM systems. The attribute
    names of COBie data were matched to the attribute names in the FM database table.
    Furthermore, a sensor data model was proposed and used as a basis to extend the
    the Ifcsensor entity to enable sensor entities and attributes to be visualised
    in a BIM model. An IfcObject matching table was used to describe the link between
    the BIM object Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) and corresponding item ID from
    different data sources like the BMS and sensor system [37,60]. These studies use
    semantic data modelling to enable data integration from various sources. The use
    of semantic models and ontologies [97,98] has been proposed for data integration
    and interoperability in digital twin models. Semantic modelling involves the use
    of semantic web-based methods to map data streams, active sensing data and proprietary
    relational data sets and combine them with user preferences to a dynamic structure
    of things [24]. On the other hand, ontologies provide a formal and explicit representation
    of domain concepts that can be shared [99]. Therefore, there is a need to investigate
    semantic data modelling of sensor data, BIM model data and data from other systems
    to aid in moving towards standardising digital twin data by enabling data integration
    and interoperability. The development of rich data models for various applications,
    data sets, different assets and processes is a ripe area of research. Through
    the use of web-based ontologies, the IFC schema, which is the standard format
    for interoperability within the built environment can be extended and linked to
    other domains. Semantic web technologies can help overcome the limitations of
    the IFC standard models by providing flexible methods of data integration across
    various domains and scales to facilitate interoperability among data and systems
    [100]. Therefore, the use of web-based semantic ontologies for digital twin data
    integration should be explored. 6.3. Data processing and visualisation of digital
    twin data Both simple and advanced data analysis techniques were used in the processing
    and analysis of data such as the comparison of measured values against target
    values/thresholds and machine learning respectively. The introduction of artificial
    intelligence techniques such as machine learning offers opportunities for analysing
    the heterogenous and voluminous data of the built environment. Artificial intelligence
    methods attempt to recreate the problem-solving and reasoning abilities of the
    human brain [101]. AI uses machine learning or deep learning models for reasoning
    about the real world [102]. From the analysis, machine learning was the most used
    AI technique in the studies. It involves the use of algorithms that learn from
    the data by automatically extracting patterns within a defined context [103].
    Thus, machine learning algorithms can be applied to a diverse range of functions
    to solve complex problems in the real world. The advent of digital twins in the
    construction industry has led to an increase in dynamic data which creates challenges
    in storing, and processing of this big data and situations of ‘garbage’ data.
    There is a need to explore the use of advanced technologies for storing and processing
    this smart big data as well as managing ‘garbage’ data in the digital twins. The
    use of AI techniques like machine learning and deep learning enables the automatic
    processing of large data sets into useful knowledge for various applications [104].
    Research should be conducted on developing AI models for processing big data to
    tackle various challenges in the industry. For example, expert systems for various
    functions in the different phases of a project lifecycle can be developed. Moreover,
    there is a need to consider realistic practical applications of these systems
    to improve the accuracy and intelligence levels of the applications. This will
    provide more advanced data models and richer data sets that are useful for decision-making
    in various project and asset management functions. The visualisation of the digital
    twin data involved the use of common 3D modelling software platforms and gaming
    environment platforms. There was also the use of more powerful visualisation technologies
    that include Virtual Reality [49,50] and Augmented Reality [64]. Virtual Reality
    (VR) can be defined as the simulation of 3D objects in a virtual world to enable
    real-time interactions in pseudo-natural immersion via sensorimotor channels [105]
    while Augmented Reality involves the use of an interface to overlay digital information
    onto a user''s view, which is often a camera image of the physical environment
    [106]. VR/AR technologies are capable of providing interactive and immersive experiences
    for users in various functions in the built environment [107]. This is achieved
    by the support of devices that can be stationary-based displays, head-based displays
    and hand-held displays. Within digital twin applications, the VR/AR technologies
    enable the user to visualise, engage and also control selected components in the
    physical environment as required. Therefore, future research on the use of VR/AR
    environments for digital twin applications is recommended. Another key aspect
    in the visualisation of digital twin data is the presentation of the data in meaningful
    ways to the users. From the analysis, most of the studies used 2D graphical methods
    to present the digital twin data to the users. However, this diminishes the use
    of a 3D virtual model and environment to reflect the three-dimensional world that
    humans exist in. It is therefore worth exploring alternative approaches to visualising
    temporal data in a BIM model and 3D environments. It is also the case that the
    IoT sensors for digital twins collect data on various parameters in the physical
    environment such as temperature, humidity, pressure, etc. These are abstract parameters
    that cannot be seen but can be measured. With the advanced technologies of digital
    twins, it could be possible to explore various methods of visualising such abstract
    parameters within a digital model. 7. Conclusions The concept of digital twins
    has the potential to improve performance and productivity in the construction
    industry through effective decision-making enabled by real-time condition monitoring,
    predictions, simulations and optimization of processes. The study conducts a systematic
    review of digital twin studies with demonstrative case studies or experimental
    setups to identify the current technologies used in the development of digital
    twins, the research gaps and future focus. The first contribution of the paper
    is the identification of current technologies that have been used in existing
    research literature in the five digital twin conceptual layers by [37] that include
    data acquisition, data transmission, digital modelling, data/model integration
    and services. This has provided a state of the art for the technologies in the
    development of digital twins in the existing research literature. The digital
    twins in the applications have been created using state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf
    technologies and tools that are developed independently and integrated to form
    digital twin platforms. The second contribution of the paper is the identification
    of the research gaps and potential areas for future research from a technological
    perspective. Future research is required on the technologies for data transmission
    in the application layers, interoperability and data integration and advanced
    data processing and data visualisation to generate high-performance digital twins
    with effective bi-directional data exchange capabilities, interoperable and semantic
    data/model integration, advanced data processing and enhanced visualisation and
    navigation by the users. The application of digital twins is still in its nascent
    stages within the construction industry. Most of the identified studies used small-scale
    experiments and case studies to demonstrate the application of digital twins.
    Mature practical applications from industry are missing in the research literature.
    This study was limited to the technologies of digital twins, but the successful
    implementation of digital technologies in practice requires both technological
    and organisational factors to work together. Thus, research on the organisational
    aspects of digital twin applications is recommended. This study is limited to
    the publications obtained from using the seven keywords that were used for searching
    for records in the ScienceDirect database and other additional databases that
    included Web of Science and Google Scholar. The search might have missed out on
    records that were very specific to certain aspects of the AEC industry and those
    that did not use similar keywords. It is therefore recommended to undertake the
    study in specific domains and activities of the construction industry using different
    search terms. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they

  description: Data accuracy has always been the essential and foremost requirement
    of any communication. A Real-time Water quality-monitoring system (WQMS) needs
    high-level data accuracy to process the water perfectly for the desired usage
    in any specific purpose. Exponential growth in man-made processes, human activities,
    Industrialization, and economic growth along with depleting safe water resources
    has made the water pollution issue a foremost threat to human survival and human
    civilisation as a whole. The Conventional WQMS lacks in providing data accuracy
    while testing and analysing the water samples at sites due to improper data transmission,
    human intervention, instrument node working and calibration issues. Therefore,
    monitoring the quality of the water is essential with a prime focus on data accuracy
    through proper testing, data analysis and data transmission methods to provide
    real-time data accuracy. In this research work, an IOT-based wireless sensor network
    (WSN) is proposed that uses mesh networking to connect the sensor nodes and message
    queuing telemetry transfer (MQTT) protocol to send the acquired data to a cloud
    server ADDA Fruit IO. ESP32 standalone microcontroller with in-built Wi-Fi is
    used as a transceiver on sensor nodes and master nodes. As far as sensor and master
    node power is concerned, a self-adapting power generation system is incorporated
    using solar power and water energy harvesting techniques. The sensor nodes are
    calibrated as per WHO standards using deionized water and buffer capsules. Five
    random samples are collected from river water, pond water, Borewell water, R.O
    water and Municipal committee water to analyse the proposed system’s accuracy.
    The accuracy test and analysis is done using statistical tools on water sample
    measurements by the proposed sensor node, and the same is compared with the actual
    certified instrument, hardware manual-based measurement, Laboratory value check
    and transmitted value on Cloud Server. The proposed WQMS is designed to measure
    various WQM parameters i.e. Total Dissolve Solid (TDS), pH, Temperature and turbidity
    and to ensure data accuracy.

    1. Introduction Fisheries and aquaculture have always been connected in the world
    economy, but they have some differences in their environmental impacts. In fishing,
    animals are captured in their natural environment, contributing to deterioration
    and biodiversity loss due to overexploitation (WWF, 2019). Aquaculture allows
    the cultivation of different aquatic species under controlled conditions. The
    level of control over culture variables contributes to minimizing the environmental
    impact and achieving production objectives, allowing better productivity. The
    amount of fish production from aquaculture worldwide increased from 25.7% in 2000
    to 46% in 2018 (FAO, 2020). Continental aquaculture contributed 62.5% of all aquaculture
    production in 2018 (FAO, 2020), reflecting the importance of this practice. Entities
    such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) promote
    aquaculture as a strategy to solve the problem of hunger and food security and
    as a sustainable economic activity (FAO, 2020). The medium and the techniques
    used to perform aquaculture have different environmental impacts. Aquaculture
    can be performed in the marine environment or in the continental zone, which is
    called continental aquaculture. The culture in continental aquaculture can use
    natural water bodies such as lakes and rivers or constructed water bodies such
    as reservoirs or dams. On the surface of land constructed ponds on the ground
    or tanks made from several materials can be used. Fig. 1 presents various methods
    of fish production, ranging from old methods, such as ground ponds, to those using
    the latest technologies, such as In-pond raceway systems (IPRS) (Kentucky Soybean
    Board, 2022). In addition, there are environmental considerations for each method.

    1. Different methods of fish production and some environmental considerations.
    Although global aquaculture practice has grown, different problems have hindered
    further development in productivity and sustainability (Cobo et al., 2019). Some
    of the problems identified in the Europe Union are of a sectoral and infrastructure
    nature: the atomization of the sector, higher production costs than in other countries,
    more onerous regulations, little space, limitations in access to water, difficulties
    in obtaining licenses, and in difficulty in accessing financial resources; there
    are also others problems that are related to the costs of the production process,
    in terms of food, repair and maintenance, quality seed, labor and those associated
    with water management (Gutiérrez et al., 2020). In Latin America, the main problems
    or limitations to overcome are access to investment capital, technological developments
    that stimulate the production process, and strategies to enter the market with
    a high level of competitiveness (Alejandro Flores Nava, 2013). Colombia has 20
    million hectares of aquatic ecosystems with great potential for use in this growing
    industry (Salazar Ariza et al., 2019). However, it has some problems, such as
    the dispersion of aquaculturists, heterogeneity in planting periods, and difficulties
    accessing the implementation of technological developments for small producers.
    Likewise, more information needs to be available to make reliable projections
    or analyses for early decisions (OCDE, 2016). The use of technological tools contributes
    to reducing some of the mentioned problems and making aquaculture practices more
    sustainable and competitive. According to FAO (2020), some of the most commonly
    used technologies to transform aquaculture practices are high-resolution satellite
    images (Belton et al., 2018), automatic identification systems (AIS) (James et
    al., 2018), cameras and sensors in situ (Føre et al., 2018), genetic and DNA profiles
    (Fagbémi et al., 2021), blockchain (Hang et al., 2020), Internet of Things (IoT)
    (Antonucci and Costa, 2020), big data (L. Yang et al., 2020), artificial intelligence
    (AI) (L. Yang et al., 2020) and machine learning (Taheri-Garavand et al., 2019).
    Specifically, information and communication technologies (ICT), such as IoT and
    AI, have been implemented to monitor, control, correct and even predict the behavior
    of critical parameters at different stages of the fish production chain. According
    to the reviewed literature, water management is where IoT and AI are most applied
    (FAO, 2020). IoT tools have also been used to administer feed to fish, including
    behavioral patterns that have influenced the management of optimal dosages of
    concentrates (Lafont et al., 2019; L. Li and Yakupitiyage, 2003), minimizing input
    costs and reducing waste production. The appearance of pathologies that affect
    the phenotype of the fish is another use given to these tools (Rohani et al.,
    2019). IoT is used to track each stage of an aquaculture culture, monitoring the
    water parameters or any other variable that can be measured. Whether the system
    is a cage culture or RAS, it can be monitored by sensors that generate alerts
    if it goes out of desirable ranges. Currently, there are many trademarks (an example
    can be seen in Fig. 2) that offer services to implement IoT in a company. However,
    the knowledge related to these technologies is not public knowledge, hence the
    importance of research published in different journals. The data collected by
    the sensors can be processed with different machine learning or deep learning
    algorithms to extract results such as parameter predictions or disease detection,
    as identified in this review. Fig. 2 shows the possible results that are generated
    with machine learning. Download : Download high-res image (962KB) Download : Download

    Several technologies are used to obtain water quality for the culture of fishes.
    Table 1 presents some known and emerging technologies that make it possible to
    obtain culture quality water, in addition some uses of IoT and AI in these technologies
    are mentioned. Table 1. Some technologies that remove contaminants from water,
    some uses of IoT and AI in these technologies are mentioned. Techniques Definition
    Use of IoT and AI Solar stills It refers to various types of assemblies in which
    solar energy is used to distil raw water and thus obtain drinking water. It is
    an old technology that has been evolving in different aspects to increase thermal
    efficiency and performance. (Saxena et al., 2022). IoT can be used to monitor
    temperatures, water level, relative humidity, flows (Benghanem et al., 2021).
    AI is used to predict thermal efficiency and water production yield (Moustafa
    et al., 2022). Bioreactor Various biological treatment options for culture wastewater
    to remove organic matter and ammonium that allow water which can be reused or
    discharged under less polluting conditions (Ahmad et al., 2022). IoT and AI enable
    real-time online monitoring, process automation, monitoring and predicting of
    key factors, fault detection, which increases the effectiveness of the biological
    process (Khanal et al., 2023). Adsorption Separation of contaminants from the
    water body through an adsorbent material with high porosity. It was used to remove
    ammonium and phosphorus from fish culture water. (Ahmad et al., 2022). IoT is
    used to measure temperature, concentrations, pH and contact times. AI is used
    to automate and optimize adsorption processes, assessing the performance of the
    process when adsorbing different types of contaminants. (Alam et al., 2022). Advanced
    oxidation process (AOP) Decomposition process of complex polluting molecules using
    highly oxidizing substances, mainly hydroxyl radical (*OH) (Ahmad et al., 2022).
    AI was used to optimize the parameters for preparing the catalyst. It also aims
    to predict the outcome of a reaction, i.e., the removal of a contaminant, depending
    on the initial conditions of temperature, pressure, time, catalyst dose and pH.
    (C. Zhang et al., 2021). Membrane separation processes: e.g. forward osmosis,
    membrane distillation. Different kinds of configurations in which the use of polluting
    membranes substances are eliminated due to the size of the pores, since it prevents
    the passage of specific substances. Both processes have been optimized using hydrogel
    to increase the efficiency of the process. (Lim and Ooi, 2022). AI is used to
    forecast water flow, membrane fouling and removal efficiency. Key data include
    total organic carbon, sodium ion, calcium ion. (Im et al., 2022). Water quality
    is essential because it directly affects the well-being and growth of fish. (Dzulqornain
    et al., 2018; Moyo and Rapatsa, 2021; Saha et al., 2018). The ICT tools applied
    to water quality range from the use of sensors in situ to monitor the parameters
    (Akhter et al., 2021) to the processing of data with AI techniques such as machine
    learning (ML) (Zhao et al., 2021) and deep learning (DL) (Xinting Yang et al.,
    2021). The most relevant water quality parameters are dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature,
    pH, ammonia, conductivity, and turbidity. Other parameters, such as alkalinity,
    organic matter, phytoplankton, nitrite, nitrate, hardness, CO2, phosphates, and
    H2S, are recommended to be measured and controlled by monitoring the percentage
    of water exchange in the ponds. Water recirculation systems have also been implemented
    (Lee et al., 2020; Saha et al., 2018), with which it is possible to save water
    and more easily control its quality. When the water quality parameters are out
    of the recommended ranges, it affects the metabolism and ability to assimilate
    food, including the periodicity in which fishes feed (Pule et al., 2017; Rodríguez
    and Anzola, 2001; Salazar Ariza et al., 2019). On the other hand, the excessive
    use of fish food produces a surplus that turns into residues that accumulate at
    the bottom. The degradation processes generated by byproducts alter the water
    quality or stimulate the growth of bacteria or viruses that make fish sick, reducing
    the productivity in the culture (Karimanzira and Rauschenbach, 2019; Liu et al.,
    2018; Moyo and Rapatsa, 2021). The ICT tools used to dose the feed are what we
    will identify in this review. This review is limited to identifying the specific
    uses of WSN, IoT, and AI in freshwater finfish culture, although many ICT tools
    are used in aquaculture. The purpose is to identify in which areas of freshwater
    finfish aquaculture these tools are used, taking into account their contribution
    to sustainability and, if possible, the level of complexity of the tools depending
    on the potential target audiences for their use. Mustapha et al., 2021 review
    the main ICT tools used in aquaculture and their application contexts, which could
    be considered the general framework of this review article. However, we focus
    specifically on IoT and AI tools for freshwater finfish aquaculture. Yue and Shen
    (2022) reviewed the ICT technologies used in aquaculture, including marine aquaculture.
    They did not focus specifically on AI and IoT equipment. Gladju et al. (2022)
    reviewed the applications of data mining and machine learning in aquaculture and
    fisheries, including marine ones. They did not focus specifically the electronic
    devices used, as this review does. Fu et al. (2022) made a complete and critical
    review of the role of deep learning in urban water management; this review contains
    the main problems faced by the application of this tool in the search for solutions
    for real situations. Some of the problems the authors mention are the ones we
    have also found in the current review since we are talking about water management
    but in the context of its use in aquaculture, which entails some particularities
    related to fish and biological processes in such systems. A systematic literature
    review (SLR) was used to identify the main variables contributing to the increase
    in sustainable productivity in continental or freshwater aquaculture and the most
    used ICT (IoT and AI) tools worldwide to monitor or control these variables. Section
    2 presents the methodology for the search and selection of documents related to
    the use of ICT. Section 3 shows the scientometric analysis of the selected papers.
    Section 4 shows the systematic literature review results, and Section 5 presents
    the analysis and discussion of the results, presenting gaps in the process. Finally,
    Section 6 presents the conclusions and future work. 2. Methodology A systematic
    literature review (SLR) is a research synthesis process in an area of interest
    in which a rigorous methodology is applied to extract or solve specific questions
    from the consultation and analyze the results. In this review, we use the methodology
    adopted by De-La-Hoz-Franco et al. (2018), initially proposed by Kitchenham et
    al. (2009). This methodology has already been used to give a more complete analysis
    of certain issues related to ICT (Beniwal and Singhrova, 2021; Hankel et al.,
    2018). To perform the SLR, we performed the following phases: 1) definition of
    search parameters, 2) identification, validation, and purge of the information,
    and 3) presentation and analysis of results. In the first phase, we defined the
    keywords for the search strings based on the following problem questions, ‘In
    which areas of the aquaculture process are IoT and AI used? What electronic instruments
    are used in the implementation of IoT and AI in aquaculture? Do IoT and AI contribute
    to the sustainable productivity increment in continental aquaculture?’ The databases
    consulted were SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEExplore, and Web of Science. Fig. 3
    illustrates the strategies of the search terms with their exclusion criteria.

    Fig. 3. Search string conformation models. Fig. 3 shows that documents containing
    the terms “sea” and “marine” were excluded from the search results in the databases.
    The review period was also delimited from 2015 to the first quarter of 2021. Reading
    review articles made it possible to identify that the phrases “precision aquaculture”
    and “smart fish farms” should also be included in the search terms in the databases.
    Fig. 2 presents the structure of the search chain used for this project: (IoT
    OR “Artificial intelligence” OR “Wireless sensor network”) AND (“fish farm” OR
    “fish farm”) AND “precision fish farm” AND “smart fish farm” AND (“wireless sensor
    network” AND aquaculture) AND NOT (sea OR marine) AND (2015–2021). In the second
    phase, validation and debugging of the information, the search strings were entered
    in each of the databases, which allowed 246 documents to be obtained. A purification
    analysis was carried out on these documents to verify which were duplicates and
    which did not conform to the hypothesis raised, obtaining 197 papers on which
    to apply the SLR process; this process allowed us to identify the scientometric
    and technical variables of the 197 documents, and these variables were organized
    in a data acquisition matrix. Subsequently, phase number 3 was executed, presenting,
    and analyzing the results, which are documented in Sections 3 Scientometric analysis,
    4 Technical analysis of this document. The technical variables were extracted
    to identify the use of technological tools. The technical variables were reported
    tools, application scopes, reported network protocols, the size of networks, the
    use of physical sensors, the microcontroller used, and the purpose of use. It
    ends with an analysis of the results of the review. 3. Scientometric analysis
    The scientometric variables used in this study were: year of publication, number
    of publications per database, type of document, quartile of the paper, country
    of publication of the journal, country of origin of the research, journals with
    more publications, and publications by University or Research Center. Fig. 4 shows
    that from 2015 to 2020, there was a progressive increase in publications related
    to the IoT and artificial intelligence in aquaculture. The year 2020 had an increase
    in publications of 345% compared to the previous year. In the first quarter of
    2021, there were 22 publications. The increase in articles published in 2020 is
    significant and an indicator of the importance given to these ICT tools in aquaculture.

    or university of the authors of the work was located. The countries that are generating
    the most publications are mainly China, India, Indonesia, and South Korea (106
    publications among the four countries, equivalent to 53.8%), which makes sense
    since China, India, and South Korea are countries that work heavily on technological
    development (Hong and Park, 2020), are leaders in the use of IoT and AI, and need
    to guarantee food security for their population (FAO et al., 2019). Download :

    that address the subject but have not been translated into English, which makes
    it challenging to access that information. The countries that receive the most
    papers on this subject are mainly the United States and the Netherlands (96 publications

    (Table 2) that the journal with the most articles related to the research topic
    in the study period was Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, with 14 papers
    (7.1% of the total), which is because the use of IoT transitioned from agriculture
    to aquaculture. In second place is IEEE Access, with seven published papers. Table

    of knowledge are Asian (see Fig. 10). The Busan University of Foreign Studies,
    located in South Korea, has a department specializing in the creative use of ICT
    tools, which could be why it is the institution with the most publications (10).

    analysis This systematic review identified the variables that directly influence
    the productivity of continental aquaculture and trends in using ICT tools to measure
    and control these variables. We divided the selected variables into five (5) categories
    of analysis: water quality, fish feeding, water recirculation, fish transport
    and traceability, and fish welfare. Below are the variables related to each type
    and the most used ICT tools. 4.1. Water quality The water quality of a pond directly
    affects the growth and well-being of the fish since when the water quality parameters
    are outside the recommended ranges; the fish become stressed, cannot eat properly,
    and are susceptible to physical damage or pathologies (Antonucci and Costa, 2020;
    Bhatnagar and Devi, 2013; Demeke and Tassew, 2016; Makori et al., 2017). Regarding
    the category of water quality analysis, the most representative parameters are
    dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, ammonia, turbidity, and water level (Moyo and
    Rapatsa, 2021; Shareef and Reddy, 2018; Wahed, 2016; Xinting Yang et al., 2020).
    Each of these are detailed below. 4.1.1. Dissolved oxygen The dissolved oxygen
    (D.O.) concentration influences the fish metabolic processes of fish; when it
    is below the level required by the cultivated species (5 mg/l in the case of tilapia),
    the culture is at risk, and the fish suffer from the stress due to the deficit
    (Wahed, 2016). Prolonged exposure to this deficit generates delays in growth,
    affecting the rate of food conversion and generating accumulation of food residues,
    contributing to the increase in anoxic conditions (Makori et al., 2017). Seven
    types of sensors can be used to monitor the dissolved oxygen levels in the culture
    tanks (Akhter et al., 2021). The sensors send the acquired data wirelessly to
    a local server or the cloud. Luo et al. (2015), evaluated the performance of a
    wireless network sensor system (WSN) in an area of 2 hm2, measuring the D.O. and
    other parameters. The results showed that when the levels of D.O. were below four
    mg/l, the system activated an aerator that turned off when the D.O. level reached
    5.5 mg/l. The information was stored on a local computer and viewed using LabView
    software (Bitter et al., 2007). The performance tests showed that the average
    loss of information packets was minimal (0.43%). Salim et al. (2017) evaluated
    a WSN that measures the D.O. every 5 s and sends the information via Wi-Fi to
    a portable station. The system shows the data in real-time but calculates the
    averages and standard deviation. It sends the data using a Wi-Fi module to a server
    to visualize it remotely. In China, Shi et al., 2018 monitored the D.O. and temperature
    of a freshwater fishpond (150 m in length, 50 m in width, and 2 m in water depth)
    using sensors at different heights to obtain a three-dimensional view of the parameters.
    They also compared three network topologies: star, tree, and mesh. They found
    that the tree network topology turned out to be the one with the minor data packet
    loss, and the nodes in the network save energy if they operate in the PM2 mode
    of operation. Shi et al. (2018) reported that a direct alarm is sent to the local
    farmer via his cell phone or by email when there are values of D.O. that affect
    production. Bhawiyuga et al. (2019), implemented a WSN that uses IoT to monitor
    water quality parameters. In this study, a gateway node receives the information
    from the sensor nodes using LoRA technology through the MQTT protocol to facilitate
    sending data to the cloud. It obtained the best results by sending 100 packets,
    which were each 56- bytes packets, at intervals of 1 s, making the evaluation
    at distances of 200 m and 400 m work well, obtaining the same efficiency in both
    cases. In South Korea, Lee et al., 2020 applied the MQTT protocol to send data
    from sensors via cellular IoT to measure and control a pilot vertical aquaculture
    farm with water recirculation. The system could operate in manual, automatic,
    and remote-control modes to control the variables D.O., pH, and water level. The
    revision of the documents of the IEEExplore database allowed us to identify that,
    in general, they are Proceedings and present projects of low complexity, which
    have a simple structure, i.e., sensors, microcontrollers, information transmission
    module, receiver module, and a computer, as seen in Fig. 11. Download : Download

    of a simple wireless sensor system. On the other hand, in different studies, artificial
    intelligence has been used to generate predictive models from historically obtained
    data, which allows us to foresee any future anomaly in the process. Gao et al.
    (2019b), worked with several water quality parameters, including the D.O., obtained
    using IoT. These data were used to train an M5 regression tree to build a predictive
    model. They previously applied the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm to eliminate
    abnormal data that affect the predictive model. Kuang et al. (2020), used edge
    computing architecture and a hybrid predictive model (KIG-ELM) to predict D.O.
    in intensive aquaculture. The model was based on an improved genetic algorithm
    with k-means for clustering (KIG) and an extreme learning machine (ELM). They
    used the percentage of absolute mean error (MAPE), the square root of the mean
    error (RMSE), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSC or NSE) to evaluate
    the predictive model and compared it with other models. The predictive model used
    pH, water temperature, ambient temperature, carbon dioxide, light intensity, photosynthetically
    active radiation, radiation, wind speed, and direction as inputs. Table 3 presents
    the performance metrics of the predictive model. Table 3. Comparison of performance

    built a predictive model of D.O. for a fish farm from Jintan Fishing Base, Jiangsu
    Province, China. For this purpose, they used a hybrid with Gradient Increase Decision
    Tree (GBDT) and optimized Short/Long Term Memory Networks (LSTM). D. Li et al.,
    (2021), worked on improving clustering techniques by developing an algorithm named
    Adam. They integrated the Adam algorithm with radial-based neural networks (RBFNNs),
    forming a predictive model for D.O. called ECA-Adam-RBFNN (Enhanced clustering
    algorithm - Adam - RBFNN) with which they had significant reductions in the MAE,
    MAPE, and RMSE metrics. Table 3 presents the performance metrics of the predictive
    models. From a productivity point of view, the monitoring of D.O. with the automation
    of the oxygenation process allowed savings of up to 30% in electricity costs associated
    with this process (Xiaoping Yang et al., 2020). 4.1.2. Temperature Temperature
    is a fundamental parameter since it directly affects the concentration of D.O.
    present in the pond, and it can change fish metabolic activity and the growth
    rate of fingerlings and adults (Bhatnagar and Devi, 2013; Moyo and Rapatsa, 2021;
    Rodríguez and Anzola, 2001). If the temperature is not in the optimal range, the
    fish also lose their appetite, and there is food waste, affecting the costs of
    aquaculture (Wahed, 2016). The air temperature affects the temperature inside
    the pond (Rahmadya et al., 2020). Fish are poikilothermic, so their body temperature
    depends on water temperature. Fish undergo growth and development alterations
    if there are extreme temperature variations (Salazar Ariza et al., 2019). For
    example, in the case of tilapia (Oreochromis s.p.), the optimal temperature range
    for its cultivation is 28 °C–32 °C; if the water temperature exceeds these values,
    the metabolism of the fish accelerates, and it makes it more difficult for the
    fish to obtain oxygen since if the temperature increases, the concentration of
    D.O. decreases. The alteration of metabolism due to temperature variations can
    be compensated with food intake; therefore, if there is no temperature monitoring,
    this metabolic need cannot be identified (Moyo and Rapatsa, 2021). To measure
    the temperature in situ, sensors connected to nodes that send the information
    to their destination are used (Tuan, 2019). According to the literature, the most
    commonly used temperature sensor is DS18B20 (Bhawiyuga et al., 2019; Quintero-Polanco
    et al., 2018; Ragai et al., 2018). As in D.O. measurement, the temperature is
    part of the basic parameters measured in WSNs connected to local servers (Ragai
    et al., 2018) or connected to the cloud (Bhawiyuga et al., 2019; Rahmadya et al.,
    2020). In the event of any temperature variation, an alarm is activated so that
    the operator can make the necessary manual corrections, alternatively these are
    sometimes carried out automatically (Dzulqornain et al., 2018; Romli et al., 2018).
    Xinting Yang et al., 2021 cite Hu et al. (2019), who used the LSTM model to predict
    culture temperature in cages, obtaining a precision of 96.88%. 4.1.3. pH The pH
    affects the proteins of living beings; if the fish is exposed to a very acidic
    or basic pH, it can affect different tissues, such as the gills, lens, and cornea.
    If the pH change is abrupt, it can cause the death of the fish (Bórquez Lopez
    et al., 2016; Salazar Ariza et al., 2019). The pH also affects the percentage
    of ammonia in its toxic form. Ammonia in an aqueous solution can be in ionic form
    (NH4+) or molecular form (NH3), depending on the pH and temperature of the solution.
    The tolerance range of freshwater fish is between 6.5 and 8.5 (Vishwakarma et
    al., 2018), but it depends on the specific species. For example, tilapia has been
    reported to tolerate low pH. However, the tolerance level also depends on the
    age of the fish, with fingerlings being less tolerant and adult fish more tolerant
    (Mustapha and Atolagbe, 2018). Likewise, when there is an alteration in pH, the
    fish behave erratically: They pant, and, secrete mucous membranes, their epithelial
    tissue is destroyed, their fins bleed, and they do not feed in their usual way,
    and are lethargic (Salazar Ariza et al., 2019). The sensors used to measure pH
    are based on the potentiometric method, where the potential difference between
    two electrodes is measured (Shareef and Reddy, 2018; Vishwakarma et al., 2018).
    The sensors are connected to microprocessors that are part of IoT-based systems
    (Luo et al., 2015; Saha et al., 2018). When the pH level is outside the recommended
    range, an alert is sent to the operator, and the system automatically uses an
    acidic or basic solutions (depending on the situation) to neutralize the water
    (Fatani et al., 2018). Huan et al., 2020, Huan et al., 2020 cite Hu et al. (2019),
    who used the LSTM model to predict pH in cage culture, obtaining a precision of
    95.76%. 4.1.4. Ammonium The concentration of ammonia is related to the level of
    D.O. (Daoliang Li and Liu, 2019a) and the pH (Ramya et al., 2019). Ammonium in
    water can be in ionized (NH4+) and nonionized (NH3) forms, according to the reaction
    NH4+ ↔ NH3 + H+. The response of ammonium will shift from one to the other depending
    on the pH of the water (Salazar Ariza et al., 2019). The nonionized form is toxic
    for fish farming. If the concentration of nonionized ammonia reaches values between
    0.6 and 2.0 mg/l, the effects on the fish are usually fatal. Even at concentrations
    between 0.1 and 0.3 mg/l, there may be harmful effects that affect production
    (Salazar Ariza et al., 2019). For example, for tilapia, the optimal range of nonionized
    ammonia is 0.02–0.05 mg/l (Merino Archila et al., 2006; Salazar Ariza et al.,
    2019). To measure this parameter, potentiometric sensors are used based on ion-selective
    electrodes, which detect whether the ammonium is ionized (Luo et al., 2015). These
    sensors are connected to microprocessors that are part of the IoT-based WSN to
    track and record these parameters (Daoliang Li and Liu, 2019a; Luo et al., 2015).
    According to the reviewed literature, ammonium is measured less frequently than
    D.O., temperature, and pH. However, as with D.O., artificial intelligence tools
    are being applied to the data collected by the sensors to predict the behavior
    of ammonium in fish farming. Yu et al. (2021), reported creating a hybrid method
    from three artificial intelligence techniques to process and predict ammonia data;
    for this purpose, they use empirical mode decomposition (EMD), enhanced particle
    swarm optimization (IPSO), and machine extreme learning (ELM). They also compared
    their EMD-IPSO-ELM method with other techniques, such as EMD-ELM and LSSVM least
    squares support vector machine, obtaining improvements in the RMSE metric of up
    to 39.81% and 22.58%, respectively. 4.1.5. Turbidity The type of turbidity of
    the water depends on its origin where it was, produced by suspended mineral solids
    it or if it was made by plankton. The excessive turbidity of suspended mineral
    solids hinders the ability of fish to breathe, affecting their growth (Rodríguez
    and Anzola, 2001). According to the FAO (Coche and Van de Wall, 2007), the turbidity
    level can be measured with a Secchi disk, and a visibility between 40 and 60 cm
    is appropriate. For the cultivation of tilapia, a visibility of 30 cm has been
    recommended (FEDEACUA, 2019). Since the measurement of this parameter requires
    optical sensors, Rocher et al. (2017), developed their sensor, which works with
    infrared light. They placed an infrared LED emitter and a photodiode, which receives
    the signal, in a sealed plastic box with a glass tube running through it, and
    the water passes through this tube so that the turbidity reading can be performed.
    The authors established an equation between the photodiode signal and turbidity
    with a correlation coefficient of 0.99918159 and an absolute mean error of 3.8651793.
    The sensor sends the call to a flyport microprocessor, which sends the calls over
    Wi-Fi to the access point (AP) and then to the switch. The router connected to
    the controller receives the information and sends it to the internet, as shown
    in Fig. 12. The switch also has a connection with another AP that allows the information
    to be displayed on a local computer and on any other equipment that is connecteds
    to it via Wi-Fi. Download : Download high-res image (393KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. Topology of the project carried out by Rocher et al.
    Adapted from Rocher et al. (2017). Other projects have worked with commercial
    sensors (DFRobot, WAVGAT, and CFsunbird, among others) that are adapted to work
    with Arduino or Raspberry PI, sending the information to a local wireless network
    (Bhawiyuga and Yahya, 2018)) or sending the data to the cloud, so that they are
    accessible from the cell phone or the computer (Rohit et al., 2019; Salim et al.,
    2017). Idachaba et al. (2017), used turbidity measurements in conjunction with
    video cameras connected to the cloud to identify if there is food waste and optimize
    food dosage. 4.1.6. Water level In fish cultures, there is evaporation, either
    by solar radiation in cultures that are exposed to the sun or by aeration effects.
    In both cases, the loss of water must be compensated to maintain optimal cultivation
    conditions (Anzola et al., 2001). Different sensor systems have been implemented
    to measure water levels periodically to monitor water loss. For this, low-cost
    ultrasonic sensors are used (Angani et al., 2019; R. J. Chen, 2019), or analog
    sensors compatible with Arduino technology, such as SMPJ-0005-01 (manufactured
    by Geekria), whose range of variation is 4.8 cm (Hang et al., 2020), are used.
    The microprocessor sends the data collected by the sensors to the cloud. The control
    system to keep the water level constant can be manual or automatic. If it is manual,
    the operator receives an alarm indicating variation of the water level, and the
    operator corrects it manually. If the control system is automated, the sensor
    sends the signal to the automatic controller, and the system activates the pumps
    to replace the lost water (J. H. Chen et al., 2016; R. J. Chen, 2019; Dzulqornain
    et al., 2018; Hang et al., 2020; Prasad et al., 2020). Statistical tools have
    been used to optimize the energy consumption of the pumps, for example, the Kalman
    filter for the sensor signal, so to save energy, automatic controllers activate
    the pump only for the necessary amount of time (Ullah and Kim, 2018). In summary,
    the aspects related to the water quality parameters directly affect the productivity
    of aquaculture due to their impact on the growth of the fish and their welfare
    state. 4.2. Feeding The second most common use case for ICT tools is dosage food
    for fishes. In all reviewed cases, IoT environments are used to monitor the need
    for food (R. J. Chen, 2019) or the level of food inside the container (Janpla
    et al., 2019). In many cases, automated feeders with time meters are used to administer
    the feed (Ullah and Kim, 2018). Artificial intelligence has also been used to
    predict feeding needs from the data provided by various tools for monitoring fish
    behavior, such as acoustic technology, computer vision, acceleration sensors,
    water quality parameters, and electromyograms (Daoliang Li, Wang et al., 2020).
    Computer vision has undergone significant development in research, L. Yang et
    al. (2020) report the use of the optical flow method to monitor groups instead
    of individuals to extract behavioral parameters; they also recommends taking into
    account water parameters such as D.O., temperature, pH, water flow, as well as
    the age and density of the culture because they affect this behavior. Considering
    the complexity of the dynamics of the movement, spatiotemporal studies are recommended,
    with daily climate monitoring. After processing the information, the feeding patterns
    of various species have been identified, which allows the identification of food
    needs and the use of automatic feeders to supply them. The type, quality, and
    quantity of feed are issues that directly affect the productivity of the cultivation
    process since feeding costs are high in countries that have aquaculture production
    (Zhao et al., 2021). According to Xinting Yang et al., 2020), the complete automation
    of the feeding process saves 30% of the feed. 4.3. Water recirculation The environmental
    component is a critical aspect of aquaculture farms, especially the sustainable
    use of water. To this end, there is a trend of wasting no water by implementing
    recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). The water recirculation process includes
    physical and biological filtration, which allows the removal of suspended solids,
    ammonia, and nitrites; from there, it goes to a storage or buffer tank where the
    temperature and dissolved oxygen are stabilized if necessary. Santorio et al.
    (2022) propose using a microalgae-bacterial consortia continuous flow granular
    reactor (AquaMab CFGR) to produce an effluent with high levels of O.D., which
    would save the use of aerators in the buffer tank or even be sent directly to
    the fish tank. From the buffer tank, the purified water is recirculated into the
    cultivation process to be used again (Shin, 2020). If necessary and depending
    on the contaminants in the water, more advanced techniques such as photo Fenton
    (Dolatabadi and Ahmadzadeh, 2019) or nanoparticles (Long et al., 2022) can be
    used. Processes such as heavy metal adsorption have been modeled with a feed-forward
    artificial neural network (ANN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).
    This modeling could be integrated into a general contaminant removal prediction
    system (Dolatabadi et al., 2018). Photocatalysis for water treatment with new
    green materials such as MXenes is an option to verify for aquaculture water treatment
    (Xu et al., 2022). Angani et al. (2019), monitored and controlled the RAS system
    using temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and ultrasonic sensors to measure the
    water level; the signal was sent to a relay that controlled the pumps. The sensor
    signals also reached a Raspberry PI microprocessor that sent it to the internet
    in MQTT format so that the process could be monitored and controlled from a cell
    phone application. The installed system allowed the control of the variables within
    the ranges required for the operation. Varga et al. (2020), performed modeling
    and simulation of RAS using a methodology called programmable process structures,
    which allowed them to make a dynamic model of the RAS from a single tank that
    could be quickly adapted to multiple process stages or the required specifications
    depending on the cultivated species. Ta and Wei (2018), developed a dissolved
    oxygen prediction model to control the operation of a RAS system at the Mingbo
    Experimental Station in China from a convolutional neural network of inverse understanding
    with which they obtained faster convergence speeds than with analysis using time-series
    multi-layer perceptron (MLP) method and backpropagation neural networks. The stability
    of the predictions is also better, and the proposed model manages the production
    system. Gong et al. (2019), installed a vertical fish culture prototype where
    they monitored the temperature, dissolved oxygen, and volume of the tank with
    sensors, which sent the signal to the oxygenation and pumping systems to maintain
    the temperature, D.O. and water level. They kept the system within the ranges
    of 28–30 °C and, 6–8.5 mg/l D.O., and maintained the desired water level. In some
    cases, when water is recirculated, substances such as geosmin (GIM) and 2-methylisoborneol
    can accumulate, affecting fish flavor and generating a characteristic odor (Kropp
    et al., 2022). Advanced oxidation processes (OAPs) are used to treat these waters.
    Through various physicochemical processes OAPs generate highly reactive hydroxyl
    radicals (OH*), which can destroy GIM and other complex molecules. Taoufik et
    al. (2022) reviewed articles presenting the results of modeling pollutant removal
    research data with OAPs using Machine Learning. Currently, research is being carried
    out for the use of “smart materials” with micro and nanostructures that allow
    the detection and removal of chemical and microbiological contaminants (Fakhri
    et al., 2022; Long et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2021), which has
    become a research area with the potential to apply machine learning or deep learning.
    4.4. Traceability and food transportation systems Zhang et al. (2018), used a
    wireless sensor network to monitor the transport of Urechis unicinctus and determine
    the cheapest and safest way to bring this species alive to local markets in China.
    They evaluated the transport conditions with and without water and measured the
    temperature, CO2, O2, D.O., pH, and salinity with sensors. They used the STM32F103C8T6
    microprocessor with a ZigBee CC2530 module to send the information to the gateway
    node via GPRS/3G to the router for local and remote monitoring. They demonstrated
    that transport without water and under controlled measurement parameters could
    transport an excellent quality product. Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis)
    is another edible species in China that diners prefer to have served live. For
    this purpose, Qian et al. (2020), investigated the waterless transport of cold
    anesthetized live fish. The temperature, O2, and CO2 data are measured in the
    containers to guarantee the O2 requirements. To determine future needs, predictive
    models are used. All information is sent to the internet using GPRS/3G for remote
    monitoring. When the fish arrive at the point of sale, are marked with a QR code
    that allows the consumer to learn the entire production and transport process.
    4.5. Fish welfare This category includes works that try to develop tools to identify
    pathologies in fish and devices that monitor their growth status through biomass
    measurement and behavior assessment (Daoliang Li, Hao, et al., 2020). From the
    perspective of pathologies, Novac and Moga (2015), proposed implementing software
    in the cloud, which would serve as a decision support system in ichthyology. The
    tool allowed aquaculturists to observe a fish to identify its disease and the
    best procedure to treat the culture. Rohani et al. (2019), used AI-processed images
    to differentiate live eggs from dead eggs of rainbow trout fish. For this purpose,
    they used the support vector data description (SVDD), reaching a precision of
    93.3% in the classification. (Daoliang Li and Liu, 2019a). Mani et al. (2021),
    used machine learning to verify the impact of diets enriched with probiotics to
    feed Cyprinus carpio; they measured the hematological parameters of fish 60 days
    after starting the treatment. They compared various machine learning techniques
    to classify the dataset and determined that the random forest technique (RF) obtained
    the best results with an accuracy of 98%. To evaluate the impact of the ammonium
    concentration on the protein level and the mobility of Oreochromis niloticus,
    Ewees et al. (2021), optimized the classification algorithm support vector machine
    (SVM) with the Moth-Flame Optimization algorithm (MFO) to classify fish according
    to the protein level and predict the fish mortality rate. Sveen et al. (2021),
    used the commercial platform Aiforia® (https://www.aiforia.com/), which processes
    images using artificial intelligence tools, to initiate research evaluating the
    health of Atlantic salmon through histology. To that end, they used supervised
    machine learning based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Most methods to
    study fish biomass are based on computer vision. Although image acquisition equipment
    and processing technologies affect detection accuracy, combining acoustic technologies
    with computer vision is recommended to improve the detection of biomass movement
    and growth (Zhao et al., 2021). 5. Analysis of results and discussion Table 4
    summarizes the results of the SLR, identifying five categories or areas of application
    of ICTs in continental aquaculture. The objectives or purposes for which the IoT

    thing to emphasize is that each category or area analyzed, in which the ICT tools
    are used for aquaculture corresponds to the most relevant aspects for its productivity
    to be sustainable. A total of 67.5% of the documents reviewed focus on applying
    and evaluating the use of ICTs in monitoring the quality parameters of fish culture
    water, indicating the importance of this aspect in the aquaculture production
    process. The main reason most of the projects reviewed focus on water quality
    variables is that the water is the medium in which the fish lives; its quality
    determines whether the aquaculture achieves production objectives or not. However,
    another reason is that implementing projects monitoring these variables may be
    less costly. The availability and costs of the sensors make the technology accessible
    so that it can be implemented in conditions with scarce resources. Table 5 lists
    the physical sensors most commonly used in monitoring water quality parameters.

    Technology Co., Ltd. (Luo et al., 2015) There is research to improve the quality
    and minimize the cost of sensors (Akhter et al., 2021) to increase response times
    and sensitivity so that they can be used in real-time. Interest is focused on
    sensors that measure some chemical nitrogen species relevant to fish cultures
    (nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium). Akhter et al., 2021 a worked on a low-cost,
    low-power nitrate sensor. Integration with artificial intelligence is also key
    to identifying trends and complementing field measurements of ammonia. Due to
    the limitations of ammonium sensors, Yu et al. (2021), worked on hybrid models
    to predict ammonium concentration values in aquaculture processes. Fig. 13 presents
    some of the elements used in the IoT assemblies found in the reviewed documents.
    The most commonly used sensors to capture information on the water parameters
    can be seen in Table 5; some of them are illustrated in Fig. 13. There also can
    also see examples of microcontrollers reported in the bibliography, such as MSP430,
    PCL32MX220F032B, ESP8266, and Pic16f877a. The most used is the Arduino UNO, and
    the Raspberry PI has been used as a microprocessor. The most commonly used network
    protocols to send the collected information to a server or the cloud can be seen
    in Fig. 13 and Table 6. This information reaches the cloud and, is stored and/or
    processed and then presented to the user through web platforms or applications
    made especifically for it. Fig. 13 shows several application environments referenced
    in the literature reviewed where IoT tools are used. Download : Download high-res

    the amount of data sent without damage, and the periodicity of the data sent.
    The network protocols used in inland fish culture are those reported in Table
    6. Fish feeding is the second category to which ICT tools are applied in continental
    aquaculture. In this context, ICT tools seek to identify behavior patterns or
    indicators showing that the fish is hungry to dose the food in the required quantities
    and at the required times. Recent research has tended to use computer vision with
    deep learning processes for image processing (L. Yang et al., 2020). The SLR made
    it possible to identify the growing use of Deep Learning because it has better
    organization abilities and allows data to be processed by skipping some steps
    required to analyze the data with machine learning (Huan et al., 2020, Huan et
    al., 2020). Another point identified in the SLR is that for processing data and
    constructing mathematical models, it has progressed from applying individual techniques
    to using hybrid techniques of machine learning or deep learning to achieve better
    results in terms of performance metrics of the obtained models. The economic impact
    on production due to food expenses motivates researchers to improve the equipment
    and techniques for processing captured information. However, there is a dire need
    for articles evaluating the impact of ICT tools on the productivity metrics of
    a freshwater fishpond culture under actual conditions. Some studies in the SLR
    performed experiments that sought to produce fish for food security and at low
    cost. Countries such as Vietnam (Munro, 2014), Bangladesh (Uddin et al., 2021),
    Thailand (Munro, 2014), and Cambodia, and African countries such as Egypt (FAO
    et al., 2017), Nigeria (FAO et al., 2017), Kenya (FAO et al., 2017), Zambia, Zimbabwe
    (Moyo and Rapatsa, 2021) and Ghana (Ankrah Twumasi et al., 2021; Antwi et al.,
    2017) produced documents with this approach. China, on the contrary, is a leading
    country that generates a high percentage of research and development articles
    on applications of ICT tools to promote aquaculture 4.0, which is the digital
    transformation of aquaculture production (Daoliang Li, Hao, et al., 2020; Daoliang
    Li and Liu, 2019b; Wei et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2021), as shown in Fig. 6. In
    the SLR process, it was found that there was a large amount of information reported
    for the use of ICT tools in aquaculture for marine fish, saltwater shrimp, and
    bivalves. These tools have been used to track cage cultures in the sea using robots,
    monitoring water quality, fish movement, and disease. In comparison, the number
    of projects using IoT and artificial intelligence tools is less extensive in freshwater
    fish farming. The most investigated species in this area are tilapia (Oreochromis
    spp.) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Work has also been reported with other
    commercially important species, such as the Guppy (Poecilia reticulata), the Chinese
    sturgeon (Acipenser Sinensis), and the freshwater eel (Anguilla Anguilla). When
    reviewing the literature, it was identified that there had been an evolution of
    the ICT tools used to increase productivity in aquaculture. References were found
    that used remote sensing to follow up on large fish cultures, and then the number
    of articles was increased, reporting various experiences using WSN. Since 2017
    there has been a progressive increase in the use of the Internet of Things. Since
    2019, there has been an increasing number of articles that refer to projects that
    integrate IoT and artificial intelligence, using tools such as machine learning
    to make predictions from data stored in the cloud. As of 2021, the use of deep
    learning is mentioned to a greater extent. The advantages of using deep learning
    over machine learning are analyzed in the most recent works (Fu et al., 2022;
    Xinting Yang et al., 2020). The main disadvantage is the large amount of data
    required by deep learning processes, which leads to investigating options to acquire
    these datasets, such as improving the quality of the data, using data obtained
    from other sources, and combining the data with existing scientific information
    to increase the precision of the results (Fu et al., 2022). For purposes of comparison
    of the research results of the research articles reviewed, the authors identified
    that there is no homogeneity in the information presented, the application scales
    vary, and the tools used vary, which makes it challenging to generate a consolidation
    of the developments made to date, especially regarding the process to create artificial
    intelligence models that can be generalized. There are reports of projects completed
    on a laboratory scale and others developed in large pools or ponds. In addition,
    the impact of meteorological variables on the environment is not always measured,
    and it is an incidence factor in the response of the fish. There is fragmentation
    of the projects at very different scales. The fragmentation of the research development
    in this area is so severe that Fig. 14 presents the coauthoring works in small
    groups independent of each other. The knowledge networks in this area of research
    have yet to be developed. Download : Download high-res image (718KB) Download

    2010–2020 period. Source: Own elaboration using Vos Viewer (Van Eck and Waltman,
    2014). Many research groups generate knowledge and train new researchers but are
    isolated from other research groups with similar works. A more inclusive international
    articulation process is required to consolidate knowledge development and generation
    and provide solutions for a more global application. From the perspective of the
    complexity of ICT tools that can be applied to aquaculture production processes,
    several levels were identified: • A sensor node for on-site monitoring and manual
    control • Multiple sensor nodes for on-site monitoring and manual control • Multiple
    sensor nodes for online monitoring and automatic control • Multiple sensor nodes
    for online monitoring, automatic control, and prediction of variables with artificial
    intelligence in the cloud • Multiple sensor nodes for online monitoring, automatic
    control, and prediction of variables with artificial intelligence, as well as
    marking and tracking of the product to guarantee quality and add value. Based
    on the degree of complexity of the projects reported in the documents reviewed,
    this classification could be transferred to the segmentation of potential users
    of ICT tools, considering their socioeconomic conditions, to be more assertive
    when proposing technologies for your fish cultures. However, although the articles
    were reviewed to identify the percentages of savings or increases in productivity
    due to the use of ICT tools, it was found that most of these documents focus on
    analyzing different aspects of the implementation of technology, such as various
    arrangements of the sensors to send the information to the gateway nodes, different
    architectures of the system, types of sensors, comparison of network protocols
    to send the data, efficiency, and energy consumption of transmitting information,
    various physical assemblies to install the sensors in ponds, and comparison of
    machine learning or deep learning techniques to improve the evaluation metrics
    of constructed predictive models. Although in some cases, percentages of improvement
    in costs are reported, especially for food, no studies show a clear correlation
    between the productivity metrics of fish cultures and the use of ICT tools. From
    the AI perspective, Fu et al. (2022) comment that the applications of deep learning
    to real situations, at an industrial level, in the context of water management,
    are still in the development phase, and there are many gaps to fill. They identified
    five areas to work on: 1) regarding data: its availability, quality, accessibility,
    security, and privacy, and cyber-attacks, 2) development of algorithms and learning
    systems, 3) the relationship performance - explainability, 4) multiagent systems,
    and 5) digital twins and autonomous systems. As in this review, the authors’ conclusions
    apply to the aquaculture industry. The social impact of using ICT tools can be
    two-sided. On the one hand, working conditions for aquaculture technicians are
    improved from the perspective of work shifts, especially at night. These tools
    allow the use of alarms or, in most cases, responses to variations in water quality
    parameters. On the other hand, there is always the fear of employees losing their
    jobs as machines replace people. Although it is a possible scenario, it is not
    in the immediate future due to the costs that this would entail. Second, having
    artificial intelligence that manages a complete fish farm will still require much
    information, which is just starting to be obtained. Finally, the impact of all
    these tools on the sustainability of aquaculture production is briefly analyzed.
    Aquaculture is a relatively sustainable activity in food production. Its sustainability
    depends on the culture technology used. Moreover, IoT and AI tools make it possible
    to monitor and control this activity more effectively and contribute to the reduction
    of input costs, whether it is fish food, which can achieve 30% savings, or in
    water, minimizing the duration of values of physicochemical parameters that affect
    production. How much can farmers implement? The implementation will depend on
    access to these tools and the financial resources available for farmers, hence
    the importance of identifying the various levels of implementation. Aquaculture
    has an impact on all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), making the implementation
    of ICT tools that help achieve these goals in this productive activity more relevant.

    is observed in ICT tools and their use in aquaculture processes, from the WSN
    and the IoT to the generation of predictive models using artificial intelligence.
    Integrating IoT and artificial intelligence is the current trend, and there are
    still many aspects to integrate. It is essential to collate atmospheric variables
    to see the correlation or correspondence with the water quality for aquaculture
    farms where the water source comes from nearby bodies. There are still many gaps
    in the construction of predictive models, so increasing the percentages in the
    prediction of feeding requirements is necessary. Technologies such as computer
    vision and acoustics can be integrated to improve this point. It is also essential
    to have more realistic models that reflect the complexity of factors that affect
    the growth process of fish and that these models can be generalized. The most
    comprehensive and first application that can be made for ICT tools in fish farming
    is to monitor the water quality parameters due to its impact on the fish culture;
    besides, this application is also more accessible to different producers. A conclusion,
    which at the same time is a suggestion, is that there is an increase in projects
    related to the application of artificial intelligence in aquaculture. Nevertheless,
    more explicit cooperation is needed between the different research groups worldwide
    so that the results of the projects are replicable or can at least be referred
    to on the same scale so that they can be comparable. Future work must focus on
    research where fish culture productivity metrics are explicitly correlated with
    IoT and AI tools, including economic evaluations of the process. This research
    can be a reference for other researchers and entrepreneurs in the sector. This
    point is essential to integrate scientific research and business. The construction
    of datasets to use deep learning should continue to be a priority, or at least
    the search for strategies to improve the efficiency of models built from existing
    data should continue to be a priority (Fu et al., 2022). This research did not
    receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or
    not-for-profit sectors. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
    that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. Data availability

  description: Wireless Communication provides the interconnection of different devices
    for the ubiquitous accessibility of intellectual capacity. Wireless Communication
    incorporates device interaction to provide sufficient capability in networking
    between intermediate devices. Conventionally, the Internet of Things (IoT) and
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) offer sufficient information between intermediate
    devices. IoT-WSN devices are resource constraints (RC), compact devices, and limited
    battery resources. The increase in the number of users leads to challenges with
    security in the IoT-WSN. The data transmission between the wireless communication
    uses the 5G communication-based NOMA communication. Due to limited RC features,
    the computational complexity is higher with minimal space consumption; those are
    evaluated with embedded hardware features within the IoT – WSN. This paper aimed
    to develop an appropriate optimal routing scheduling and security model based
    on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The performance of the proposed ORSS is evaluated
    for security analysis based on consideration of different attacks. With the ORSS
    model, the position of nodes is computed with the covariance matrix estimation.
    To identify the optimal route, 's Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm
    is implemented for the route scheduling for the data transmission. SWIPT is implemented
    for effective energy harvesting to minimize energy consumption within the network.
    Based on the covariance estimation, optimal routes in the network are computed
    to detect attacks. The attacks are computed based on the utilization of the LSTM
    model for the detection and classification of attacks with the use of CICIDS datasets.
    The comparative analysis stated that the proposed ORSS exhibits ~40% higher data
    transmission and ~21% reduced delay than state-of-techniques.

    The data transmission between the wireless communication uses the 5G communication-based
    NOMA communication. Due to limited RC features, the computational complexity is
    higher with minimal space consumption; those are evaluated with embedded hardware
    features within the IoT – WSN. This paper aimed to develop an appropriate optimal
    routing scheduling and security model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
    The performance of the proposed ORSS is evaluated for security analysis based
    on consideration of different attacks. With the ORSS model, the position of nodes
    is computed with the covariance matrix estimation. To identify the optimal route,
    ''s Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is implemented for the route scheduling
    for the data transmission. SWIPT is implemented for effective energy harvesting
    to minimize energy consumption within the network. Based on the covariance estimation,
    optimal routes in the network are computed to detect attacks. The attacks are
    computed based on the utilization of the LSTM model for the detection and classification
    of attacks with the use of CICIDS datasets. The comparative analysis stated that
    the proposed ORSS exhibits ~40% higher data transmission and ~21% reduced delay
    than state-of-techniques Keywords: Internet of Things (IoT), Simultaneous Wireless

    Listen Urban stormwater refers to water transferred in built environments from
    rainfall or snowmelt (Müller et al. 2020). In the past centuries, with the development
    of the economy and society, there were more and more built areas all over the
    world. In these built environments, biodiversity and ecosystems services related
    to stormwater are reduced due to impervious surfaces such as streets, parking
    lots, and rooftops (Berland et al. 2017), and as a result, many environmental
    issues have arisen (Prudencio & Null 2018). These environmental issues include
    but are not limited to (i) urban flooding due to reduced water infiltration that
    is also linked to climate change (Cousins 2017), such as floods in Zhengzhou City,
    China on July 20, 2021 (Wang et al. 2021) and (ii) water contamination due to
    stormwater runoff over polluted impervious surfaces (Gasperi et al. 2014; Becouze-Lareure
    et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2019; Müller et al. 2020). Since the middle of the 19th
    century, modern storm drains, gutters, and underground systems which are also
    known as gray infrastructures are constructed in cities worldwide (Qiao et al.
    2018; Fu et al. 2019). The last decades have also seen the emergence of green
    infrastructures including wet ponds, constructed stormwater wetlands, bioretention,
    infiltration facilities, permeable pavement, swales, green roofs, and rainwater
    harvesting systems, etc., also named nature-based solutions (NBSs), stormwater
    control measures (SCMs), best management practices (BMPs), with issues related
    to their design, operation, and long-term performance (Fletcher et al. 2015; Cherqui
    et al. 2019). Traditionally, stormwater quantity and quality in the infrastructures
    mentioned above are monitored by water technicians using accurate and expensive
    instrumentation (Salehi et al. 2020; Thebault et al. 2020; Nickel et al. 2021).
    Because of resource limitations, it is difficult in theory and impossible in practice
    to monitor stormwater in these infrastructures with high temporal and spatial
    resolution. The drawbacks of this condition are numerous and include (i) lag in
    urban flood warning and relief decision-making due to inaccurate rainfall estimates
    (Wang et al. 2021); (ii) lack of proactive response to water contamination due
    to the inadequacy of data (Pule et al. 2017); and (iii) lack of maintenance due
    to lack of monitoring and leading to failure of the stormwater infrastructures
    themselves (Thomas et al. 2016; Wong & Kerkez 2016; Al-Rubaei et al. 2017). Facing
    the above-mentioned drawbacks of insufficient monitoring, thanks to the development
    of open-source hardware, wireless communication technology and sensors in the
    last few years, a promising paradigm for soil, air and water monitoring appeared
    and a large number of papers have emerged in this area (Montserrat et al. 2013;
    Gaddam et al. 2014; Rai et al. 2017; Morawska et al. 2018; Valente et al. 2020).
    In this paradigm, high-resolution spatiotemporal and relatively reliable data
    are collected by using a ubiquitous network of low-cost sensors. The potential
    benefits of applying such a paradigm for stormwater monitoring are (i) supplementing
    conventional stormwater monitoring; (ii) enhancing the capacity of urban flood
    warning; (iii) improving the ability of water contamination detection; (iv) accumulating
    a wealth of new knowledge on stormwater and stormwater infrastructure management
    and maintenance; (v) provide the means for real-time control of infrastructure;
    and (vi) making the most of the Big Data approach to discover new beneficial information.
    Therefore, this paradigm attracts urban hydrologists like the authors of this
    review to devote themselves to this attractive but unfamiliar area to build their
    own monitoring network to support research. Indeed, as urban stormwater management
    rapidly evolves worldwide toward numerous decentralized source control facilities,
    widely disseminated across catchments and cities, there is a growing need for
    monitoring these facilities, to obtain spatially distributed information and data
    about their functioning. With traditional reliable and well-known but expensive
    sensors and monitoring systems, only a few of these facilities can be monitored.
    This is why it is worth evaluating the potential of massively using low-cost sensors
    to monitor these numerous decentralized stormwater facilities, with particular
    attention to their levels of reliability, accuracy, and uncertainty, along with
    adapted specifications. An example of the applicability of the crowd-sourcing
    approach to urban rainfall monitoring with low-cost sensors used by citizens has
    shown that it could, under some conditions, overperform for rainfall runoff modeling
    compared to a sparse traditional rain gauge network (Yang & Ng 2017). This review
    is linked to the collaborative project Cheap''Eau, funded by the French Rhône-Méditerranée-Corse
    water agency (http://graie.org/othu/progr_cheapeau.htm, visited on 28 Feb. 2023.).
    Cheap''Eau aims to evaluate if and how low-cost sensors can be used by researchers
    and practitioners for stormwater monitoring. In addition to this review, various
    low-costs sensors are presently tested for monitoring stormwater facilities like
    green roofs, detention tanks, and trenches (Cherqui et al. 2020). Results and
    conclusions of the on-going Cheap''Eau project will be published separately. Three
    technical parts can be distinguished in this emerging paradigm: open-source hardware,
    communication protocols and low-cost sensors. Open-source hardware and communication
    protocols are relatively reliable and there are a few commonly used solutions.
    These solutions have been in development for several years and are designed, developed,
    promoted, and guaranteed by professional companies such as, e.g., Arduino and
    Raspberry Pi. On the contrary, low-cost sensors are a more complex part. Most
    of them were originally designed for teaching purposes, small parts for other
    goods or for do-it-yourself (DIY) use by electronics enthusiasts. Their reliability
    is questioned (Kumar et al. 2015). As a trade-off of price, some of them do not
    have a clear manufacturing company and brand, and do not provide end-users with
    (detailed) datasheets. There is also no universally agreed definition of ‘low-cost’
    sensors. In this context, there have been some high-quality reviews in scientific
    papers about low-cost sensors for monitoring air quality, with recommendations
    to end-users (Rai et al. 2017; Morawska et al. 2018). But the authors of this
    article could not find similar reviews in the field of low-cost sensors for stormwater
    monitoring. This undoubtedly may hinder the large-scale application of low-cost
    sensors in this field. To fill this gap, we review scientific articles about using
    or assessing 12 types of commercially available low-cost sensors for monitoring
    stormwater and related meteorological variables. The method for literature selection
    is presented in the next section. Three categories of low-cost sensors are distinguished:
    (i) meteorological sensors for monitoring air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation,
    and rainfall; (ii) water quantity sensors for monitoring water level, water flow
    and soil moisture; and (iii) water quality sensors for monitoring pH, conductivity,
    turbidity, nitrogen, and phosphorus. In this review, a sensor is identified to
    be low-cost according to two possible criteria: (i) its price is at least 10 times
    lower than equivalent traditional sensors or (ii) it has been reported in the
    literature to be working with open-source hardware to build a low-cost monitoring
    unit. The authors of this article speculate that the main readers of this review
    are stormwater researchers who are aiming to conduct stormwater monitoring projects
    with full control but a limited budget. On the one hand, one may to some extent
    assume they are low-cost sensor hobbyists: the information provided in this review
    is important to design and build their own systems. On the other hand, they are
    researchers who must ensure reliable and robust best practices in stormwater monitoring.
    Performance criteria like trueness, repeatability, and uncertainty, etc. are of
    key importance in their evaluation of low-cost sensors and in their possible use
    of such sensors for data acquisition to support research conclusions. To the best
    knowledge of the authors, this review is the first one on a diversity of low-costs
    sensors that could potentially be used for stormwater monitoring, by gathering
    and summarizing information from various sources. Special attention is devoted
    to the metrological performance criteria of the sensors, for example, trueness,
    repeatability, reproducibility, and uncertainty to provide objective information
    to potential users and clarify the current level of knowledge of such technologies.
    It reveals that such information is frequently missing in the reviewed papers,
    which indicates that further work is necessary to reach the required level of
    maturity and reliability for efficient routine use of such sensors in urban hydrology.
    Low-cost sensors could potentially hold the promise to complete (and not replace)
    both the traditional (e.g., Bertrand-Krajewski et al. 2021; Sambito & Freni 2021)
    and emerging (e.g., Yaroshenko et al. 2020) monitoring systems in the urban drainage
    field. METHODOLOGY Paper selection Listen To make this review paper as comprehensive
    as possible, there are no specific price restrictions when using the term ‘low-cost’.
    We reviewed scientific literature that contains low-cost or related expressions.
    Web of Science and Google Scholar (Martín-Martín et al. 2021) are used to search
    papers in which commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) low-cost sensors are used in sensing
    networks. In the advanced search query builder tool of Web of Science, for example,
    query ‘ALL = ((Low-cost OR cheap OR frugal) AND (sensor OR instrument) AND (off-the-shelf
    OR commercial) AND (sensor network OR sensing network) AND (water flow OR discharge
    OR flow rate))’ is used to search the usage of COTS low-cost water flow sensors.
    The search timespan is from 2012-01-01 to 2022-12-31 (publication date). And then,
    all results are browsed. A paper which indicates the usage of specific COST sensors
    is selected to review. In the advanced search tool of Google Scholar, similar
    queries are used. Google Scholar is also forced to return articles dated between
    2012 and 2022. Papers are sorted by relevance based on full text matching and
    information on journal, author, and citation. The results in the first five pages
    are browsed to select papers to review due to the very high number of references
    (several tens of thousands) returned by Google Scholar. When a specific sensor
    model is detected, Google Scholar is used to search papers that give the performance
    assessment of this specific type of sensor (e.g., search ‘SHT20’, ‘HC-SR04’, ‘SEN0161’).
    Papers are sorted by relevance. The results in the first three pages are browsed
    to select papers to review. Numbers of search results and final selected papers
    are given in Table 1. Table 1 Number of Web of Science and Google Scholar search

    is a lag between the application of sensors in projects and the publication of
    papers. During the review, we found that most low-cost sensor models are sold,
    tested, and used for several years which proves they have a stable design and
    supply. This review also included some abstracts to enhance its timeliness. Sensor
    performance evaluation Listen Even though the evaluation of sensors is dependent
    on application scenarios, contexts, and purposes, the authors of this review believe
    that the greatest challenge is to identify sensors which are not only low-cost,
    but which can generate useful data over an extended period. Like any sensors,
    the performance information of low-cost sensors is collected and classified by
    parameters as shown in Table 2. Table 2 Major performance criteria for the performance
    assessment of low-cost sensors Parameters Description Trueness  Output closeness
    with the reading of the reference measurement at the same place and same time.  Repeatability  Output
    closeness under a set of repeatable conditions of measurement (NF EN 17075 2018).  Reproducibility  Dispersion
    between measurements obtained using different sensors of the same model (Rai et
    al. 2017).  Resolution  Smallest change in a quantity being measured that causes
    a perceptible change in the corresponding indication (JCGM 2012).  Response time  Time
    interval between the instant when a continuous measuring device is subjected to
    an abrupt change in the measurand value and the instant when the readings cross
    the limits of (and remain inside) a band defined by the 90% and the 110% of the
    difference between the initial and final value of the abrupt change (NF EN 17075
    2018).  Sensitivity to environment  Effect of environmental factors (temperature,
    relative humidity and so on) on sensor output (Rai et al. 2017).  Maintenance
    needs  Frequency and hours dedicated to the maintenance of sensors (including
    controls and cleaning).  Longevity  Time of operation before replacement (Kumar
    et al. 2015).  Information from manufacturers and scientific literature of every
    type of sensor is connected as much as possible. Many low-cost sensor''s datasheets
    use the term ‘accuracy’ to describe their sensor''s performance, combining and/or
    likely confusing trueness and repeatability. In the tables of this review, we
    put manufacturers'' accuracy metric into trueness criteria. As in low-cost air
    quality field (e.g., Rai et al. 2017), due to the lack of a standard calibration
    protocol specific for low-cost sensors, studies have used dissimilar calibration
    methods, against a variety of reference instruments, which makes intercomparison
    between them infeasible. Nevertheless, these studies provide valuable information
    about the performance of low-cost sensors under a variety of operating conditions
    (Rai et al. 2017). Some authors used subjective judgment vocabulary such as ‘good’,
    ‘acceptable’, ‘reasonable’, ‘satisfactory’, ‘not severe’ to describe the performance
    of low-cost sensors. We use quotation marks to indicate that this is the judgment
    of the authors of the papers, and not our own opinion. Various performance metrics
    have been cited in this review and their definitions are given and harmonized
    in Table 3 in the order of their appearance. All notations are unified in this
    review, where n is the number of samples, is the reading of low-cost sensors,
    is the reading of reference sensors, and are the average values of and ⁠, and
    are the ranks of and ⁠. When computing dynamic residuals (DR), is the averaged
    linear model output of the given sensor (Araújo et al. 2020). When computing pooled
    relative standard deviation (SD) (sr,p), k, ⁠, m and are the index of the current
    series, number of measurements in series k, the total number of series, and corresponding
    SD of the series, respectively (Adla et al. 2020). Table 3 Performance metrics

    only a very limited number of papers reporting about sensitivity to the environment,
    maintenance needs and longevity of the tested sensors. Consequently, we provide
    this information only when it is available. The review revealed that low-cost
    sensors are frequently poorly documented and described in the literature, with
    many of the criteria listed in Table 2 not provided, or, when provided, given
    without or with insufficient details or references to the protocols and methods
    used. To reflect this finding, we indicate ‘NA’ when information is missing. In
    the same way, the review also shows that the available literature on low-cost
    sensors is not always sufficiently detailed, according to metrology good practice
    requirements, which leads to some difficulties in interpretation. These difficulties
    are discussed further in Section 6. LOW-COST METEOROLOGICAL SENSORS REVIEW Listen
    In this chapter, performance assessments of four low-cost meteorological sensors
    are reviewed: air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and rainfall, which are
    typical components of weather monitoring stations. The reason for measuring air
    humidity, wind speed and solar radiation is that a critical component of the water
    cycle in urban areas and green infrastructures is evapotranspiration, which can
    be estimated by the FAO Penman–Monteith equation using air humidity, radiation,
    and wind speed data (Ndulue & Ranjan 2021). In addition, the optimization of management
    and maintenance of some SCMs such as wet ponds, wetlands, swales, and green roofs
    also depend on these local weather data (Czemiel Berndtsson 2010). Accurate rainfall
    measurements are essential for the effective management of stormwater. Historical
    rainfall records are used extensively in the design of water infrastructure, while
    at finer scales, real-time rainfall measurements are a key component of flood
    forecasting systems. But current methods for measuring precipitation often do
    not provide the spatial resolution or measurement quality required for real-time
    applications (Bartos et al. 2019) despite the progress of rainfall radar measurement
    with high spatial resolution (Vos et al. 2018). Large-scale ubiquitous low-cost
    rain gauge sensor networks hold promise to fill this gap. Air humidity sensors
    Listen There are three basic types of air humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive,
    and thermal. Lorek (2014) tests the capacitive sensor Sensirion SHT75 in low vacuum
    (10–1,000 hpa) and temperature (−70–25 °C) ranges and reports that it works ‘reliably
    and with reproducibly measured values’. Most low-cost humidity sensors mentioned
    in the scientific literature are DHT11 (Adepoju et al. 2020; Hernández et al.
    2020; Hussein et al. 2020; Leonowicz et al. n.d.; Morales-Morales et al. 2020),
    DHT22 (also named AM2302) (Math & Dharwadkar 2017; Azma Zakaria et al. 2018; Morón
    et al. 2018; Arzoumanian et al. 2019; Bankar & Sagat 2020; Institute of Electrical
    & Electronics Engineers & Università di Napoli n.d.; Pereira et al. 2020; Sulzer
    et al. 2022), BME280 (Lee et al. 2020; Tagle et al. 2020; Cowell et al. 2022;
    Radogna et al. 2022), 808H5V5 (SM et al. 2019), SHT20 (Moreno-Rangel et al. 2018;
    Nouman et al. 2019), HTU21D (Farhat et al. 2017), and HIH4000 (Bastos et al. 2020).
    According to manufacturer''s manuals, DHT11 cannot read the full range of relative
    humidity (only 20–90% RH), and 808H5V5 and HIH4000 cannot provide satisfactory
    performance (trueness of 808H5V5 at 25 °C, over the range 30–80% RH is 4% RH,
    trueness of HIH4000 at 25 °C, over the range 0–59% RH is 5% RH and increases to
    ±8% RH over the sub-range 60–100% RH). HTU21D is observed presenting significantly
    biased data (Araújo et al. 2020). We thus do not discuss them further. The sensors
    we consider the most promising ones (low cost, full humidity range, best accuracy)
    are presented in Table 4 including their main technical specifications. About
    the performance assessments of SHT20, DHT22, and BME280, Table 5 gives a summary
    based on manufacturers’ data and tests in scientific studies. Table 4 Specifications

    al. (2018) test five SHT20 used in Fooboot FBT0002100 air quality monitor compared
    to a validated instrument from GrayWolf and show 2 days of data. bSmith (2018,
    2017) tests six DHT22 and nine BME280 with reference to saturated solutions and
    distilled water. cAraújo et al. (2020) test three AM2302 and three BME280 inside
    a controlled climatic chamber (Aralab© Fitoclima®) with reference to Lascar Electronics
    EL-USB-2. dTagle et al. (2020) compare the output of three BME280 with three regulatory
    air quality monitoring stations (HMP 35A, Vaisala) in three sites. For each parameter,
    the source of the information is given in the superscript and when available,
    criteria are given (associated formulae can be found in Table 2). NA stands for
    not available. Moreno-Rangel et al. (2018) report that for SHT20 deviations are
    from −0.78 to 1.08% RH and the average deviation is −0.01% RH, Spearman''s rank-order
    correlation (rs) are from 0.935 to 0.948, p-value < 0.001. About its reproducibility,
    deviations are from −1.86 to 0.75% RH and the average deviation is 0.52% RH, rs
    are from 0.985 to 0.991, p-value < 0.001. They conclude that SHT20 inside air
    quality monitoring has ‘very low variability’ in trueness and ‘very strong uniformity’
    in reproducibility. According to the datasheet, trueness is 3% RH, repeatability
    is ±0.1% RH, the resolution is 0.04% RH and response time is 8 s. About DHT22
    (also named AM2302), Smith (2018, 2017) report that its trueness is expected to
    be around 5%, repeatability in a range 0.5–1% RH and reproducibility is around
    5% RH, response time is about 30 s (30-s delay in response compared to other humidity
    sensors). The authors of this review think this delay may be due to a mistake
    in the Arduino library. Smith also reports that the sensor output shows a dependence
    of up to 8% RH over the temperature range 10–40 °C. We cannot understand this
    statement because relative humidity itself is a quantity related to air temperature.
    About longevity, in this test, two sensors failed after about 1 year and five
    failed after 3 years, with output which may suddenly increase or even saturate.
    Araújo et al. (2020) report that AM2302 showed mean error −4.4 to −4.2% RH at
    30% RH, −4.2 to −2.5% RH at 50% RH and 0.0–1.5 at 80% RH when the temperature
    is 10, 24, and 40 °C, respectively, and SD of mean errors is 2.7% RH. When using
    a linear model to fit AM2302 output p and reference output P, they get with R2
    = 0.992 and dynamic residual is 3.5% RH. They concluded that AM2302 is ‘overestimating
    the relative humidity variations’. In all above situations, the average SD of
    repeatability is less than 0.70% RH. The sensor datasheet claims that trueness
    is 2% RH, repeatability is ±1% RH, the resolution is 0.1% RH and response time
    is 2 s. About BME280, Smith (2018) reports that it performed within specifications.
    Its output values had a dependence of less than 3% RH over the range 10–40 °C.
    Araújo et al. (2020) report that BME280 showed mean error −1.4 to −3.9% RH at
    30% RH, −3.0 to −1.2% RH at 50% RH, and 0.7–2.2 at 80% RH when the temperature
    is 10, 24 and 40 °C, respectively, and SD of mean error is 2.1% RH. When using
    a linear model to fit BME280 output p and reference output P, they get with R2
    = 0.995 and dynamic residual is 2.3% RH. In all above situations, the average
    standard deviation of repeatability is less than 0.60% RH. In the comparison work
    of Tagle et al. (2020), some of their BME280 modules show output saturation (at
    30% RH) and underestimate 100% RH, this indicates its poor reproducibility. The
    sensor datasheet claims that trueness is 3% RH, the resolution is 0.0008% RH and
    response time is 1 s. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends the
    following accuracy performances: 1% at high values of relative humidity (80% or
    more) and 5% at moderate values of relative humidity (Araújo et al. 2020). According
    to available literature, trueness, repeatability, and resolution of SHT20, DHT22,
    and BME280 modules are close to this recommendation. Their resolution and response
    time can meet every minute of monitoring. We do not think they have maintenance
    needs, because it is more convenient to replace them when using separate modules.
    The main problems of these low-cost air humidity sensors are their reproducibility
    (high variability from sensor to sensor) and longevity (output saturation or underestimation).
    Facing these problems, we recommend end-users to purchase them from reliable sources,
    take care of data quality and replace them every year. The sensor housing is another
    key concern. We note that these low-cost sensors are provided with naked circuit
    boards, plastic housings or waterproof probes. What housing is more suitable for
    field use and the effect of the housing on sensor performance are issues that
    need to be investigated. Wind speed sensors Listen Many types of anemometers exist.
    When examining the low-cost anemometers cited in the literature, we found that
    three-cup anemometers are used in many applications due to their simplicity and
    low-cost features. The modules mentioned in the papers are SKU: SEN-08942 (Khattab
    et al. 2016; Prabhakaran & Ravindran 2019; Sarkar et al. 2020), SKU: SEN-15901
    (Flores 2020; Kaewwongsri & Silanon 2020; Fortes et al. 2021), WS-2080 (Tai et
    al. 2017; Domínguez-Brito et al. 2020), and SKU: SEN0170 (Nouman et al. 2019;
    Semenov et al. 2019; Hussein et al. 2020). Based on the information available
    on the internet, SEN-08942, SEN-15901 and WS-2080 are weather station kits. SEN-15901
    is the new version of SEN-08942 and has the same appearance as WS-2080. It seems
    that the difference between SEN-15901 and WS-2080 is that SEN-15091 has only mechanical
    parts and does not contain electronic parts such as a controller and monitor.
    The separate anemometer module used in SEN-15901 is called WH-SP-WS01. SEN0170
    is a separate anemometer module. Specifications of WS-2080, WH-SP-01 and SEN0170
    are presented in Table 6. Table 7 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost
    anemometer modules by manufacturer and tested by scientific studies. Table 6 Specifications

    comparison in real conditions with scientific-grade Thies Clima anemometer model

    fNouman et al. (2019) test performance of SEN0170 compared to a TESTO Air Flow
    Probe 06280143 whose accuracy is ±0.03 m/s. About the anemometer part of WS-2080
    or named WH-SP-WS01, regarding its trueness, in the test of Domínguez-Brito et
    al. (2020), data were collected at 1 Hz, and they applied a centered median filter
    with 30 s threshold to cancel noises in the wind speed data. They report that
    between low-cost sensor and reference, the regression analysis coefficient is
    0.951, but they do not give the function, mean bias error (MBE) is −0.167 m/s
    and mean square error is 0.468 m/s. They consider these results ‘to be a good
    fit’ because that ‘sensors not being mechanically identical and not being situated
    at exactly the same position’. Regarding its longevity, Tai et al. (2017) use
    it in the field for 1 year and do not mention any running problems. According
    to the user manual of WS-2080, the maintenance need is cleaning the connectors
    once every 1–2 years. Unfortunately, user manual of WS-2080 and data sheet of
    WH-SP-WS01 give three resolutions to convert raw signal (close of reed switch)
    to wind speeds (0.04, 0.33, and 0.67 m/s) and Domínguez-Brito et al. (2020) do
    not report the value that they use. About SEN0170, it showed poor trueness (R2
    = 0.3162) as it is not sensitive to wind speed below 0.8 m/s (Nouman et al. 2019).
    According to the datasheet, accuracy is 3%, resolution is 0.1 m/s, and it is recommended
    to work in air humidity range 35–85% RH (no condensation). We do not find assessments
    of other criteria. In general, it seems that the only low-cost anemometer choice
    is WH-SP-WS01. The maintenance need is that the connectors should be cleaned every
    1 or 2 years and users can avoid this if they do not use the original connectors.
    The main problems of WH-SP-WS01 are (i) unknown repeatability and reproducibility
    which is especially critical when using many of them to model a wind field and
    (ii) unknown true resolution to convert the close signal of internal reed switch
    into wind speed: this problem can be solved when comparing it with a reference.
    Solar radiation sensors Listen Broadband solar radiation or global irradiance
    is an electromagnetic spectrum in the wavelength range of 300–3,000 nm (WMO) or
    350–1,500 nm (ISO) (Azouzoute et al. 2019). Pyranometers are designed to measure
    this physical quantity. They are standardized according to the ISO 9060 (International
    Organization for Standardization 2018) standard, which is also adopted by the
    WMO. This standard discriminates three classes: the best is called Class A (old
    name: secondary standard), the second-best Class B (old name: first class), and
    the last one Class C (old name: second class). There are three kinds of pyranometers:
    thermopile pyranometers, silicon photodiode pyranometers and photovoltaics (PV)
    reference cells (Karki et al. 2021). Thermopile pyranometers measure irradiance
    with a spectral response from 280 to 2,800 nm. They usually cost thousands of
    euros, are often considered as Class A standards and are used as reference devices
    to test other types of pyranometers. Silicon photodiode pyranometers usually cost
    hundreds of euros. They are a low-cost and lower-maintenance option compared to
    thermopile pyranometers but can only measure irradiance with a spectral response
    from 300 to 1,100 nm (López Lorente et al. 2020). Recently, an emphasis focused
    on the use of separate photodiodes which cost tens of euros to measure solar radiation
    (Espinosa-Gavira et al. 2018; Tohsing et al. 2019; Salgado et al. 2020). As for
    photovoltaic reference cells, we found that their prices were hundreds of euros
    in 2010 and decreased due to the price decrease of photovoltaic modules. The authors
    of this review believe that there are hundreds of commercially available pyranometers
    on the shelf. There are no need and necessity to list them all out. We present
    four widely used and representative sensors: Apogee CS300 (Schenk et al. 2015;
    Patrignani et al. 2020), ISET (Azouzoute et al. 2019), Si1145 (Burgt 2020; Theisen
    et al. 2020), and ML8511 (Burgt 2020). Their specifications are given in Table
    8. Table 9 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost pyranometers given
    by the manufacturer and tested by scientific studies. Table 8 Specifications of

    and <± 5% (amorphous material). The measurement uncertainty refers to a confidence
    level of 1-alpha = 95%. cSchenk et al. (2015) compare three CS300 with a Kipp
    & Zonen CMP11 thermopile pyranometer that is installed 250 m away and then use
    CS300 in field. dAzouzoute et al. (2019) compare ISET sensor 02581 with a Hukseflux
    thermal sensor SR11 classified as a Class B specification sensor at same site
    and give the results in June and December, respectively. eTheisen et al. (2020)
    compare output counts of Si1145 with LI-COR pyranometer that has an accuracy of
    ±5% from August 2018 to March 2019. fBurgt (2020) calibrate and validate output
    of ML8511 and Si1145 compared with pyranometer Davis Instruments Vantage Pro 2.
    About CS300, regarding its trueness, Schenk et al. (2015) reported that, compared
    to the reference, the mean deviations of three CS300 are 6.2, 9.1, and −10.4 W/m2,
    respectively, and standard deviations are 43.2, 41.4, and 47.1 W/m2, respectively.
    They conclude that CS300 is ‘the most economical solution’ compared to the two
    semiconductor pyranometers they tested. After this test, Schenk et al. (2015)
    use 20 CS300 in the field for more than 1 year and report that CS300 show ‘good
    agreement between the sensors’ when they are not shaded but do not give any metric
    details. The manufacturer of CS300 indicates that it is calibrated against a Kipp
    & Zonen CM21 thermopile pyranometer and has an absolute accuracy of ±5% for daily
    total radiation, its resolution is 0.2 mV per W/m2, its response time is less
    than 1 ms and it needs to be checked and cleaned every month. About the ISET sensor,
    Azouzoute et al. (2019) read its output every 10 s and compare it to the reference
    in time resolution 1min. Regarding trueness, they report that in June, MBE is
    −19.57 W/m2, root mean square error (RMSE) is 45.946 W/m2, normalized root mean
    square error (NRMSE) is 11.292%, t-statistic (TS) is 82.381, SD is 41.569 and
    coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.993. In December, MBE is −2.398 W/m2, RMSE
    is 13.027 W/m2, NRMSE is 3.913%, TS is 30.975, SD is 12.804, and R2 is 0.999.
    They conclude that ‘the reference cells underestimate the plane of array irradiance
    values. This underestimation is much higher in the summer than in the winter,
    which is completely understandable, since the PV cells are highly affected by
    the high-temperature values’, even though the ISET sensor has an integrated Pt100
    temperature sensor to compensate for its output. According to the manufacturer,
    it is professionally calibrated and came with a certificate. It has a relative
    measurement uncertainty of <± 5%, and a resolution of 0.1 mV per W/m2. About light
    sensors Si1145 and ML8511, they are not initially designed to be a pyranometer.
    Theisen et al. (2020) find there is a linear correlation between the downwelling
    global solar radiation measured by the LI-COR pyranometer P and the output counts
    p of Si1145: ⁠. But Si1145 has three outputs: infrared light counts, visible light
    counts, and UV index, and Theisen et al. (2020) do not describe which Si1145 output
    they use. Using this calibration function, they report that from August 2018 to
    March 2019, every month RMSE is from 34.14 to 81.64 W/m2 and the correlation coefficient
    is from 0.96 to 0.99. Burgt (2020) connects ML8511, Si1145 and reference pyranometer
    to a Wemos D1 Mini microcontroller and uses an analog-to-digital converter ADS1115
    to read the output of ML8511 and reference pyranometer. All his measurements are
    taken every 2 s. He reports that the calibration function is where P is the output
    of the reference pyranometer in W/m2. The authors of this review guess that is
    the UV index output of Si1145, is the visible light counts output of Si1145, is
    the infrared light counts output of Si1145 and is the output voltage of ML8511
    but we do not know their units. About this calibration function, the adjusted
    R2 is 0.995, the SD is 23.93, the significance F is 0 and all p-values are below
    0.05. In the 2h validation test on a sunny afternoon, RMSE is 46.37 W/m2, but
    there is a negative ‘offset of about 50 W/m2, when the solar irradiance is at
    a value of about 200–400 W/m2.’ (Burgt 2020). The datasheet of Si1145 indicates
    that its resolution is 100 microlux. When designing a solar radiation sensing
    network, there are two main choices. One choice is to use commercial pyranometers
    such as CS300 and ISET: they are calibrated by manufacturers and provide reliable
    trueness, repeatability, reproducibility, resolution, response time and longevity
    (Schenk et al. 2015; Azouzoute et al. 2019). Another choice is to use cheaper
    light sensors such as Si1145 and ML8511. In that case, users need to calibrate
    and house them (Burgt 2020; Theisen et al. 2020). If funds allow, it is highly
    recommended to use a Class A thermopile pyranometer as a reference. WMO standard
    specifies a resolution of 5 W/m2 and uncertainty of 8% hourly totals (5% daily
    totals for Class B pyranometers). According to the authors of this review experience,
    the output of CS300, ISET, and ML8511 is a voltage signal and the analog-to-digital
    conversion module of Arduino is not accurate enough, it is thus necessary to use
    an additional analog-to-digital converter such as an ADS1115. All pyranometers
    are recommended to be checked and cleaned every month. Rainfall sensors Listen
    In stormwater management, accurate and timely rainfall monitoring is a prerequisite.
    Rain gauges are the key standard equipment for monitoring rainfall. A variety
    of rain gauges exist. To compare rain gauges based on different measuring principles,
    the WMO organized field intercomparison from October 2007 to April 2009 in Vigna
    di Valle, Rome (Italy) involving 30 different types of rain gauges. Results indicate
    that synchronized tipping-bucket rain gauges (TBRG), using internal correction
    algorithms, and weighing gauges (WG) with improved dynamic stability and short
    step response are the most accurate gauges for 1-min rainfall intensity measurements,
    providing the lowest measurement uncertainty with respect to the assumed working
    reference (Lanza & Vuerich 2009). But this report does not mention any gauge model
    or any manufacturer. We identified four low-cost rainfall sensors mentioned in
    the scientific literature: droplet detector YL-83 (Rivas-Sánchez et al. 2019;
    Islam et al. 2021), tipping-bucket rain gauge WH-SP-RG (Abeledo et al. 2016; Chan
    et al. 2021), optical rainfall detector RG-11 (Bartos et al. 2018) with no guaranteed
    accuracy to measure rainfall intensity, and Pluvimate drop-counting rain gauge
    (Michelon et al. 2020). According to information available on the internet, WH-SP-RG
    is part of the weather station kit SEN-15901 or WS-2080. RG-11''s manufacturer
    also provides a new version named RG-15 with guaranteed accuracy. Their specifications
    are given in Table 10. Table 10 Specifications of low-cost rain sensors Model

    V DC on J1 (reverse polarity protected to 50 V), or 3.3 V DC through pin 8 on
    J2. According to the datasheet from VASALA, YL-83 capacitive sensor has a housing
    which makes it waterproof. But only its bare circuit boards can be retrieved and
    purchased online. Although some applications have been reported (Rivas-Sánchez
    et al. 2019; Islam et al. 2021; Wisudawan 2021), papers do not mention any evaluation.
    Rivas-Sánchez et al. (2019) calibrate YL-83 with the value (ON/OFF) to detect
    if there is rainfall or not and they show the output voltage change of YL-83 during
    a rainfall event. But they do not describe the method of calibration and the correspondence
    of the output of YL-83 to the rainfall intensity. Dias (2019) reports that YL-83
    is oxidated after the first occurrence of rain. Probably because RG-15 appeared
    more recently on the market, there is no scientific literature reporting the application
    of RG-15. RG-15 and RG-11 appear very similar and there are some scientific papers
    about RG-11. Table 11 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost rain
    gauges given by the manufacturer and tested by scientific studies. Table 11 A

    the original text is ‘Each 0.3 mm of rain causes one momentary contact closure’
    in English. eIn the website of RG-15, ‘Depending on option selected’ written by
    manufacturer. fColoch Tahuico (2021) checks the resolution of WH-SP-RG by pouring
    a known volume of water inside it and then counting the tips. gTai et al. (2017)
    use WS-2080 at northern Lake Tahoe. hSteele et al. (2014) compare RG-11 with manual
    rain gauge (typically are cylindrical and totalize the rainfall accumulated between
    visits to the field site). iMoore et al. (2020) use RG-11 in Zadko Obervatory.
    jBenoit et al. (2018) evaluate the performance of eight Pluvimates. kMichelon
    et al. (2020) claim that Pluvimate is a low-cost sensor, and they use 12 Pluvimates
    in the Swiss Alps for 3 months. WH-SP-RG appears as part of weather station kits
    WS-2080. Coloch Tahuico (2021) increases its collector area from 55 to 314 cm2
    (calculated from the design drawing, he describes it in the text as 1,000 cm2,
    which may be a mistake). And then he pours 1.6–1,000 mL water and the sensor output
    1–434 tips. he concludes that sensor resolution is 2.5 ± 0.08 mL/tip (R2 = 0.98).
    The authors of this review do not think this a correct dynamic calibration method
    because pouring much water into the tipping-bucket rain gauge means always simulating
    an unrealistic heavy rainfall and it seems that a curve function is much more
    suitable in his calibration chart. Coloch Tahuico (2021) does not mention any
    in field test results. Tai et al. (2017) use WS-2080 at northern Lake Tahoe for
    1 year and did not mention any running problems. According to the user manual
    of WS-2080, WH-SP-RG has an accuracy of 10% and a resolution of 0.254 mm, but
    according to the datasheet of WH-SP-RG, its resolution is 0.2794 or 0.3 mm/tip
    in different languages. About RG-15, its appearance is very similar to RG-11.
    Steele et al. (2014) report that the average absolute percent deviation of RG-11
    from a manual rain gauge is 86.9% and linear regression produces an R2 of 0.75.
    They find that RG-11 tended to overestimate large rainfall events and underestimate
    smaller rainfall events. Moore et al. (2020) used RG-11 for 1 year in the field
    to detect rainfall events without error which is a reference to the longevity
    of RG-15. The manufacturer indicates that its accuracy is ±10% but field accuracy
    will vary. It has a resolution of 0.2 or 0.02 mm depending on the selected option,
    and its maintenance need is only replacing the lens after 7–10 years. About the
    Pluvimate sensor, Benoit et al. (2018) report that after bias correction for rainfall
    intensities 5–20 mm/h, the measurement uncertainties of seven Pluvimates sensors
    are less than 5% and one was slightly exceeding this value. For its reproducibility,
    they pass a known amount of water through the funnel and compare the recorded
    water depth to the known input (i.e., static calibration). The measured bias of
    eight sensors ranges from 2.8 to 23% with a mean bias of 13.9%. Michelon et al.
    (2020) do a dynamic calibration of a Pluvimate and report that the calibration
    curve is ⁠, R2 = 0.998, where P is the generated rainfall intensity and p is the
    measured rainfall intensity in mm/h, which means that the measuring uncertainty
    is below 5% for 0 to 20 mm/h generated rainfall intensity and reach −10% of error
    at 60 mm/h and −15% at 150 mm/h. They used it in the field for 3 months. The manufacturer
    indicates a resolution of 0.010 mm and maintenance needs include checking its
    filter and drain hole. In general, rain gauges WH-SP-RG and RG-15 deserve further
    tests. The drawbacks of WH-SP-RG are (i) a small collection area (only 55 cm2),
    and (ii) in case of heavy rainfall events, water tends to splash because it has
    no visible cone or funnel (Coloch Tahuico 2021). So WH-SP-RG needs to be adapted
    or transformed to be used in the field. The resolution of WH-SP-RG needs more
    investigation. It needs to check and clean every month to avoid drain hole blockage.
    For the optical rain gauge RG-15, the point is to test whether it can really deliver
    the performance claimed by the manufacturer. We think that it is better to check
    and clean the surface of RG-15 every month like pyranometers. LOW-COST WATER QUANTITY
    SENSORS REVIEW Listen In this chapter, three water quantity parameters are selected
    for review: water level, flow, and soil moisture. Water level sensors Listen Water
    level is one of the most important parameters when monitoring stormwater. The
    correct and timely monitoring of this quantity is also related to the ability
    to achieve good urban stormwater management. There are many types of water level
    measurement devices such as float systems, pressure-measuring devices, capacitive
    devices, ultrasonic devices, radar devices, and radiation devices (Morris & Langari
    2016). When narrowing the range to low-cost sensors. according to available comparisons
    and wireless system design, two types of water level sensors are commonly used:
    non-contact ultrasonic sensors and contact pressure sensors. There are many kinds
    of ultrasonic and pressure sensors reported in the literature. We only focus on
    representative and validated sensors. Five sensors are selected: HC-SR04 (Intharasombat
    & Khoenkaw 2015; Shrenika et al. 2017; Sumitra et al. 2017; Nasution et al. 2018),
    JSN-SR04T (Andang et al. 2019; Cherqui et al. 2020; Dswilan et al. 2021), MS5803-01BA
    (Cherqui et al. 2020; Kombo et al. 2021; Shi et al. 2021), Kingspan Watchman Anywhere
    Pro (Zhang et al. 2019), and TL231 (or named TL-231, TL136, ASL-MP-2F) which has
    not been investigated in scientific papers. Their user manuals specifications
    are listed in Table 12. In addition, we noted that JSN-SR04T has different versions.
    In some papers, it may be the original version while the version indicated in
    Table 12 is version 2.0 with higher specifications. Kingspan Watchman Anywhere
    Pro is a complete off-the-shelf solution with an ultrasonic transducer, control
    board, communication module, battery and housing. Table 13 gives a summary of
    the performance of the low-cost water level sensors given by the manufacturer
    and tested by scientific studies. Table 12 Specifications of low-cost water level

    test HC-SR04 comparing to manual measurement in a distance to water surface in
    the range 0.8–1.3 m. cAndang et al. (2019) test JSN-SR04T by measuring the water
    level of a river compared with the manual distance measurement results. dCherqui
    et al. (2020) test the performance of JSN-SR04T and MS5803-01BA in laboratory
    in a water level range 0–2 m using an automatic system they developed with a reference
    sensor OTT PLS pressure transducer that has an accuracy ≤± 2 mm. eZhang et al.
    (2019) compare the output of four Kingspan Watchman Anywhere Pro with nearby hydrometric
    station for one month and use nine along the River Dodder. fShi et al. (2021)
    test MS5803-01BA in laboratory for 2 months and in field (pipe) for 1 year comparing
    with a Hach probe. About HC-SR04, Sumitra et al. (2017) report that its mean error
    is 0.97% but they only record data in centimeters and do not describe the calculation
    details of water level from echo time. Nasution et al. (2018) do a laboratory
    test and report that the average accuracy is 96.6% (they define accuracy as measurement
    value/reference value) but in their test, the measurement value is always lower
    than the true value, we think there may be a systematic error that is not corrected,
    and they also do not describe the calculation details. About JSN-SR04T, Andang
    et al. (2019) use where D is the distance in meter and T is the echo time in seconds
    and they assume that sound speed is always 340 m/s. They report that the errors
    between JSN-SR04T and reference are always less than 5 cm in a range 0–200 cm
    and that the error rate is 0.74%. Cherqui et al. (2020) report that its distance
    measure range is 0.225 to1.9 m, and expected accuracy can be less than 10 mm when
    adjusting the speed of sound for the correct temperature and humidity (error can
    increase up to 130 mm with a 40 °C difference and increase to 23 mm with a 100%
    relative humidity difference), its repeatability is 7 mm and it should be installed
    far from obstacles because it has a wide beam (70 degrees). During the laboratory
    experiment, JSN-SR04T recorded a total of more than 300,000 values without fault
    or drift. The maximum measurement time is 250 ms (includes the measurement itself,
    processing of the measure by the microcontroller and transfer to the computer
    to be stored via serial). They believe that the ultrasonic sensor needs very little
    maintenance because it is not in contact with water so that it will be not fouled
    by sediment, debris or algal growth. According to the datasheet of JSN-SR04T,
    its resolution is 1 mm. About Kingspan Watchman Anywhere Pro, Zhang et al. (2019)
    report that during their four units in field comparison in a water level in the
    range 0–1.2 m, Spearman''s rank correlations between Kingspan sensor and reference
    outputs are 0.9907, 0.9893, 0.9736, 0.9786, respectively, and mean absolute errors
    are 0.92, 0.76, 1.12, 0.74 mm, respectively. They conclude that ‘the low-cost
    remote sensor measurements are very close to the reference Dublin City Council
    (DCC) stations.’ But the authors of this review found that in their comparison
    chart of the unit which has a mean absolute error 0.74 mm, at many reference water
    levels, the Kingspan sensor''s output has a deviation of around 50 mm. Zhang et
    al. (2019) also report that throughout the duration the deployment in the field
    for more than 2 years with sample rates of 15 min, there is no field maintenance
    need, but one sensor is influenced by spider nests and two sensors are destroyed
    by somebody. About the liquid pressure sensor MS5803-01BA, Cherqui et al. (2020)
    report that it includes temperature compensation, but that there is a need to
    use a second sensor to measure atmospheric pressure to calculate the relative
    pressure. They report that for two MS5803-01BA sensors (one under water and one
    above water), trueness is ±5 mm and repeatability is 3 mm when measuring water
    levels ranging from 0 to 1.9 m. During their test, like JSN-SR04T, MS5803-01BA
    can also output more than 300,000 measurements without fault or drift and the
    maximum measurement time is 150 ms. Shi et al. (2021) also use two MS5803-01BA
    to measure water level. They report that MS5803-01BA drifts clearly in water and
    they think this is because of water uptakes in the layer of white gel protection
    in the sensor. Facing this drawback, Shi et al. (2021) report that during manual
    recalibration, for three test sensors, absolute errors can decrease from −20.6
    to 34.4 mm to −8.4 to 2.3 mm in the laboratory. In their field test, they install
    the reference sensor 76 mm higher than the low-cost sensor because that reference
    sensor is impacted by sediment loads and the low-cost sensor is not, but do not
    explain why. With automated recalibration every 14 days, absolute errors decrease
    from −18.1 to 110.8 mm to −36.7 to 33.8 mm. They find that even without calibration,
    MS5803-01BA can still ‘adequately detect the water level trend’ (almost the same
    results as the reference with R2 ∼ 1). They also report that two MS5803-01BA have
    0.72 mbar difference in air which is an indicator of reproducibility. According
    to the datasheet, trueness is about 25 mm and resolution is about 0.12–0.65 mm.
    Complete solutions like Kingspan Watchman Anywhere Pro with reasonable price allows
    for rapid deployment. In this way, end-users can focus on data collection and
    processing. For ubiquitous sensor networks, non-contact ultrasonic sensors HC-SR04
    and JSN-SR04T installed above water have almost no maintenance needs except spider
    nest interference and man-made damage. But sensor outputs will be noisy in case
    of events. It is important to correct sound velocity by air temperature (correction
    for humidity is not really necessary). HC-SR04 is not waterproof, which means
    additional development work is required. JSN-SR04 is waterproof but its maximum
    accurate measurement range is only 2 m. Contact pressure sensors installed under
    water can avoid human damage and situations where the water level cannot be monitored
    from above (e.g., presence of vegetation). However, Shi et al. (2021) report that
    MS5803-01BA experiences a drift issue in water due to water absorption of the
    sensor''s white protective layer so that MS5803-01BA needs to be re-calibrated
    at least every 2 weeks to achieve ‘accuracy’ ±10 mm. TL231 is a sensor worth testing.
    Although slightly expensive, it provides waterproof metal housing and possible
    manufacturer calibration. Water flow sensors Listen Water flow monitoring is crucial
    for hydrological monitoring. In this review, water flow (discharge) sensors are
    sensors that can measure the velocity of water in a river, a stream, or a sewer.
    Low-cost flow sensors currently off-the-shelf are relatively scarce. The most
    frequent type of sensors are Doppler velocity radars. We identified two representative
    works. Alimenti et al. (2020) propose a prototype of a low-cost continuous wave
    (CW) Doppler radar sensor, able to monitor the surface flow velocity of rivers.
    Their field results show a residual velocity SD of 0.07 m/s compared to a commercial
    handheld radar sensor Decatur SVR. There are some 24 GHz radar modules off-the-shelf
    such as CDM324 (or named IPM165), SEN0306 (SKU, from DFRobot), and 10 GHz module
    HB100. We cannot find papers describing in detail the usage of these sensors for
    water flow monitoring. Fulton et al. (2020) use a Doppler velocity radar QCam
    to measure surface velocities and river discharge. Compared to conventional stream
    gauging methods, percent differences were 0.3, 2.5, −10.4, 7.3, and −18.8% in
    five flights. They thought QCam was relatively inexpensive (compared to traditional
    radar sensors) but still cost about 6,000 €. In addition, some papers reported
    the use of the low-cost flow sensor YF-S201 (or other similar models such as G1/2),
    initially designed for pipelines, to measure flow rate in open channels or natural
    watercourses (Jegadeesan & Dhamodaran 2018; Koshoeva et al. 2021; Yuniarti et
    al. 2021). However, these papers are poorly informative for our review. The specifications
    of YF-S201 are given in Table 14. Table 14 Specifications of YF-S201 low-cost

    μs. 450 pulses per litre. In general, water flow monitoring does not have low-cost
    solutions. Image-based methods (e.g., Sanyal et al. 2014; Patalano et al. 2017;
    Giordan et al. 2018; Koutalakis et al. 2019; Zhu & Lipeme Kouyi 2019) may be low-cost
    in the future thanks to advances in electronics and artificial intelligence technology.
    It seems unrealistic to send all the images to a centralized service for processing:
    images need to be processed locally. Flow rate information can then be sent to
    a server by means of a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) and checked photographs
    can be sent only in case of high flow rates. There are some sensors off-the-shelf
    based on Doppler velocity radar, but they are still too expensive to be used on
    a large scale (Fulton et al. 2020). Given this situation, it may be feasible to
    develop a water flow velocity measurement system using commercially available
    Doppler radar modules such as CDM324 and SKU: SEN0306 which cost about 50€. But
    we cannot estimate the workload required to have a fully operational equipment.
    An alternative option is using a pipeline water flow sensor like YF-S201 to develop
    an immersed water flow monitoring system. However, we do not find high-quality
    literature about this solution. Another interesting work is focusing on the presence
    or absence of water flow. Moody & Martin (2015) use resistor type instruments
    to develop overland flow detectors (OFDs). Hinrich Kaplan et al. (2019) use time-lapse
    imagery, electric conductivity (EC), and stage measurements to check the presence
    of streamflow. Chamber et al. (2020) use EC sensors (soil moisture sensors in
    fact) to develop their autonomous OFD. Assendelft & Ilja van Meerveld (2019) chose
    electrical resistance (ER) sensors, temperature sensors, float switch sensors,
    and flow sensors like YF-S201 to monitor temporary streams. They define the percentage
    of correct state data (the percentage of the state data derived from the sensor
    data that corresponded to the state data derived from time-lapse photographs)
    and the percentage of correctly timed state changes (the percentage of the state
    changes derived from the sensor data that corresponded in timing with the state
    changes derived from time-lapse photographs) to assess the performance of sensors.
    They conclude that ER sensors (99.9% correct state data and 90.9% correctly timed
    state changes) and flow sensors (99.9% correct state data and 90.5% correctly
    timed state changes) perform best. EC and ER sensors are presented in the next
    section dedicated to soil moisture sensors. Soil moisture sensors Listen As mentioned
    just above, soil moisture sensors can work as OFD. Of course, the objectives of
    soil moisture monitoring are more numerous: large-scale soil moisture sensing
    networks can provide information about rainfall, runoff, water cycle and ecosystems
    (Robinson et al. 2008). Due to the important use of soil moisture sensors in agriculture,
    there is a large number of off-the-shelf sensors now and some are very cheap.
    In the field of science, the most frequent expression of soil moisture is volumetric
    water content (VWC) whose definition is volumetric soil content (%) = [volume
    of water (cm3)/volume of soil (cm3)] × 100. There are several methods to measure
    VWC, e.g., gravimetry, time domain reflectometry (TDR), and time domain transmission
    (TDT). Two methods are usually low-cost (less than €100 approximately): ER and
    capacitance methods (Adla et al. 2020). Resistive soil moisture sensors, which
    are extremely cheap, have been reported as inaccurate. Saleh et al. (2016) report
    that resistive soil moisture sensor EC-5 show an average percent error rate above
    10% and is corroded after 1 month of use, which is a serious problem for continuous
    monitoring. Adla et al. (2020) tested resistive soil moisture sensors YL69 and
    YL100 with reference to a secondary standard sensor Delta-T ThetaProbe ML3 and
    concluded YL69 and YL100 are also not accurate (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of YL69 were
    4.13, 5.54, and 0.41; MAE, RMSE, and RAE of YL100 were 3.51, 5.21, and 0.37, respectively)
    and they cannot work as standalone sensors. As for capacitive soil moisture sensors,
    Adla et al. (2020) recommended SM100. There are also SKU: SEN0193 (DFRobot, Shanghai,
    China) (Akhter et al. 2018; Nagahage et al. 2019; Placidi et al. 2020, 2021; López
    et al. 2022) and 10HS (Mittelbach et al. 2011; Panjabi et al. 2018), and a low-cost
    TDR sensor VH400 (Bitella et al. 2014; Tebbs et al. 2019) which are reported.
    It is also worth mentioning the Chameleon sensor was developed and commercialized
    by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) for
    agriculture in low-income countries (Mdemu et al. 2020). Specifications of all
    the above sensors are given in Table 15. Table 15 Specifications of low-cost soil

    to moisture content. eMeasuring soil water suction: Blue 0–20 kPa (wet), Green
    20–50 kPa (moist) and Red > 50 kPa (dry). According to the manufacturer, the Chameleon
    sensor measures how hard the roots of plants must suck (the tension required)
    to extract moisture. So that it does not need to be calibrated for different soil
    types. The sensor can provide a quantitative measure (based on resistance measurement)
    but for irrigation applications in agricultural production, a qualitative measurement
    is proposed (it can only report if the soil is wet, moist, or dry). Mdemu et al.
    (2020) reported large increases in yields of green maize by using tools like Chameleon
    sensors and implementing other changes, but they did not assess the performance
    of the Chameleon sensor. Table 16 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost
    soil moisture sensor SEN0189, SM100, 10HS, and VH400 modules given by the manufacturer
    and tested by scientific studies. Table 16 A summary of performance characteristics

    SKU: SEN0193 compared with gravimetric VWC. gAkhter et al. (2018) test SKU: SEN0193
    in two difference sites. hAdla et al. (2020) test five SM100 with reference to
    gravimetric weight and ThetaProbe soil moisture sensor in fluid and four kinds
    of repacked soils. iSalman et al. (2021) compare soil moisture measurements by
    the gravimetric method and SM100 readings in two sites. jPanjabi et al. (2018)
    do a soil-specific calibration for 10HS in laboratory. kBitella et al. (2014)
    test VH400, in laboratory in three kinds of non-saline soils. lPayero et al. (2017)
    test VH400 in four soil texture types (loamy sand, sandy clay, sandy clay loam
    and sandy loam) with the reference of gravimetric VWC and output of VH400 was
    measured by FLUKE 117 electrician multimeter. Nagahage et al. (2019) report four
    SEN0189 sensors to have a significant sensor-to-sensor variability according to
    the analysis of variance (ANOVA). It is not sensitive to high mineral content
    soil. They suggest this is because SEN0189 sensors ‘operate in low frequencies
    and are thereby more sensitive to effects of soil textural variances and salinity’.
    The calibration function of SEN0193 for organic-rich soil is where P is gravimetric
    soil water content and p is mean raw analog-to-digital counts output of two SEN0193
    with R2 = 0.98. After calibration, at a gravimetric water content of 60–80%, the
    RMSE of SEN0189 is 5% VWC. Akhter et al. (2018) reported that after site-specific
    calibration (linear calibration function, R2 > 0.98), in 6 months, the max errors
    are 6.2 and 4.3% and correlation coefficient are 0.76 and 0.73 between reference
    value (oven-dry method) and reading of SEN0189 for two sites, respectively. They
    also use a one-way ANOVA test (Tukey''s multiple range test) to check sensitivity
    to the environment and report that soil temperature and measuring depth had no
    significant effect on the SEN0193 output. But the output of SEN0189 increases
    with an increase of the bulk density (if the bulk density is either higher than
    1.3 g/cm3 or lower than 0.9 g/cm3), resulting in statistically significant differences
    (p-value < 0.05). About SM100, Adla et al. (2020) report that using the manufacturer
    calibration equation, the average Spearman''s rank correlation coefficient (rs)
    between sensor readings and the actual VWC is 0.94. The average comparison of
    the precision performance of SM100 is 0.41%. Using a piecewise linear equations
    calibration function (R2 = 0.94), MAE = 1.67%, RMSE = 2.36%, RAE = 0.21. It follows
    an expected positive temperature effect (at the actual VWC values of 7.63 and
    18.38%, respectively, an increase of 30 °C resulted in an increase of estimated
    VWC by 7 and 2.99%) and is not sensitive to changes in salinity (R2 = 0.85). Salman
    et al. (2021) report that after site-specific calibration at one site, the RMSE
    values for SM100 changed from 2.68% before calibration to 0.91%. At another site,
    the RMSE values changed from 3.09 to 1.03%. According to datasheet, resolution
    is 0.1% VWC. Panjabi et al. (2018) report that their calibration function of 10HS
    is with R2 of 0.9299, where P is the soil moisture content in % by volume, p is
    the 10HS reading in mV. They use it in the field for about 2 years, but do not
    discuss data validation. According to datasheet, resolution is 0.08% VWC and the
    response time is 400 ms. About VH400, Bitella et al. (2014) report that for all
    soil texture types, three parameters logistic model fits data (VH400 output and
    VWC getting from gravimetric water content) ‘very well’ (R2 = 0.89), training
    RMSE = 2.63, validation RMSE = 2.61, and NRMSE = 0.09 in cross-validation (leave-one-out
    method). They also test its sensitivity to the environment, report that its output
    increases by 70 mV between 3 and 50 °C and that it is sensitive to small changes
    in water content but without details. Payero et al. (2017) report that VH400 responds
    linearly to changes in VWC for four soil types (R2 > 0.90). An analysis of co-variance
    (ANCOVA) shows that soil texture has a highly significant effect (p < 0.001) on
    the output of VH400. In general, resistive type soil moisture sensors are reported
    as inaccurate and easy to be corroded by water. Capacitive sensor SKU: SEN0193
    is very cheap but shows significant sensor-to-sensor variability. There is also
    a soil moisture development board named HiGrow including SKU: SEN0193, microcontroller,
    and DHT11 on the same board, which is reported of very poor quality (Flashgamer
    2019). Low-cost capacitive sensor SM100, 10HS and TDR sensor VH400 are worth trying.
    It is absolutely required to conduct a site-specific calibration before deploying
    these sensors because soil moisture sensors are impacted by many environment quantities
    such as soil texture, bulk density, temperature and salinity. Another worth trying
    sensor is Chameleon which claims no need to be calibrated thanks to its measurement
    principle. LOW-COST WATER QUALITY SENSORS REVIEW Listen As all sensors cannot
    be reviewed here, five water quality parameters are selected for review: pH, conductivity,
    turbidity, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Among the numerous water quality parameters,
    we chose these five ones considering the technology development and the needs
    related to stormwater monitoring. We note that producers and sellers of water
    quality sensors usually categorize their products into two types: laboratorial
    usage and industrial usage. We cannot find any unambiguous definition of this
    categorization. Usually, laboratory usage requires sensors with high quality and
    accuracy, operated under strictly controlled conditions. Industrial usage requires
    monitoring in a more demanding environment (temperature, pressure, electromagnetic
    compatibility, resistance to shocks, and lightning shield) and robust sensors
    which deliver data continuously over weeks, months and years with online transmission
    to a control room. Industrial usage is closer to what is expected in the field
    of in situ stormwater monitoring. In addition, we find low-cost water turbidity
    sensors which are originally used in household appliances such as washing machines
    and dishwashers. Therefore, in this chapter, we propose three categories: laboratory,
    industry and household appliances. pH sensors Listen There is an extensive literature
    (e.g., Zhou et al. 2017; Qin et al. 2018; Alam et al. 2020) describing the development
    of low-cost pH meters based on optical fiber, metal oxides, and micro-electro-mechanical
    system (MEMS) techniques. Their works are, however, only in the laboratory development
    stage and not related to low-cost commercial products yet available on the market.
    Commonly used pH sensors in low-cost water quality monitoring systems are SKU:SEN0161
    and SKU:SEN0169 from DFRobot (Harun et al. 2018; Saha et al. 2018; Nasution et
    al. 2020; Ilyas et al. 2021; Kelechi et al. 2021), pH sensor from Atlas Scientific
    (Faustine et al. 2014; Faustine & Mvuma 2014; Zakaria & Michael 2017; Bartos et
    al. 2018; Demetillo et al. 2019; Shamsi et al. 2020), pH sensor from Phidgets
    (Rao et al. 2013; Nazer et al. 2018), and pH sensor from SensoreX (Lambrou et
    al. 2014; Al Haji & Al Odwani 2015; Sun et al. 2016). Some papers only state the
    brand but no model. Common models in reviewed papers are ENV-40-pH from Atlas
    Scientific (Faustine et al. 2014; Faustine & Mvuma 2014; Zakaria & Michael 2017).
    Alumno et al. (2021); Baéz Rodríguez & Rodríguez Jarquin (2019) use PC2121-5M
    from Phidgets. Specifications of the above models are given in Table 17. Table
    18 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost water PH sensor modules

    (2020) use the function P = (7-output)/59.16 where P is the pH value and output
    is the SEN0161 output in mV. This formula has been first established by Shahrulakram
    & Johari (2016). In Nasution et al. (2020)''s field test, the deviation between
    SEN0161 output and a handheld pH meter is 0.02–0.26 pH at around 8.0 pH. But they
    do not provide calibration details. Yuzhakov et al. (2021) report that its calibration
    function is ⁠, where is the measured voltage in mV, with ⁠. But using this calibration
    function, for a change of 1 pH unit, only a voltage of approximately 0.12–0.13
    mV would be necessary. SEN0161, therefore, seems highly susceptible to electrical
    interferences. A possible explanation could be that Yuzhakov et al. (2021) in
    fact use volt to record SEN01610 output. In addition, the number of digits in
    a and b is too high for measuring pH with an accuracy of ±0.1 pH according to
    the supplier. After calibration, its reading was ‘similar’ to the stationary pH
    meter OHAUS Starter 3100 which had a ±0.01 pH measurement error. Mahardika et
    al. (2021) use ADS1115 to measure its output voltage and report that its calibration
    function is where P is the measured pH and p is the measured voltage in mV. After
    calibration, the error is from 0.02 to 0.12 and the average error is 0.068. Akhir
    (2021) reports that using the manufacturer calibration function, in 3h immersing
    test, the error rate increases from 1.11 to 5.45%. In the 5-day in situ test,
    the outputs pH of SEN0161 are from 7.15 to 11.27. Akhir (2021) indicates that
    ‘SEN0161 can only be effectively performed in the range of pH 6–8 so that the
    sensor is not in optimal working condition’ but does not give any further explanation
    and test results. According to the datasheet, response time is less than 2 min
    and longevity is more than 6 months but depends on the frequency of use. About
    SEN0169, Moyón Rivera & Ordóñez Berrones (2019) report that its absolute error
    is ±0.1 pH, but they do not give the calibration equation. Saputra et al. (2017)
    report that compared to a reference, the average deviation is 0.0766 pH. The maximum
    deviation is 0.16 pH, but their reference sensor has less valid numbers than SEN0169
    and they also do not give a calibration equation of SEN0169. The authors of this
    review think the researchers mentioned above use the manufacturer''s Arduino code
    and calibration equation. According to the datasheet, response time is less than
    1 min, and longevity is more than 6 months with 7 × 24h use but depends on the
    water quality. Demetillo et al. (2019) report that their Atlas Scientific pH sensor
    ENV-40-pH output p shows ‘good’ results compared to the reference sensor output
    ⁠: with R2 = 0.9731. In their test, the maximum difference is 0.60 pH at around
    8 pH. They deploy their WSN system in two creeks for 2 weeks and do not mention
    any operation problems. The datasheet of ENV-40-pH indicates that resolution is
    0.001, response time is 1 s and calibration should be done every year. About the
    PC2121-5M, Baéz Rodríguez & Rodríguez Jarquin (2019) use analog-to-digital converter
    (ADC) of Arduino to read its output and DS18B20 to account for temperature compensation.
    When using buffer solutions of, respectively, pH 8.86 and pH 9.7, the value measured
    were pH 7.00 and 9.2. They think these errors are due to improper calibration
    but do not give any further results. According to the datasheet, trueness is ±0.09
    pH, resolution is 0.018 and response time is less than 10 s. This sensor has many
    usage cautions, and it is recommended to store it in a storage solution. There
    are already some low-cost off-the-shelf pH probes and interface circuits with
    Arduino and other open-source hardware. According to the available literature,
    after calibration, at least all these sensors can indicate the acidity or alkalinity
    of the tested liquid. But most reviewed papers do not report the influence of
    temperature on pH measurement. Further research could focus on the following points:
    (i) the true performance of ready-to-use pH sensors with open-source hardware.
    For example, trueness is reported very differently for different sensors, e.g.,
    0.1 pH for SEN0161 and 0.002 pH for ENV-40-pH, which is meaningless for sensors
    based on the same measuring principle; (ii) can these sensors be suitable for
    submersion measurements in stormwater for months? (iii) can these sensors perform
    at the expected performance with as little maintenance as possible? It is worth
    mentioning that there are some on-going projects on the subject such as the Setier
    project (Prost-Boucle et al. 2022). Conductivity sensors Listen Measuring the
    EC of water can indirectly provide information on the water quality condition
    or identify a specific water source (rainwater or groundwater for example) in
    relation to the increase or decrease of conductivity. In addition, total dissolved
    solids (TDS) concentration has an approximately proportional relationship with
    water conductivity (Rusydi 2018). Commonly used low-cost conductivity sensors
    are SKU: DFR0300 from DFRobot (Nazer et al. 2018; Saha et al. 2018; Alimorong
    et al. 2020), and conductivity sensor from Atlas Scientific (Faustine et al. 2014;
    Lockridge et al. 2016; Siyang & Kerdcharoen 2016; Bartos et al. 2018; Shamsi et
    al. 2020; Othaman et al. 2021). A commonly used TDS sensor is SKU: SEN0244 (Ula
    2020; Mahardika et al. 2021). Table 18 A summary of performance characteristics

    Laboratory. jMahardika et al. (2021) calibrate SEN0244 comparing to a TDS meter.
    kUla (2020) compare SEN0244 with TDS meter. About DFR0300, Saputra et al. (2017)
    report that in 27 min of measurement and around 650 ppm, comparing to the reference,
    deviation is from 0 to 6 ppm and average deviation is 2.1 ppm, but they do not
    give calibration details. Rozaq et al. (2020) report that the calibration equation
    of DFR0300 is with where P is the salinity value and p is ADC counters of Arduino
    Due. Using this calibration equation, the error rates are from 5.7 to 17.6% and
    average error rate of DFR0300 was 9.5%. But they do not divide the calibration
    and validation dataset and their reference values are integer and DFR0300 outputs
    are with two decimal places. According to the datasheet, longevity is more than
    6 months but depends on the frequency of use. Othaman et al. (2021) report that
    for ENV-40-EC all the percentage differences between measured EC and manufacturers''
    suggested values are less than 0.02% and EC values are directly proportional to
    temperature (R2 ∼ 1). Lockridge et al. (2016) report that compared to the reference,
    RMSE is 1.35 parts per thousand, approximately 10% of the observed salinity range
    and outputs of ENV-40-EC-K1.0 and reference are ‘highly correlated’ (R2 = 0.96).
    They think this deviation is a slight offset/bias that is likely of a physical
    nature such as the distance between them (0.5 m). They also report that instrument
    biofouling is a significant issue during the summer in the field test, and commonly
    results in sensor drift after 3–4 weeks of deployment. The manufacturer claims
    that trueness is ±2%, response time is 1 s and longevity is 10 years. About SEN0244,
    Mahardika et al. (2021) use ADS1115 to read its output voltage and report that
    its calibration function is where P is the output of the TDS meter and p is the
    output of SEN0244 in mV. After calibration, its error is from 0.18 to 12.9 ppm
    in a range from 400 to 700 ppm and the average error is 4.896 ppm. But they do
    not divide calibration and validation datasets. Ula (2020) reports that at about
    820 ppm, the error rate of SEN0244 is from 2.54 to 0.24% and the average error
    is 1.89%; at about 400 ppm, the error rate is from 5.12 to 8.29% and the average
    error is 6.00%; and at about 170 ppm, error rate is from 0.47 to 7.39% and average
    error is 2.90%. But he does not provide the calibration details. The average error
    rate of the three experimental samples is 3.59%. There are two other interesting
    works we identified: Geetha & Gouthami (2016) used resistive soil moisture YL-69
    to measure water conductivity, but it is doubtful how long this resistance sensor
    can work continuously in water as aforementioned YL-83 and EC-5 are easily oxidated
    (Saleh et al. 2016; Dias 2019). Shi et al. (2021) built a DIY water conductivity
    sensor using two small stainless-steel rods with a simple voltage divider circuit
    (a resistor of 100 Ω and water as another resistor) and calibrate it comparing
    to a HANNA meter (linear calibration function in 0–10 mS/cm with R2 = 0.9871).
    At four sites tested, they claim that their DIY EC sensors have ‘highly linear
    correlation’ with a HANNA meter even though relative uncertainties are from 17.42
    to 31.12%. And they do not give temperature compensation details in test results
    and the longevity of their DIY EC sensor. In general, in situ water conductivity
    measurement appears promising. There are some low-cost sensors off-the-shelf and
    even DIY sensors can give useful water quality information. It is mandatory to
    compensate EC readings with water temperature and DS18B20 is a commonly used waterproof
    temperature sensor. Like water pH sensors, the long-term performance of immersed
    EC sensor is also unstable because of, e.g., biofouling, so a self-clean or self-maintenance
    system is necessary. Turbidity sensors Listen Turbidity is an optical determination
    of water clarity and total suspended solids (TSS) is a total quantity measurement
    of solid material per volume of water. These two parameters are related but not
    in a simple linear relationship. Turbidity is usually reported in nephelometric
    turbidity units (NTU). We found four low-cost optical turbidity sensors in scientific
    papers. They are SKU: SEN0189 from DFRobot (Ammari et al. 2019; Hakim et al. 2019;
    Hendri et al. 2019; Iskandar et al. 2019; Mwemezi 2020; Gusri & Harmadi 2021;
    Kelechi et al. 2021), TSD-10 and TSW-10 from Amphenol (Faisal et al. 2016; Camargo
    2017; Nguyen & Rittmann 2018; Valenzuela et al. 2018), and TS-300B (Yuan et al.
    2018; Angdresey et al. 2021). Specifications of the above models are given in
    Table 21. Table 22 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost turbidimeter

    NTU calculated from weight of sediments in portable water. cGusri & Harmadi (2021)
    compare SEN0189 with Lutron TU-2016 meter. dTrevathan et al. (2020) modify SEN0189
    and only retain its original LED and IR phototransistor. They calibrate the modified
    sensor with Hach turbidimeter (relative error < 0.5%) using Formazin calibration
    samples. And then they deploy the sensors in various water bodies for several
    months. eFaisal et al. (2016) calibrate and compare TSD-10 with a Hach 2100N.
    fAngraini et al. (2016) compare TSD-10 with a turbidimeter and test it in a river.
    gValenzuela et al. (2018) calibrate TSW-10 with a reference T-100. About SEN0189,
    Hakim et al. (2019) report that at 25 °C, the calibration function in the range
    0–1,000 NTU is where P is the turbidity of water in NTU and p is the output voltage
    of SEN0189 in V, with R2 = 0.9762 but they do not validate the relation between
    water NTU and the weight of sediment in the water. Gusri & Harmadi (2021) report
    that at 1 NTU, the error rate of SEN0189 is 31.37%; at 55 NTU, the error rate
    is 6.28%, and other error rates are less than 3.5% from 75 to 228 NTU. The average
    error rate is 7.7% but they do not give details about their calibration function.
    Trevathan et al. (2020) report that the performance of the original LED and IR
    phototransistor of SEN0189 is different so that it should be calibrated one by
    one. About their modified sensor, they believe that it is ‘accurate for all turbidity
    levels’, the actual changes due to temperature are ‘not that significant’ but
    do not give any details data such as calibration function and RMSE. In their 7
    months in field test, they find that their sensor is influenced by ambient IR
    and in some water bodies, the sensor needs to be cleaned regularly because of
    fouling. According to the datasheet, output deviation is less than 10% in low
    temperature, thermal shock, damp heat, and vibration tests, and response time
    is less than 500 ms. Faisal et al. (2016) report that at the range 0–700 NTU,
    the TSD-10 calibration curve is where P is the turbidity of water in NTU and p
    is the output voltage of TSD-10 in V, with R2 = 0.99. After calibration, its average
    measurement error is 6.51% but the measurement error is 24.63% when measuring
    at 37.8 NTU. They think this low sensitivity to low NTU is due to the fact that
    the range 0–4,000 NTU is mapped to over 0–1,023 digital counts and the IR phototransistor
    of TSD-10 is not sensitive enough. Angraini et al. (2016) calibrated TSD-10 in
    the range 169–771 NTU. The calibration equation was where P is the turbidity of
    water in NTU and p is the output voltage in mV, with ⁠. After calibration, the
    average relative error is 9.35%, and the error is large at low NTU (24.77% at
    169 NTU). But they also do not separate calibration and validation datasets. In
    their field test, they find that at a point, sensor output NTU is abnormally lower
    than others and think this is because the light intensity at this point is higher
    than others. About TSW-10, Valenzuela et al. (2018) report that in the range 0–180
    NTU, the calibration equation is ⁠, where P is the turbidity of water in NTU and
    p is the output voltage in V, with ⁠. After calibration, all the relative errors
    in 50 samples are in a range from 2.0 to 5.0% and the average relative error is
    3.86%. Camargo (2017) reported the calibration equation in datasheet is where
    P is the turbidity of water in NTU and p is the output voltage in V. Four sensors
    are originally used in washing machines (and thus already widely used): SKU: SEN0189,
    TSD-10, TSW-10 and TS-300B. Because their principles are the same, and appearances
    are very similar, we can discuss them together. Dedicated case-by-case calibration
    functions (linear to cubic depending on the NTU range of interest) are absolutely
    necessary. The reproducibility appears rather poor, may be due to the difference
    in performance of the LED and IR phototransistors inside them. Their resolution
    depends on the ADC that is used to read their voltage output so that an additional
    analog-to-digital converter such as ADS1115 is necessary. Their response time
    is sufficient for every second of monitoring. They are sensitive to ambient infrared
    light interference and temperature compensation is not mandatory. They should
    be cleaned regularly because of fouling. Their longevity depends on the remodeling
    work because they are not designed for field operation. Nitrogen and phosphorus
    sensors Listen We identified three commercially available technologies to monitor
    nutrients in water: optical (UV) sensors (>15,000 €), wet-chemical sensors (>10,000
    €), and ion-selective electrodes (ISE) (<1,000 €). It seems that only ISE could
    be a choice for ubiquitous low-cost sensor networks. ISE advantages are easy to
    use, fast response, no influence of color or turbidity, and availability for both
    ammonium and nitrate. Disadvantages are low resolution, accuracy and precision,
    ionic interferences, high instrument drift, and limited shelf life (Pellerin et
    al. 2016). Kotamäki et al. (2009) used a s::can spectrometer probe. Wollheim et
    al. (2017) used a submersible ultraviolet nitrate analyzer from SUNA. Jones et
    al. (2020) used Hach Nitratax SC Plus to measure nitrate in water continuously.
    All sensors are optical (UV) sensors which are not low-cost. Wade et al. (2012)
    used Systea Micromac C to determine the total reactive phosphorus (TRP), nitrite
    and ammonium. Yu et al. (2021) used a Sigmatax sampler combined with a Phosphax
    Sigma auto analyzer to measure total phosphorus (TP) and Amtax combined with a
    Filtrax automatic sampler to measure ammonium. The devices mentioned above are
    large cabinets and thus are also not low-cost. It is expensive to use a colorimetric
    method to measure phosphates in water and low-cost microfluidic and electrochemical
    methods to determine phosphorus in water are still in their laboratory development
    phase. Therefore, in terms of nutrient monitoring in water, the only current comparatively
    low-cost option is ISE probes to monitor nitrate or ammonia. Some ISE sensors
    are used: nitrate and ammonia ISE from Vernier (Rossi et al. 2015; Abu-Baker et
    al. 2016), Cooking Hacks (Ramadhan 2020), HYDRA (Menon et al. 2017), and Thermo
    Scientific (El-deen et al. 2018). Specifications of the above models are given
    in Table 23. Table 24 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost nitrogen

    the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) results, but do not give details of
    comparison. According to the datasheet, repeatability is ±10% of reading, but
    depends on calibration. About sensitivity to the environment, the nitrate ion
    probe works in the pH range 2–11, the ammonium ion probe works in pH range 4–7.5,
    both work in the temperature range 0–40 °C and do not have pH and temperature
    compensation. The datasheet does not indicate a working flow rate and we think
    they can only work in stable water, and both interfere with some other ions. About
    the Cooking Hacks nitrate ISE probe, Ramadhan (2020) report that its readings
    are in the range 10.5–11.7 mg/L in laboratory test and this results ‘show good
    agreement with laboratory results’ but did not give any comparison details. The
    system is equipped with a sensor that was ‘functioning correctly’ over 10-day
    in situ tests. According to the datasheet, it works in a pH range of 2–11 and
    a temperature range of 5–50 °C and interferes with many other ions. The manufacturer
    does not mention the water condition when using it. About the HYDRA nitrate or
    ammonium ISE probe, Menon et al. (2017) do not mention any performance assessment.
    The manufacturer claims that trueness is ±3%, response time is 1 min, working
    temperature is 0–50 °C, that it can measure flow velocity from 0.1 to 3.0 m/s,
    and that its longevity is 4–6 months. About the Thermo ammonia ISE probe, El-deen
    et al. (2018) claim that the performance of their own interface circuits is ‘similar’
    to Orion/mV benchtop meter. They use three segments of linear functions to represent
    the relation between the electrode output potential in mV and the logarithm of
    the NH3 concentration, and claim that this curve is ‘similar to direct calibration
    curve mentioned in Thermo Scientific user guide’ but do not give comparison details.
    In their fish tank test, the ammonia probe is output 0 and they think this is
    due to the fact that there is no ammonia in the fish tank. The manufacturer indicates
    that reproducibility is ±2%, samples and standards must be adjusted to above pH
    11, and the temperature range is 0–50 °C. In conclusion, there are some low-cost
    ISE probes to determine nitrate and/or ammonia concentrations, but no true low-cost
    option exists now to measure phosphorus in the water. ISE probes are designed
    for specialized equipment, and there is, therefore, need for extra work to combine
    them with open-source hardware such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This undoubtedly
    requires a certain amount of specialized hardware knowledge. It is possible that
    some commercial pH probe adapter boards as discussed in low-cost pH sensor part
    can also work with nitrate ISE probe. DISCUSSION Listen In this review on low-cost
    sensors ready for ubiquitous stormwater sensing networks, we included off-the-shelf
    low-cost sensors referred to by open-source communities and scientific literature
    as systematically as possible. Various low-cost sensors, using different devices
    and methods in different environments, have been tested. There is to date no existing
    literature review dedicated to low-cost stormwater monitoring with a unified metrological
    framework considering numerous parameters and providing feedback from commercially
    available sensors. Performances of off-the-shelf low-cost sensors are summarized
    in six indicators: (i) trueness, (ii) repeatability, (iii) reproducibility, (iv)
    resolution, (v) response time, and (vi) sensitivity to the environment, maintenance
    needs and longevity. Of course, when building a node of a sensing network, according
    to the experience of the authors of this review, there are many other aspects
    that must be considered. For example, the built-in real-time clock of some Arduino
    is easy to drift over time. Most open-source hardware does not have shielding,
    which means that they are easy to be disturbed by external interferences. Power
    efficiency is also essential for outdoor autonomous systems. However, the global
    performance of the sensing node is largely governed by the sensor it uses. The
    present review is nevertheless positive in the sense that several low-cost sensors
    and solutions already exist. Low-cost sensors have been identified to measure
    continuously and in situ several quantities of interest for urban hydrology (research)
    and stormwater management (operation), including meteorology and water quantity.
    There are many low-cost sensors for monitoring air humidity, wind speed, solar
    radiation, rainfall, water level and soil moisture. But many of their performances
    and their uncertainty still need to be better quantified by means of further tests
    and evaluations. Water flow monitoring needs more creative sensor modules and
    system design, but they are not far away from giving relatively reliable results.
    Compared to meteorological and water quantity, water quality monitoring by means
    of low-cost devices is more knowledge intensive, and users clearly need specific
    skills, with adaptation to the water matrix of interest (stormwater in this paper,
    but could be drinking water, and river water). Reviewed papers do not sufficiently
    report repeatable examples with references to metrology literature and methods.
    For example, a comparison between sensors, even a traditional more expensive one
    used as a reference, is not equivalent to a true calibration. To a higher degree
    compared with traditional sensors, the quality of data generated by low-cost sensors
    not only depends on the sensors themselves, but also on the user and his/her knowledge,
    skills and metrological practice. This is why users of low-cost sensors and monitoring
    systems shall not only have skills in electronics and informatics. They must be
    trained in metrology, including measuring principles, indispensable periodic calibration
    and verification of both sensors and measuring chains and systems, and uncertainty
    assessment. Regarding the trueness of low-cost sensors, it seems that every metric
    in Table 3 can be used to describe this parameter. There are several discussions
    about its assessment: (i) many papers do not consider the trueness of reference
    sensors when they test low-cost sensors and give their results. (ii) Many papers
    do not distinguish calibration and validation datasets when they test low-cost
    sensors. (iii) Very different to traditional sensors, the output of low-cost sensor
    is frequently very primitive. Many low-cost sensors identified in this review
    deliver output voltage signals such as pyranometers, soil moisture and water quality
    sensors. It is better to use high performance ADC such ADS1115 to read their output.
    Using the build-in ADC of Arduino will introduce a higher system error (e.g.,
    Arduino nano has a build-in 10-bit ADC while ADS1115 is a 15-bit ADC, which means
    that ADS1115 provides a resolution 32 times better (iv) As the output of low-cost
    sensor is very primitive, there is almost no manufacturer calibration to adapt
    the output, which gives users more freedom but also involves more preparatory
    work in using the sensors. The trueness of low-cost sensors really depends on
    building a good calibration equation by users. For example, the output of the
    ultrasonic water level sensor is the echo time. Users can improve the trueness
    by compensating for the change in wind speed by temperature and humidity. (v)
    Some users use unsuitable methods to calibrate low-cost sensors: for example,
    pouring too much water into a rain gauge means simulating an unrealistic heavy
    rainfall event. Regarding the repeatability and reproducibility of low-cost sensors,
    some papers use pooled relative SD and ANOVA to check them. But many papers ignore
    these two important criteria. Almost no paper checks the reproducibility of low-cost
    sensors intentionally. In fact, this should be the manufacturer''s duty to ensure
    each sensor is calibrated in the factory. But low-cost sensors often involve no
    guarantee of repeatability and reproducibility, and this is the buyer''s duty
    to verify it. For example, the Pluvimate rain gauge has a mean bias of 13.9% in
    the reproducibility test even though we are skeptical of the test method. Specific
    tests of every low-cost sensor are mandatory before usage (as it should also be
    the case for any sensor), but this introduces another problem: when we plan to
    use tens to hundreds of low-cost sensors, testing all of them one by one is too
    costly and develop automated testing systems may facilitate this task but remains
    expensive. In many cases, users cannot test the resolution of low-cost sensors
    because they do not have the required equipment. There is a risk of uninformed
    use of low-cost sensors if users only rely on information provided by manufacturers.
    Indeed, some datasheets of low-cost sensors are of poor quality (insurance quality
    and reliability are costly). For example, the datasheet of weather station kit
    SEN-15901 gives different resolution values in different languages as discussed
    in the wind speed and rainfall sensors subsections. There is another issue as
    many low-cost sensors only deliver voltage: using an ADC with more bits can increase
    resolution in theory but requires a case-by-case adaptation. However, more importantly,
    the original analytical performance of some of the low-cost sensors is low constrained
    by its principle such as low-cost turbidimeter. In addition, some low-cost sensors
    have a higher resolution than the reference sensors used to test them. For example,
    the optical rain gauge RG-15 has a resolution of 0.02 mm. Regarding the response
    time, it appears that reviewed low-cost sensors can afford measuring every minute.
    In some cases, it may be better to read the output signal every several seconds
    and then compare to reference for calibration, or to calculate mean or median
    to improve repeatability. Very rare information is given about the sensitivity
    to the environment, maintenance needs and longevity of low-cost sensors. Some
    papers use an ANOVA to check sensitivity to the environment. Indeed, most low-cost
    sensors need retrofit to make them suitable for in situ application: enclosure,
    coating, etc. So, this is not only related to low-cost sensor itself. For example,
    air humidity and water level sensors with waterproof housing should have longer
    longevity. We speculate that all the low-cost water quality sensors discussed
    in this review will be fouled when immersing in stormwater and/or wastewater for
    months, which will (i) require frequent cleaning and (ii) reduce longevity. It
    would be valuable to develop a plumbing system that can automatically sample water
    and clean water quality sensors. FUTURE OUTLOOK Listen In one word, users of low-cost
    sensors should accept a trade-off between price and quality. The time needed to
    use operationally a low-cost sensor can be significant and lead to significant
    human resources costs: time to acquire the expertise, and time for prototyping,
    testing, calibrating, adapting, and assembling the commercial products into a
    ready-to-use monitoring equipment. There is another important task to be accounted
    for: connecting traditional sensors to open-source hardware such as Arduino. Facing
    this situation, we believe the lack of top-level planning really hinders the large-scale
    application of low-cost sensors in urban hydrology. Most of the low-cost sensors
    come from hobbies of open-source geek communities, school teaching needs and other
    initially non-scientific monitoring areas. This market grows and evolves very
    rapidly, with decreasing prices. It attracts the attention of the urban hydrology
    scientific community and an increasing number of stormwater management operators
    who would like to use them to obtain spatially distributed data and information
    allowing developing knowledge, modeling, operation performance, maintenance planning,
    and providing support for decision-making. But it is clear this was not the original
    intent of the developers of low-cost sensors. It would therefore be highly beneficial
    to organize the urban hydrology and stormwater management community like international
    institutions such as WMO. Uniformed international guidelines for the sensor production,
    interface, performance, calibration and system design, installation and data validation
    of low-cost sensors become necessary. This will greatly regulate and facilitate
    the sharing of experience and knowledge. Low-cost sensors are challenging the
    way we monitor urban water systems: they bring new ‘problems’ (related to any
    DIY component) but also open new perspectives (full control, large deployment
    and high spatial resolution of monitoring networks, low-energy consumption, communication
    capabilities, fast evolving technologies, and very high diversity of sensors).

    1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) has been steadily rolled out to numerous
    devices worldwide since the mid–late 2000s, starting largely with benign consumer
    items and increasingly into more sensitive areas, including healthcare, transportation,
    and more sensitive services [1]. With the inclusion of the IoT into healthcare,
    significant gains were realized in that patients experienced ease in reporting
    their health status [2,3]. In some cases, those confined gained autonomy [2,3].
    This applies to institutions adopting the IoT, gradual, sparing legislation adopted
    in the past 20 years to fast-track and improve the digitalization and reporting
    of medical information. It has not been just healthcare facilities that have boomed
    with IoT adoption. Modern labs, warehouses, schools, transport equipment, and
    agricultural plots use IoT devices in the 21st century [4], and these remain critical
    in consideration of healthcare impacts as their inputs and interactions impact
    operations. However, consumers and institutions alike have raised significant
    concerns about the continued digitalization of healthcare. The issues causing
    these concerns have occurred, from simple oversights in design to complex implementations
    of IoT health devices (IoTHDs). These have been accompanied by the discovery of
    numerous security vulnerabilities and high volumes of attacks that have been carried
    out [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. Vulnerabilities in IoTHD design and implementation
    pose immediate data-based threats. These threats include mass data leaks, improper
    forwarding of data, and sometimes even indirectly disrupting the operation of
    other connected devices through a lack of communication or coordination [15,16,17].
    We found vulnerabilities in production-scale and patched devices that have stored
    data in unencrypted, non-proprietary, and easy-to-access formats. However, it
    is worth noting that proprietary formats can frustrate open-source efforts and
    are usually financially motivated but more secure. Alternatively, some vulnerabilities
    leak access to other connected devices, which is problematic for any roll-out
    [17]. Relating to attacks, an increasing amount of health and manufacturing infrastructure
    has been open [17,18] and subject to attacks, such as Advanced Persistent Threats
    (APTs), ransomware, trojans, worms, and loggers [19]. These persistent problems
    within the IoTHD supply chain and health chain of actions pose numerous threats
    to patient health, caregiver service, and national security. Strielkina et al.
    [15] noted the significant problems networked devices posed, including random
    failures, privacy compromise, and deliberate operations disruptions. This paper
    examines the architecture components of IoTHD systems dissected in terms of devices,
    connected software technologies, the backbone infrastructure, and the individuals
    involved—IoTHD stakeholders. The discussion of the devices targets medical imaging,
    medical sensors (used to derive data from being taken advantage of and facilitate
    processes in modern healthcare), external and implanted devices, and virtual home
    assistants. The software discussion is split between legacy systems and AI-based
    software technologies that enable functions within these IoTHDs. The infrastructure
    discussion covers the communication and application backbone relevant to achieving
    medical services. Lastly, using IoTHDs requires a discussion of the relevant people
    and communities. These refer to nation-state actors, healthcare facility personnel,
    and independent and unorthodox communities. With knowledge of the landscape, we
    explore the vulnerabilities in healthcare infrastructure as a subset of the international
    bioeconomy through the lens of IoTHDs. We discuss the components of IoTHDs, vulnerabilities
    and threats leading to security risks, and control suggestions to address the
    security risks in IoTHDs. We propose and apply a multi-layer approach to IoTHD
    security risk management as a beneficial method to facilitate end-to-end security
    in IoTHDs. Lastly, we discuss the purpose of modern and emerging IoTHDs. Understanding
    this allows for an enhanced understanding of emerging and future vulnerabilities
    and threats, i.e., theoretical threat classification due to emerging IoTHD issues
    (in terms of novel attack/defense topologies, emerging social dynamics around
    devices, neuro-link adjacent devices, brain–computer interfaces, and wearable
    and minimally invasive device vulnerabilities) and practical examples with a case
    report in the literature. Following this, we discuss future IoTHD controls/countermeasures
    considerations in terms of device and culture design, practices and training,
    and innovations to introduce as relating to 4th industrial revolution (4IR) technologies
    (relating to AI, blockchain, and others that assist toward automation), applications
    of state defense in the vein of defend forward, and business opportunities that
    can be capitalized upon by enterprising minds. Overall, this condensed survey
    and exploration paper will be a valuable tool for anyone concerned with the security
    of IoTHDs and their potential impact on healthcare and other sectors. We believe
    that our paper can contribute to navigating the complexities and potential risks
    of IoTHDs and those that emerge from them. 2. IoT Healthcare Components IoTHDs
    are gaining popularity in healthcare. Some are legacy devices that do not immediately
    have IoTHD features that can be retrofitted, but many are newly manufactured devices
    that automatically have IoT functionality that can be embedded. Covering important
    common assets they produce in processing patient phenomena is also important.
    According to the literature, over half of the IoTHDs have critical security vulnerabilities
    [20,21]. Before enumerating the vulnerabilities of these devices and the future
    directions of IoTHDs, we define the different types of IoTHDs that we focus on
    in this paper. 2.1. IoT System High-Level Architecture In the literature, the
    extent of the reference architecture used for IoT systems in healthcare examines
    layered models. The architecture of the IoT in healthcare essentially consists
    of three (3) basic layers consisting of the perception, network, and application
    layers [22,23]. Fundamentally, medical information is collected from networked
    medical devices and wearable or implanted sensors and is transmitted through communication
    infrastructures to relevant end-users through software applications for monitoring
    and taking appropriate action. We summarize the high-level architecture of IoT
    components in healthcare. This is visualized in Figure 1. Figure 1. IoT architecture
    layers and their components, adapted from [24]. 2.1.1. Perception Layer This layer
    comprises devices with sensing capabilities where medical devices and wearable
    and implanted sensors are used to obtain real-time patient or end-user medical
    information to facilitate diagnosis and high-quality medical treatments. Such
    devices include Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, infrared sensors,
    imaging equipment, GPS, other medical sensors, and smart device sensors [22,25].
    These devices allow for comprehensive perception through object identification,
    image recognition, location recognition, and actuation and can convert this information
    to digital signals for transmission [25]. We discuss more regarding perception-layer
    devices in Section 2.2. 2.1.2. Network Layer The network layer constitutes wired
    and wireless networks, which connect perception devices, application-layer devices,
    and other network devices to transmit medical information collected at the perception
    layer to the application layer. Communication between things can occur using short-range
    communication technologies, such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and
    NFC (Near-Field Communication), and medium-range communication technologies, such
    as Bluetooth, Zigbee, WiFi, and the global system for mobile (GSM) communications
    [22]. However, high-frequency fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G)
    cellular networks are becoming more readily available and providing a reliable
    connection for up to thousands of devices at the same time [25]. 2.1.3. Application
    Layer The application layer interprets and applies data generated at the perception
    layer and transmitted through the network layer. The layer is also responsible
    for providing usability to the end-user, delivering application-specific computing
    services, and data storage. The end-users could be a doctor monitoring their patient’s
    data in real time on a hospital computer, a specialist monitoring their patient’s
    record on a smart device, and a family member of the patient or even the patient
    themselves monitoring vital signs on their smart device. We discuss more regarding
    relevant end-users in Section 2.4. Most promising IoT medical applications are
    facilitated using artificial intelligence (AI) for image analysis in radiology,
    pathology, and dermatology, electronic medical records (EMRs) text recognition
    with natural language processing, and drug activity design, as well as illness
    trajectories, medical outcomes and interventions, and re-admissions predictions
    [26]. Data storage and manipulation are critical aspects of IoT healthcare applications.
    Cloud infrastructures support data-intensive electronic medical records (EMRs),
    patient portals, medical IoT smartphone applications, and big data analytics driving
    decision support systems and therapeutic strategies [27]. 2.2. IoT Healthcare
    Devices Our analysis focuses on IoTHDs, ranging from networked medical devices
    to wirelessly reprogrammable implantable devices and software applications. In
    this paper, we refer to medical devices as any instrument, machine, implant, in
    vitro reagent, or related components intended for the diagnosis or in the cure,
    mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases [28]. We discuss examples of
    these IoTHDs and their application to healthcare. 2.2.1. Medical Imaging Medical
    images are becoming even more important due to the advancements in telemedicine.
    Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and CT (Computed Tomography) are volumetric medical
    imaging methods commonly used for medical diagnosis. X-rays are a more elementary
    mode of medical imagery. Because these images contain important information about
    one’s health concerns, they are usually considered key components that the healthcare
    sector needs to protect in the field of cyberbiosecurity [29,30,31]. One of the
    many forms of medical images is Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
    (DICOM). DICOM is a standard for storing and transmitting medical images, which
    gives the biomedical details of the organ that is being examined [32]. DICOM and
    PACS (picture archiving and communication systems) are well-known for medical
    imaging transmission and storage protocols [33]. Typically, CT and MRI images
    can be acquired in the DICOM format and stored in PACS servers where the PACS
    clients, such as doctors and medical staff, can access the stored files through
    the DICOM protocol. However, these medical imaging systems have been exposed to
    malicious attacks because of the lack of critical network security [34,35]. For
    example, DICOM provides encryption options but has also been exposed to malicious
    attacks [36]. Although Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are mostly used
    in image fabrication, they can also be used in sensing data. Some studies have
    already shown the feasibility of using GANs in ubiquitous sensing data other than
    images. For example, Erol et al. [37] utilized GANs to generate realistic radar
    data for human activity recognition [37]. While these are not relevant for medical
    procedures, they can be when adapted to specific surgical or other medical techniques
    that are machine guided. For example, deep learning was utilized to attempt noise
    reduction in ultrasound images [38]. This demonstrates the potential for adversaries
    to build means that mimic medical devices’ behavior in time. Beyond the radar
    data, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensing data or biometric data can always
    be replayed using GANs [39]. In addition, other forms of imaging include smart
    cameras to assist healthcare delivery, including wound analysis in patients with
    diabetes [40], monitoring dermatitis and skin conditions [41] and heart rates,
    and monitoring tear film buildup in dry eye disease [42]. 2.2.2. Medical Sensors
    Besides medical imaging equipment, biometric medical sensors can directly retrieve
    digital output readings from human beings [43]. Medical images are predominantly
    created at a specialized medical facility, but medical sensing data can be collected
    at a hospital or in daily life [44,45]. This is made possible because IoT technologies
    have grown rapidly, and thus ubiquitous sensing is available by wearable devices
    worn by the user that interconnect wearable sensors through wireless connections
    [46,47]. For example, vital sign patches to wirelessly track and monitor heart
    rate, respiration rate, temperature, step count, sleep cycle, stress levels, and
    falls or incapacitation; wireless electrocardiogram monitors [48]; smartwatches
    and Fitbits (to track activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns); fall detectors,
    such as iFall (a wearable accelerometer that communicates with a smartphone and
    the cloud), to detect and respond to patient falls [49]; wearable blood pressure
    monitors [50]; neural sensors to read and understand neural brain signals and
    to infer the state of the brain [51]; and finger pulse oximeters to measure oxygen
    saturation levels in the blood [52]. With the criticality of these devices to
    patient diagnosis, injecting or removing sensing data can also cause a significant
    misdiagnosis. However, a lot of these devices have notably poor signal quality
    already. For instance, wrist-mounted pulse oximeter devices are regularly off
    by a large margin when addressing patients with darker skin tones [52]. Devices
    like these require additional reevaluation on top of their potential to leak data.
    This presents a possible compound disruption to the quality of care in analogously
    deficient devices. As a result, disruptions can further impede the reliability
    of healthcare operations. Thus, future healthcare sectors must ensure that medical
    sensing data are secure. 2.2.3. Implanted Medical Devices As micro-electromechanical
    systems (MEMS) have grown significantly, researchers have made inroads to propose
    medical devices that can be implanted into human bodies—yet popular acceptance
    of these devices may be many years away. This is to say nothing of the current
    reliability of these devices, which may be low. Numerous brain–machine interfaces
    aim to communicate with neural signals of human brains to treat disease conditions
    that are currently difficult to treat reliably [53,54,55,56]. Likewise, implanted
    medical devices not only stay in human bodies but will eventually be parts of
    live devices that can transmit data outside the body [57]. For example, for digital
    (smart) medications, an ingestible sensor (a microfabricated sensor made from
    copper, magnesium, and silicon, in minute quantities) can communicate with an
    external body sensor, such as a wearable sensor patch [23]. In this regard, there
    are multiple vulnerabilities in using such implanted medical devices [58]. For
    example, authentication methods on implanted medical devices are an especially
    pertinent topic [59]. It is also important to consume battery power more efficiently
    [58]. Implanted devices can be hacked to consume inefficiently and reduce user
    life quality. In addition, data availability, integrity, and confidentiality should
    always be available to the users [60]. By doing this, healthcare professionals
    can better manage the implanted devices. 2.2.4. Virtual Medical Home Assistants
    As discussed earlier, advanced IoT technologies can enable patients to be treated
    at home. Virtual medical home assistants could be part of healthcare [16,61,62,63].
    For example, continuous glucose monitors and smart insulin pens (which track dose
    and time and recommend the correct type of insulin to use) [64]; sleep trackers;
    home security cameras; and voice assistants can also be part of healthcare components
    because they generate medical information, e.g., fall events, and transmit them
    to off-site data storage facilities [65,66]. These devices can be used at home
    for remotely monitoring patients’ biomedical status remotely [16]. Specifically,
    smart voice assistants (also known as conversation agents) installed in the home
    setting can support users through conversations, answer specific health-related
    questions without human contact, and collect data for screening and remote patient
    monitoring [67]. Product designers, security experts, human factors engineers,
    and regulators might benefit from considering how the lexicon might affect voice
    assistants. For example, they might want to consider how people of different backgrounds/incomes
    would talk to a doctor and (presumably) a voice assistant differently. Considerations
    within this space might help expose additional vulnerabilities in device operation.
    Additionally, health robots can be applied to support the detection of unhealthy
    behaviors, manage medication use, and assist in rehabilitation therapies [68].
    Overall, the definition of healthcare input data has expanded substantially. Accordingly,
    healthcare should protect these wide scopes of input data from malicious adversaries
    [14,69,70,71,72]. As healthcare organizations become more distributed in treating
    and observing patients, they represent wider attack surfaces. 2.3. IoT Healthcare
    Supporting Technologies Various software components and infrastructure technologies
    support IoTHDs to function effectively. 2.3.1. IoTHD Software Components Software
    components are crucial in enabling various functionalities and facilitating communication
    among different devices and systems, and they need to be designed, developed,
    and tested with security in mind. Healthcare facilities can choose from a wide
    variety of healthcare software programs. Each choice requires high-quality security
    implementations to secure patient data and medical facilities. IT solutions in
    healthcare support medical professionals by automating manual workflow or supporting
    medical workers wherever they work. Most software gathers patient information
    to coordinate the best care among qualified healthcare providers. The Electronic
    Health Record Software (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record Software (EMR) are
    the most used healthcare software. These are the gateways for both patients and
    providers. Other medical software currently available includes Medical Diagnosis
    Software, which enables the real-time transmission of information between providers,
    medical databases, visualization and imaging, medical research, tele-health and
    telemedicine, and patient engagement software [73]. Software for the healthcare
    industry is not currently standardized. Even at its best, some of the current
    healthcare software is cumbersome. The user experience was not prioritized in
    the design of the system interface. Although EHR is intended to simplify the process,
    it can be compromised. As a result, hackers are free to take patient data and
    hold it hostage while exploiting it to make money. Some hospitals still use paper
    medical records because they have not fully migrated to EHR. Teaching hospital
    employees the best ways to secure patient data throughout these changes is crucial.
    As secure as any software is, medical professionals will continue making human
    errors in healthcare. The medical software should be a backup to the provider
    to provide the best possible care. Healthcare systems have also used outdated
    legacy software that is still in use due to its critical functionality but is
    often no longer supported by the manufacturers, making them vulnerable to security
    risks and compatibility issues. One major challenge with legacy software in IoT
    healthcare device systems is the potential for security vulnerabilities. These
    software components no longer receive updates and patches, making them susceptible
    to cyberattacks that exploit known vulnerabilities. This could result in compromised
    sensitive patient data or the device, potentially harming patients [34,74,75].
    Another issue with legacy software is compatibility. As new technologies and systems
    are developed, legacy software may no longer be compatible with newer hardware
    or software. This can create issues when integrating older devices into new systems
    or upgrading existing ones. It is also important to note that in some cases, healthcare
    organizations may be required to continue using legacy software due to regulatory
    or compliance requirements. AI-based software also benefits IoTHDs. AI can read
    available EMR data, including medical history, physicals, laboratory reports,
    imaging, and medications, and contextualize these data to generate treatment and/or
    diagnosis decisions and/or possibilities. Further, it can interpret data from
    various sources. For example, IBM Watson uses AI to read both structured and unstructured
    text in EMR, to read images to highlight primary and incidental findings, and
    to compile relevant medical literature in response to clinical queries [39]. IoT-based
    healthcare and deep machine learning can assist health professionals in seeing
    the unseeable and providing new and enhanced diagnostic capabilities. Although
    diagnostic confidence may never reach 100%, combining machines and clinician expertise
    reliably enhances system performance. For example, compared with the diagnostic
    evaluation by 54 ophthalmologists and senior residents, applying AI to retinal
    images improved the detection and grading of diabetic retinopathy and macular
    edema, achieving high specificity (98%) and sensitivity (90%) [76]. AI and deep
    learning can also optimize disease management, provide big data and analysis generated
    from mHealth apps and IoT devices, and are seeing adoption in healthcare [77].
    Some examples of this include predicting risk, future medical outcomes, and care
    decisions in diabetes and mental health [78] and predicting the progression of
    congestive heart failure [79,80], bone disease [81], Alzheimer disease [82], and
    benign and malignant tumor classification [83]. However, AI-based threats are
    new and emerging. These threats used machine learning techniques to rapidly and
    comprehensively learn new vulnerabilities and attack routes. A recent survey [84]
    listed actual and possible frameworks that can attack devices, software, and other
    assets in health security. 2.3.2. IoTHD Supporting Infrastructure Backbone infrastructures
    are critical in ensuring IoTHDs function effectively, securely, and reliably.
    IoTHDs generate massive amounts of data that need to be processed and analyzed
    in real time, where cloud computing infrastructure provides the necessary processing
    power and storage capacity to handle this data. However, with more cloud apps
    entering the health market, it is just as important that an evidence base supports
    its effectiveness and safety and can deal with the security of health data and
    the reliability and transparency of that data by third parties. Furthermore, it
    has been suggested that centralized cloud storage will present issues in the future
    to users, such as excessive data accumulation and latency, because of the distance
    between IoT devices and data centers. IoTHDs require a reliable and secure communication
    infrastructure to transmit data between devices, servers, and other systems. This
    infrastructure includes wired and wireless networks, protocols, and communication
    standards. Communicated healthcare data are often stored on a local machine (often
    decentralized) or turned over to a central hospital repository. Cloud-based computing
    to support the delivery of health services has many benefits, as it is ubiquitous,
    flexible, and scalable in terms of data acquisition, storage, and transmission
    between devices connected to the cloud [66]. The use of the cloud can be foreseen
    to support data-intensive electronic medical records (EMRs), patient portals,
    medical IoT devices (which can include smartphone apps), and the big data analytics
    driving decision support systems and therapeutic strategies [85]. Decentralized
    data processing and networking approaches may improve the scalability of the IoT
    in healthcare. Edge cloud is a newer cloud computing concept that allows IoT sensors
    and network gateways to process and analyze data themselves (i.e., at the edge)
    in a decentralized fashion, reducing the amount of data required to be communicated
    and managed at a centralized location [31,86]. Similarly, blockchain storage uses
    a decentralized approach to data storage, creating independent blocks containing
    individual sets of information, forming a dependent link in a collective block,
    and creating a network regulated by patients rather than a third party [87]. However,
    the usage of blockchain is minimal for now. There are examples of platforms engineering
    blockchain for medical practice already [20,87]; however, research on edge clouds
    and blockchains in healthcare is still limited and is an important area for future
    research. 2.4. IoT Healthcare Stakeholders Individuals must interface with IoTHDs
    on the front end (usually the Graphical User Interface (GUI)) and back end (usually
    through medical infrastructure). We focus on patients and patient family members,
    healthcare personnel, and IoTHD developers as they have security impacts on IoTHDs
    and their related assets. 2.4.1. Patients and Related Family Members Patients
    and their related family members have a tremendous role in accessing and advocating
    for quality care. It is important to consider the modes of care and the communication
    platforms (smartphone vs. hospital-owned medical device(s)). Healthcare security
    professionals should consider wide scenarios at play with the transmission of
    hospital information. For example, upon obtaining acceptance from the patient,
    or even the patient themself on their smartphone, family members will communicate
    healthcare details differently. 2.4.2. Healthcare Personnel We discuss healthcare
    personnel in degrees of contact with patients. First-degree personnel commonly
    include physicians, nurses, students, receptionists, phlebotomists, technicians,
    surgeons, scribes, emergency response doctors, janitors, security workers, and
    administrators. Contract workers who may be involved with security, the transportation
    of materials, information technology staff, and guest scientists or collaborators
    make up second-degree personnel. Third-degree personnel can work with or associate
    with second-degree personnel or are unpaid, such as students, volunteers, patient
    visitors, and police officers, in limited cases of needed operation, participation,
    and agency. 2.4.3. IoTHD Manufacturers IoTHD manufacturers cover all those in
    charge of building, configuring, and maintaining IoTHDs. IoTHD manufacturers can
    introduce security issues during device manufacturing cycles and should similarly
    sharpen the protection of their most critical manufactured assets. These include
    tighter protocols, vetting, and minimization of interactions with core IP assets,
    offline backups, networking segmentation, web filtering, etc. [88]. Additionally,
    IoTHD manufacturers should assume they are already targets and be aware of phishing
    attacks [88]. 2.5. Security Risk Management To study the security aspects and
    possible risks with IoTHDs, we apply information systems security risk management
    (ISSRM) concepts, defined by Dubois et al. [89], that define the asset, risk,
    and risk treatment-related concepts to guide security risk management. We selected
    the ISSRM method because it supported systematic asset identification and functional
    decomposition of the system [90,91] when compared to other risk management methods
    used for IoT systems, such as NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
    [92], OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation
    Method) [93], and TARA (Threat Assessment and Remediation Analysis) [94]. Affia
    et al. [95] provides a more detailed comparison of these methods. We also follow
    a threat-driven approach to security risk management [96], developed in line with
    the ISSRM method, to provide security threat analysis support benefits, including
    threat and risk treatment coverage, by leveraging the STRIDE method. We explore
    major concepts of the ISSRM method below: Asset-related concepts—identify relevant
    assets for security risk analysis. It describes the business assets—that represent
    information, data, and processes that bring value to an organization—and system
    assets—that support business assets to protect. Asset-related concepts also describe
    the security criteria (in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability)
    that define the security needs of the assets [89]. Risk-related concepts—illustrate
    the vulnerability, threat agent, threats, and risk impact analysis of the assets
    in scope. A security risk is a combination of a security event and its impact
    (negation of the security criterion), harming business and system assets. A vulnerability
    is a characteristic of system assets, constituting its flaws—an implementation
    defect that can lead to a vulnerability [89]. A threat agent refers to an entity
    that has the potential to cause damage to information system assets, thereby initiating
    a threat and becoming the origin of a risk. Typically, a threat agent is identified
    by their motivation, skills, capability, knowledge, available resources, and opportunity
    to carry out an attack [89,97]. A threat event is a component of security risk
    that occurs when a threat targets system assets and exploits their vulnerability.
    The STRIDE method [98] can then be used for security threat analysis [96]. The
    abbreviation STRIDE stands for spoofing (S)—pretending to be someone else to gain
    access to sensitive data or resources, tampering (T)—altering data or code to
    manipulate the application’s behavior or cause it to malfunction, repudiation
    (R)—denying ones actions or the actions of others and making it difficult to track
    down the source of an action, information disclosure (I)—exposing or gaining access
    to information one should not be able to access, denial of service (D)—preventing
    a system from providing its intended service by crashing it, slowing it down,
    or filling its storage, and elevation of privilege (E)—gaining access to functionality
    without authorization [98]. Further in this study, we use STRIDE to guide a security
    threat analysis due to its industrial usage, maturity, high research concentration
    within the security community, and applicability for guiding risk treatment. Risk
    treatment-related concepts—tackle mitigating the identified security risks, guiding
    risk mitigation decisions, security requirements, and controls to treat the risks.
    Security requirements aim to define conditions to be reached by mitigating identified
    security risks and are prerequisites to controls that implement the specified
    security requirements [89]. The STRIDE security requirements can thus guide requirements
    elicitation for risk treatment [96]. In this study, we apply these security risk
    management concepts in a multi-layer approach to understand the security risks
    within the IoTHD ecosystem. 3. Security Risks in IoT Health Devices The examination
    of security risk management in IoT layers through the related work [24] has brought
    to light certain issues that may not have been discovered if the IoT system’s
    architecture was not considered. These issues include research gaps arising from
    an unequal focus on security research on some IoT architecture layers to the detriment
    of others, the effect of risk on one layer cascading to other layers, and the
    necessity of implementing multi-layer risk analysis and defence strategies. Thus,
    we seek to apply a multi-layer approach to IoTHD security management as a beneficial
    method to facilitate end-to-end security in IoTHDs. In this section, we summarize
    our multi-layer IoTHD asset findings in Table 1, discuss the vulnerabilities of
    these IoTHD system assets, highlight relevant threat agents with the motivation
    and expertise to attack IoTHDs, and then formalize threats to IoTHDs in Table
    2. We also provide a multi-layer risk analysis based on real-world scenarios to
    instantiate our approach. 3.1. IoTHD Assets Table 1 summarizes the IoTHD assets
    (system and business assets) based on the discussed IoTHDs and classifies these
    assets into functional areas of each layer. Table 1. IoTHD Architecture-layer
    assets. 3.2. IoTHD Vulnerabilities A vulnerability is a weakness in a system asset,
    group of system assets, or security control that a threat agent could exploit
    to cause harm to the system. As such, medical devices, specifically when they
    are connected to networks, are just as vulnerable as any other networked security
    systems and are subject to security breaches because they are all interconnected
    [100]. As the medical world expands in networking and information technology,
    there are increased opportunities for threat incidents initiated by malicious
    agents that target IoTHD system assets by exploiting their vulnerabilities. IoTHDs
    have become more vulnerable to cybersecurity vulnerabilities due to the rapid
    growth, prioritized role in aiding healthcare diagnosis, and greater connectivity
    between the devices, leading to high-impact clinical treatment and patient safety
    [100]. This section discusses the vulnerabilities of IoTHD system assets within
    their respective IoT layers. 3.2.1. Perception-Layer Vulnerabilities IoTHDs, including
    legacy devices, are vulnerable to physical attacks that render devices unusable.
    Those medical devices are usually expensive and mostly managed by RFID in hospitals
    [101]. Despite the efforts of the protocol-level approaches, medical devices are
    often targeted by physical thefts, which is harder to protect through software
    solutions. Additionally, the potential for smart pills to be a target of theft
    exists as well [102], alongside medical identity theft by stealing fobs, cards,
    and other physical means of accessing healthcare assets. According to Mancini
    et al. [103], medical identity is used to access certain medical benefits by adversaries.
    IoT health devices are also limited in the power and resources they possess [100].
    Thus, encrypting data transmitted by these devices, for instance, can significantly
    slow down their operation, reducing their usable battery life. This is a critical
    issue as some medical devices rely on prolonged battery life, and any reduction
    in it could affect their effectiveness and even pose risks to patients. Data authentication
    is crucial to medical device security because these factors are related to one’s
    medical history and data privacy. IoTHDs may suffer from an elevation of privilege
    attacks (EoP) when device authentication is missing [104]. Implanted devices that
    enable communication between brains, brain-stems, and other parts of the central
    nervous system are vulnerable to unethical access to consumer/patient neural information.
    Although these devices are designed to help mitigate patients’ diseases, adversaries
    can potentially exploit the IoTHDs to extract information from our brains. Several
    researchers have pointed out that this could be a new ethical threat to humans
    in the coming decades [105,106]. 3.2.2. Network-Layer Vulnerabilities Data integrity
    is a key security criterion for securing data generated and transmitted by IoTHDs.
    However, the data integrity of the remotely collected data in communication is
    not always easy. Vulnerabilities in communication are likely to persist. For accessibility,
    any data generated by IoTHDs are usually always available. While adversaries may
    block transmission channels by using jamming or flooding attacks, medical devices
    should be able to provide ceaseless data monitoring [107,108]. The lack of accessibility
    may also cause data integrity, which can be used for altering data stored on IoTHDs
    [78,106]. Automation has boosted medical device manufacturing, providing many
    advantages in improving productivity while reducing unnecessary costs [109,110].
    However, in medical device manufacturing, every component created with network
    capability or means of amplifying, dampening, or re-routing network communications
    creates new avenues of attacks [111]. For example, ransomware can cause massive
    supply-chain disruptions [111]. 3.2.3. Application-Layer Vulnerabilities Many
    computer vision technologies have been proposed to alter images [1,112]. Thus,
    it threatens healthcare sectors that adversaries could apply techniques such as
    modification, swapping, and obscuring toward vulnerable medical images [113,114].
    For example, injecting or removing medical evidence to and from those medical
    images can cause a major misdiagnosis [115,116]. Medical images with insufficient
    security guidelines updates can also often suffer from various malicious manipulation
    attacks [33]. Additionally, adversaries and researchers have proposed more complicated
    attacking models and defense requirements as deep learning techniques evolve.
    For example, CT-GANs (Computed Tomography—Generative Adversarial Networks) [117]
    train GANs to generate fake CT images by having AI learn real medical images [117].
    At the application layer, web services have become a popular means of interfacing
    with existing (and somewhat legacy) systems. However, when it comes to ensuring
    greater interoperability, some implementations can be insecure due to weak authentication
    and the absence of encryption. As a result, there is a risk of information being
    tampered with during transmission. Given the growing importance of IoTHDs, preserving
    data integrity is of utmost importance [100]. The human factor is also a component
    of the application layer. A lack of awareness of cybersecurity issues, poor security
    practices, and the consistent education and training of healthcare personnel,
    patients, and end-users of IoTHDs on cybersecurity risks and their impact contributes
    to the persistent cybersecurity vulnerabilities [100]. Some examples of these
    insecure practices include the insecure disposal of devices containing sensitive
    information or data, sharing passwords, and distributing passwords for device
    access, especially in cases where password protection is required [100]. 3.3.
    Relevant Threat Agents A threat agent can be a person, group, or organization
    that intends to exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to a system intentionally.
    A threat agent is characterized by motivation, available resources, and expertise
    to use an attack method sufficient to trigger a threat. The threat agent is, thus,
    the source of risk. This section highlights relevant threat agents with the motivation
    and expertise to attack IoTHDs. 3.3.1. Nation and State Actors Nation and state
    actors are parties that operate on behalf of governments—with or without that
    government’s public support. These tend to be well-funded entities collaborating
    with other allied countries and often work with “private enterprise” or criminal
    associations [118,119,120]. However, governments can fund operations that are
    often seen as independent. They have been known to be the main parties perpetrating
    cyber warfare largely through APTs contributing sustained operations [13,121].
    For example, various APTs have been noted for interfering in politics, assisting
    in IP theft, participating in extortion attempts, or shoring up military imbalances
    in capacity between nations. A yet unknown source has been behind the “Tardigrade”
    APT targeting biomanufacturing facilities [122]. So far, Tardigrade has been suspected
    of gathering intelligence on vaccine production data [88] to disrupt it. Even
    more unusual is the metamorphic ability of Tardigrade to learn the systems it
    is in, change its signatures when detected, and then act anew. Thus, meaningful
    concerns can be had about new Tardigrade-like and Tardigrade derivatives in development
    or deployed elsewhere, perhaps even other industries. Limited actions can be performed
    while Tardigrade is under examination, but key insights can be gleaned: State
    actors continue to have the means to produce sophisticated works. APTs produced
    are likely to prioritize and maintain autonomy, allowing damages delivered to
    be sustained. Interference can be run through these to disrupt the operations
    of critical healthcare [122]. If APTs can securely deliver hostile software into
    organizations with enough IoTHDs, and those devices are distributed widely enough
    and sufficiently evade patching, they can be a significant means of surveillance.
    The most relevant APTs toward IoTHDs appear to be those that would target both
    IP and operations of such IP. Such could deliver strategic technological gains
    to nation-states while offering positioning to control companies of rival nation-states
    and or their alliances. IoTHD developers should assume they are already targets
    and sharpen the protection of their most critical assets, including tighter protocols,
    vetting, and minimization of interactions with core IP assets. Further, as per
    BIO-ISAC’s reported recommendation for bio manufacturers, all IoTHD developers
    should similarly consider reviewing the degree of backups, networking segmentation,
    and product lead times [88]. Owing to automation in APTs and other means of automated
    attacks, we may see increased automation in defense. 3.3.2. Healthcare Facilities
    and Related Personnel Conversations about healthcare facilities and personnel
    commonly include physicians, nurses, students, receptionists, phlebotomists, technicians,
    surgeons, scribes, emergency response doctors, janitors, security workers, and
    administrators. These are first-degree personnel. The many contract workers who
    may be involved with security, the transportation of materials, information technology
    staff, and guest scientists or collaborators are important to include, which can
    make up the second degree. One more degree can be removed for those who work with
    or associate with workers at the second degree or are unpaid, such as students,
    volunteers, patient visitors, and police officers, in limited cases of needed
    operation, participation, and agency. From the first to the third degree, there
    is a gradient of access to IoTHDs, from higher to lower. Still, all must be considered
    to a degree depending on the tasks at hand and the value of the IoTHD assets,
    for they can all provide an input that can determine a valuable output. Each of
    these degrees of separation entails different trees of attacks on healthcare assets.
    Healthcare personnel need to consider how the IoT either shortens the degree of
    separation or removes barriers entirely. 3.3.3. Independent and Unorthodox Communities
    Unorthodox communities include many diverse actors of different funding groups
    and sizes. Independent actors can include from hobbyists and lone actors to organized
    groups either looking to exploit for intrigue, the repurposing of devices, or
    exploitation or harm. From the ethical hacker end of the spectrum, spaces such
    as those within Community Bio and Makerspaces and groups such as “I Am The Calvary”
    and the “Grinder [Implant] Community” would be those among whom IoHTDs may find
    beneficent uses. These individuals improve technology through identifying vulnerabilities
    and alerting manufacturers, addressing the vulnerabilities directly, positively
    advertising the proper use of the devices, or repurposing the devices within accepted
    frameworks. Toward the other end, lone exhibitors, criminals, and criminal groups
    can be expected to pose considerable, irregular threats to IoTHD users. 3.4. IoTHD
    Security Threats Medical devices, specifically when they are connected to networks,
    are just as vulnerable as any other networked security systems and are subject
    to security breaches because they are all interconnected. IoT devices have increasingly
    become prevalent in healthcare and have improved patient care, remote monitoring,
    and medical research. However, these devices pose security threats that malicious
    actors (see Section 3.3) can exploit. Security threats to IoT devices in healthcare
    can occur at different layers, including the perception, network, and application
    layers. We aggregate the results of the security threats to IoTHDs [123,124,125,126]
    following the STRIDE method [24,96] in Table 2. Table 2. IoTHD security threats
    [24,123,124,125,126]. 3.5. IoTHD Countermeasures As the medical world expands
    in networking and information technology, security threats in IoTHDs will continue
    to impact the future of clinical treatment and patient safety directly. Technical
    controls, governance, resilience measures, unified reporting, context expertise,
    regulation, and standards are general suggestions for the remediation of security
    risks due to IoTHD threats [100]. We discuss countermeasures to IoTHD security
    threats (see Section 3.4) at the perception, network, and application layers [124,126,127].
    3.5.1. Perception/Device-Level Controls In the era of Healthcare 4.0, all the
    sensing data from IoTHDs will be transmitted to remote servers and stored in cloud
    databases [128,129,130]. In addition, due to the nature of IoT devices, various
    sensing capabilities are used. Especially in implanted medical devices and sensors,
    if the data protocols or message formats vary, data protection against a wide
    range of malicious attacks can be more difficult [83]. Thus, more unified networks
    can be built with unified data encryption and transmission schemes to bring more
    protection capabilities against future adversaries [131]. Perception-layer components
    are prone to physical attacks, such as tampering or theft. Physical-layer security
    schemes [124,132] including RFID-based secure algorithms [101] have been suggested
    to protect against physical attacks (i.e., eavesdropping, sniffing, data breach,
    compromised node and device cloning attacks). Researchers have also proposed secure
    data management protocols for medical identity protection [133,134] against medical
    identity theft that allow for privileged attacks. Mashima et al. [135] pioneered
    to secure medical systems against physical theft [135] that creates a trusted
    domain and an online monitoring system. However, medical identity threats cannot
    only be resolved by engineering efforts but also require holistic efforts. Halstead
    et al. [136] emphasized the importance of educating healthcare workers to become
    aware of these physical threats [136]. Medical professionals are not trained to
    deal with security threats, so device manufacturers should provide some security
    on their devices, release patches, and ensure secure products. While medical staff
    have little to do with the security of their devices, the owner of the healthcare
    facility can maintain (buy) strong device security and hire capable cybersecurity
    teams [137]. IoTHD perception-layer components become a more beneficial target
    as they collect patient medical data and control the device. Data hygiene entails
    the removal or limited persistence of data created on or entered into the device
    to reduce the impact of device data breaches and limit how much sensitive data
    can be transmitted to other IoT layers. Developers must consider protocols that
    limit the data taken and the data deciphered to limit thefts, as the ability to
    decode human biosignatures improves [105]. Additionally, data authentication schemes
    (i.e., biometric-based, mutual authentication, etc.) are crucial to medical device
    security because these factors are related to the privacy of one’s medical history
    and data [124]. Such schemes can help remediate impersonation, password intrusion,
    reply, weak authentication, and side-channel attacks. 3.5.2. Network/Communication-Level
    Controls Vulnerabilities in IoTHD communication can be addressed through key management
    schemes (using symmetric or asymmetric approaches) to protect the information
    exchanges between IoTHD system components [124]. With key management, the messages
    to be transmitted are protected with a key, which allows the packets to be encrypted.
    However, with the traditional approaches, there is a possibility of high power
    consumption and complexity [138]. There is also a need to adapt to newer technologies
    such as 5G technology and the emergence of more complex smart applications [124].
    Proxy-based mechanisms can introduce additional security by adding an entity,
    layer, or process to secure the data generated in medical devices and transmitted
    between medical devices and the healthcare platform at the application layer.
    Wu et al. [139] created a proxy-based approach with ciphertext-policy attribute-based
    encryption (CP-ABE) to protect the communications and provide fine-grained access
    control in devices and WBANs. Similarly, Marwan et al. [140] proposed the CloudSec
    framework for data sharing and processing with two cryptosystems (AES and Paillier
    cryptosystems) for data encryption and key management. Secure routing mechanisms
    such as SDN technology [141] protect IoTHDs from attacks such as Wormhole, routing
    attacks, DoS, battery depletion, flooding, Grayhole, etc., that take advantage
    of the high power consumption or low processing capabilities of the transmission
    mechanisms. Thus, deploying secure gathering and routing strategies to incur the
    least communication overheads and transmission costs mitigate these attacks [141,142].
    Intrusion detection techniques are also beneficial for discovering attacks or
    malicious actions in the network or system [124]. Lastly, as with limiting the
    data collected through data hygiene methods, limiting the data transmitted from
    IoTHDs remains important. Despite implicit agreements upon the IoTHDs’ vulnerabilities
    in communication, several studies [143,144] have reviewed the literature on how
    to build reliable data communication protocols or systems. 3.5.3. Application-Level
    Controls Security at this layer is critical because it manages the exchange of
    sensitive data between the device and the user or external systems. Developers
    of IoT health applications should follow secure coding practices, such as input
    validation, output encoding, and data sanitization, to prevent common application-layer
    attacks, such as SQL injection and buffer overflows. While key management schemes
    protect data in transit between the IoT device and the user’s mobile device or
    external systems [100,124], sensitive data should be encrypted at rest in the
    user’s mobile device or external systems. Strong encryption algorithms such as
    AES symmetric key based-schemes and RSA should be used [124]. IoT health devices
    must also ensure data integrity of the data transmitted and received, as incorrect
    data can lead to life-threatening situations. Mechanisms such as check-sums, digital
    signatures, and hash functions can be used to ensure that data have not been tampered
    with. Access control mechanisms can also be implemented to limit authorized users’
    access to sensitive data and device functionality. Authentication mechanisms such
    as username/password, biometrics, or smart cards can be used to authenticate users.
    Secure data aggregation techniques protect the patient’s sensitive information
    aggregated from distributed medical devices (medical sensors) by applying an aggregation
    technique to secure and privatize the information. Tang et al. [145] applied different
    characteristics to implement secure data aggregation techniques, such as differential
    privacy preservation, obliviousness security, patient fair incentives, and data
    aggregation source identification. Chen et al. [146] proposed the federated learning
    paradigm using trained models to implement secure data aggregation. 4. Practical
    Examples Inspired by Real-World Concerns We have followed a high-level layered
    architecture perspective to IoT systems, allowing for a more in-depth asset-oriented
    security risk analysis of IoTHDs within their perception, network, and application
    layers. We applied a suitable security risk management method—the ISSRM method—and
    its domain model [89] to guide our analysis. Our analysis in Section 3 shows that
    a multi-layer security risk management analysis benefits securing IoT health devices.
    By identifying and mitigating potential risks at each layer, IoT health devices
    can be made more secure, protecting user privacy and safety. In this section,
    we summarize this analysis at each layer. 4.1. Risk 1: Medical Image Modification
    Medical imaging systems can comprise sensor equipment to collect CT and MRI images
    in various formats and store, transmit, or share them using the picture archiving
    and communication system (PACS). PACS is networked medical imaging technology
    that facilitates the storage, retrieval, and sharing of medical images. 4.1.1.
    Perception-Layer Risk Analysis In the case of medical imaging using PACS, the
    perception layer includes devices used to capture and configure the CT and MRI
    imagery, as well as the software used. These include the CT scanners, MRI, DR
    device, ultrasound to capture medical imagery, and the modality workstation configuring
    and sending all the imagery in the DICOM format to the PACS server [117]. Vulnerabilities
    in the perception layer may arise from inadequate security measures, such as weak
    passwords, unpatched software, or default settings that have not been changed,
    which can increase the risk of unauthorized access to these assets. The attacker
    with physical access to the perception-layer assets, i.e., the modality workstation,
    can plant the malware by accessing the unlocked workstation. To secure against
    this threat, anti-virus software can be used on modality workstations and should
    be kept up to date [117]. Additionally, digital signatures [147] and digital watermarking
    [148] with each scan and machine learning techniques [149] can be used to detect
    tampered images and, thus, prevent their use for medical diagnosis. 4.1.2. Network-Layer
    Risk Analysis The network layer in this scenario refers to the PACS network infrastructure
    used to transmit and store the medical images, typically in the DICOM format.
    The network layer comprises internal networks, WiFi access points connected to
    the internal network, and an internet connection. PACS which are not directly
    connected to the internet can be indirectly connected via the facility’s internal
    network [150] and are thus vulnerable to attacks. PACS servers exposed to the
    internet pose a high risk of security threats that could compromise the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of the medical images stored on the server. Threats
    in this layer could include social engineering attacks, physical access, network
    intrusions, denial-of-service attacks, and other types of attacks that target
    the network infrastructure [151]. The risk of these threats increases when the
    medical images are transmitted over unsecured networks or stored in an unencrypted
    form. For example, an attacker can access the internal network by hacking WiFi
    access points with critical vulnerabilities, such as “Krack” [152] and “BleedingBit”
    [153], where Bluetooth and WiFi electronics are integrated into a single chip.
    To address such threats, healthcare facilities should enable encryption between
    the hosts in their PACS network using proper SSL certificates [117] and remain
    up to date with patches to vulnerable network software. 4.1.3. Application-Layer
    Risk Analysis In the application layer, the risk of unauthorized access to the
    medical images stored on the PACS server can lead to malicious image modification.
    Although most healthcare facilities use local servers, a few have transitioned
    to cloud storage [154], increasing the potential attack surface. When a PACS server
    is exposed to the internet, there is a risk of various security threats that could
    compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the medical images
    stored on the server. Thus, a threat agent with motivation, expertise, and resources
    to gain unauthorized access to the PACS server can use the CT-GAN technique on
    medical imaging systems, posing a high risk of malicious image modification, leading
    to the loss of integrity of MRI/CT images, misdiagnosis of a severe disease, delayed
    treatment for the affected patients, and a loss of trust in the medical system.
    Vulnerabilities in medical imaging systems, such as inadequate encryption and
    security measures, increase the likelihood and severity of this risk. Mirsky et
    al. [117] also demonstrated how an attacker could compromise medical images on
    PACS servers by designing two conditional GAN models. One injects medical evidence
    into healthy images, while the other removes medical evidence from images with
    detectable tumors [117]. This approach is critical because it can cause a misdiagnosis
    of severe diseases. Pathologies requiring high-resolution scanning would become
    a higher risk of CT-GAN-related attacks [117]. To mitigate this risk, organizations
    should implement adequate security controls, such as encryption (of data in motion
    (DiM) and data at rest (DaR)) and access controls, and limit the exposure the
    PACS server has to the internet [117]. Additionally, organizations should reduce
    the sensitive data collected (e.g., pathologies that do not need a CT scan should
    be discouraged), prioritize pathologies that require high-resolution scanning
    for further security measures, and consider alternatives to CT scanning for pathologies
    that do not require it. Finally, organizations should use risk management methodologies,
    such as the STRIDE method, to identify and address specific threats posed by the
    CT-GAN technique. 4.1.4. Summary Malicious image modification by malicious actors
    can have severe consequences for the affected patients and the medical system.
    Attacker motivations comprise ideological, political, money, fame, and revenge
    motivations; attacker goals vary according to motivations, including to affect
    elections (political), hold data hostage (money), insurance fraud (money), terrorism
    (revenge), etc.; and the impact includes physical (injury and death), mental (trauma
    and life course), and monetary (loss and payouts). These point to nation/state
    actors and unorthodox communities, although independent actors (i.e., hobbyists
    and ethical hackers) may seek to explore such evolving uses of CT-GANs [117].
    Therefore, it is essential to implement appropriate security measures, such as
    strong authentication and access control, data encryption, and regular security
    assessments, to mitigate the risks at each IoT layer. We illustrate a scenario
    of malicious image manipulation in Table 3. 4.2. Risk 2: Malicious Synthesis and
    Camouflage of Genetic Sequences DNA synthesis has become more common [155]. It
    now is a non-trivial threat [156] where genetic sequences being synthesized and
    analyzed for various purposes, such as medical research, drug development, and
    forensic analysis, can be leaked to unauthorized parties or corrupted. 4.2.1.
    Perception-Layer Risk Analysis The perception-layer security risk analysis of
    the DNA synthesis IoT health device system involves identifying risks associated
    with the user’s interaction with the system. In this case, the risk involves the
    attack on the synthesizer through sound waves produced during the operation of
    the synthesizer. The acoustic side-channel attack is a type of “sonic malware”
    or “bioacoustic hacking” that can infer information about the synthesizer’s operation
    and the synthesized DNA sequence [157,158]. This attack requires close physical
    proximity to the DNA synthesizer, which means that healthcare or related personnel
    could be likely threat agents. Alternatively, an attacker can breach systems in
    proximity to the DNA synthesizer (e.g., remote monitoring systems, employee phone/laptop,
    etc.) and record the information leaked in the acoustic side-channel of the DNA
    synthesizer through an existing microphone(s) of those systems [157]. To mitigate
    acoustic side-channel risks, Faezi et al. [157] suggested using physically identical
    components placed in a geometrically uniform manner to remove any variations in
    acoustic emissions. Additionally, preventing unauthorized personnel from accessing
    any room containing a DNA synthesizer helps to maintain confidentiality of the
    synthesized DNA sequences. Any unapproved devices discovered in the same room
    as a DNA synthesizer should be reported as a security threat [157]. 4.2.2. Network-Layer
    Risk Analysis DNA synthesizers can connect to computers, external drives, and
    Ethernet cables. However, operators generally keep the machine disconnected from
    the internet and local networks or use secured protocols to eliminate the possibility
    of cyberattacks [157]. Although the possibility of network-layer attacks is limited,
    security risks target the communication between the DNA synthesizer and any integrated
    external system posing a significant risk to the confidentiality of the synthesized
    DNA sequences. Appropriate security measures, such as encryption, access controls,
    and monitoring for suspicious activity in any room containing a DNA synthesizer,
    can mitigate network-layer risks [157]. 4.2.3. Application-Layer Risk Analysis
    The application-layer security risk analysis of the DNA synthesis IoT health device
    system involves risk impacts stemming from perception-layer threats. When genetic
    sequences are manipulated, these corrupted sequences will be used in various medical
    applications, posing significant risks to genetic research and development [157].
    Routine risk assessments can help identify corrupted sequences and prevent malicious
    actors from exploiting them. 4.2.4. Summary DNA synthesis in medical research,
    drug development, and forensic analysis poses a significant security risk to genetic
    research and development integrity. The risk of malicious DNA synthesis and camouflage,
    particularly through acoustic side-channel attacks, can compromise genetic data
    and misdiagnose severe diseases. Faezi et al. [157] discuss attacker intent, such
    as industrial espionage and bioterrorism; however, because most attacks require
    close physical proximity to the DNA synthesizer, the healthcare or related personnel
    are the likely threat agent (although they can be recruited by a nation/state
    actor or an unorthodox group). To mitigate these risks, appropriate security measures
    must be implemented at the perception, network, and application layers, including
    removing variations in acoustic emissions, encryption, access controls, and monitoring
    for suspicious activity. We illustrate a scenario of a genetic sequences attack
    in Table 3. 4.3. Risk 3: Transport of Critical Materials and Unintentional Advertising
    IoT health devices often use expensive and potentially dangerous materials such
    as radioactive isotopes to function properly, such as in medical devices used
    in radiation therapy or medical imaging. These devices may have communication
    protocols that could be vulnerable to malicious attacks or unintentional exposure,
    leading to serious health risks for the public. For example, in the Goiânia accident,
    numerous people were exposed to radioactive material stolen from a hospital, and
    this could easily happen again [159]. Therefore, assessing the security risks
    at the perception, network, and application layers of these IoT health systems
    and implementing appropriate security measures to protect against such risks is
    important. We illustrate a scenario of attacks exploiting the unintentional advertising
    of critical materials in Table 3. 4.3.1. Perception-Layer Risk Analysis This IoT
    health device system’s perception layer involves medical materials containing
    high-activity radioactive materials. The lack of comprehensive security protocols
    to protect them can result in unintentional advertising, making them a target
    for theft. The theft of these materials can pose severe health risks to the public
    and lead to legal consequences, damaging the reputation of medical device manufacturers
    [160]. Therefore, marking these materials discreetly among professionals is crucial
    to avoid unnecessary exposure to unprepared populations and to implement appropriate
    security measures to protect against malicious attacks [161]. For instance, the
    International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has established guidelines for the security
    of radioactive sources, including physical protection, control and accounting
    requirements, and detection and response to unauthorized access [162]. 4.3.2.
    Network-Layer Risk Analysis The network layer of this IoT health device system
    involves assessing vulnerabilities in the communication protocols of IoTHDs. Network-layer
    security risks may involve the possibility of a malicious actor gaining access
    to IoTHD communication protocols and using them to identify and target medical
    materials containing radioactive isotopes. This could involve network scanning
    or malware to gain unauthorized access to the device or network. Implementing
    appropriate security measures to protect against such attacks, such as encryption
    and access controls, and conducting routine vulnerability testing is necessary.
    Novel engineering efforts are also required to develop more specified security
    protocols to protect against theft and the unintentional exposure of these materials
    and revised education and law enforcement for medical professionals and peripheral
    agencies [163,164]. 4.3.3. Application-Layer Risk Analysis Application-layer security
    risks could include a malicious actor exploiting vulnerabilities in the software
    or firmware of medical devices to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information
    or materials. This could include tactics such as exploiting software vulnerabilities
    or using malware to gain access to device settings or data. Implementing appropriate
    security measures, such as revising education and law enforcement for medical
    professionals and peripheral agencies to ensure the safe handling and disposal
    of radioactive materials, can significantly reduce the risk of malicious attacks
    and unintentional exposure. 4.3.4. Summary Overall, the security risks associated
    with medical devices that use expensive and potentially dangerous materials require
    careful consideration and appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the public
    and the reputation of medical device manufacturers. Healthcare facilities housing
    high-risk radioactive materials and devices become easy targets for theft or sabotage.
    Attackers can be highly motivated and well-resourced unorthodox communities or
    state-sponsored threat actors with specific agendas, such as economic or political
    gain, terrorism, or activism. This could include insiders with privileged access
    to the medical device manufacturer’s systems or facilities. Due to the high value
    of the medical materials involved, the attackers may be highly skilled and sophisticated
    and able to leverage a variety of attack vectors and techniques to achieve their
    objectives [165]. Thus, medical device manufacturers must keep abreast of potential
    malicious actors and implement appropriate security measures to protect against
    malicious attacks and unintentional exposure. This may require novel engineering
    efforts such as blockchain technology to enhance security and traceability in
    managing radioactive sources in medical facilities [164], and revised education
    and law enforcement for medical professionals and peripheral agencies [163]. Table
    3. Practical Security Risk Examples Inspired by Real-World Concerns.           4.4.
    Lessons Learned A multi-layer approach to security risk management is essential
    for IoT health device systems because it helps identify potential risks and threats
    across different system layers. IoT health devices involve interconnected components
    that operate at different levels, including perception, network, and application
    layers. Each of these layers has unique vulnerabilities and threats requiring
    different security measures. At the perception layer, the physical sensors and
    actuators that gather and control data are vulnerable to tampering, eavesdropping,
    and spoofing attacks. Network-layer vulnerabilities can result from unsecured
    wireless communications, weak authentication, and unencrypted data transmission.
    The application-layer vulnerabilities arise from the software and applications
    used to process and store data, including outdated software, unpatched vulnerabilities,
    and weak password policies. IoT health device manufacturers and healthcare organizations
    can identify and assess these vulnerabilities and threats across different system
    layers by taking a multi-layer approach to security risk management. This approach
    enables relevant stakeholders to implement appropriate security measures that
    address the specific risks at each layer. It also helps to ensure that security
    controls are integrated across all layers to provide end-to-end security. Furthermore,
    as we have seen from the scenarios discussed, a multi-layer approach can help
    identify risks across different layers. For instance, in the DNA synthesizers
    scenario, attacks may require physical proximity to the device (at the perception
    layer) and the ability to analyze acoustic signals (at the application layer).
    This highlights the importance of considering security risks spanning different
    IoT system layers and implementing security measures that address these risks.
    5. The Future of IoTHD Security Many new medical technologies are increasingly
    accepted and trusted by medical professionals [166,167,168]. Specifically, we
    will briefly address several innovations of the 4th industrial revolution, including
    artificial intelligence [169], blockchain [170,171], genetic engineering, quantum
    computing, and intersectional/combinatorial use. Innovations with these technologies
    can be expected to set the stage for novel exploits leading into the middle and
    latter parts of the 21st century. 5.1. Administrative (Laws and Policy Changes)
    As discussed above, modern medical devices vary in many aspects, such as software,
    operating systems, and communication protocols. More administrative efforts are
    needed to achieve cybersecurity in various medical devices, especially at the
    law and policy levels. First, governmental health agencies must specifically define
    their roles in cybersecurity administration toward devices [86]. Formulating a
    policy/framework and having vendors follow the guidelines is required. That said,
    a single reliable network that supports heterogeneous medical devices can be newly
    defined, and vendors could promptly integrate existing/new medical devices into
    the secure network. Depending on laws and policy, governments may decide whether
    they utilize existing networks or redesign a network for future IoTHDs [77]. For
    example, current MRI/CT images are connected to centralized pictures archiving
    and communication system (PACS) networks. Building a new framework should consider
    those existing networks [172]. In the new form of medical network frameworks,
    migrating legacy devices effectively is necessary. These gateway designs can include
    but are not limited to data transformation, network protocol design, and encryption/decryption
    schemes. Some medical devices do not have network capabilities; thus, a form of
    data transformation and secure uploading scheme will be needed. Otherwise, adversaries
    could conduct physical data theft attacks or man-in-the-middle attacks. Vendors
    are expected to abide by laws/policy changes at any level of cybersecurity. This
    can be developing security programs or adding two-factor authentication. Both
    administrations and vendors should collaboratively inspect the quality of security
    fulfillment. During the inspection periods, the government may define standardized
    action items as validated and deliverable tests. It is recommended that government
    health agencies define fine-grained requirements with expected outcomes, eventually
    decreasing overall timelines. Vendors can then provide corresponding item results
    in their lab settings. That way, health agencies can assess the risk management
    abilities of the manufacturers. This process should be performed seamlessly; existing
    users would not face denial-of-service experiences. Overall, being aware of cybersecurity
    for medical devices in laws and policies is important. When building a future
    framework/network, governmental and industrial efforts can expedite smoother transitions
    [173]. 5.2. Defending Forward A small but significant amount of the literature
    on the intersections of biosecurity and cybersecurity discusses the national security
    implications at risk. George (2020) speaks about this at length with the health
    of citizens and the status of bioeconomies [174]. Palmer and Karahan [13] discuss
    how intersectional research is important to consider in light of cybersecurity
    defense initiatives under the term “Defend Forward”, given how integral health
    infrastructure is. The careless integration of IoTHDs can threaten military operations
    if they can be widely and acutely exploited. It, therefore, appears sensible that
    further scrutiny be given to IoTHDs as they are considered for purchase and use
    in proximity to military and policing forces, regardless of the country. Further,
    such scrutiny is reasonable to be heightened as 4IR technologies, especially that
    of artificial intelligence, are employed [175]. Several AI-based studies [76,81,82,176,177]
    discuss this at length wherein AI can meaningfully present further hurdles if
    misused or taken advantage of. Future considerations toward defend forward applications
    should be mindful of health infrastructure that is accessible at these intersections.
    5.3. AI Innovations and New Directions According to Kruk et al. [178], about 3.6
    million people die annually due to poor quality healthcare [178]. There is also
    an employment gap of 5.9 million nurses globally [179]. This is alarming and has
    triggered a lot of technological innovations within the space of artificial intelligence
    (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to solve these challenges.
    Machine learning techniques have proven to learn complex representations and patterns
    to automate some clinical responsibilities. Internet of Things devices, on the
    other hand, have provided the capabilities to collect high-throughput heterogeneous
    rich data from patients and individuals for training and improving AI algorithms.
    Healthcare workers and patients expect AI to play an important role in diagnosis
    and treatment more effectively and accurately than the current methods [180,181,182,183].
    For example, as AI in computer vision improves image analysis, patients can obtain
    better image quality from medical devices with AI. Likewise, AI characteristics
    can improve the diagnosis and disease management process. This is not to say that
    the applications are not without hurdles, but there exists evidence for optimism
    over time as practitioners improve their integration of artificial intelligence-based
    modalities [184]. We can expect artificial intelligence to improve applications
    in resource-strapped areas. AI and machine learning have permeated every aspect
    of healthcare delivery—identifying and discovering new therapeutics, diagnosing
    diseases and infections, or aiding in treatment decision making. Toward the discovery
    of novel therapeutics and drugs, AI has been used to speed up the virtual screening
    of compounds to narrow the search space for lead compounds or potentially viable
    drugs [185]. This decreases the cost and time it will take to bring new drugs
    to market by pharmaceutical companies. Within disease diagnosis, AI has been used
    to diagnose disease and medical abnormalities from data collected with IoT devices
    (such as wearable fitness devices), medical imaging devices, and blood chemistry
    analyzers [186]. In terms of administering treatments, ML algorithms have been
    used to inform how limited clinical resources should be allocated [187]. For example,
    machine learning algorithms have been used to prioritize patients to maximize
    how clinical resources are used to treat patients. Moreover, ML algorithms have
    aided in determining the optimal time for administering certain treatments. AI
    and ML have shown incredible performance in the past and have demonstrated a lot
    of potential for the future. Despite these, AI in healthcare poses major drawbacks
    that must be addressed as the field evolves. One of these drawbacks is the lack
    of ethnic diversity in some datasets used in training these AI systems [188].
    An AI system is as good as the dataset it was built on. Thus, if certain groups
    of people are not represented in these training datasets, AI systems built on
    these datasets will perform terribly when used on underrepresented groups. Notable
    authors who have discussed issues and potential pathways to solutions regarding
    representation in data and the algorithms handling them can be found among [189,190,191,192,193,194,195].
    Moreover, many AI systems and IoT applications require good infrastructure, such
    as reliable internet and electricity. In resource-constrained environments where
    such amenities are a challenge, it will be almost impossible to deploy these technological
    innovations fully. Thus, more work is needed to investigate ways to deploy these
    technologies in resource-constrained settings. With access to medical data, generative
    AI can generate fake medical information, including MRI/CT images, for which new
    security means have been suggested [117,196,197]. Thus, data generated by IoTHDs
    must be validated by experts or high-performing discriminator models. Building
    a good discriminator model for data protection can help healthcare sectors to
    protect from malicious data fabrication attacks. This approach is needed given
    the data generated. The same aspects can be applied to other types of medical
    data resources. To extrapolate, future cyberbiosecurity models may apply more
    complicated discriminative techniques to detect generic sequences of DNA synthesis
    or other important biological outputs or signatures. In terms of biomolecules,
    biosystems, biomachine interfaces, and biocomputing, there exist many new and
    dynamic targets [155,198]. A single organization or academic institute cannot
    make this approach. Thus, region-wide or nation-wide data collection and research
    collaborations are needed and can expedite more complicated AI solutions [199,200,201,202,203].
    5.4. Innovations of Blockchain Technology Blockchain technology refers to cryptography-linked
    records in chained blocks. It is an emerging technology that may prove essential
    in shoring-up privacy concerns and adding needed avenues of automation in record
    processing [204]. With an eye on privacy, several groups have put forth security
    solutions at this intersection. For example, Kumar and Chand [205] revealed a
    model for using blockchain with the IoT in medical privacy contexts; this builds
    on efforts of protocols which aimed to cover the privacy of PII on the blockchain.
    Those concerned with regulation would be pleased to note that conversation at
    the intersection of blockchain, regulation, and hospital device application is
    alive. Sneha et al. [206] introduced a model that “emphasizes distribution and
    encryption of data, smart contracts, and permissioned blockchain-based architecture”
    within the scope of the FDA review process. Alblooshi et al. [171] developed a
    protocol specifically for medical devices. All in all, blockchain efforts exist
    and are growing. Testing, time, and adoption will tell if the efforts take root.
    They present novel avenues for managing medical data. These reflect just some
    of the innovations taking place with blockchain technology. 5.5. Genetic Engineering
    Genetic engineering is a 4IR technology that has been pacing rapidly [207,208,209,210].
    It allows skilled technicians to change fundamental aspects of organism DNA and
    make profound biomaterials. Of the latter, DNA is being investigated as a programmable
    4D scaffold that may improve wearable technology and offer further bio-digital
    functionality [211,212,213]; in fact, IoT functionality with DNA is already a
    matter of investigation. In the former case, genetic engineering has immediate
    healthcare implications as, for example, this can translate to effective gene
    therapies and allows for crafting tissue and organ grafts that have a much lower
    rejection from those these are implanted into. Sequencing, the decoding of one’s
    genome, is required for this. Thankfully, the cost to sequence genomes per base
    pair has fallen drastically, and the speed to do so on a population basis for
    analyzing a community is here. The advent of COVID-19 provided an important basis
    and means to implement effective genetic surveillance to study population susceptibility
    [214,215]. The means can be minimalized significantly. For example, researchers
    demonstrated that Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology could be utilized via
    a gaming laptop, allowing for sequencing on the go [216]. From the individual
    to the corporate entity to the nation-state, there are many reasons to be interested
    in sequencing. The same goes for information about genetic editing. Cheap gene
    engineering kits and exploration stations, via companies such as The Odin or Amino
    Labs, can be obtained cheaply, allowing for the potential of biomedical exploration
    and prototyping by larger swaths of individuals [207,208]. IoTHDs that utilize
    either gene editing or sequencing may find themselves targets. Companies might
    consider adding these products to their labs and sandboxes to test intermediate
    attacks between connected systems. Reverse engineering and purchasing more advanced
    units, especially industrial and hospital-grade sequencing and diagnostic units,
    may heighten preparedness. 5.6. Quantum Computing Quantum computing conducts complex
    computations by harnessing quantum states. Instead of calculations based on binary
    architecture, quantum computing can hold more information, significantly reducing
    computation times and energy usage. This concept of quantum bit computation could
    eventually lead to accurate diagnosis and precision medicine in healthcare [85].
    Although the advanced processing ability of quantum computing may threaten legacy
    encryption schemes, it can also be used to reinforce the current encryption systems
    with quantum computing power. There is ample opportunity for business opportunities
    in exploring both sides of these uses. 5.7. Intersectional Fusions of 4th IR Technologies
    One potential innovation to be mindful of is the intersection of multiple 4IR
    technologies in the future. An example can be found in a recent avant-garde project
    that fuses biotechnology and blockchain in a decentralized autonomous organization
    (or DAO for short) called BitMouseDAO, sought to encode cryptocurrency into a
    mouse [217]. This would involve genetically engineering the mouse’s DNA to hold
    the key to access an amount of Bitcoin. Fifty (50) years ago, this idea would
    have been considered poor science fiction, but the means of technology exist.
    However, less than twenty (20) years ago, considerable amounts of digital data
    were converted into DNA reliably stored and played back in text or video format.
    In the last decade, a researcher and his team managed to encode malware in DNA
    and use it to perform a remote attack on a DNA sequencer, which spelled immediate
    implications for future healthcare operations [155]. The takeaway is the value
    of pondering what creative teams may produce in their goal to produce novel attacks
    on IoTHDs. It is not out of the question that institutions may one day see novel
    attacks that act on the synchronized actions of patients who seek medical services
    that access their genetic information under the right combination of spiked and
    submitted samples. It is possible from here that complex bio-digital DDOS attacks
    can be made functional for more devastating malware, perhaps in the form of a
    condensed but dynamic machine learning algorithm that eventually winds its way
    through a facility. This scenario is wonderfully contrived for the time being.
    Thankfully, this is not a practical attack in the next few years, but with time,
    testing, and a large enough value target, it very well could be in ten (10) years
    by an enterprising group. Underestimation is an ever-present vulnerability that
    must be frequently assessed. 6. Concluding Remarks The world of medical devices
    is diverse, and varieties that utilize internet connectivity add to this diversity
    and increase use. IoT health devices have become increasingly prevalent in the
    healthcare sector, offering a range of benefits, such as remote monitoring, real-time
    tracking, and improved patient outcomes. Thus, when rapid technological advancements
    outpaced the gradual advancement of healthcare cybersecurity, security concerns
    became difficult to manage. Each interconnected medical device has unique security
    risks, and there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to securing IoTHDs. In this
    paper, we have provided a survey and mapping of IoTHDs, regarding healthcare components
    and the communities that use them, a multi-layer security risk management analysis,
    and future and evolving considerations. Each device presents risks that we have
    classified into the STRIDE threat categories, showing the need to consider the
    security risks of IoTHDs in their environment and focus on security risk management.
    We introduced the multi-layer approach to conducting security risk management
    for these IoTHD systems as it provides a comprehensive view of the system’s security
    posture and enables the implementation of appropriate security measures that address
    vulnerabilities and threats at each layer while ensuring end-to-end security.
    We do not cover all of the forms of IoTHDs but provide a useful introduction to
    thinking about the threat landscape of IoTHDs, proposing that all adoption of
    IoTHDs is done carefully and with the utmost consideration for security risk management.

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) 1. Introduction Nowadays, several municipalities
    implement the smart city model [1] to improve the quality of life for their citizens
    and the efficient use of city resources. Intelligent services can decrease operational
    costs and resource expenditure in smart cities. They can enhance performance and
    operations in a wide variety of smart city applications (SCAs) including transportation,
    healthcare, energy, education, and many more. Smart services are provided by various
    cutting-edge technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples of these technologies
    include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data analytics,
    and robots. IoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful
    human life benefits [2]. IoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart
    things into urban environments where innovative services are offered to support
    every activity at any time and from any location [2]. Things are monitored by
    IoT applications that make direct decisions for their efficient management. Moreover,
    things state their conditions, such as battery status and fault reporting for
    prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state of the infrastructure
    and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices can also obtain physical
    environment information such as temperature. In a CPS, the computation, networking,
    and physical processes are put together to control and monitor the physical environment
    of a smart city [4]. In smart cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical connections
    between the virtual and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can be
    sustained by the ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform
    for computation and IoT data storage [5]. FogC offers reduced latency, greater
    mobility, location awareness, streaming, and real-time response for SCAs [6].
    Smart cities have dispersed vast numbers of sensors, and thus large-scale data
    processing requires a complex infrastructure. Robotics in the cloud can be an
    effective computing tool for IoT applications that require a lot of data processing
    [7]. To improve the services offered by smart cities, big data analytics is employed
    to generate intelligent and optimal temporary and lasting decisions [8]. The abovementioned
    technologies are used to implement numerous smart city services [9,10]. For instance,
    intelligent transportation services are applied to improve route planning and
    avoid jamming in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety and
    make possible self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart traffic
    light controls are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy
    management and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids
    and smart buildings. These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable
    energy. Additional smart services are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges,
    tunnels, water networks, train and subway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural
    health monitoring is also feasible using smart services [11]. Last but not least,
    there are smart services that focus on monitoring the environment, public safety,
    and security of citizens [12]. All these smart city services necessitate a reliable
    networking infrastructure to efficiently exchange messages between the modules
    of a smart city system implementing a particular smart service. In particular,
    smart city services need a variety of networking and communication technologies
    for their completion because they are proposed for dissimilar scales. For example,
    smart services for smart buildings must be implemented based on Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
    or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols. On the other hand, smart services
    for the smart grid must be mainly implemented using the WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) network
    protocol. From another viewpoint, smart city services can exploit dissimilar network
    and communication models and solutions. Until now, the networking and communication
    components of smart city systems have received little research attention. To the
    best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey of network architectures and protocols
    for IoT applications in smart cities does not exist and is the goal of this study.
    The communication and networking issues involved in smart city systems are examined
    in this study. This paper considers networking technologies, topologies, and communication
    requirements for such systems. It also examines if current network protocols are
    appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent developments
    in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active area, this paper
    is important to support new research in this field. The paper contributes as follows:
    It presents network requirements of the major SCAs including intelligent transportation,
    smart buildings, pipeline monitoring and control, smart water networks, smart
    grids, and manufacturing control and monitoring. It reviews networking architectures
    used for the above applications focusing mainly on the protocols’ suitability.
    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;
    Section 3 presents network requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;
    Section 4 and Section 5 analyze protocols and network architectures for smart
    grids, smart buildings, smart water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart
    transportation; Section 6 summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open
    research directions; lastly, Section 8 concludes the paper. Figure 1 provides
    the layout of the survey. Figure 1. The layout of the survey paper. Systematic
    Literature Review Article Selection Method: We provide a Systematic Literature
    Review (SLR) methodology [13] with particular notice to studies related to networking
    architectures or protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. The SLR was employed
    to systematically study networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications
    in smart cities. We proposed a research question to cope with the key issues of
    networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. Question
    Formalization: Key issues and challenges in the field were identified. Such issues
    were network architectures for IoT, network protocols for IoT, IoT applications
    for smart cities, and smart city applications. This study answers the next research
    question: RQ: What is the emphasis of networking architectures or protocols for
    IoT applications in smart cities? This question determines the number of studies
    focusing on network architectures and protocols for IoT applications for smart
    cities that have been published to date to emphasize its significance in smart
    cities. Article Selection Process: The article selection process is performed
    in three stages: Automated keyword-based search; Selection of the article based
    on the title, abstract, and quality of the publication; Elimination of inappropriate
    articles. In the first stage, the search process is automatically performed using
    searching on popular academic databases such as IEEE explorer, ACM, Wiley, Springer,
    Science Direct, SAGE, and Google Scholar. The following search string was defined
    by adding other spellings of the main elements to find relevant articles. The
    search string was as follows: (“IoT” OR “Internet of Things”) AND (“network architecture”
    OR “network protocol” AND “smart cities” OR “smart rural” OR “smart village” OR
    “smart traffic” OR “smart transportation” OR “smart street lights” OR “smart energy”
    OR “smart grid” OR “smart buildings” OR “smart home” OR “smart residence” OR “home
    automation” OR “smart water” or “smart waste management” OR “smart healthcare”
    OR “smart rural” AND “Cloud Computing” OR “edge computing” OR “software-defined
    networking” OR “Artificial Intelligence”). We found 264 articles from journals,
    conference proceedings, books, and patents. These articles were published between
    2013 and 2023. In the article selection based on the quality of the publisher
    stage, the search string was constrained by searching for conference papers and
    journal articles of IEEE, ACM, Sage, Wiley, Science Direct, and Springer, in order
    to guarantee that only high-quality publications and articles were selected for
    the review. Consequently, 240 articles were selected. In the third stage of eliminating
    the inappropriate articles, a Quality Assessment Checklist (QAC) based on [13]
    was developed, wherein those articles emerging from the initial search were refined.
    After reading the abstracts, we eliminated the unrelated articles. The entire
    body of the remaining papers was checked, and those which were not related to
    our concerned field were also crossed out. After eliminating inappropriate articles,
    only 226 studies were identified. 2. Smart City Applications This section discusses
    the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what type of assistance is
    needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs, their advantages and
    design problems were addressed. In the energy sector, SCAs are being used to increase
    the reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of electric energy generation
    and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart grid is a new power grid system
    that automatically collects and reacts to available information about supplier
    and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply self-monitoring and superior
    control mechanisms for power generation and consumer demand, improving grid reliability
    and efficiency. CPS systems are also used to manage the process of producing renewable
    energy from wind turbines [15]. Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings
    to monitor and manage energy consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the
    buildings, including the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems;
    appliances; and lighting systems. Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep
    track of the current state of the environment and energy consumption, are typically
    included in smart building systems. A centralized monitoring and control system
    receives observations and measurements from these sensors. Based on reported observations,
    current operational circumstances, and environmental factors, the control system
    employs intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems employed in the buildings
    to optimize energy consumption. Intelligent transportation is another SCA that
    has attracted a lot of interest in the transportation sector. Applications related
    to vehicle safety are among the most crucial types of such applications. Vehicles
    can be equipped with a variety of safety features, such as blind spot monitoring,
    emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane change warning signs.
    To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-automatic operations.
    Real-time and reliability support in detection and response are these applications’
    most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing vehicle safety must be
    dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects such as threat observations,
    decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software cannot handle
    high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices and guarantee real-time
    and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial
    SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring
    equipment to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed
    data and intelligent software that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.
    Intelligent traffic light controls, which incorporate device monitoring across
    numerous locations to precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application
    of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent
    traffic lights. Water networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase
    their intelligence, efficiency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems
    are integrated into water networks to add smart characteristics to the processes
    of water distribution [19]. Offering early warning systems to identify problems
    in water networks is one of these duties. For instance, it is simple to identify
    leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary fixes can be implemented to prevent water
    wastage and future network threats or damage [20]. WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses
    is another SCA. Such monitoring provides well-organized control for appropriate
    soil, climate, lighting, and water level in greenhouses [21]. Other smart city
    systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control, monitor, and improve
    manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare systems based on edge
    computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine the physical health of users
    [25]. Figure 2 shows some important applications including smart traffic surveillance
    and management, smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste
    management, smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart
    home. Figure 2. Facilitating networking and communication amongst SCAs. Analysis
    of Smart City Applications/Systems This subsection analyses the SCAs shown in
    Figure 2. Smart Traffic Surveillance Systems: These systems are based on centralized
    processes and may fail due to networking problems. Thus, to automate such an innovative
    system, centralized and distributed methods must be used to maintain local servers.
    Javaid et al. [26] suggested a smart traffic management system using a mixture
    of centralized and decentralized processes to optimize the flow of vehicles on
    roads and an algorithm to manage a variety of traffic conditions efficiently.
    In the context of smart cities, effective traffic management implies that a decision-making
    model identifies and quantifies traffic congestion as well as predicts traffic
    patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered a theoretical analysis that takes into account
    such effective traffic management. Notably, existing decision-making models are
    primarily devoted to urban and highway traffic management, not considering the
    closed campuses and collector roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] identified this
    weakness and proposed an IoT-based system model that collects, processes, and
    stores real-time traffic data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based traffic
    management system, various challenges emerge. These challenges include security
    issues, extremely sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required
    adjustments, and specific information fields in the protocol header and structure,
    as well as higher costs. Smart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of
    health parameters, these systems are progressively being associated with and connected
    via the Internet to numerous types of available smart wearable sensing and computing
    devices. These systems face several problems [29] that must be resolved. A security/privacy
    perspective, inter-realm authentication, interoperability issues, device-to-device
    informal communication, and collection and management of medical data are among
    the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30] addressed issues related to cyber-security
    while using IoT for such applications. They sought to examine secure techniques’
    deployment and implementation from the perspective of preventing and reducing
    cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys and reviews [31,32] on smart
    healthcare applications tackle the problem of integrating IoT systems with any
    healthcare application particularly. Weather and Air Quality Monitoring Systems:
    These systems use environmental monitoring stations, which are extremely pricey
    to acquire and maintain. For example, these stations require engineers with specialized
    skill sets and data analysts. Therefore, it is impractical to deploy such monitoring
    stations densely. Instead, they are often deployed sparsely, which creates the
    problem of limited spatial resolutions for useful measurements. Lately, cheap
    monitoring sensors have evolved in the market, significantly assisting in refining
    the granularity of monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors
    [33] emphasized the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with
    air quality monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle
    with the issue of cross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.
    Moreover, these sensors are extremely susceptible to unexpected variations in
    humidity, temperature, and wind direction, and as a result, their accuracy deteriorates
    with time. A recalibration routine might be a way to maintain and enhance such
    accuracy. However, because it would take a lot more time and work, this technique
    is highly improbable and would not work for large-scale deployments. In a weather
    monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex and involves three steps [34]:
    (1) Observing: It can be performed by monitoring satellite imagery, precipitation
    reports, surface data, and gathering data from other nearby forecasters. (2) Forecasting:
    It can be performed by forecasters as short-term and long-term forecasting. Short-term
    forecasting is carried out by evaluating the current weather conditions and projecting
    them over the next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics of the weather.
    Long-term forecasting, however, is possible through weather (numerical) modeling
    and the projection of such modeling using computer simulations. To produce these
    simulations for future forecasting, these modeling techniques use environmental
    data from satellite photography, weather balloons, and surface observations. Following
    completion of the forecasting, the forecasters translate the produced simulated
    expected output into a perceptible format for non-specialists so that they can
    respond appropriately. (3) Communicating: Finally, they communicate such output
    or forecasted information to appropriate authorities. Despite the fact that all
    of these computer models are used to forecast the weather, the success of each
    one is largely influenced by three different elements: (a) the quantity of precise
    data; (b) the length of time needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity
    of dynamic atmospheric weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data
    for a region is the placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed
    distant from rural areas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather
    enough information for desert, sea, or even rural areas to supply the computer
    models used to predict weather conditions accurately. Forecasters also use satellite
    data to combat this issue. However, because of cloud cover and significant changes
    in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, satellite data accuracy can occasionally
    be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and map information or surface/land
    features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence, it further impacts temperature
    and precipitation values significantly. This further makes things harder for a
    computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there is a need to re-evaluate and
    re-modify such models’ mathematical equations so that they can predict the changes
    more accurately. Smart Waste Management Systems: Automated smart waste management
    is crucial for the following reasons: (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure;
    (2) thin or delicate waste collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective
    waste logistics management; (4) insufficient use of cutting-edge trash treatment
    and recycling technologies; and (5) lack of workers and specialists with the necessary
    technical and non-technical skills to handle garbage disposal and the associated
    infrastructures. Smart waste management schemes include various steps such as
    (1) waste collection; (2) differentiation of waste as per their biological and
    physical properties; (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage disposal
    infrastructures/treatment plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova
    and Porras [35] identified issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing
    data from smart deployed sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some
    operational issues such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure
    and smartly managing waste vehicle routes. Smart Street Lighting Systems: This
    system is a network-oriented solution that uses streetlights fitted with specific
    actuators and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities and connectivity interfaces
    [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a mechanism that
    gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting with
    the use of smart wireless nodes (fitted out with numerous forms of sensors and
    actuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the streetlights,
    and they are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device. Zanella et
    al. [37] insist that their system could assist in gathering environmental parameters
    such as humidity, air temperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors stated
    that optimizing street lighting efficiency is a paramount concern that must be
    addressed. This monitoring system makes it possible to maximize efficiency since
    it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity in response to the time of
    day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this system is simple and
    built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns that require
    particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions and communication
    among heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right light lamp is critical
    for a power-efficient lighting mechanism. Their selection is based on how effective
    they are in terms of power usage and lifespan. The existing metropolitan system
    relies on Metal Halide (MH) or High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs,
    these bulbs are frequently seen as being inefficient in terms of power consumption
    and requiring significant maintenance, which adds significantly to the cost. In
    addition, the system should be designed following the advised design standards
    (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201) [36]. Currently, there are
    three kinds of control systems for smart lighting systems in use: centralized,
    decentralized, and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a variety
    of security assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem
    thus far. Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and
    security of its residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention,
    dealing with natural calamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data
    collection is first and foremost important for the designing portion of these
    applications. Depending on the gathered facts, the development of intelligence
    (which aids in making important decisions) and the ability to respond swiftly
    and quickly are the issues that require special attention. When it comes to gathering
    data, we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated traffic sensors. A developer
    can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will conduct predictive
    analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore, this
    kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather significant information
    that will help the relevant authorities (e.g., the fire safety department, the
    police department, and law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and
    preventive measures. The concept of widespread surveillance has important benefits
    for security and safety. However, keeping track of such vast amounts of data also
    prompts a lot of worries and issues for designers and developers, including storage;
    the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and, most importantly, the question
    of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track of each individual
    (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether this kind of
    widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such as China and
    India, where a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation. Further, Gharaibeh
    et al. [38] claimed that combining information transmission technologies with
    well-implemented data analytics models is necessary for quick and swift collaboration.
    To save as many lives as possible during natural disasters, it is imperative to
    gather, assess, and communicate vital information to the relevant authorities.
    As a result, there is currently a lot of work being done to enhance the performance
    of information exchange systems. Although this system is based on the IoT concept
    and is relatively simple, it faces important problems that need consideration,
    such as complex networking solutions and information sharing across heterogeneous
    devices on time (time-sensitive application). Smart Residence/Home Automation:
    A smart home has highly developed systems such as a control system for devices
    or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems, TVs, and other smart appliances),
    automated door openers, smart appliances that may send users remote status updates,
    smart refrigerators, and washing machines. A user can control the majority of
    smart home appliances remotely with two recently produced gadgets: Google Home
    and Amazon Echo. In a smart home, the end-user demands a high-speed internet connection,
    so they can access networking sites that control the home with HD live streaming
    services. In contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to
    computing servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence,
    data management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to
    concentrate on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than
    just recommending distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38].
    The concept of smart home automation raises serious concerns about security and
    privacy risks. A smart home includes security monitoring systems with motion sensors,
    wirelessly opening smart door locks, televisions, phones, and other smart appliances
    that are highly outfitted with cameras and microphones. Although these gadgets
    improve the system, little research has been done on their privacy and security
    features. If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we will discover
    that their manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.
    Indeed, Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully
    examining Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market.
    They argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already
    more privileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated applications.
    As a result, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this, according to a published
    document by WikiLeaks [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the
    tools to access, control, and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the
    world. Furthermore, criminal entities and hackers could seize control of smart
    personal devices, capture delicate private information, and exploit that information
    immorally typically through user tracking and profiling. Additionally, a hacker
    may break into one of these smart applications, grab vital information, and then
    use it to launch any kind of attack. For instance, based on motion sensors, security
    camera feeds, and power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where and when
    to break into the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized
    parties, they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware
    and software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard
    against all these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators, etc.,
    are impervious to such security and privacy attacks. Smart Grid Networks: The
    functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirectional (i.e., electricity
    is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers). Electricity
    has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks to the
    deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in an open-loop
    fashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures in the
    distribution sector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little or no real-time
    knowledge of the system’s operating conditions and dynamically changing load.
    There are also several technical, economic, and environmental problems with this
    conventional approach. Therefore, this conventional system must become dependable,
    manageable, and scalable, as well as flexible, secure, and interoperable [42].
    The smart grid is the next invention of the Electric Power System (EPS) that incorporates
    quicker, more secure, and reliable communication networks [43]. Smart grids supplement
    the conventional electricity grid by incorporating renewable energy sources such
    as biomass, solar energy, and wind energy. These energy sources are much cleaner
    and more ecologically friendly than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil
    fuels. However, it is important to identify the most suitable communication technology
    for the smart grid’s successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s
    overall communication style is unique compared with conventional network communication
    patterns. The communication network architecture of the smart grid must be able
    to handle information exchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,
    and numerous smart meters in such a particular environment with little to no human
    intervention. This type of communication, called Device-to-Device (D2D) communication,
    is autonomous and may be initiated in response to an event or at regular intervals.
    Notably, depending on how these smart grid applications were built, their QoS
    requirements and characteristics differ greatly in terms of delay, burst size,
    and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement of a smart meter
    event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent grid networks,
    the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the same network present
    the issues of flexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications based on the
    smart grid can be developed and implemented using the current wireless and wired
    networking infrastructure and technologies. For some devices, such as smart meters,
    designing and standardizing acceptable smart grid-based protocols is a critical
    matter [45]. Furthermore, these smart grid-based networks are too dependent on
    intelligent sensors, actuators, and other devices. This makes them extremely vulnerable
    to attacks by malicious users. These smart grids could be taken over by malevolent
    users or hackers, who could then obtain unauthorized access to many smart meters
    and alter crucial data. Moreover, as the existing electricity system is insufficient
    for establishing smart grid systems, high-level adjustments to current power infrastructure
    scenarios are required. Subsequently, these smart systems require high installation
    costs because the installation requires a large number of smart meters, sensors,
    and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efficient operation of
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free
    network channel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent
    applications. Many surveys [42,43,44,45,47] reviewed communication frameworks
    for smart grids, smart-grid-based networking technologies, traffic management,
    and the requirements of numerous smart grid applications. Further, Kansal and
    Bose [48] presented their insights on transmission grid applications regarding
    their latency and bandwidth requirements. 3. Network Requirements for SCAs This
    section considers several communication requirements including reliability, delay
    tolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security, network type, heterogeneous
    network support, and mobility support. It also studies the aptness of different
    network protocols for dissimilar SCAs. Smart city services and applications need
    robust and dependable communication support as well as an effective networking
    infrastructure, which will permit competent message-sharing procedures among the
    components of the smart city systems [49]. Every smart city system has an intricate
    networking architecture made up of various networking components. Therefore, smart
    city systems are innately required to have a variety of networking requirements.
    To access the far-off destination, which may be clouds, the network traffic from
    a broad variety of deployed diverse applications uses a common networking architecture
    and resources. These resources may consist of switches, routers, communication
    connections (links), and other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing
    faraway clouds or far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently
    brings up problems with high packet loss probability, significant delay, and constrained
    network bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered
    when developing, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart
    cities. Otherwise, users would be reluctant to approve the use of such applications
    in the absence of adequate security safeguards. Such intelligent applications
    need a high-speed networking environment where the quick reaction may be managed
    with the support of the ability of a fast-processing speed. Furthermore, a variety
    of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city, based on their usefulness
    and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have different networking
    requirements, particularly in terms of response and security [50]. For example,
    the networking requirements of smart emergency response systems are quite different
    compared to other applications such as smart healthcare systems. Emergency response
    smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick to react [50]. In contrast,
    smart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily need to be especially
    dynamic. − Network Protocols: Monitoring applications for smart cities often use
    a dense network of heterogeneous sensor nodes, including fixed sensor nodes, mobile
    sensor nodes, and crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for
    Machines (LTE-M), extended coverage GSM IoT, and fifth-generation (5G) technologies
    [52] are intriguing options to support such heterogeneous networks. First, the
    bulk of crowd-sensing nodes (smartphones) is already supported by LTE communications.
    Consequently, no further wireless communication devices are required. To save
    energy, LTE and 5G can be utilized on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads)
    to allow the data gathered by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring
    center via base stations (the backbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.
    − Zigbee [53], WiFi, and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary
    nodes to communicate within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing
    the sensor node clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network
    connectivity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes
    maintenance simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies
    also make possible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance
    of real-time monitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance, can
    accommodate video streams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.
    The fast data rates provided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous for
    the sink nodes or clusters. The use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)
    in structural health monitoring applications of bridges, tunnels, or towers is
    fairly common. The cluster heads will be able to send the vibration data in this
    situation in real time. In conclusion, practically all applications for smart
    city monitoring that demand a high data throughput and minimal delay may be satisfied
    by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there are some new sensor node standards, such as
    IEEE 802.11 ah [55], LoRaWAN [56], and Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband
    protocols offer numerous advantages: greater coverage, improved scalability, reduced
    energy usage, and increased device longevity. Researchers have tested these standards
    in more than a few applications, including street lighting, energy metering, and
    home automation, even though some are still being discussed and revised. The new
    narrowband communication standards enable the sensor nodes to run more sustainably,
    which is beneficial for applications that aim for long-term monitoring. In addition
    to these protocols and standards, the FogC architecture [58] aids in monitoring
    smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile users (the potential crowd-sensing
    providers) and the cloud are connected via fog servers. These fog servers are
    WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users are more inclined to
    participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing measurements
    to the fog server in just one hop, significantly decreasing the cost and energy
    usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the
    FogC architecture, such as the nearby traffic conditions. The service latency
    and response time are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates
    directly from the fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone
    network. Lastly, using the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is crucial
    to getting the best possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and cost. The
    networks may be hierarchical so that diverse roles and functions can be assigned
    at various layers to increase the networks’ dependability and cost-effectiveness.
    As a result, certain nodes may be able to transmit data utilizing various protocols.
    − Bandwidth requirements: Many video applications in smart cities require high
    bandwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors capture video from the physical
    environment. Moreover, video transmission is more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional
    scalar data traffic in IoT. Examples of these applications are intelligent multimedia
    surveillance systems for home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring
    systems, traffic monitoring systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based
    monitoring of an environmental system. − Delay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart
    transportation, only tolerate a small amount of end-to-end delay. For example,
    to prevent imminent danger to the vehicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data
    that are being relayed must arrive within microseconds. Therefore, the control
    systems must react in time. However, other applications have a higher tolerance
    for delays [49]. Such applications rely on data monitoring and information gathering
    for upcoming analysis. − Power Consumption: Another crucial need for applications
    is power consumption. Smart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy
    sources can tolerate protocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45]. Other
    applications have medium power needs and require energy sources with limited capacities.
    One example of such an application is intelligent transportation. Other applications
    demand protocols with low or very low energy consumption characteristics since
    they have limited energy resources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), smart water
    networks, and pipeline monitoring for gas and oil are a few examples of such uses.
    − Reliability: The majority of applications have medium reliability requirements.
    A typical example of such applications is smart water networks. Some other applications
    have high-reliability necessities such as intelligent transportation and smart
    grids [49]. − Security: The majority of applications need medium to high security.
    Applications such as production control and monitoring, for instance, need medium
    security, whilst others, such as smart grids, need high security because of the
    sensitivity of the data and the importance of the operations carried out [50].
    − Heterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city systems use networking
    protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent transportation and
    smart buildings are two examples of such systems. These protocols must coexist
    in such situations without conflicting with one another. To ensure seamless and
    effective operation, it is also necessary to correctly map the control information
    in the headers at the various networking stack tiers used by the many heterogeneous
    protocols and networks. − Wired/wireless connectivity: The majority of SCAs that
    include wireless connectivity are UAVs and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines.
    Others, including intelligent transportation and smart buildings, use wired and
    wireless connectivity [50]. In these situations, wired networking may be used
    for communication within a specific physical system (such as within a UAV), while
    wireless communication may be used to link the physical system to other such systems
    that are comparable to it or to the backbone and infrastructure networks. − Mobility:
    Some systems, such as the smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil, and
    smart water networks, have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such as
    UAVs and intelligent transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility
    smart city systems can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and
    adaptable to node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control
    messages and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.
    Table 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network
    with low, medium, or high traffic rates and supporting high or low mobility of
    devices. Each SCA is based on different protocols and requires different bandwidth
    and latency tolerance. In each SCA, the number of devices involved differs. Table
    1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements. 3.1. Additional
    Challenges − Interoperability: Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous
    networking protocols that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at
    the physical and data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated
    seamlessly, these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks,
    the IEEE 1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface
    between physical/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this
    function. Future research should focus on the creation of similar protocols to
    increase the support system for smart city systems. − Scalability: A smart city
    platform must manage many devices that are connected to the city’s infrastructure.
    Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously produced and consumed
    by devices and client applications, must be stored and processed. The platform
    must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests from users and services
    that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change depending on the features
    of the city as well as the installed applications and services. Recently, Del
    Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source smart
    city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale systems,
    apps, and services for smart cities. − Load Balancing: To maximize the usage of
    resources, load balancing assigns appropriate resources (i.e., network resources,
    storage capacity, computational resources, and energy resources) to user tasks.
    A large-scale IoT network performs better and avoids overload thanks to an effective
    load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time, cost, throughput, performance, and
    resource usage are all improved in terms of QoS parameters. − The Cloud/Edge/FogC
    Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation of smart city prototypes.
    These computing paradigms efficiently aid in the gathering, upkeep, and analysis
    of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that demand advanced processing
    and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems for smart cities
    have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time applications present
    the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently, FogC and Edge Computing
    have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing, implementing, deploying,
    and controlling such systems/applications. These paradigms bring computing resources
    closer to the IoT/device plane so that the primary computation can be done locally
    [65,66]. Each computing paradigm offers particular assistance based on the requirements
    of the application at hand. For example, to support a cloud-based SCA, ClCom offers
    centralized storage and processing capacity. For certain SCAs, ClCom can offer
    scalable processing power and data storage [5]. The features of ClCom (e.g., powerful
    processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge software services)
    can be used to provide various support services for a variety of SCAs. ClCom can
    be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The city’s ClCom services
    can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs to gather, process,
    store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes of data are gathered
    across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The sophisticated platforms
    required for storing and analyzing this massive amount of data to improve operations
    and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing. To effectively support SCAs,
    the communication between city sensors and actuators and ClCom may involve various
    communication requirements. The network architectures used in the smart city should
    meet these requirements. Smart applications require the integration of sensors,
    actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function well with a robust network
    that offers good communication services linking both sides. The fact that cloud
    services are either provided at a single central location or across numerous distributed
    platforms in various locations is another problem that occurs when adopting ClCom
    for a smart city. For many cloud applications, the distributed ClCom strategy
    can offer greater quality and dependability support [67]. However, it is frequently
    necessary to establish effective communication channels between the distributed
    ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability and
    efficiency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control
    of network resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot be
    avoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated the QoS
    requirements of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment to recognize
    QoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog) that is inspired
    by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture [69] for a
    FogC system. 3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks A smart city
    network has the following features [70]: Large Densities: A smart city network
    has a very large density as thousands of smart devices are distributed in the
    area of a city. Abnormal Traffic Patterns: Cascading or synchronization among
    smart devices produces extremely bursty or correlated traffic patterns. These
    traffic patterns differ from the regular social-generated traffic patterns on
    which most existing schemes and technology used in our society are based. Disorganized
    Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless connectivity features, smart
    city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology. The problem arises when
    smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless channels, where packet losses
    caused by wireless channel special properties are extremely common and eventually
    have an impact on the functioning of the smart city system. Therefore, it appears
    very improbable that a single high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.
    Heterogeneity: SCAs use a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,
    latency, throughput, and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates
    at a unique trade-off threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist
    on a single platform. Coexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication
    technologies used in smart cities are distributed over the same radio space. At
    the same time, independent radio infrastructures are connected through a variety
    of wireless channels. Under such circumstances, the SCA must handle interference
    issues with competence. Security and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to
    several risks from malevolent users. The majority of specialized smart sensors,
    actuators, and other intelligent devices are developed by designers without considering
    security measures. Such applications may be highly vulnerable due to hostile actors’
    ease of access to these cutting-edge technologies and potential threats to people’s
    security and privacy. The main challenges for smart city networks are as follows
    [70]: Lack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies
    for Personal Area Networks (PANs) and the IEEE 802.11 groups for wireless LANs
    adopt the concept of single-hop ad-hoc networking. These standards permit direct
    communication between two devices that are in the transmission range of each other.
    At the same time, the multi-hop ad-hoc networking paradigm enables the communication
    between any two devices which are not necessarily in their transmission range
    [71]. A problem that researchers must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous
    sets of devices (i.e., actuators, sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate
    uniformly without any standardization. Global distributors and manufacturers must
    propose and accept standardized network solutions that enable communication between
    diverse devices on homogeneous communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    is the dominant solution that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical
    Layer. This standard deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication
    range, and power consumption. Several revisions or amendments (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g
    and IEEE 802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released. The IEEE 802.15.4g
    amendment allows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing data rates and communication
    ranges compatible with neighborhood mesh (wide) networks. Then, it is followed
    by another cutting-edge modification, known as IEEE 802.15.4e, which modifies
    and enhances the method used by devices to access wireless channels while also
    using time-slotted channel hopping mode. This hopping mode further delivers low-power
    consumption and improved dependability. From another viewpoint, many researchers
    customized appropriate upper-layer protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They
    made the necessary modifications there to make smart applications compatible with
    conventional infrastructure. Since the network of low-power smart devices is confined,
    the researchers developed numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make
    them easily adaptable. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72]
    and 6LoWPAN [73], which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.
    Interference problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same
    radio space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless
    channels. Because of this, the smart application must handle interference problems
    in such situations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate
    and be compatible with one another. Vertical handover (soft): Multiple radios
    are used by the rapidly expanding number of smart devices being developed. These
    devices should be able to recognize and use the best interface that is currently
    available while balancing power usage and throughput. D2D Communications: In the
    IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication demands. Unfortunately, conventional
    network gateways cannot handle such generated messages from heterogeneous devices.
    Short Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support and recommend acceptable
    performance for longer data packet scenarios. However, smart devices communicate
    with one another using short messages (since most of them are tiny and operate
    over low-powered battery devices). To this end, short communicating messages will
    positively impact network congestion detection and avoidance policies and promote
    in-band aggregation. Local Network Traffic Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-specific
    devices frequently use the same network infrastructure. However, most cellular
    data networks are exclusively planned, implemented, deployed, and managed for
    smartphone usage. Fitting traffic from these heterogeneous devices onto a single
    platform is now the main challenge that cellular data network providers face.
    It is difficult to integrate the traffic from these two types of heterogeneous
    devices into the same network infrastructure due to several intrinsic factors
    and the specified features of this traditional network. Additionally, D2D devices
    use a more significant proportion of scarce resources than smartphones, unnecessarily
    creating a problem of unfairness in the system [74]. Therefore, we must first
    comprehend D2D traffic patterns and how they differ from traffic patterns generated
    by smartphones. Understanding traffic patterns can provide insights into managing
    and allocating shared network resources more effectively and guarantee the highest
    level of service quality for both types of devices. Security mechanisms: Denial
    of Service (DoS) attacks are a remarkable threat to the security of smart city
    networks and must be identified. Some statistical methods have been proposed to
    solve this problem. Such a statistical method is presented in [75] that is based
    on feature distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis process. Another
    security mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying users and devices
    in a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-manipulated devices.
    Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT systems such as the
    reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation attack, and the
    Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be encrypted.
    However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might be able
    to embed general-purpose microprocessors for this task. In addition, low resources
    and constrained devices can only embed application-specific integrated circuits.
    Therefore, conventional cryptographic primitives are not suitable for low-resource
    smart devices due to their low computation power, limited battery life, small
    size, small memory, and limited power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography
    may be an efficient encryption for these devices. Trust management is another
    security mechanism that detects and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure
    access control. Automated and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate
    the trust values of the participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of
    trust management schemes focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based
    access control methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large
    number of smart things storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,
    transparent, and easy access control management so that different nodes/users
    can be granted different levels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain
    technology can be used to create secure virtual zones where things can identify
    and trust each other [77]. Self-organization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can also
    be planned to set up the relationship between Blockchain and IoT, as suggested
    in [78]. Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that flow through
    the IoT system can vary to a great extent, in terms of either format, shape (in
    time and space), and semantics. Therefore, the process of separating normal from
    abnormal sensed data is extremely demanding. In the context of IoT applications,
    sensors are the real source of big data, which suggests that anomaly detection
    at the edge could be a powerful tool to address the inevitable data communication
    bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is concerned with identifying data patterns that
    deviate remarkably from the expected behavior. This is critical in the process
    of finding out important information about the IoT system’s functioning, detecting
    abnormalities that are often rare or difficult to model or, otherwise, to predict
    [79]. A timely identification of anomalies is vital to preventing IoT system failure.
    Advanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artificial intelligence (AI), machine
    learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) play a key role in the evolution
    of the smart city sectors [80]. These techniques are now being developed as solutions
    for completely automated IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal
    analysis of the big data is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing
    DRL/ML approaches can improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency;
    and increase precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality
    prediction, person detection, traffic management, etc. For example, an intelligent
    transportation system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize
    self-driving vehicles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques
    are also used to precisely monitor and estimate the real-time traffic flow data
    in an urban environment. In SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned
    techniques can enhance the safety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,
    management, and power grid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective
    use of smart meter big data for different applications such as load assessment
    and prediction, baseline estimation, demand response, load clustering, and malicious
    data deception attacks. In health intelligence, extensive use of AI, ML, and DRL
    techniques is implemented due to high-performance IoT devices, Cloud Computing,
    and an increase in data rates. These techniques can play a vital role in disease
    diagnosis, cure prediction, social media analytics for a particular disease, and
    medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role of AI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques
    is also outstanding. These techniques can be used from an advanced security perspective
    of IoT to confront security threats. Notably, the accuracy and precision of the
    aforementioned techniques can be further enhanced by increasing the amount of
    training data to strengthen their learning capabilities and hence the automated
    decision efficiencies [82]. 4. Protocols Used for SCAs Figure 3 shows a proposed
    taxonomy of networking protocols and architectures for SCAs. It also shows the
    challenges in IoT communications via TCP/IP. Figure 3. A taxonomy of technologies
    facilitating communication and networking for smart cities with IoT-enabled application
    protocols and suggested networking architectures and protocols. SCAs involve numerous
    smart things that operate on low-powered battery devices [83]. New connectivity
    solutions are being investigated in light of the following question: do the currently
    available methods, tools, and techniques—especially those for wireless networks—allow
    for the reliable handling of such a large number of smart devices? Yaqoob et al.
    [84] provided details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN technologies
    such as ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D communication.
    In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of connected devices,
    transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies (e.g.,
    WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve significant power consumption and are only partially
    applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies and communication
    strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication perspective.
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput performance
    for fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior context.
    Due to the limitations of its initial design, this standard does not support IoT
    applications. Hence, to enable IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the
    community (IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efficient protocol
    [55]. They aim to create a system that enables effective communication between
    several indoor and outdoor devices. Nevertheless, the real-time implementation
    of IEEE 802.11 ah may need to be improved by the absence of an appropriate interference
    mechanism. IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n,
    Cellular 3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of
    standards and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various
    SCAs. Smart home automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems
    require short-range communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g.,
    Bluetooth and Zigbee) from the WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by
    a lower bandwidth requirement, minimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication
    infrastructure environment. In contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used for
    SCAs that require longer-range communication. Such applications are smart transportation
    management systems. The protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular and WiMAX,
    can be adopted by applications that need wide-range communication, such as smart
    emergency response systems, weather and air quality monitoring systems, and smart
    grid systems. These features designed in terms of standards or protocols have
    enough capability that allows for both synchronous and asynchronous data connections.
    The best-effort traffic (which can effectively tolerate latency) allows the asynchronous
    data connections feature to be linked with smart city services or applications.
    Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connections is possible for those services
    or applications that generate traffic mandating strict QoS standards such as low
    latency and high accessible network capacity [49]. Since IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee)
    is a short-range (low bit rate) communication protocol that often suggests higher
    flexibility for small devices running on low power, such a protocol can significantly
    increase network lifetime. Moreover, such a protocol encourages and indicates
    support for applications and services with relatively relaxed latency and throughput
    conditions in WPANs. The authors of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4
    and proposed an intelligent system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted
    the benefits of using wireless emulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation
    and deployment, relatively easier in expanding a network, and flexibility in the
    system due to the use of wireless technology, which supports the usage of heterogeneous
    devices in the same implemented and deployed structure. Furthermore, they emphasized
    the advantages of employing the same intelligent infrastructure for a variety
    of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring, and cost-effectiveness.
    For example, by including specific smart metering devices such as water or gas
    meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established to
    target smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering applications.
    5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called BDMA and FBMC multiple
    access, which was first launched in 2015. In the case of BDMA multiple access,
    an orthogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that resources can be distributed
    in parallel to each mobile base station by dividing the antenna beam in accordance
    with the position of the mobile stations to enable multiple accesses to the base
    stations. Successively, this helps in improving the capacity of 5G networks [86].
    Specifically, the idea of moving towards 5G is based on current technology advancements
    and particularly on unique customer needs. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed
    that implemented 5G cellular networks should address noteworthy complications
    that are not successfully addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced network capacity and
    data rate, lower End-to-End (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and consistent user QoE
    provisioning. In addition, massive and rapid growth in the number of highly developed
    connected devices leads to a sharp increase in network traffic and a widening
    range of applications with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta and
    Jha [86] studied numerous facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive
    MIMO, traffic and power management policies, offloading (local), and self-configuring
    and organizing networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time
    managing and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days
    thanks to 5G. 5G ultimately targets some networking possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable
    and Low-Latency Communications (uRLLC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and
    massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC). In a smart city context, eMBB controls
    data transfer between a variety of networked user end devices, edge devices, or
    cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC aims to manage huge connected, complex devices,
    such as wearables, actuators, and sensors, through dense urban deployment. Finally,
    uRLLC takes responsibility for managing highly time-critical communication such
    as vehicular communication, base stations, and edge devices communication [87].
    Although 5G has completely brought about a new revolution in the field of networking,
    numerous unknown challenges still are possible in these cases of communication
    when 5G is deployed in the context of smart cities. One major problem is power-efficient
    communication, especially when communicating low-powered battery devices such
    as sensors and other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when two distinct
    technologies (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Specific device-level
    compatibility problems might always persist when communication infrastructures
    migrate to next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely,
    how to handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or
    difficult-to-reach places, as well as the potential high costs associated with
    building and maintaining 5G networks. Table 2 compares protocols used for smart
    cities, while Table 3 evaluates standards utilizing features and characteristics.
    Table 2. Comparison of protocols used for smart cities. Adapted and extended from
    [49,84,88]. Table 3. Evaluation of standards utilizing their features. 4.1. IEEE
    802.11 Standards Table 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features. Table
    4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features. 4.2. IEEE 802.15.1 The
    IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave time
    division duplex mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with
    a 1 Mbps data rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services
    designed to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include
    Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the
    IoT [98]. The deployment of services offered for tracking and localization devices
    is typically suggested by BLE-based devices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.
    These beacons produce a signal that other compatible devices can pick up between
    50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises greater indoor localization accuracy
    than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can be used for a wide range
    of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch of points of
    sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally, to provide
    specific services of interest, it is frequently required to combine the BLE technology
    with other technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the aim of BLE technology
    (Bluetooth Classic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous wireless connection,
    i.e., BlueTooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR). It became the perfect
    option for the IoT since it permits connectivity and audio-streaming applications
    using brief bursts of long-distance radio, which lowers the battery consumption
    of mobile devices (because they need not be connected all the time). Using the
    idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE specification, smartphones or regular
    phones can be linked to other heterogeneous devices (such as headphones) in BR/EDR
    mode. Otherwise, they can be connected to wearables in LE mode. A low-power radio
    called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends to broadcast data across 79 channels in the
    2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. Wireless audio streaming is primarily made
    possible through BCR, which has evolved into the industry-standard radio protocol
    for in-car entertainment systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims
    to transmit data over 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To
    facilitate the deployment of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks
    to provide support for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast;
    and, most notably, mesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create
    distribution and locating maps utilizing fingerprint templates for indoor device
    and user localization. Due to BLE’s greater susceptibility to abrupt fading and
    substantial changes in received signal strength, it has been proven that using
    BLE is more efficient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101]. However, Bluetooth
    technology has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly when its BR/EDR
    mode is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the master nodes
    to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered
    a variety of scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the
    BR/EDR mode reveals a lack of scalability that further restricts the performance
    of the system. 4.3. LoRA The LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications
    and operated as a low-data-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum
    that could go up to 10 km. LoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth: 125,
    250, and 500 KHz. Even while this technology can function at the largest bandwidth
    class, which further improves data rate, it still causes issues with high power
    consumption, a shorter communication range, and an increase in the likelihood
    of interference because it is free to operate in a wider frequency spectrum. This
    method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation and a CSSM variant
    with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission range will expand
    as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption will rise as
    well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby making it resilient
    to channel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not differentiate the noise
    in the channel such as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK modulation approach, which
    normally identifies signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise floor, the CSSM
    feature enables this technology to sense, perceive, and capture signals that are
    19.5 dB below the noise floor [103]. Its architecture uses a star network topology
    and includes gateways and end nodes. In this design, end nodes are referred to
    as slaves and run on battery-powered devices with limited power, but gateways
    are thought of as powerful machines that gather data from slave nodes. Furthermore,
    LoRaWAN is a communication layer that operates on top of LoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates
    the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability and suitability for
    low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over cellular technologies,
    which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice, LoRaWAN improved
    network features and functionalities by addressing the concept of a specialized
    server (network) and specifically defining numerous device types to meet the needs
    of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet filtering, and
    packet scheduling are all made possible using specialized network servers. LoRaWAN
    has also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission power and
    rate, which aids in optimizing network performance in terms of power consumption
    and throughput. This technology can be employed for a wide range of applications,
    such as smart health nursing [104], traffic monitoring [105], agriculture monitoring
    [106], localization [107], and smart grid applications [108]. In particular, this
    technology is useful for non-latency-sensitive applications and those that call
    for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al. [109] and Adelantado et al. [110]
    emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart metering, tracking, and localization-based
    applications. At the same time, it is not so feasible for real-time monitoring
    and video surveillance. 4.4. WiMAX WiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential
    peak data rate of 60 Mbps for an entire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps
    for an entirely uplink operation, based on the original IEEE 802.16 air interface
    standard (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amendment [112]. It can be done using
    two antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz. Additionally, it may provide
    support for multimedia services with different traffic characteristics and wide
    area mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety of QoS
    scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous traffic, such as Internet data
    traffic, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio traffic, and voice and video streams
    [113]. Table 5 shows the specified WiMAX standards and their operational parameters
    [114]. This standard provides a communication channel between geographically separated
    devices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges between 30
    km and 100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such as high installation
    costs and the possibility of complications and irregularities when dealing with
    high-definition multimedia traffic. Table 5. WiMAX standards and their operational
    parameters. Wireless network traffic has recently increased extraordinarily due
    to the rapid proliferation of smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators.
    These devices, along with smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based
    specialized devices, are the most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network
    environments. In such a dense network environment, interference is a critical
    issue that must be addressed if satisfactory performance and, thus, proficient
    spatial frequency reuse is required. Subsequently, the standards IEEE 802.11 were
    designed and implemented to support these requirements. Numerous international
    organizations, including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved their technologies
    in response to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance, the original
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior throughput
    performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as
    a result, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a result,
    to address the challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group
    (TG) was formed by the IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to redesign and
    extend the applicability of WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They focused on the
    critical issue of power-aware efficient schemes and protocols to extend the functionality
    and applicability of 802.11-based networks while dealing with a variety of small
    power-constrained smart outdoor and indoor devices [55,97]. 4.5. Challenges in
    IoT Communication Using the TCP/IP Protocol Suite In IoT, smart sensing motes,
    devices, and actuators share unique features such as constrained memory, power,
    and processing capabilities; the need for facilitating real-time requirements
    of smart applications; extremely vulnerable radio environments; and little to
    no human involvement after deployment [115]. By enabling communication amongst
    these devices utilizing low-power-cost technologies, a new infrastructure for
    deployed smart services has been formed. Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP
    protocol suite might provide a solution and be flexible enough for a variety of
    evolving IoT communication scenarios. Unfortunately, there were additional challenges
    that network administrators, designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers
    were searching for the best way to install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally
    use the system’s limited resources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of such
    power constraints, researchers highlighted the requirements of low-power Layer-2
    technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4) and low-power WiFi usage. In contrast
    with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies operate with smaller maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission speeds. IoT network protocol
    designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining the ideal MTU size. Another
    obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless networks and
    thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies. This vulnerability
    brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture: (1) The current IP addressing
    model cannot assist mesh communication (since it relies on a multi-link subnet
    prototype) at all. (2) In mesh communication, the multicasting and broadcasting
    communication methods are quite expensive, power-demanding, and prohibitive as
    the network nodes are extremely power constrained. Moreover, unicasting is the
    only remaining alternative method. (3) Unicasting is power intensive in and of
    itself because it may take many hops while forwarding and may wake up an excessive
    number of nodes that are asleep. Notably, idle nodes and hops can modify the radio
    state’s operation mode to save power. Additionally, a large amount of power is
    used and saved by a node during transmission, reception, overhearing, idle, and
    sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful delivery, we cannot just
    alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective coordination and intricate
    synchronization [117,118]. (4) There is a high requirement for scalable routing/forwarding
    schemes for IP communication to take place over mesh architectural systems. (5)
    For many IoT applications requiring data prioritizing and customized control,
    original TCP-suited features such as those operational on fixed MSS sizes (such
    as MTU sizes) that further lead to silly window syndrome or in-order byte-stream
    delivery to ensure dependability, are unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF
    started defining standard Internet protocols such as RPL [120] for such specialized
    environments to minimize protocol overheads that impair the computing ability
    and memory management of these specialized resource-constrained devices. WiFi-based
    infrastructure networks enable backhauling support, which helps establish and
    sustain seamless connectivity among smart IoT devices. In smart home wireless
    networks, this form of connectivity can be provided through TCP connections. The
    TCP/IP protocol suite supports dependable data delivery and congestion control
    strategies to maintain network throughput performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP
    is a protocol that has been regularly modified and improved over the years to
    effectively transport large amounts of byte-stream in-ordered data via resilient
    P2P connections with comparatively lower latency needs. IoT services deal with
    atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP protocol suite-based protocols,
    such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns adequately [119]. There are severe
    problems that TCP faces when it deals with an IoT application: (1) TCP connection
    establishment and termination (three-way handshaking) incur significant overhead
    in the system as most communication in an IoT application includes the transmission
    of brief segments and relatively little data. (2) TCP functionality needs resilient
    P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these connections in an IoT network
    environment because smart sensors and other connected devices switch their mode
    of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119]. (3) Some IoT applications
    might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns, and enabling such patterns
    via TCP will result in substantial network overhead in the entire IoT system and
    high-power consumption. (4) Some IoT services have very granular delay requirements,
    and any extra delay in the form of connection establishment or MSS creation (waiting
    for data to fill the entire MSS) is completely unacceptable for their performance.
    Thus, TCP is unable to provide much support for these IoT services. (5) IoT applications
    that rely on wireless communication scenarios must deal with critical wireless
    channel characteristics such as channel error, interference, and wireless interface
    properties that result in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer contention-induced,
    and collision-induced packet losses. When TCP operates in such a setting, its
    stringent in-order delivery requirements and retransmission policies (i.e., fast
    retransmission) may occasionally result in very serious system problems such as
    Head-of-Line (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in a
    reduction in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121,122,123,124].
    Furthermore, wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may further
    impair TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP Retransmission
    Time Out timer. Some standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement
    Layer-4 functionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed to
    utilize UDP as an underlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should depend
    on an application’s requirements, which may vary from application to application.
    However, TCP and its updated variants rely on the concept of data delivery deferment
    and try to perform retransmissions from an already created copy in the sender
    buffer. However, this is not the only approach to dealing with packet losses in
    the network. Another method is for AppL to accept packet delivery that is not
    completely flawless and proceed with its current operations. This feature will
    be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution. Additionally, retransmission
    is an additional option. However, AppL should handle this retransmission rather
    than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost
    data bits, doing so enables the source application to reconstruct them. Furthermore,
    in situations where real-time services are severely constrained, the transmitting
    application may transmit fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair”
    the effects of the initial loss [126]. Clark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these
    concepts and subsequently introduced the concept of Application Level Framing
    (ALF). Implementing Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself brings the idea of employing
    ALF into the system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF, a network can recognize
    individual Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently can offer support for
    flexible Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission procedures
    for diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using in-network
    caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails
    to provide support for the ALF scheme [119]. 4.6. Compound TCP for IoT Compound
    TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel utilization
    and fairness performances. It will play a significant role in home networks with
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128]. Pokhrel and Williamson [115]
    studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an IoT scenario involving sensors
    and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home appliances). They
    analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of connections made
    using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks in the presence
    of significant buffer-overflow-induced losses and severely degraded transmission
    channel circumstances. The authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements
    for all IoT devices as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional
    bandwidth-hungry Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated
    a thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted
    classical devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overflow-induced losses
    and significantly deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of
    [115,129] suggested models that aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion
    and flow control of several concurrently running competitive long-lived compound
    TCP connections. In evaluating and developing these models, they considered MAC-level
    retransmissions, link-layer contention, channel failures, and collision. The authors
    of [130] utilized a transient model suggesting a new queue management scheme to
    capture the interactions of short-lived TCP flows (the most workable flows in
    IoT scenarios) over conventional traffic patterns over WiFi networks. However,
    the performance of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using
    a single shared Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale
    well and provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially
    when wireless channels are often reused by several APs [131]. 4.7. Viewpoints
    of Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems The network architectures for IoT are
    heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular
    Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due to
    the large-scale production of intelligent sensing devices, survivability and self-organization
    of deployed functional networks are essential. A WSN is deployed for a variety
    of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and military applications. It
    is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which the sensor nodes communicate
    over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered, low-power sensors capable
    of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating, and regulating communication.
    Numerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2, TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have been
    suggested. Therefore, some standards were introduced to enable interaction and
    other compatibilities among these numerous heterogeneous platforms. For example,
    the IEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT.
    WSNs provide critical functionalities for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered
    battery-operated End Devices (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to
    the Internet. A WSN can be considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several
    equipped sensor nodes. Due to the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability
    must be obtained from the viewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability
    issue, various works suggested a standardized arrangement that could enable the
    usage of IP over LoWPAN. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability
    for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard outlines
    the physical and data link layers of the network and offers a low-cost framework
    for network operations. To link LPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may be used as
    an adaptation layer to enable sensors to implement an IP stack and become approachable
    by other conventional devices over the Internet. This adaptability layer also
    supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables a variety of applications and
    permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding algorithms at the Internet
    layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot be supported
    when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72] considers the
    LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained, and they
    are connected by some lossy links that only support low data rates. These links
    are thought to be extremely unstable and have poor performance in terms of packet
    delivery rates. In such specialized networks, the traffic patterns are often P2MP
    and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint (MP2MP) rather than just P2P [72]. These networks
    contain hundreds of smart devices. This makes the implementation of routing policies
    more difficult than ever. In addition, numerous existing traditional ad-hoc wireless
    network routing methods, such as DSR and AODV, cannot manage these unique situations
    and unforeseen circumstances. Designing and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking
    settings has been more difficult due to the mobility aspect and the resource limitations
    at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’ design principles emphasize QoS
    elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end latency [134,135]. The forwarding
    rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations take into account the
    increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the node energy [117,136].
    As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and maintain solely inside their
    operational infrastructure, this was very feasible. However, the interoperability
    of these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when such networks are integrated
    with IoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration with IoT needs novel routing
    policies that support scalability and assure QoS, fairness, and connectivity between
    two nodes (both in APs and ad-hoc networks) with the least amount of power consumption.
    The standard classical forwarding strategies were intended to ensure QoS between
    a pair of devices/nodes. In the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures
    should suggest enough fairness so that each node can sufficiently get enough chances
    to communicate with nearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing
    solutions are followed to decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation.
    Researchers have often raised concerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules,
    which lead to the consumption of excess energy in networks while taking into account
    mobile and static ad-hoc network scenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood
    of frequent network disconnections, route failures, and even network partitioning,
    all contributing to the system’s significant MAC-level and routing-level overhead
    problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the high-power consumption problem,
    many researchers presented numerous smart routing paradigms [118,134,135,137].
    Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the desired QoS. Cross-layer
    design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion control are
    well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless channel
    attributes. Therefore, significant work has been done in these areas. These designs
    provide support for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely variable channel
    parameters at lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing and Transport
    layers to further optimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations decisions
    [121,134,135,138,139,140]. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) indicates
    how well a device can hear a signal from an AP or router. A network layer forwarding
    policy can effectively utilize the RSSI (accessible through lower layers dynamically)
    to assess link quality. AODV and DSR are examples of the traditional ad-hoc routing
    protocols used in various smart forwarding systems designed for IoT scenarios.
    The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing mechanisms were suggested for the IoT
    scenarios and talked about node and link disjoint paths while discovering routes.
    However, the proposed schemes do not shed light and discuss anything related to
    performance issues when there is a significant level of interference in the network
    because of traffic running parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned techniques
    do not always perform well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay. Recently,
    the scheme [140] considered different critical factors such as interference level,
    link-layer contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related
    to wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution
    policies’ efficiency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,
    different possible disjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might
    be able to interfere with one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting
    behavior in wireless communication. Consequently, such separate disconnected pathways
    could be utilized to enhance the performance of the network as a whole [138,140].
    When employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend on WSN-based networking
    connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from smart things to sink nodes.
    These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes (IoT-GW). To balance energy
    usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous such static and mobile IoT-GWs
    can be deployed in the system. In the whole system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous
    types of critical data, are connected to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee
    specified three forms of devices: Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee
    End Device, and three forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh. Moreover,
    the Zigbee stack embraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the case of star
    network topology, the Reduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e., RFDs and FFDs)
    can communicate with the PAN central coordinator only. They are not capable of
    communicating with one another. Here, the PAN coordinator may be powered by mains,
    while the RFDs and FFDs run on low-powered limited battery devices. Moreover,
    in the case of the mesh network topology, any device can communicate to within-range
    devices at a point of time. Moreover, this topology contains a PAN coordinator,
    which can communicate with other RFDs and FFDs. Furthermore, this networking topology
    offers support for the usage of the integrated forwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree
    and AODV routing procedures. Lastly, the tree (cluster) network topology is a
    subset form of mesh networking topology, consisting of RFDs and FFDs (which may
    act as coordinators). However, the FFD count could be more than the RFD count
    in the network. RFDs may attach to tree (cluster) network topology as the end
    nodes in the system. The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization functionalities
    to other connected coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single PAN
    coordinator amongst these coordinators [144]. 4.8. IoT Application Protocols Each
    IoT application is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.
    These protocols can be the following: Representational State Transfer Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is the primary client/server protocol
    that adopts the request/response model. HTPP has been related to the REST architecture
    [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar entities over web-based services.
    The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices to make their status readily
    available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions
    [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE techniques
    of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build a REST model for dissimilar
    IoT devices [148]. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [149]: It is a lightweight
    RESTful protocol lately standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
    CoAP is used by IoT devices for IP-based, HTTP-like interactions. It uses UDP
    with acknowledgment messages to set up reliable communication based on a request/response
    interaction. It has reduced complexity, and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained
    IoT applications and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) [150] is established for IoT messaging. According to MQTT design
    principles, network bandwidth and device resource requirements should be kept
    to a minimum while also aiming to assure dependability and some level of delivery
    assurance. Since June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by ISO as a standard (ISO/IEC
    20922). The protocol continues to progress by formalizing popular capability options
    and adding new functionalities. The most recent version, MQTT v5.0, was released
    in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe paradigm. Clients connect
    to a centralized broker when using MQTT. Open Platform Communications Unified
    Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoperability standard is used for the secure
    and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation domain and other industries.
    It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow of information among
    IoT devices from multiple vendors. It supports two different communication methods:
    the Client/Server method as well as Publish/Subscribe (e.g., over UDP or MQTT)
    to mainly meet different industry requirements from the production systems to
    edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main IoT vendors including IBM, AWS, Google
    Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage secure, standardized information exchange
    in edge-to-cloud applications based on OPC UA. Extensible Messaging and Presence
    Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is based on text messages that
    use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which it can implement both request/response
    and publish/subscribe methods by using suitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant
    messages between clients, and this happens in real-time using a push mechanism
    to avoid increasing unnecessary network loads. XMPP also determines the state
    of an XMPP entity as online, offline, busy, etc. Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
    (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing business messages between applications
    or organizations using TCP. It connects systems, feeds business processes with
    the information they need, and reliably transmits onward the instructions that
    achieve their goals using the point/point and publish/subscribe interaction modes.
    AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of message orientation; queuing; routing;
    security; reliability; and interoperability. Data Distribution Service (DDS) [154]:
    DDS was developed by the Open Management Group (OMG). DDS is a real-time M2M protocol
    that enables dependable, high-performance, interoperable, scalable data exchanges
    using a publish–subscribe pattern. DDS provides low-latency data connectivity,
    high reliability, and scalability in publish–subscribe and request/response patterns
    over TCP and UDP. The needs of various IoT applications requiring real-time data
    exchange can be addressed using DDS. Such applications are air traffic control,
    transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart grid management. Lastly,
    Glaroudis et al. [155] provided a comparison among IoT application protocols in
    terms of well-accepted key performance indicators and discussed their suitability
    in the framework of smart farming. 5. Networking Architectures and Protocols 5.1.
    Generic Architectures Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an
    urban IoT’s enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated
    the implementation of an IoT island as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City
    of Padova. In the IoT, two methods provide data access to objects/things. The
    first involves deploying multi-hop mesh networks with short-range communication
    among network nodes using unlicensed frequency. The second involves using licensed
    frequency band long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM). Centenaro et al.
    [156] presented a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wireless connectivity)
    called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based on a star topology
    characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed
    sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide connectivity
    in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed the
    advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efficiency,
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled
    SCA that uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled
    street lighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental
    research facility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander supports
    testing proposed protocols, services, and configurations in a realistic setting
    at an appropriate scale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is a significant
    part of IoT. Vilajosana and Dohler [159] reviewed currently used smart city M2M
    technologies (i.e., sensors, data loggers, wireless modems, and gateway). They
    considered one of the most famous deployment use cases, i.e., smart parking. In
    any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount of M2M communication requests
    occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways cannot face this challenge.
    Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control model for M2M communications.
    Their model differentiates all M2M requests into delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant.
    Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant requests by routing them into one low-priority
    queue, aiming to reduce the number of requests from various devices to the access
    point in the IoT for smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up
    architecture after analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture
    has four layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each
    layer integrates security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer,
    located at the bottom of the architecture, collects data from physical devices.
    The transmission layer is located above the sensing layer. Several communication
    technologies are used to transmit data from the transmission layer to the (upper)
    data management layer. The data management layer performs data fusion, data analysis,
    data processing, and data storing. It stores valuable information that various
    applications use at the application layer to provide services. The majority of
    the above works mainly focus on a single characteristic, such as quality of service
    [162]. Marques et al. [163] proposed a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities
    infrastructure management architecture that allows the integration of physical
    objects, communication infrastructure, cloud platform, and IoT-based services
    in a pervasive way. This architecture (Figure 4) is generic and includes four
    layers: (1) Physical Objects, (2) Communication, (3) Cloud Platform, and (4) Services.
    Figure 4. Architecture design. Adapted from [163]. The Physical Objects Layer
    enables IoT sensors to collect data that will feed the smart city architecture
    with information used to offer services. After the sensors collect data, a Communication
    Device is used to collect sensor data. A communication device can implement different
    technologies (e.g., RFID, Bluetooth, and Zigbee). Sensor data are processed by
    a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing unit responsible for gathering
    information used by the application providing a service. The local processing
    unit brings elements of edge computing, as it pushes part of the computation to
    edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating all the computation in a centralized
    remote server. The Communication Layer: The architecture supports a variety of
    network access technologies. The communication layer supports the implementation
    of various wireless technologies. The local processing unit located at the Physical
    Objects Layer defines the technology to be used and relays data to the communication
    layer using the interface of a network access point. The Cloud Platform Layer
    provides three services: processing, database queries, and data storage. In the
    context of providing services for smart cities, each of these services can be
    dynamically allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably, only
    some applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation
    is optional. The Services Layer implements four groups, which are called classes
    of services: (I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III) Infrastructure,
    and (IV) Technology. In each class, different kinds of applications can be implemented
    to deal with the challenges of smart cities. This architecture is a generic solution,
    so the underlying layers are designed to offer support to the applications. Therefore,
    it can be adapted to the specific implementation of a given service. To this end,
    the authors adapted their architecture to a waste management scenario. Another
    multi-level smart city architecture [164] was built on semantic web technologies,
    and its design is mostly used in smart city wireless sensor network applications.
    Data collection, data processing, integration and reasoning, and device control
    and alerts make up its four layers. Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s
    edge, Gheisari et al. [165] suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in
    the smart city that protects privacy. Saadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer
    architecture for mobile object authentication in the context of IoT smart cities.
    Their architecture is based on the applicability of a proposed hierarchical elliptic
    curve identity-based signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167] presented
    a Fog-based smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network (FOCAN).
    To reduce latency and increase the efficiency of services among things with various
    capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through
    the smart city environment. One of FOCAN’s primary benefits is that the IoT device
    can deliver services effectively and with less energy consumption. 5.2. SDN-IoT
    Architectures Software-defined networking (SDN) [168] is an approach to enable
    flexible and efficient network configuration to enhance a network. SDN can provide
    many advantages for configuring city networks to support different applications.
    For example, SDN can improve the QoS of city networks against link failures [169]
    and meet smart city latency demands [170]. While some efforts are investigating
    this approach for supporting SCAs, there is room for developing more advanced
    management and networking mechanisms in SDN for efficient, reliable, and secure
    network configurations in smart cities. Jazaeri et al. [171] considered the advantages
    of integrating edge computing, SDN, and IoT technologies and reviewed different
    frameworks and platforms. Liu et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples
    urban sensing applications from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture,
    centralized controllers manage physical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition,
    transmission, and processing services to develop urban sensing applications. Bi
    et al. [173] proposed a scalable SDN-enabled architecture that integrates a variety
    of smart city components and provides reliable and timely scheduling for big data
    transfer to support smart city services. They also studied the time-constrained
    big data transfer scheduling (TBTS) problem under this architecture and proposed
    a heuristic with an intelligent scheme that can maximize the throughput and schedule
    the multi-flow transfer dynamically. IoT systems collect and process data vulnerable
    to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed
    a collaborative and intelligent-network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)
    architecture, namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT networks. SeArch is a security
    architecture in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS nodes, i.e., Edge-IDS,
    Fog-IDS, and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration among nodes.
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy
    in smart cities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network architecture
    for the smart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN and Blockchain technologies.
    To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, their architecture
    is divided into core and edge networks. By designing a hybrid architecture, their
    architecture inherits the strength of centralized and distributed network architectures.
    “PrivySharing” [177] is a Blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving
    and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. This framework protects
    data privacy by segmenting the blockchain network into different channels, consisting
    of a limited number of approved businesses and handling a certain category of
    data, such as health, smart auto, smart energy, or financial information. Additionally,
    smart contracts contain access control rules that regulate who has access to the
    users’ data within a channel. In addition, private data gathering and encryption
    are used to further isolate and safeguard the data within a channel. Islam et
    al. [178] designed a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT ecosystem
    that addresses the existing challenges through the use of the technologies Blockchain,
    SDN, and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architecture
    confronts the problems of scalability, flexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats. 5.3. Architectures
    for Smart Grid The automated and intelligent management of the next-generation
    electric power systems determines their effectiveness and efficiency. Smart Grid
    (SG) is the name given to the next generation of electricity systems, which are
    anticipated to offer various benefits over the current systems in terms of digitization,
    flexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustainability, and customization [179].
    Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies to improve power quality.
    Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric devices remotely in
    real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate their local devices.
    The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented by using the electrical
    and communication infrastructures that connect the transmission and customer domains.
    The distribution domain includes distribution feeders and transformers to supply
    electricity. It interacts with much different equipment, such as distributed energy
    resources (DERs), plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure
    (AMI), and sensors with communication capability. The distribution domain is responsible
    for delivering electricity to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability.
    To provide quality electricity, the stability of this domain is monitored and
    controlled. Typical applications [44] of the smart grid communications network
    are automatic meter reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and
    DERs/microgrid. DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked
    to the distribution system. Distributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS),
    or a combination of renewable and non-renewable sources are all possible sources
    for DER. Solar panels, wind turbines, combustion turbines, fuel cells, battery
    storage systems, etc., are a few examples of DER. An electric power system with
    one or more DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid. The communication
    infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities of the smart grid and
    complies with performance standards. This infrastructure connects a huge number
    of electric devices and manages complex device communications. As a result, it
    is built in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected individual sub-networks,
    and each sub-network is responsible for separate geographical regions. The extremely
    dispersed smaller area networks that support the power systems at various locations
    are connected by WANs, which act as the communication’s backbone. When the control
    centers are located a great distance from the substations or the end-users, the
    real-time measurements made at the electric devices are transported to the control
    centers through the WANs, and in the opposite direction, the WANs carry out the
    instruction communications from the control centers to the electric devices. The
    authors of [43] present a communication architecture in an SG. This architecture
    includes (1) an energy smart house with electric appliances connected to the smart
    grid, (2) a residential complex with AMI, (3) a residential subdivision installed
    with solar panels, (4) a PEV charging station, (5) a power substation, and (6)
    power transmission lines. In this architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as
    the backbone in connecting the distributed sub-networks. Demertzis et al. [180]
    presented and categorized the communication network standards that have been established
    for smart grids and should be considered in planning and implementing new infrastructures.
    Such standards are IEC 61850 for substation automation. This standard is based
    on open architecture and incorporates sampling and timing synchronization specifications
    based on IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181]. Notably, IEEE 1588 is the standard
    for a precision clock synchronization protocol for networked measurement and control
    systems [182]. Due to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)
    throughout the power grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution
    networks in smart grids would undergo significant changes to accommodate the nature
    of non-radial power flow. For the most part, the low-voltage distribution networks
    where RERs (such as solar cells) may be attached are not monitored by the majority
    of the present supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for power
    grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control, Abdrabou [183] presented
    a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse structure that may
    supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage distribution networks.
    A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also presented as a useful method
    for prioritizing data transfer across the newly introduced network architecture.
    HetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network design with a specific QoS routing method
    for power distribution grid applications. It delivers QoS assurances across the
    network while taking into account three factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability.
    The authors created two components to accomplish this: A multipath routing mechanism
    that compensates critical applications for their high-reliability requirements
    by using end-to-end physically disjoint paths, and Altruistic resource allocation
    with the QoS routing mechanism that targets communication with QoS guarantees
    for applications with strict QoS requirements. The findings in [184] show that
    the HetGrid overlay network architecture enables extremely effective, trustworthy,
    and QoS-aware communication in heterogeneous networks. The major characteristics
    that set SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are the ability to execute
    two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time pricing. The present
    SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to be protocol independent.
    Therefore, global communication network management and monitoring approaches have
    been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network administrators may more
    efficiently manage their networks by separating the control plane from the data
    plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication networks. SDN
    implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efficiency and resilience.
    SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and protocols by virtue
    of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity capabilities to
    cope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185] presented SDN-based
    SGC architectures, along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for
    SDN-based SGC and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied
    to SDN-based SGC. Alam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication
    networks in terms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,
    and applications. They proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication Network
    for Smart Grid. CR is a software-defined radio (SDR) platform that can quickly
    reconfigure its operating parameters, such as modulation/demodulation, compression
    algorithm, and error coding techniques, according to changing circumstances and
    requirements, through cognition. In such an SDR platform, radio transceivers can
    switch functions and operations on demand only. Molokomme et al. [187] reviewed
    architectures that aim to accomplish the various and strict QoS requirements in
    SG communication systems. Wireless communication networks have been motivated
    to harvest energy from ambient environments and run energy-efficiently for economic
    and ecological benefits through improvements in the smart power grid and the advocacy
    of “green communications”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments in energy
    harvesting, redistribution, trade, and planning for future wireless networks integrating
    with smart grids. The authors considered the optimization of various energy-harvesting
    wireless systems as well as traditional models of renewable energy-harvesting
    technologies. Moreover, they discussed how to distribute redundant (unused) energy
    generated by cellular networks, plan for energy under dynamic pricing when smart
    grids are in place, and engage in two-way energy trading using smart grids. From
    a different viewpoint, including IoT devices and providing connectivity, automation,
    and monitoring for such devices enables SG systems to sustain multiple network
    operations during the generation, distribution, transmission, and expenditure
    of energy. Numerous IoT-aided SG systems have been proposed in the literature.
    The survey [189] on IoT-aided SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures,
    uses, and prototypes. 5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings There are various
    building applications such as heating, cooling, load control, air quality, ventilation,
    lighting, water management, and cooking gas management. A smart building incorporates
    the major building systems on a common network and functionality to provide operational
    efficiency, fire safety, and security. A smart building architecture (SBA) manages
    several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation, air cleaning,
    HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation and monitoring);
    smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management); a smart fire
    detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart building [190]
    has security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality system, a fire alarm
    system, a water management system, and an energy management system. Moreover,
    it can detect intrusion and supports HVAC services. Diverse SBAs include complex
    operational systems, sensing, and communication technologies. Such architectures
    have converged into an IP-based architecture. This convergence is occurring rapidly
    with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices driven through IoT concerning
    conventional building management and smart buildings. Traditionally, numerous
    building systems utilized varied forms of networking protocols and cabling systems.
    This variety makes the whole system more complex and highly infeasible from both
    a deployment and a system administration standpoint [191]. SBAs entail making
    plans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational technologies that improve
    the application’s, service’s, or provision’s operational steps while also boosting
    the well-being of its users. Researchers, policymakers, and implementers should
    pay attention to several crucial issues, such as reliable communication/connection
    procedures, power-efficient measures, competent security measures, efficient sensors
    and actuators, and data analytics procedures. Amalgamating new systems and technologies
    with conventional (base) technologies to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes,
    but is not limited to, WSN deployment; advanced power-aware traffic engineering
    policies; cloud, edge, and fog computing paradigms; big data engineering and analytics;
    and human–computer interaction procedures [192]. The rapid development of ICT
    technologies has enhanced the connectedness of intelligent sensing, actuators,
    and communication devices to real-time physical entities. Recently, smart sensing
    mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology have boosted the area of
    SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies for a particular smart
    building domain poses significant difficulties, including heterogeneity of IoT
    devices and applications, workable networking protocols and architectures, power
    efficiency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One solution is the SDN paradigm,
    which manages the network more efficiently than a customary one. SDN also assists
    network services, including storage, routing, dynamic bandwidth management, and
    QoS. Hence, these simplifications offer a creative environment through the implementation
    of proper software tools for smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation
    for intelligent infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home
    automation and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing
    based on SDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that
    improves critical SB parameters such as bandwidth efficiency, energy efficiency,
    latency, security, and reliability. Silva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things
    (WoT) SBA that is integrated with the representational state transfer (RESTful)
    application programming interface (API). The RESTful API employs HTTP requests
    (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT data. Regarding network
    performance and smart building power management, the authors showed how their
    recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance. Smart sensing
    devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or modifying
    vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.
    These systems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms, power,
    and transceiver modules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based SBAs for
    assessing and regulating air quality, smart lighting systems, fire detection systems,
    power management, and other basic building operations. An indoor-air-quality-based
    SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for monitoring and regulating
    air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing system was initially
    suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature, and relative humidity.
    Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198]. Considering smart
    indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed in the literature.
    In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system to satisfy the users’
    needs. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption reduction via energy-efficient
    smart lighting systems. Today’s smart building employs low-power usage LED-based
    light sources that last longer than Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In
    reality, the development of control technologies, heterogeneous networks, and
    embedded systems has made it promising to create smart innovative lighting systems
    that can effectively address the problem of energy conservation. Researchers have
    recently begun testing by integrating different power-saving techniques in a single
    illumination system for improved energy efficiency while enhancing lighting performance
    without sacrificing user satisfaction. According to the authors of [201], using
    several cheap detectors, as opposed to a single expensive sensor, would result
    in improved performance and higher power savings. Considering the same motivation,
    various authors [202,203,204] have suggested similar types of smart lighting systems
    for several room types, such as classrooms and offices. In [205], the authors
    provide a deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing on
    power savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration
    of visible light communication technology [206]. Recently, researchers focused
    on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work performance and thermal comfort, to
    propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented Technologies (OOT) have
    been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal comfort while conserving
    energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the drawbacks of the
    automatic control used today. In practice, thermal comfort analysis is based on
    parallel objective and subjective evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises
    monitoring, assessing, and recording the status of environmental parameters through
    dedicated sensors and instruments following standardized guidelines. Subjective
    evaluation involves monitoring, assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal
    sensation, and thermal environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor
    results as the cumulative method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found
    in [193]. Green building refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that
    adjusts to predetermined circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation,
    the system makes full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather
    data and subsequently allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The
    ambient intelligence concept aims to conserve natural resources with limited and
    efficient use of them to offer comfort to the occupants. Through unconventional
    energy sources, it also meets some of the conventional energy requirements [207].
    Many aspects of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and power efficiency, are
    the subject of extensive study. However, one of the most important functions of
    an SB system is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by HVAC
    systems [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial buildings
    for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for this
    context. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of rated fan
    energy can be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect on a building’s
    indoor temperature. The method of computational control for passive and active
    sources was used in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized the problem that
    the ambient and active sources of lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling, and
    shading are not synchronized in buildings. Such a computational control scheme
    is also suitable for reducing daily power usage. Similarly, numerous methods [211,212,213]
    considering HVAC systems have been proposed with respect to frequency regulation,
    predictive control, and smart controller. An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks
    environmental situations. It also notifies when measurements exceed thresholds
    and provides data on energy usage and consumption. In addition, it can autonomously
    turn equipment intermittently at programmed times. As individuals spend more time
    indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed spaces) than outdoors, the air quality
    inside buildings should be improved along with that of the external surroundings.
    This is the task of indoor Air Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS). The basic parts
    of an AQMS (Figure 5) are a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal
    conditioning circuit, a small amount of external memory, and a communication module
    that is typically wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors
    that can detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2,
    CO, and O3, as well as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity
    and temperature. These sensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values
    of the real-time indoor air quality parameters and an external memory used to
    store real-time data [214]. When deploying such systems, various communication
    (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and LoRAWAN technologies, are considered.
    Figure 5. Air Quality Monitoring Sensor System. Adapted from [215,216]. Figure
    5 shows a typical sensor system for an indoor environment for air quality monitoring.
    Figure 6 shows an SBA architecture [217]. The system of this architecture collects
    vital information about the various air quality parameters, including CO2, CO,
    particles (Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5), and some other crucial parameters
    such as humidity and temperature. By using gas sensor boards and wasp motes, the
    authors created a method for collecting and monitoring the indoor atmosphere.
    For monitoring CO2 and CO parameters, they also used TGS 4161 and TGS 2442 gas
    sensors. These sensors usually work using the resistive heating principle. The
    TGS 2442 sensor has excellent sensitivity to fluctuations in CO gas concentration.
    This sensor’s internal resistance, or “IR”, is inversely proportionate to the
    amount of CO present. As the CO content rises, the IR falls. While TGS 4161 also
    offers low power consumption and suggests better performance in detecting changes
    in CO2 gas concentration, the TGS4161 is ideally suited for indoor air control
    applications as it can measure 350–10,000 ppm carbon dioxide. The authors used
    the DustTrak DRX, a specialized aerosol laser photometer that simultaneously measures
    mass and size fraction, for PM1 and PM2.5 monitoring purposes. To define and create
    an interface to the deployed sensor for wireless transmission of gathered aerosol
    data, this photometer is connected to a base station device via LAN. The authors
    also set up ZB (ENs) at each location that was taken into consideration, which
    sent updates on the air quality and aerosols at regular periods to BS (ZBC) that
    had already been set up. Figure 6. IAQMS architecture. Adapted from [217,218].
    This system assesses the indoor air quality to assess the current state of the
    indoor environment while simultaneously providing real-time inputs for HVAC system
    management. The authors also designed a toolkit that analyzes real-time air quality
    data and displays them through meaningful representations to service the SBAs.
    Likewise, Lozano et al. [216] proposed another IAQMS technique that considers
    a star topological architecture [217]. The ZB (ENs) in this technique is based
    on the XBee and XBee pro-version modules. Nevertheless, the suggested scheme [216]
    considers a single pollutant only, i.e., suggesting using a GAC sensor. Conversely,
    the authors of [215] further claimed that they considered seven pollutants in
    their proposed implementation. IoE for Smart Building: To achieve optimal functionality
    and energy-efficient performance, Kim et al. [218] offered an overview of the
    design and implementation of energy-related SB technologies, including energy
    management systems, renewable energy applications, and current advanced smart
    technologies. Undoubtedly, the electricity sector of smart cities is impacted
    by the Internet of Energy (IoE), which aims to increase energy efficiency, prevent
    energy waste, and enhance environmental conditions by integrating IoT technologies
    into distributed energy systems. Two examples of IoE technology are intelligent
    sensor use and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. As a result, the
    IoE is becoming a tool for legal science to support the goals of a smart city.
    Metallidou et al. [219] discussed the factors that prompted the European Union
    to create regulations to make it easier to transition current towns into smart
    cities, starting with existing structures. To achieve energy efficiency, the authors
    suggested a smart building template that uses IoT technology to manage the performance
    of all technical systems. In addition, they suggested an automated remote-control
    technique supported by a cloud interface to enhance the certification of existing
    buildings for energy performance. This technology reduces time-consuming processes
    and stores the energy performance of each building on a cloud platform to make
    decisions and put measures in place. A review of current tactics in the field
    of active building energy management systems (BEMS) was offered by Mariano-Hernández
    et al. [220]. The authors reviewed articles on several BEMS management techniques
    for residential and non-residential buildings, including Model Predictive Control
    (MPC), Demand Side Management (DSM), Optimization, and Fault Detection and Diagnostics
    (FDD). MPC predicts building response to control requests, while DSM is an agreement
    of actions to improve the energy system on the user side. FDD is an automatic
    procedure of detecting and separating flaws in BEMS to protect a system from additional
    harm. Moudgil et al. [221] examined cutting-edge academic and industrial research
    to discover significant technological solutions that improve the integration of
    IoT in building infrastructure (BI). Their review also identifies key technical
    and non-technical problems that must be resolved through extensive research for
    BI to fully incorporate IoT. The authors contend that IoT in BI is still not operationally
    capable. IoT and BI stakeholders must make a concerted effort to give modern BI
    access to a generic IoT framework with cognitive intelligence and context-aware
    computing capabilities. 5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring Retrofitting
    the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some benefits,
    including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert
    utilities to pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network, allowing
    them to remotely adjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224]. Automation
    can be used for both operational procedures and components that provide functionality.
    For instance, when a water problem occurs during operation or with the element
    itself, the smart components inform the system center and then take action to
    avert a crash. The water utility can also determine a sensor’s requirement for
    maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic self-verification mechanism
    [225]. In [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid architecture
    that includes technical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework. Moreover,
    this smart water system (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms, simulation
    procedures, diagnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control mechanisms.
    Although an SWS incorporates offline performance, real-time performance is defined
    by online procedures such as online data monitoring, online data assimilation,
    online modeling, online charting, and online results output. An SWS must have
    real-time functionality to implement the necessary smart features [227]. Researchers
    put a lot of effort [228] into developing water systems that operate intelligently.
    Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time controlling, etc., which seek
    to reduce the lag between system input and system output, should be added to the
    smart performance of SWS. It was discovered that using SCADA would considerably
    increase the data transfer efficiency [229]. A smart water architecture [230]
    often includes five layers: (1) the physical layer; (2) the sensing and control
    layer; (3) the communication layer; (4) the data management layer; and (5) the
    data fusion layer. Within the framework of the GST4Water project, the authors
    of [230] presented a system that allows for receiving consumption data sent by
    a generic smart meter installed in a user’s house and transferring them to a cloud
    platform. The consumption data are saved and processed to characterize leakage
    at the district meter area and the individual user level. Meanwhile, the processed
    data are returned to the Water Utility and can be used for billing. On the other
    hand, they provide regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness of
    their consumption behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework
    based on FIWARE that aims to realize a highly flexible standards-based open-source
    software solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting
    of various FIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis
    et al. [232] considered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding
    conventional water metering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted
    bi-directional (whenever required) data exchange between water flow devices, metering
    equipment, and end-users. The authors’ ultimate objective is to design, implement,
    and deploy more sophisticated infrastructure offering improved performance in
    bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit the amount of data that needs to be
    shared between the various system layers, their approach makes use of the FogC
    paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water grid model. The Information
    and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the Efficient Water Resources
    Management project was funded by the European Commission under the auspices of
    the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the Smart Water project is to
    examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively managing urban water systems,
    with a focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues
    such as leakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.
    Kulkarni and Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,
    proposed a framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost
    of ownership, and highlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’ Smart
    Water case studies. Pipelines are used to transport water, gases, and oil. Since
    they are frequently underground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes them, which
    may result in leaks. In addition, water in the pipelines may get contaminated
    by infectious agents or substances that are mistakenly or purposely introduced
    into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline networks is crucial for maintaining
    public health and protecting the environment. The sensor node deployment profoundly
    impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline network monitoring, including
    coverage area, coverage population, and detection time. The sensor nodes should
    typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s junctions [234]. Given the
    design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor node deployment challenges
    are therefore formulated as integer optimization problems, where the integer variables
    represent the maximum amount of sensor nodes that must be placed at each junction.
    The deployment difficulties for pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging
    to solve because of the integer decision variables. Pipeline network flows are
    not predictable. As a result, depending on the flow pattern, the sensing performance
    of a deployed sensor node may vary. As a result, the flow pattern is taken into
    account in [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to decide
    how to deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a
    branch and bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify the
    ideal answer, the time complexity is typically significant. This means that large
    pipeline networks cannot be used with the method. Similarly, the study in [236]
    considers the various demand patterns of water flows through pipes. The authors
    used a genetic-based method to find the best deployment locations to increase
    coverage under various monitoring station demand patterns. The global optimum
    of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach. The performance of
    the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices. Consequently,
    we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks. Singapore’s WaterWise@SG
    program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate burst incidents [237,238].
    PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to find pipeline leaks, where
    three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure. To reduce
    water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track water consumption
    for businesses. A Steamflood and Waterflood Tracking System [240] has been created
    to find irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks and bottlenecks. With
    the aid of all these technologies, the investigators had the opportunity to evaluate
    the efficiency of the monitoring algorithms. However, these technologies rely
    on fixed sensors, and we still need to put innovative testbed models and systems
    built around crowd sensing and mobile WSN into place. 5.6. Architectures for Smart
    Transportation The Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce
    traffic congestion and accidents. It also enables information exchange involving
    the vehicle and all entities that may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking
    and vehicle intelligence are the two technologies that underpin IoV implementation.
    The three components that compose vehicle networking are the onboard information
    service, VANET, and mobile network. VANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range
    communication. Providing remote location, remote diagnostics, navigation, and
    other information services is referred to as an onboard information service. Every
    car can be utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks to mobile networks. Vehicle
    intelligence is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence
    (AI), big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing (CogC),
    to facilitate information sharing among people and vehicles, as well as between
    vehicles and the environment, infrastructure, or other vehicles. Vehicular networks
    consist of data-gathering sensors and inter-vehicle communication systems. Such
    networks require an open and flexible layered architecture to handle characteristics
    such as interoperability, scalability, dependability, and modularity. Recently,
    the research community proposed efficient vehicle network architectures. For example,
    the Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture [241] includes seven layers. Offering services
    and choosing messaging protocols are tasks that fall within the application layer.
    Data preprocessing, big data processing, and intelligent transmission are all
    tasks that the multimedia and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems,
    the cloud service layer’s ClCom and cloud virtualization technologies offer hardware
    computing platforms, infrastructure, and software services. In the UIoV architecture,
    the communication layer and the intra–inter devices layer are merged to accomplish
    the connectivity of many heterogeneous objects and networks. Notably, there is
    no intra–inter devices layer in classical architecture. The UIoV system’s physical
    objects layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter devices layer
    for additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are
    identified using the Identification Layer. Liu et al. [242] suggested another
    IoV network architecture to increase the flexibility of application management
    while enhancing the scalability and dependability of information services. This
    architecture has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety of
    nodes with various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of
    IoV is frequently changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced
    and transmitted at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the
    underlying resources, the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes
    and the network, computation, communication, and storage resources in IoV. To
    execute applications such as road safety management and data sensing, the control
    layer’s SDN controller is responsible for scheduling the abstraction resources
    of the virtualization layer and interacting with the application layer. A difficult
    topic in network architecture design is dealing with diverse networks. Interoperability,
    scalability, dependability, and adaptability are some of its network features.
    The design seeks to increase layer separation and network architecture’s total
    number of layers. In addition to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture
    should facilitate the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other
    communication devices. By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving
    systems, the learning ability of autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved.
    Utilizing both physical and network data space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles
    (CIoV) paradigm [243] improves network security and transportation safety. CIoV
    enables IoV to bear more accurate perceptive ability through cognition in the
    intra-vehicle network (driver, passengers, smart devices, etc.), inter-vehicle
    network (adjacent intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network (road environment,
    cellular network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture includes
    a cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road
    condition investigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture of
    CIoV. The gathering and preprocessing of big data from several sources are done
    by the sensing layer. As opposed to the previous communication layer (of other
    architectures), the architecture’s communication layer uses a cloud/edge hybrid
    structure to accommodate various application schedules. The data cognition engine
    at the cognition layer processes and interprets heterogeneous data streams (machine
    learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety of cognitive analysis approaches.
    The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in charge of allocating and scheduling
    network resources with the aid of technologies such as NFV, SDN, network slicing,
    and self-organized networking (SON). There are primarily two categories in the
    application layer (i.e., usual application services and intelligent transportation
    applications). Efficient message authentication and integrity are required to
    guarantee vehicle privacy and safeguard vehicular communications. To protect V2V
    and V2I communications in the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber
    threats, Karim [244] provided a cryptography-based routing solution. This solution
    includes a data encryption and decryption mechanism based on attributes and identity
    that has the lowest computational overhead while keeping the optimum level of
    security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245] suggested a seven-layer network architecture.
    The user interface layer, which controls information exchange between the user
    and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units (RSUs) and onboard
    sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing and filtering
    layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data before sending
    the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission. Making
    choices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities of control
    and management. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing layer
    to create the pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop assaults,
    the security layer directly manages each of the layers above. A unique network
    architecture with enhanced throughput, reduced latency, higher security, and widespread
    connectivity was recently proposed by Ji et al. [246]. This architecture consists
    of four layers: Security authentication layer: The RSUs on the road may monitor
    traffic environment data in real-time after setting several sensors, surveillance
    footage, and radar. This layer determines the legality of the car and RSU that
    are requesting to join the network. Perhaps an illegal vehicle or an RSU that
    has been installed unlawfully will attempt to steal or alter the information of
    a real vehicle. Data acquisition layer: This layer collects and categorizes many
    types of data from various networks. To ensure that the data can be sent to the
    edge layer securely, it digitizes the data. Edge layer: Edge devices produce several
    data streams. As a result, processing and analyzing data in one go using ClCom
    will result in significant delays. As a result, we must process data more closely
    related to the data source. The edge node, a physical device situated closest
    to the data source, is used by the edge layer to carry out basic processing and
    analysis on the acquired local data. It releases data analysis findings for nearby
    traffic incidents and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a local
    decision-making plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud data
    center’s computing power. Cloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses
    the information it has collected about global traffic in this tier, develops a
    plan, and rationally distributes traffic resources. This layer, having the ability
    to implement connection management, data management, aided autonomous driving,
    intelligent navigation, path planning, and information security, is the “smart
    brain” of the IoV. A blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)
    for the smart city was presented in [247]. Building innovative distributed transport
    management systems is made possible by the robust and secure Block-VN architecture.
    The authors considered how the network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused
    on networking and vehicular information. To handle real-time transportation data,
    Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing transportation data using Spark
    and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four layers: data collection and
    acquisition, network, data processing, and application. Each layer is built to
    process and manage data in a structured manner. On the data processing layer,
    Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing the suggested event and
    decision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249], the data are made available
    to a smart community member. The suggested approach was examined using transportation
    datasets from some reliable sources. The outcomes demonstrate data processing
    and real-time distribution to citizens in the shortest amount of time. Spark with
    the Hadoop environment produces findings that are quite accurate. From another
    viewpoint, Social IoV (SIoV) are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks
    [250], where vehicular nodes share/exchange information with different entities
    and are thus forth comparable with traditional social networks. Kerrache et al.
    [251] proposed a trust-aware communication architecture for social IoV (TACASHI),
    which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication architecture
    for SIoVs. 5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart Villages The smart village
    paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities using IoT technologies.
    In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried out, including smart agriculture,
    waste management, irrigation management, livestock management, smart energy, smart
    healthcare, and smart education. A smart village or smart rural area can enable
    real-time data analytics and automate decision-making for local villagers regarding
    healthcare, agriculture, environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from
    a smart city as there are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and
    sustainability) between urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart
    village goal, The European Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in
    which it proposed to interfere ICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254]
    addressed the meaning of “smart” in rural contexts as well as its link with sustainability.
    The European Commission-funded Smart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the
    ultimate goal of encouraging and motivating communities to create and execute
    smart village methods and tactics throughout Europe as a tool for rural development,
    serving as the authors’ primary source. IEEE Smart Village [256] also supports
    the world’s energy-impoverished communities by providing a complete solution combining
    renewable energy, community-based education, and entrepreneurial opportunities.
    Malik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart villages with
    different technologies. They concluded that digitization is only possible if a
    reliable and robust network and communication infrastructure are installed in
    the village environment. Shrestha and Drozdenko [258] proposed a Smart Rural framework
    to mitigate the effects of climate change using IoT and the Cloud, building a
    prototype on the Louisiana Tech University campus. Their framework is an energy-efficient
    monitoring system for observing the environmental conditions that affect agricultural
    production and human health. It consists of the following subsystems: Wireless
    Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud Services, and a Web Dashboard. The dashboard converts
    raw sensor data into meaningful information from which public officials and residents
    can adapt to or frustrate the effects of climate change. Monzon Baeza and Alvarez
    Marban [259] proposed a flexible and scalable Smart Rural system for gathering
    and processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional communication
    coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in separate
    segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS). Their
    proposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs of the
    system in the collection of IoT data from these remote rural areas, its coverage
    by space vehicles, and its processing and storage through 5G terrestrial networks
    and cloud services. Their proposal includes the deployment of IoT sensors and
    the development of Amazon Web Services. Conversely, the part of the space segment,
    considered by HAPS, has been simulated for different space channels. This method
    provides a complete and automated smart rural system that allows access to these
    IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet. To provide secure services
    close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored the integration of a Distributed
    Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with IoT in improving security and privacy
    solutions for villagers and consumer electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,
    the authors designed and evaluated the performance of an Intrusion Detection System
    (IDS) in a DFC-based smart village environment. Moreover, they discussed open
    security issues and challenges regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages.
    Rohan et al. [261] proposed a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering
    the resource constraints in a smart village. The authors illustrated the concept
    of collaborative edge computing as applicable to reduce cost and better manage
    the existing infrastructural facilities. Collaboration occurs between the multiple
    IoT edge devices (e.g., the edge data centers or edge routers) for data processing
    and storage. For example, in times of high computational load demand, one village’s
    edge devices can collaborate with another village’s edge devices. 6. Summary Various
    SCAs have different network requirements such as bandwidth, delay tolerance, power
    consumption, reliability, wireless connectivity, mobility, security, and privacy.
    Therefore, they need different protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network architectures
    for IoT are heterogeneous and include various network technologies such as WiFi,
    WSNs, Mesh Wireless Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile Communication
    Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these architectures must
    allow interoperability, while cross-layer design-based recommendations for power
    consumption and congestion control are well-suited proposals. State-of-the-art
    generic network architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm and are
    based on FogC to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.
    Fog and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in
    the future to fulfill QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efficiency.
    The CR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this technology
    can quickly reconfigure the operating parameters of the SG communication system
    to the changing requirements through cognition. By extracting usable data from
    both the physical and network data space, it is possible to increase network security
    and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures will become cognitive.
    These architectures will include cognitive data engines that will conduct cognition
    of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis,
    emotion analysis, and road condition investigation. The networking performance
    of SDN is better than the customary networking of smart buildings (SB). However,
    as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been facing some challenges such as
    network management in terms of maintenance, east–west interface, southbound interface,
    traffic management, energy, ML-based SDN networking for SB, and the network resources
    issue of SB SDN-based networking. 7. Open Research Issues −Network slicing management
    is required: IoT services such as smart transportation and smart energy have diversified
    requirements. To accommodate diverse IoT services, the network slicing paradigm
    is suggested because it enables multiple independent logical networks running
    on the same physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented an architecture
    for intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT) focusing
    on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).
    The authors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing
    management in this field. −NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The
    ETSI Industry Specification Group proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions
    that were before performed by some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the flexible
    provisioning of software-based network functionalities on top of an appropriately
    shared physical infrastructure by separating the network functions from the underlying
    hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing inexpensive commodity servers, it solves
    the issue of operating costs associated with administering and controlling this
    closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is used in conjunction with NFV (the
    software-defined NFV architecture), it can overcome the difficulties associated
    with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic resource management [263].
    SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service environment through NFV. As a
    result, the need for specialized hardware and labor-intensive effort to fulfill
    a new service request is avoided. In conjunction with the use of SDN, NFV also
    allows real-time and dynamic function provisioning along with flexible traffic
    forwarding. The SDN-IoT network may be improved and secured with NVF. It enables
    the software-based deployment of network devices as virtualized components. Throughput
    is increased because of NFV integration in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances
    network performance. To this end, Sinh et al. [264] proposed a practical model
    for hosting IoT services and building SDN controller applications to show that
    SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services. Recently, Mukherjee et al. [265]
    proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV implementation for smart
    cities. −Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology can
    address the bandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can be enabled
    with cognitive functionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum accessing,
    circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs and services can be based
    on CR technology because it can do dynamic sensing and cognition of the surrounding
    environment. For example, in smart grid applications, cognitive IoT can achieve
    the objective of enabling users to know their energy consumption at any time and
    anywhere [267]. In smart home applications, cognitive-radio-equipped sensors can
    handle potential heterogeneous network interference [268]. At the same time, cognitive
    IoT can help with smoother real-time monitoring over longer distances in the healthcare
    industry without worrying about spectrum availability [269]. The complete utilization
    of cognitive radio technology in IoT demands extensive research in spectrum optimization,
    standardization, hardware design, privacy protection, heterogeneous network fusion,
    scalability and flexibility problems, etc. [270]. For this reason, many CIoT-based
    smart city network architectures must be proposed to solve such problems. In this
    regard, Park et al. [271] suggested a CIoT-based smart city network architecture
    that outlines how data collected from SCAs may be analyzed using the CogC paradigm
    and manage the scalability and flexibility challenges. −Challenges in IoT communication
    through TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access Points (APs) can utilize identical
    WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interference problems that can
    significantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many APs can provide
    support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with the DownLink
    multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY layer technology
    (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the capacity of WLANs
    by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations. As a result,
    it is possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to the number of antennas
    on APs. Thus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel and Singh [131] stressed
    the employment of CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods with many APs to improve
    the Compound TCP’s performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL
    method can accelerate the learning processes of the transport protocols such as
    Compound TCP. In FL, training data are dispersed across a large number of clients,
    each having unreliable and comparatively slow network connections, with the aim
    of developing a high-quality centralized model. The authors of [131] insisted
    on using these specialized strategies to coordinate numerous APs with regard to
    losses caused by unique wireless channel characteristics and WiFi downloading
    and uploading dynamics. Through the use of FL and CR approaches in dual AP settings,
    it is now possible to improve the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions. Another
    study [274] assumed TCP Cubic [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the
    FL approach for IoVs. The authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting
    the FL technique, which enhances the efficiency and privacy protection for the
    case of IoVs. −Digital Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources,
    personnel, procedures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital
    twin. Digital twin technology can be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including
    humans, IoT devices, aircraft engines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original
    vehicle is created, for instance, when an automobile business creates a virtual
    representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car model. If a manufacturer creates
    a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the replicated process
    is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a profile of the
    actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this virtual graphic,
    the dynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation are depicted.
    The digital twin can offer the location, state, and/or status of physical assets
    in real-time due to continual learning and advancements. This fusion of the real
    and digital worlds enables organizations to monitor systems, set strategies, and
    anticipate problems before they occur. Digital twins are created using digital
    twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure graphs, AI, software
    analytics, and the IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is demonstrated.
    This technology can efficiently administer the city, from urban planning to the
    optimization of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before
    putting them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.
    If a digital twin is in place, government organizations can only fully assess
    what might be achieved with the data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic
    opportunity, and establish a more cohesive community. Although the idea is currently
    novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few years [277]. −The 6G Network
    for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense and AI-centric
    city because massive device connectivity with vast data traffic is estimated in
    the future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted to the concept
    of Internet of Everything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart cities should have
    a huge bandwidth, low latency, and AI integration. Such networks should also provide
    ubiquity, high QoS, and on-demand content for thousands of interconnected devices.
    The 6G network [278] is the problem-solving network of futuristic cities, with
    huge bandwidth and low latency. It is under development for wireless communications
    technologies supporting cellular data networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks
    will probably be broadband cellular networks, in which the service area is divided
    into small geographical areas (cells). It is expected that 6G will be supported
    by existing 5G infrastructures such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing, together
    with new infrastructure. The network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:
    (1) ultra-fast data rates as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than
    1 ms; (3) increased mobility and coverage; (4) flexible and efficient connection
    of trillion level objects; (5) peak spectral efficiency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very
    high system reliability; and (7) improved network security [279]. However, the
    main problem of 6G is that transmitting at a higher frequency spectrum is prone
    to high path loss, making the distance for transmission limited [280]. The expected
    6G of the radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the capability
    of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability
    of carrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks, such
    as short-range and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can introduce
    complications and hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore, such complications
    of THz waves must be considered, and efficient AI-centric multilayer physical
    network architectures of 6G must be proposed for futuristic smart cities. Farooq
    et al. [280] considered the expectations from a network of futuristic smart cities
    and the problems of THz waves and proposed a conceptual terrestrial network (TN)
    architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a scalable multilayer architecture
    designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart cities. It provides an on-ground
    cloud network that helps smart devices to run AI applications partially on their
    own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore, the distributed and edge computing-oriented
    infrastructure of Bee Hive provides security and reduces traffic load on the upper
    layer of the network. Undoubtedly, pervasive AI is the main enabling technology
    in 6G, while some forms of AI are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples
    of using AI on wireless communications have been proposed, from physical layer
    designs (e.g., channel estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation
    (e.g., traffic control and cache storage management), to security and authentication,
    to dynamic cell and topology formation and management, to fault prediction and
    detection, etc. However, DL-based solutions require high computational complexity,
    which might not fit in current mobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity,
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based RL algorithms must be carefully designed
    to decrease the computational resources required on these devices [282]. Quantum
    communication [283] offers a promising approach to avoiding the challenge of limited
    computational resources and energy efficiency. Applying Artificial Neural Networks
    in IoT also comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy and computational/energy
    requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above issues and envisioned
    6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous systems. Apart
    from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important enabling technologies
    of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies are as follows: Reconfigurable
    Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reflect signals and help in places where
    maintaining Line of Sight (LoS) is difficult. RISs will be mainly deployed on
    doors, windows, and buildings. Cell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology
    is introduced in 5G with a more dense network of access points (APs), and this
    is further developed in 6G to include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287].
    Cell-Free Massive MIMO improves spectral efficiency in communication networks,
    but there are some health risks associated with such a dense network of APs. CubeSat
    communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class spacecraft)
    is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up to 6U, and
    U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units. UAVs/satellite communication. Terahertz communication
    and Optical Wireless Technology [289]. Blockchain technology [290] and quantum
    communication [283]. The development of futuristic smart cities keeps up with
    the development of energy-efficient 6G communication. Kamruzzaman [291] presented
    the key trends in the IoT for energy-efficient 6G wireless communication in smart
    cities. He argues that the application of IoT devices to 6G in smart cities will
    provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency rate, up to 1000 km/h mobility rate,
    100 bps/Hz spectral efficiency, and 1000 GHz frequency. This will resolve the
    issues of energy inefficiency and other concerns in conventional communication
    networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efficient 6G in smart cities via IoT devices
    probably will solve various problems that are encountered by existing smart city
    systems. In futuristic smart cities, residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer
    interface (BCI) technology [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on
    the signals and information that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable
    headsets and devices. It uses human consciousness more than external sources for
    better interaction. As humans have five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell,
    and taste), BCI comprises five datasets, comprising features of human senses that
    are used for human interaction with the machine [292]. 8. Conclusions Utilizing
    resources efficiently, reducing operating expenses, and enhancing city dwellers’
    quality of life are the objectives of the smart city paradigm. This goal is obtained
    by combining various technologies including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big data
    analytics, and robots. For this model, the effective networking and communication
    between the many components required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving
    its objectives. The ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic
    and manageable platforms for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings,
    smart home, smart water, and smart transportation systems. The networking needs
    of the key SCAs were examined in this research, and the appropriate protocols
    that can be applied at different system levels have been identified. Additionally,
    we provided examples of networking protocols and smart grid, intelligent building,
    smart residence, and smart transportation system architectures. We concentrated
    on key criteria for a variety of networking designs, such as energy savings, routing,
    security, dependability, mobility, and support for heterogeneous networks. In
    addition, we presented open research issues. This survey can assist researchers
    to recognize research gaps/problems working in the networking architectures for
    smart cities, and it provides an overview of available protocols and architectures
    for SCAs. Author Contributions Conceptualization, D.K.; methodology, D.K. and

  description: The level of dependence on data communication in the modern era is
    increasing exponentially. The internet of things (IoT) plays a very important
    role in the advancement of the industrial revolution 4.0 that utilizes data communication
    systems. IoT deployments require data communication protocols, such as hypertext
    transfer protocol (HTTP), and message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) as well
    as network communication protocols (wireless) to meet the network needs of devices
    with limited resources. Optimization of data communication in IoT is needed to
    maintain the quality of sending and receiving data in real time. This research
    proposes a hybrid NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT) protocol designed using NarrowBand communication
    network technology with optimization of data communication using MQTT and HTTP
    protocols. In this research, the hybrid NB-IoT protocol has the best packet loss
    value of 0.010% against the HTTP NB-IoT protocol which has a value of 0.017%,
    and the MQTT NB-IoT protocol of 0.024%. The hybrid NB-IoT protocol has a latency
    value of 8.7 seconds compared to the HTTP NB-IoT protocol which has a latency
    of 10.9 seconds. Meanwhile, the throughput value of the hybrid NB-IoT protocol
    is 158906.1 byte/s and is better than the MQTT NB-IoT protocol which is only 158898.6
    bytes/s.

  description: A farmland precision auto-irrigation system based on wireless network
    is proposed to improve the using efficiency of irrigation water. The system consisting
    by host computer, soil moisture sensor, wireless network, ZigBee module, and valve
    controller. The system makes its own network based on ZigBee protocol. Monitor
    center and wireless gateway base on GPRS for information transmission and control.
    System control core is a single-chip microcomputer, composed by wireless sensor
    nodes, routing nodes, and change of wireless gateway real-time monitoring soil
    moisture, also irrigate the soil precisely according to the soil water content
    and the rule of irrigation water. The system realized the automatic water-saving
    irrigation control, improved the utilization of water resources in agriculture
    irrigation and irrigation automation. The results experiment show that, the system's
    flexibility is well. When soil moisture is high or the factors in sensor nodes
    are damaged, other parts of the system can continually work, also having self-organizing
    restore function. The monitoring center can display soil moisture and on/off situation
    of the valve parameters in each node in real-time. It realizs the remote monitoring
    of water saving irrigation. Preface. With the development of electronic technology
    and the shortage of water resources, irrigation automatic control technology has
    a constant progress, but data acquisition is always the core problem of irrigation
    control system [1-2]. Foreign countries had an early start in the irrigation control
    with highly automated irrigation control system. China has made great progress
    in some aspects of farmland soil moisture monitoring. However, there is still
    a huge backward when comparing with foreign countries since the late start and
    old equipment. Therefore, a system with fast, accurate, real-time field information
    collection, real-time monitoring is imperative to realize precise irrigation.
    Precise irrigation is a part of water management. It is mainly about making irrigation
    by crop demand. Precise irrigation system managed irrigation by using modern sensor
    technology for acquisition environment and water information of crop and automated
    irrigation control device.

    consisting by host computer, soil moisture sensor, wireless network, ZigBee module,
    and valve controller. The system makes its own network based on ZigBee protocol.
    Monitor center and wireless gateway base on GPRS for information transmission
    and control. System control core is a single-chip microcomputer, composed by wireless

    financeN pollutionSustainability 1. Introduction The Great Barrier Reef (GBR)
    is a spectacular ecosystem and one of the most complex natural systems on Earth.
    A UNESCO World Heritage Area, the GBR is an icon under pressure since 2014, facing
    severe threats that challenge its resilience. Climate change is the greatest threat
    to the world heritage status of the GBR, while water quality represents cumulative
    pressure, further reducing the resilience of the GBR ecosystems to climate change
    (MacNeil et al. 2019). Land and agricultural activities are the main sources of
    pollutants from the GBR catchments (Steven et al. 2019). For example, modelled
    dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) load to the Great Barrier Reef is around 12
    kt/yr, mostly delivered by the Wet Tropics (46%) and Burdekin (21%) regions (Bartley
    et al. 2017). Pollutants originating from agricultural lands cause major damage
    to coral reefs. Therefore, improvements on two fronts are required to restore
    the GBR resilience and improve its long-term outlook: (1) effectively improve
    water quality at a regional scale, and (2) halt and reverse the effects of climate
    change at a global level (GBRMPA 2019). Agriculture is the dominant land use in
    the GBR catchments, with sugarcane being the main crop (Thorburn et al. 2011a).
    In 2016–17, the gross value of agricultural production in Queensland was $14 billion,
    of which 22% came from sugarcane production (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2017).
    In 2019–20, 31.1 million tonnes of sugarcane were produced across Australia, of
    which approximately 95% was grown in Queensland’s coastal regions adjacent to
    the GBR (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2021). Sugarcane production systems are
    usually intensive, with large inputs of fertilisers and water. Irrigation is vital
    to sugarcane production in many parts of the world, as the crop requires >2000
    mm of irrigation water to achieve commercial yields (Thorburn et al. 2013). Irrigation
    increases the chance of N losses (Gheysari et al., 2009, Randall et al., 2015),
    especially when applied with low application efficiency, which leads to substantial
    runoff and/or deep drainage. The lower Burdekin region typifies this situation
    (Thorburn et al. 2011a), where substantial irrigation is applied to crops through
    furrow irrigation, and N fertiliser applications are the highest among the GBR
    catchments. Consequently, N has been identified as a chemical of concern to GBR
    health in the region, as N runoff contributes to algae production, which feeds
    juvenile Crown-of-Thorns starfish, a marine invertebrate that feeds on coral (Mitchell
    et al. 2007). Modelling indicates that 21% of nutrient loads to the GBR comes
    from the Burdekin region (Bartley et al. 2017), largely due to water runoff carrying
    fertiliser pollutants, predominantly from sugarcane (Waters et al., 2014, Brodie
    et al., 2015). Increasing the efficiency of water use and N application in agricultural
    systems benefits farmers by reducing input costs (Biggs et al. 2021) and must
    be a part of any strategy to solve water-quality-related issues in the GBR catchments
    (Mueller et al., 2017, Taylor and Eberhard, 2020). Management of nitrogen loads
    to the GBR to improve water quality has been the focus of major investments by
    state and federal governments, not-for-profit organisations, and farmers (Waltham
    et al., 2021, Coggan et al., 2021). The reduction rate of pollutant loads has
    been slow, reflecting modest improvement in agricultural land management practices
    (GBRMPA 2019). Future initiatives must deliver timely, best-practice agricultural
    land management over a wider area to improve water quality. These initiatives
    must address the issues of over-irrigating (i.e., irrigation losses to runoff
    and leeching), which costs the farmers more in terms of water use and electricity,
    and under-irrigating (i.e., higher N losses due to lower yield). Halting and reversing
    the effects of climate change requires addressing the issue of atmospheric greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions. Australia’s Long-term Emissions Reduction Plan expects a
    29–36% reduction in emissions from the agriculture sector. From this perspective,
    the contribution of sugarcane production to Australia’s GHG emissions is an issue
    of national concern. A study in Brazil (de Figueiredo et al. 2010) estimated that
    241 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent were released to the atmosphere per ton of
    sugar produced. Residue burning (44%) and synthetic fertilisers (20%) were the
    two major parts of total emissions. In Australia, total CO2 emissions from residue
    burning, trash-blanketed, and bare sugarcane fields in the 1994 season were estimated
    at 7.6 Mt CO2-C year−1. N2O emanating from sugarcane soils via denitrification
    and methane evolution following the burning of the crop were shown to be two other
    major sources of GHG. On the other hand, the sugarcane crop was also identified
    as a major sink for C, with uptake by the crop in 1994 estimated at 13.4 Mt CO2-C/year
    (Weier 1998). This suggests that management decisions at the paddock level and
    the productivity of sugarcane lands directly affect the contribution of sugarcane
    production systems to Australia’s total GHG emissions. Improving water quality
    and contributing to solutions that mitigate climate change impacts requires a
    multi-dimensional approach considering the complex interactions between soil,
    climate, farm management, farm economics, GHG emission, and green finance systems.
    Hence, a decision support tool is needed to unravel these complex interactions
    and guide agricultural land managers about which management practices are more
    likely to succeed in delivering better water quality and climate outcomes whilst
    maintaining profits at the farmgate. Notwithstanding countless efforts and several
    policies that have already been formulated to achieve these goals at a regional
    scale, less emphasis has been put on influencing paddock-scale practices, especially
    irrigation management, and measuring their effect on the water quality outcome
    for the GBR. Moreover, there is a need for a new tool that conveniently integrates
    complex information and measures improvement in sustainability at the paddock
    scale so that improved management can be better linked to sustainable finance
    systems. Another tool commonly used in the Burdekin and adjacent regions (i.e.,
    the Paddock-to-Reef Projector) is unsuitable for the paddock-scale investigations.
    In addition, the new tool must allow farmers to answer, “Is it possible to reduce
    water and energy consumption without compromising productivity, profitability
    and sustainability?”. However, some challenges must be overcome for such tools
    to be successfully adopted by the target end-users (see section 2.1). Therefore,
    this paper aims to demonstrate, via a practical ‘what-if’ example, how fundamental
    learnings about more (drought) resilient farming systems and more sustainable
    irrigation practices can be extracted from a paddock-scale ‘discussion’ support
    system (DSS; Nelson et al. 2002) named Irrigation Rapid Assessment Tool (hereafter
    referred to as ‘i-RAT’). Details of the participatory approach with research and
    industry partners that informed the design and function of i-RAT and how APSIM
    was set up and parameterised are discussed. 2. i-RAT development: a co-learning
    and participatory process i-RAT was developed as a DSS and rapid assessment-visualisation
    tool to assess the economic and environmental impacts of different sugarcane irrigation
    practices. The aim was to make a robust but complex crop model more accessible
    to farmers and advisors without requiring them to collect data and set up the
    model for numerous combinations of soil types, weather stations, and management
    scenarios. i-RAT bridges the gap between better irrigation management and natural
    capital accounting, with the view to encouraging farmers to consider transitioning
    to more efficient irrigation practices that will deliver a better economic and
    environmental outcome. Potential stakeholders and end-users of i-RAT include,
    but are not limited to, sugarcane farmers, extension officers, agronomic advisors,
    sustainability financiers, and government agencies. Burdekin was selected as the
    pilot area (Fig. 1). With 67,000 ha of the sugarcane-cultivated area producing
    more than 7 million tonnes per annum, the Burdekin Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2)
    is the largest sugarcane-producing region in Australia. i-RAT was designed through
    participatory processes based on the conceptual framework proposed by Jakku and
    Thorburn (2010). Four ‘Focus Groups'' were consulted through the design and implementation
    of i-RAT: (1) the ‘Research’ focus group: comprising the Paddock-to-Reef (P2R;
    Australian and Queensland Governments 2022) modelling and adoption teams; (2)
    the ‘Farming’ focus group: comprising a selected group of the Burdekin region’s
    sugarcane farmers; (3) the ‘Extension’ focus group: comprising extension officers
    from different organisation in the Burdekin. and (4) the ‘Finance’ focus group:
    comprising representatives of Queensland Government’s Department of Agriculture
    and Fisheries (DAF), GreenCollar (https://greencollar.com.au), and Queensland
    Rural and Industry Development Authority (QRIDA; https://www.qrida.qld.gov.au).
    In this context, i-RAT was considered a ‘boundary object’ as it created a connection
    between the participants while remaining sufficiently flexible to be used by different
    parties for their own purposes (Jakku and Thorburn 2010). This boundary object
    facilitated the re-framing of assumptions, expectations, and knowledge (i.e.,
    ‘technological frames’) of participants (including the core team) regarding the
    problem of efficient irrigation and helped the participants to arrive at a shared
    understanding of the problem and potential solutions (i.e., ‘interpretative flexibility’).
    While the Research focus group ensured rigour in the scientific modelling processes,
    the role of other focus groups was to ensure that i-RAT was meaningful and comprehensive
    yet easy to use with useful and informative outputs. Download : Download high-res

    sugar-producing region in northeastern Australia (left). The white border shows
    the approximate boundary of the study region (right). Markers are the locations
    of the two weather stations (Ayr DPI Research Station and Clare). 3. i-RAT modelling
    framework The sugarcane module from the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator
    (APSIM; Keating et al., 2003, Holzworth et al., 2014) modelling framework generated
    a data cube containing modelled outputs (1961–2021) from 240,408 simulated scenarios
    incorporating different weather stations, soil types, and farm management scenarios.
    These simulated outputs from the crop model were complemented with farm economic
    calculations as functions of yields, water, labour, and electricity costs. The
    modelling framework was built on the work of the Research focus group and the
    P2R Projector (https://p2rprojector.net.au; Australian and Queensland Governments
    2022). The P2R Projector estimates the water quality improvement of farm-scale
    agricultural practice change projects. However, due to spatial aggregation and
    upscaling, the P2R Projector is unsuitable for the paddock scale. This issue was
    discussed and established in meetings with the members of the Research focus group.
    Therefore, an upgraded modelling framework was developed using the framework implemented
    by the P2R Projector modelling team as the base. All APSIM manager scripts were
    rewritten in the new type of ‘manager scripts’ that enables the adoption of the
    C# programming language. These manager scripts provide more flexibility in implementing
    complex management scenarios. Regionally representative management scenarios were
    defined within the new framework in consultation with the Modelling and Extension
    focus groups. Rigorous testing ensured that the two frameworks would produce reasonably
    comparable outputs for the same management scenarios. 3.1. APSIM setup Crop modelling
    and irrigation scheduling were performed with APSIM, a modelling framework that
    simulates crop-soil-atmosphere dynamics daily. APSIM requires detailed data on
    sugarcane physiology and morphology, weather, soil physical and chemical properties,
    and management (sowing and harvest time, tillage, fertilisation, irrigation, etc.).
    Various sources of data were used. Fig. 2 shows the data ingestion and modelling
    framework implemented in APSIM. This structure, implemented in APSIM, has multiple
    components, each responsible for a part of the data ingestion and modelling process.
    All these components calculate many intermediary variables that will then be used
    by other components or in post-processing. Data Manager provides an entry point
    in APSIM graphical user interface where the user can choose the irrigation scenario,
    fertilisation scenario, and tillage scenario, among others, and choose parameters
    related to sugarcane cultivation, e.g., the variety to be sown, sowing depth and
    sowing density. These data will then be passed on to the other manager components.

    Fig. 2. Data ingestion and modelling framework implemented in APSIM. 3.2. Simulation
    scenarios To generate a data cube that covers a wide range of representative paddock
    management scenarios, many simulations needed to be run. Each simulation represented
    a combination of scenarios for soil (six soil classes), planting (six scenarios),
    tillage (seven scenarios), irrigation frequency (four scenarios), irrigation rate
    (13 scenarios), dry-off period (three scenarios), and N fertilisation rate (three
    scenarios) and timing (one scenario). The scenarios previously investigated by
    the P2R Projector modelling team were reviewed, and amendments and/or modifications
    were applied, if necessary, to create more realistic and representative scenarios.
    In total, 240,408 scenarios (all combinations of scenarios × two weather stations)
    were simulated continuously (i.e., without resetting the initial water/N conditions
    at the beginning of each crop) using six simulation starting years (to simulate
    plant crop, all ratoons, and bare fallow in every year) over the 60-year period
    of 1961–2020 (>86 million crops) and analysed. Crop model simulations and post-processing
    of the outputs were executed using the JCU High-Performance Computing platform
    (‘Zodiac’). 3.2.1. Soil and weather data Six soil profiles were selected (two
    from the APSoil database, v3.37, and four from Donnollan, 1991, Attard et al.,
    2009, Hesp et al., 2011) that represent the dominant soil types in the Burdekin
    region. These soil profiles represented six different soil classes regarding plant-available
    water (PAW; Low, Medium, and Very High) and water infiltration (Very Low, Low,
    Medium, and Very High). Currently, we are using data from the SILO patch point
    dataset (Jeffrey et al. 2001) for two weather stations (Ayr DPI Research Station
    and Clare; Fig. 1). 3.2.2. Crop/fallow cycles Six scenarios were defined with
    planting times ranging from March 15 to August 15 with a plant crop, four ratoons,
    and bare fallow. Sugarcane planting was simulated for the cultivar ‘Q117′ considering
    10 plants/m2 and a planting depth of 15 cm. Plant crops were harvested 12–15 months
    after planting, while ratoons were harvested 7–13 months after the harvest of
    the previous crop, depending on the selected scenario. 3.2.3. Tillage Five tillage
    scenarios were defined, representing conservation-tillage to intensive-tillage
    regimes. The first tillage, if any, was performed one day after this period. In
    APSIM, tillage operations can have two effects: (1) reduction in the soil curve
    number (CN) value (i.e., reducing run-off), and (2) incorporation of plant residuals
    in the soil. Each operation can cause one or both effects. Tillage depth, CN reduction,
    a fraction of residue incorporated, and cumulative rain required to reset the
    value of CN to its original value were determined for a wide range of tillage
    operations and were implemented in relevant APSIM input files. Any operation in
    the model, including planting and tillage, was subject to soil workability, i.e.,
    an operation was plausible if available moisture in the first soil layer was less
    than the Drained Upper Limit (DUL) of the layer. If this criterion was not met,
    the operation would be postponed and skipped if postponed for more than ten days.
    3.2.4. Residue burning The user can choose whether crop residue is burnt before
    a harvest. In APSIM-Sugarcane, a fraction of leaf (live and senesced) and cabbage
    can be ‘burnt’ at harvest, with the remaining material becoming surface residue
    in the APSIM-SurfaceOM module. Here, 85% of the leaf and cabbage was assumed to
    be ‘burnt’. Choosing to keep crop residue instead of burning it was only possible
    if zonal tillage scenarios were selected. 3.2.5. Irrigation Five irrigation frequency
    (i.e., timing) scenarios were defined (Table 1), including low, medium, and high-frequency
    regimes along with two soil water deficit (SWD)-based irrigation scenarios (scenarios
    ‘SWD-Based-Drip’ and ‘SWD-Based’). Table 1. Number of irrigations during the crop
    establishment phase for different irrigation scenarios. The values in parentheses
    show the last day of the crop establishment phase. SWD: soil water deficit. Scenario
    Plant Ratoon 1 Ratoon 2 Ratoon 3+ SWD-Based Drip irrigation: SWD > 15% of PAW
    over the top 600 mm of soil Furrow irrigation: SWD > 40% of PAW over the top 900
    mm of soil Low-Frequency 3 irrigations (91 days) 4 irrigations (87 days) 4 irrigations
    (80 days) 4 irrigations (66 days) Medium-Frequency 4 irrigations (91 days) 5 irrigations
    (87 days) 5 irrigations (73 days) 5 irrigations (65 days) High-Frequency 5 irrigations
    (91 days) 6 irrigations (87 days) 6 irrigations (72 days) 5 irrigations (62 days)
    For the low, medium, and high-frequency scenarios, irrigation scheduling was done
    separately for two parts of the growing season. Three to six irrigation events
    were simulated between the beginning of crop establishment and a maximum of 91
    days later (Table 1). The irrigation frequency increases after establishment (Table
    1) as demand for water increases before slowing as demand slows prior to dry-off
    (i.e., the period prior to harvest during which irrigation is stopped). During
    the peak-demand phase, irrigation was performed regularly (every 7, 10 and 14
    days, respectively). Moreover, three scenarios (5, 8 and 11 weeks) were defined
    for the dry-off period. In the soil water deficit (SWD)-based irrigation scenarios,
    irrigation was triggered when SWD within the top 600 mm was larger than 15% of
    plant available water (PAW). In the ‘SWD-Based-Drip’ scenario, which represented
    a fully automated high-frequency, high-efficiency (90%) irrigation regime (e.g.,
    subsurface drip), irrigation water was applied as much as it was needed to fill
    the soil profile over the maximum of the rooting depth and 600 mm. In the ‘SWD-Based’
    scenario, however, irrigation water was applied as much as the amount set by the
    irrigation amount scenario. In these two water-deficit-based scenarios, an irrigation
    event was triggered only if at least two days had passed from the last irrigation
    event. Thirteen irrigation amount scenarios (50, 65, 80, 95, 110, 125, 140, 155,
    170, 185, 200, 250, and 350 mm) were simulated. Irrigation events were postponed
    based on the following rules: (1) two days delay for a 20-mm 3-day rainfall, six
    days for a 50-mm rainfall, and ten days for a 100-mm rainfall, while 3-day rainfall
    was capped at 7 mm × (irrigation cycle + 2) to account for the soil water holding
    capacity, assuming a maximum evapotranspiration rate of 7 mm d–1; (2) one day
    delay for every 7-mm daily rainfall (capped at 7 mm × irrigation cycle); (3) taking
    the maximum value obtained by the two rules; and (4) capping the delay to the
    number of days passed from the previous irrigation event, to account for lesser
    effect of rainfalls closer to the previous irrigation. The postponement rule did
    not apply to the SW-based scenarios. 3.2.6. N fertilisation rate Three scenarios
    were simulated for the ‘base’ N application rate: 180, 200 and 220 kg ha−1. For
    plant sugarcane, 25% of N fertiliser was applied on planting day, and the rest
    90 days after planting. For ratoons, all N was applied the day after harvest of
    the previous plant/ratoon. Under SWD-Based irrigation scenarios, one irrigation
    event was triggered one day after N was applied. 3.3. Run-off DIN modules The
    Paddock-to-Reef Modelling Team (Vilas et al. 2022) calibrated and validated a
    model with more than ten years of data from two of the main Australian sugarcane
    regions, a high (Wet Tropics) and moderate (Mackay Whitsundays) rainfall area.
    This model was used to estimate DIN in run-off. The model predicts DIN losses
    in runoff from both inorganic and organic fertilisers (RMSE = 0.37 and 2.0 kg
    N ha−1 for the Wet Tropics and Mackay Whitsunday regions, respectively) as a function
    of the concentration of nitrate and ammonium in the first layer of the soil profile
    (0–10 cm) and the amount of predicted runoff. 3.4. Greenhouse gas emission Multiple
    sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission were considered: (1) CO2 emission during
    the decomposition of soil organic material, (2) nitrous oxide (N2O) emission during
    nitrification and denitrification, (3) emission due to pumping of water, and (4)
    N2O and CH4 (methane) emission due to residue burning. The APSIM SoilN module
    estimated the first two sources. CO2 emission was defined as efficiency coefficients
    representing the proportion of carbon retained in the system. APSIM assumes, by
    default, that 60% of decomposed carbon (C) is lost to the atmosphere. N2O emission
    during nitrification is calculated as a proportion of nitrified N (Li et al. 2007).
    N2O emission during denitrification is calculated by combining predictions of
    denitrification with the ratio of N2 to N2O emitted during denitrification (Grosso
    et al. 2000). The amount of GHG emission due to pumping depends on the fuel used
    and energy required to pump a unit of water. CO2 emission factors for combustion
    were extracted from IPCC (2006a). According to IPCC (2006b), for estimating GHG
    emissions due to plant residue burning in agricultural areas, only CH4 and N2O
    emissions should be considered because the crop growth in a 1-year period would
    compensate for the CO2 emissions. This hypothesis was also applied to carbon monoxide
    (CO) as it is quickly converted to CO2 in the atmosphere. NOx emissions were also
    not considered in our estimations because their global warming potential is uncertain.
    The IPCC (2006b) methodology was applied to estimate GHG emissions from burning.
    The emission factors adopted were 2.7 and 0.07 for CH4 and N2O (g kg−1 of burned
    dry matter), respectively (Andreae and Merlet 2001). At this stage, GHG emission
    resulting from the combustion of fuel is not considered. 3.5. APSIM parameterisation
    The default values of radiation use efficiency (RUE) for plant and ratoons were
    set at 1.8 and 1.65, respectively (Robertson et al. 1996). While it is usually
    assumed that potential photosynthesis (i.e., RUE) is reduced by 80% when the fraction
    of crop roots exposed to water logging reaches 100% (Meier and Thorburn 2016),
    these parameters were deemed to cause too severe water-logging impact for the
    Burdekin region (personal communications with the P2R Projector Tool modelling
    team). Therefore, to account for the erratic and local nature of waterlogging
    across a paddock, it was assumed that RUE was affected when the fraction of water-logged
    roots exceeded 70% and was reduced by 30% when it reached 100%. While in some
    of the previous studies and projects (including early versions of P2R Projector),
    the impact of lodging was simulated when daily rainfall exceeded 20 mm when plant
    biomass was above 20 t ha−1 (Thorburn et al., 2011a, Biggs et al., 2013, Meier
    and Thorburn, 2016), the impact was not considered here due to its erratic and
    unpredictable spatial pattern in a single paddock and for lack of reliable field
    data. Transpiration efficiency coefficient (TEC) was increased from 8.7 (Inman-Bamber
    and McGlinchey 2003) to 12.4 g kPa kg−1 (Jackson et al. 2014) when the water stress
    factor (i.e., water supply/demand ratio) reduced from 1.0 to 0.31 (Inman-Bamber
    et al. 2016). The effect of atmospheric [CO2] on transpiration efficiency coefficient
    (TEC) and RUE was simulated with the model proposed by Webster et al. (2009).
    Daily atmospheric [CO2] was estimated using a 3rd-degree polynomial fitted (R2
    = 0.999) on the monthly data obtained from the Cape Grim station (Ziehn et al.
    2016). 4. i-RAT review process Following several internal meetings, the i-RAT
    project team met with the focus groups multiple times between March 2021 and September
    2022. A beta version of i-RAT (v1.0) was developed via a step-by-step process
    in close consultation with the Research, Extension, and Finance focus groups.
    These groups were first surveyed about the ‘problem’ i-RAT was intended to address
    and how to formulate the potential solutions. The survey results were collated
    and discussed by groups, and the path forward was agreed upon. The boundaries
    of the analyses (i.e., soil, irrigation, planting, and tillage parameters, etc.)
    were also negotiated, and a trade-off was achieved between maintaining the simplicity
    of the tool whilst still providing sufficient details desirable to the focus groups,
    all constrained by data availability and computational resources to conduct simulations
    and analyses. Multiple sub-versions of the user interface were developed and tested,
    each incorporating new/improved features. Finally, the alpha version was presented
    to six members of the Farming focus group in May 2022 via a series of one-on-one
    demonstrations by an extension officer. Expectations, experiences, and learnings
    were documented and combined with the feedback received from other focus groups
    and incorporated into the design of i-RAT. The beta version was developed using
    Shiny, an open-source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework
    for building web applications using R. Before releasing the alpha version of i-RAT
    (v2.0), the interface was rebuilt using ReactJS, a highly used open-source JavaScript
    library, to improve the loading speed and eliminate the need for a costly server
    to host/run the application. The alpha version was released in August 2022 and
    presented to the Farming focus group in September-October 2022. The final review
    of i-RAT was conducted in two meetings in September 2022, wherein it was presented
    to the other focus groups. 5. i-RAT user interface To ensure gradual exposure
    and learning, two different user interfaces were designed. The ‘basic’ user interface
    was used through the development phase and was presented to the farmers and extension
    officers. The ‘premium’ user interface, described in the following sections, was
    presented to the Research, Extension, and Finance focus groups. This version of
    the user interface provides more options and enables more comprehensive analyses
    of water balance, N/C balance, and GHG emission. 5.1. Inputs • Paddock settings
    (Fig. 3A, Fig. 4): the user can define the paddock settings to explore the data
    cube by changing options via the drop-down lists. Current options include region
    (currently only Burdekin), weather station (currently Ayr DPI Research Station
    and Clare), soil (six soil types), planting scenario (six scenarios), display
    results (averaged across all crops, plant only, or individual ratoons), tillage
    scenario (seven scenarios classified in four groups), residue burning, dry-off
    period, N fertiliser, fallow (currently only bare fallow), and paddock size. A
    help button is provided for each menu which leads to a relevant section in the
    i-RAT documentation. In addition, the user can change water cost, energy used
    for pumping (for surface and drip irrigation), energy cost and other parameters
    to reflect the reality of the paddock. These parameters are used to estimate water
    and energy savings due to changes in irrigation management. Download : Download

    Fig. 4. Options Available under ‘Paddock settings’ section in the premium version
    of the user interface (see Fig. 3). • Irrigation settings (Fig. 3B): in this section,
    the user can compare two irrigation scenarios. Each scenario is defined by irrigation
    frequency (during the establishment phase and the peak-demand period) and irrigation
    amount. 5.2. Outputs • Summary (Fig. 3C): provides a colour-coded summary of (simulated)
    changes achievable by going from Current to New irrigation scenario. It consists
    of a few sections with information on the impact of change in irrigation scenario
    on water and energy cost, water quality (N and soil loss), total amount of irrigation
    water applied, number of irrigations, energy used, cane and sucrose yields, Gross
    Production Water Use Index (GPWUI = cane yield / (gross water applied + effective
    rainfall), Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), and GHG emissions. • Cane and Sucrose
    Yield (Fig. 3C): provides visualisations for cane and sucrose yield changes due
    to changes in the irrigation scenario from Current to New irrigation scenario.
    ‘History chart’ lets the user visually inspect and ‘count’ the number of seasons
    (out of 50 simulated seasons) where the target variable increased/decreased or
    did not change substantially (shown in grey). ‘Count plot’ and ‘Count table’ show
    the number of seasons in which the change in target variable would have been in
    a pre-defined range (e.g., ±5-10%). ‘Probability plot’ shows the same data that
    ‘Count plot’ shows, except in the form of probability. ‘Pie chart’ shows the probabilities
    of improvement and worsening of the target variable. ‘Box plot’ shows the variation
    (10, 25, 50, 75, and 90th quantiles) of the target variable under each irrigation
    scenario. • Water Balance (Fig. 3C): provides visualisations for various components
    of water balance, including irrigation water applied, runoff, deep drainage, evapotranspiration,
    crop transpiration, soil evaporation, number of irrigations, and in-season rainfall.
    • N Balance (Fig. 3C): provides visualisations for N balance, including plant
    N uptake, N loss via run-off and leaching, denitrification, surface residue N
    burnt, soil inorganic N at harvest, harvested cane N content, soil organic N at
    harvest, N2O emission from soil, and N2O emission from burnt biomass. • C Balance
    (Fig. 3C): provides visualisations for carbon (C) balance, including soil C at
    harvest, surface residue C burnt, and surface residue dry matter burnt. • GHG
    Emission (Fig. 3C): provides visualisations for GHG emission, including total
    GHG emission, CO2 emission from the soil, N2O emission from the soil, N2O emission
    from burnt biomass, CH4 emission from burnt biomass, and GHG emission from pumping.
    • Productivity (Fig. 3C): provides visualisations for GPWUI and NUE. • Weather
    (Fig. 3C): provides visualisations for long-term averages and annual time-series
    of weather data (minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall, evaporation, and radiation).
    The new scenario is considered better (displayed in green) or worse (displayed
    in red) than the current scenario only if the impact of the change in the irrigation
    scenario on the target variable is greater than ± 5%. Otherwise, the change is
    shown in grey. 6. Extract learning from i-RAT: A ‘what-if’ analysis 6.1. Context
    Suppose that a farm manager is considering improving their irrigation practice
    to enhance the farm’s financial status. The farm is in the Burdekin region and
    has several blocks where soil with ‘Medium PAW & Very Low Infiltration’ is dominant.
    Currently, irrigation is applied every ten days during the peak-demand period
    and during each irrigation event, 140 mm of water is applied via a furrow irrigation
    system (Table 2). The sugarcane crop is planted on April 15 and harvested after
    15 months, followed by four 13-month ratoons. A moderate tillage scenario (up
    to 10 operations) is applied before planting and after harvest. Crop residue is
    burnt before each harvest. The dry-off period is 35 days, and 200 kg ha−1 of N
    fertiliser is applied to each crop. The electricity to operate the pump is provided
    via a local company and is generated at a power plant that burns brown coal. Other
    management decisions and financial variables are depicted in Fig. 4. Table 2.
    Irrigation scenarios for the example ‘What-If’ analyses. For other paddock parameters,
    see Fig. 4. Operation cost and harvest loss are not considered in these analyses.
    Soil type Irrigation frequency Irrigation rate Example of i-RAT irrigation setup
    Medium PAW Very Low Infiltration 10-day cycles at peak demand 140 mm The farm
    manager sought consultation from an extension officer. They decided to use i-RAT
    to perform a series of ‘what-if’ analyses to explore a few relatively simple options
    which might improve water and energy use efficiency. The options included reducing
    the irrigation amount from 140 mm per irrigation to 110 mm, 80 mm, and 50 mm (see
    the last column of Table 2). They created three 1-ha paddocks, which only differed
    regarding New Scenario. Then, they went through the Summary Tab first to quickly
    grasp the outcome of such a change on farm finance, water quality, water/energy
    use, productivity, and GHG emission (Fig. 5). They also used the visualisation
    tabs to explore the implications for multiple aspects of the production system.
    Along with the impact of this change on the farm’s water-energy productivity,
    they wanted to know if this change might improve their farming practices regarding
    water quality and GHG emissions. Download : Download high-res image (576KB) Download

    analyses (reducing irrigation amount from 140 mm to 110 mm per irrigation event).
    Green (red) colour means the new scenario is better (worse) than the current scenario
    and grey colour shows small or no changes (see the text for definition). In the
    next section, we present i-RAT outcomes in detail for one selected scenario (reducing
    irrigation amount from 140 mm to 110 mm per irrigation event; hereafter the ‘140-110′
    scenario). At the end, we provide a summary of their findings for all three scenarios/paddocks
    and how they performed a multi-criteria analysis to answer their questions. 6.2.
    Learning Fig. 5 shows i-RAT’s Summary Tab for the first paddock representing the
    140 mm to 110 mm scenario. i-RAT’s outputs show that reducing irrigation amount
    from 140 mm to 110 mm per irrigation, without any change in irrigation frequency
    scenario (see Table 2), would lead to 314 AUD ha−1 of saving in water and energy
    cost in an average season. This saving would result from an 8.4 ML reduction in
    water consumption and a 585-kWh reduction in energy consumption. As cane and sucrose
    yield would not markedly change, the Gross Production Water Use Index (GPWUI)
    would be a direct function of water consumption and raised by 23.9%, on average.
    Given the assumed sugar and water price, the farmer could expect a 358 AUD ha−1
    increase in net income. From a water quality perspective, reducing water consumption
    would lead to substantially less N loss via run-off (3.5 kg ha−1), though a reduction
    in N leaching via deep drainage would be relatively small (0.1 kg ha−1) due to
    the low infiltration capacity of the soil (Fig. 6). This scenario would reduce
    total GHG emission by at least 5% in 8 out of 50 seasons (Fig. 7), leading to
    a small reduction in the average total emission from the paddock (0.1 t CO2-e
    ha−1), mostly due to a reduction (0.2 t CO2-e ha−1) in pumping-related emissions.

    Selected count plots from the i-RAT’s GHG Emission Tab for an example ‘What-If’
    analyses (reducing irrigation amount from 140 mm to 110 mm per irrigation event).
    Each plot shows the number of analysed seasons in which the target variable increased
    or decreased or did not change markedly. Green colour means new scenario is better
    than current scenario, red means current scenario is better than new scenario,
    and grey colour shows small or no changes (see the text for definition). The same
    observations were made for other two paddocks (data not shown). Obviously, the
    more reduction in irrigation amount, the more saving in terms of water and energy
    cost and N loss via run-off and leaching. GHG emission would not change tangibly
    unless irrigation amount is reduced to 50 mm, which would lead to 1.1 t CO2-e
    ha−1 reduction in GHG emission. However, on the other hand, the 140–50 scenario
    would lead, on average, to 7% reduction in cane yield which in turn would lower
    the gross income by 719 AUD ha 1. While even under such circumstances, the saving
    related to water and energy cost would cover the loss of income due to lower yield,
    this scenario would involve higher risk. It may be least appealing to the farmer
    and wider industry that relies on maximising cane volume. Fig. 8 summarises the
    ‘what-if’ analyses by showing changes in selected financial (sucrose yield, and
    water and energy cost) and environmental (total N pollution and loss, soil carbon
    at harvest, and total GHG emission) indices due to change in irrigation rate from
    140 mm per irrigation event to 110 mm, 80 mm, and 50 mm, respectively. As mentioned
    before, sucrose yield would only decrease significantly if the irrigation amount
    per irrigation event was to be reduced from 140 to 50 mm (Fig. 8A). Total N pollution
    (i.e., N loss via run-off + deep drainage) could be lowered by 10–20% with every
    30 mm reduction in irrigation water (Fig. 8C). We can see that reduced water consumption
    would lead to a higher amount of C stored in the soil profile at harvest, though
    the impact is small (Fig. 8E). Download : Download high-res image (311KB) Download

    in selected financial (sucrose yield, and water and energy cost) and environmental
    (total N pollution and loss, soil carbon at harvest, and total GHG emission) indices
    due to change in irrigation rate from 140 mm per irrigation event to 110 mm, 80
    mm, and 50 mm, respectively. Unlike N loss, N pollution (run-off + leaching) does
    not include denitrification. From an environmental perspective, reducing water
    application per irrigation event would directly affect the amount of N pollution
    and GHG emission from the paddock (Fig. 8C, F). Therefore, while lower yield might
    be an important factor leading to the ruling-out of the 140–50 scenario, it could
    still be a viable option for the farmer if the loss of income (due to lower yield)
    was compensated through sustainability funds in recognition of lower N pollution
    and GHG emission. This option will be discussed in more detail. 7. Discussion
    7.1. Modelling: A solution to a multifaceted problem The rising costs of electricity
    and water have inflated the importance of adopting more efficient irrigation practices
    and state-of-the-art technologies that are usually embedded in decision/discussion
    support systems. Better irrigation practices, through increased water use efficiency,
    can deliver economic, environmental, and social outcomes to agroecological systems
    (Mueller et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2020). Improving irrigation practices requires
    quality data on crop water requirement during the season. In Queensland, the total
    crop water requirement is usually calculated using the concept of reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0; Allen et al. 1998). This approach is simple and easy to implement but does
    not consider the impact of soil and crop status on its water and nutrition requirements.
    For proper irrigation scheduling, the atmospheric demand for water vapour, soil
    characteristics, and plant-specific features must be considered (Anadranistakis
    et al. 2000). A crop model, like APSIM-Sugar, simulates many processes to model
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum as a dynamic system. Application of such models
    can lead to improved water requirement estimation and irrigation scheduling. However,
    it requires a considerable amount of data on soil, weather, plant, and management
    along with a high level of expertise and experience. A DSS built upon data generated
    by a crop model, like i-RAT, removes the complexity of such models and provides
    ready-to-use data to users without requiring them to know anything about the setting
    up of a crop model. Implementation of the GBR 2050 Plan (State of Queensland 2018)
    marked a significant shift in how the federal and state governments should lead
    collaborations in addressing challenges that face the GBR. However, achieving
    tangible outcomes has proven difficult, partly due to a lack of quality paddock-scale
    data on N pollution and GHG emission from vast and diverse agricultural lands
    in the region. To assess the relative importance of various N loss pathways (run-off,
    deep drainage, and denitrification) along with CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions from
    agricultural production systems, and to suggest possible procedures for mitigating
    these air and water pollutants, obtaining quality data on GHG and N pollution
    generated at a paddock level is essential. However, measuring these emissions
    and losses at a paddock level is extremely time-consuming and costly, if not impossible.
    Once again, crop models can reasonably reproduce processes involved in the soil-atmosphere
    C/N cycle and provide reliable estimates, which can then replace and/or complement
    such field measurements. 7.2. Environmental markets and incentives i-RAT is a
    tool that can help farmers, extension staff, and local advisors trial scenarios
    that can mitigate the main threats to the GBR and potentially benefit from existing
    and emerging environmental markets and financial incentives. Climate change or
    land-based run-off (i.e., water quality) present a very high-risk to the GBR’s
    ecosystem and heritage values (GBRMPA 2019). At the same time, increasing GHG
    emissions from human activities continue to pressure the agricultural sector to
    mitigate emission (de Figueiredo et al. 2010). In response to these and other
    environmental challenges, the Australian federal government recently passed the
    Climate Change Bill 2022, which targets a 43% reduction in carbon emissions by
    2030, compared to 2005 levels and net zero by 2050. Achieving the ambitious net-zero
    goals by 2050 will require further incentivisation. Moreover, the federal government
    is now promoting accounting systems and trading infrastructure needed to grow
    Australia’s carbon markets. Some of these environmental markets address the issue
    of improving water quality flowing into the GBR and its lagoons by paying land
    managers for reduced water pollutants resulting from their on-farm actions without
    compromising the productivity of their land. Performing ‘what-if’ scenario analyses
    in i-RAT will allow landholders to better understand the impact of different management
    practices on economic and environmental outcomes and provide guidance on benefits
    that can be generated from such markets. Examples of schemes that i-RAT outputs
    can be linked to include the Federal Government’s Carbon + Biodiversity Pilot
    (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; DAWE 2021) and the Reef Credit
    Scheme, administered by Eco-markets Australia (Eco-Markets Australia 2021). 7.3.
    i-RAT development: reflection on the approach Previous researchers have discussed
    challenges that surround the adoption of DSSs (Carberry et al., 2009, Ascough
    et al., 2010, Thorburn et al., 2011b, Hochman and Carberry, 2011, Cahn et al.,
    2017, Rose et al., 2018, Aversa et al., 2018, Car, 2018, Gallardo et al., 2020,
    Baldin et al., 2021, Ara et al., 2021). These challenges include, but are not
    limited to, (1) the DSS (especially the information and communications technology-based
    DSSs) being too complex and not doing what end-users need or want it to do; (2)
    the DSS being developed in a top-down fashion by researchers rather than being
    demand-driven by end-user needs, (3) end-users not engaging with the DSS as a
    co-learning or educational tool; (4) the lack of effective procedures to train
    and support end-users; (5) a perception that the outputs from the DSS are not
    sufficiently accurate to reflect reality; (6) limited interest to reduce water/energy
    use due to the perceived risk (e.g., reduced yield), physical limits, and the
    effort/investment (e.g., labour) required relative to the perceived benefits;
    and (7) lack of the DSS’s application outside the region(s) where it was originally
    developed. i-RAT was designed and developed with these challenges in mind while
    remaining simple, easy-to-use, and relevant: (1) i-RAT user interface provides
    sufficient information to the user and reduces the complexity of a DSS to simple
    rules, which can improve the chance of its adoption (Thorburn et al. 2011b), (2)
    the participatory approach that underpinned the development of i-RAT involved
    engagement by the Extension and Farming focus groups as part of action- and co-learning
    cycles throughout the project. This process was especially important during the
    early phases of the project, wherein the ‘problem’ and ‘potential solutions’ were
    formulated, (3) i-RAT has been adopted by an industry body who has embedded i-RAT
    into their district management plan as the only available tool that allowed farmers
    to answer the question, “Is it possible to reduce water and energy consumption
    without compromising productivity, profitability, and sustainability?”. Moreover,
    several workshops and one-on-one interviews were held to train and support end-users,
    (4) i-RAT scenarios help advisors confidently guide farmers towards more efficient
    irrigation practices by showing that in most cases, efficient irrigation practices
    do not result in reduced yield and can be implemented with limited investment
    and effort, (5) external drivers and incentives such as the upcoming rises in
    the cost of water and electricity, stricter environmental regulations, and social
    awareness are new forces that can lead to a higher chance of adoption for i-RAT,
    (6) i-RAT does not collect any data and thus eliminates concerns farmers have
    with sharing their data, (7) i-RAT framework is extensible and easily transferable
    to other regions. The positive feedback from the focus groups and the funding
    body (the GBRF) has already led to the funding of the i-RAT extension to the Mackay-Whitsunday
    region. 7.4. Limitations and future works In current version, i-RAT displays other
    irrigation related variables as well, including soil loss, crop transpiration,
    soil evaporation, and N update by the plant. In the future, there is the potential
    for other parameters to be made adjustable and/or other variables be outputted/displayed.
    New features may also be added while some of the available features may be discarded
    from the future versions. These changes will be conditional on the feedback from
    i-RAT users and requests from the industry partners. It is essential to note that
    the outputs of i-RAT strongly depend on (i) the crop model used, (ii) the choice
    of sugarcane cultivar and its parameterisation, and (iii) the choice of management
    practices. Outputs from any crop model are subject to uncertainty, of which the
    user must be aware. APSIM parametrisation was done based on previous peer-reviewed
    research studies. Currently, i-RAT captures a representative range of scenarios,
    but it is possible to increase the range of predefined scenarios. i-RAT currently
    provides simulations utilising historical climate data, but it can potentially
    integrate climate change scenarios in the future, contingent upon funding availability.
    Although i-RAT may accommodate a larger number of management scenarios in its
    future versions, for now, it is critical that the user chooses scenarios that
    best resemble real management practices on the paddock. 8. Conclusion This paper
    demonstrated how fundamental learnings about more (drought) resilient farming
    systems and more sustainable irrigation practices can be extracted from a paddock-scale
    ‘discussion’ support system. We overviewed the industry involvement that guided
    the development of the DSS by taking a participatory approach. Via a “what-if”
    scenario example, it was demonstrated that it is possible to reduce water/energy
    consumption and N pollution without compromising productivity and profitability.
    i-RAT, through an easy-to-use web interface, enables its users to take advantage
    of the power of a crop model and perform many other ‘what-if’ analyses without
    any need to collect or store individual growers’ data. It also provides measures
    of sustainability that can be used to assess the impact of proposed changes in
    irrigation practices not only on the financial status of a paddock/farm, but also
    on the water quality of the GBR and GHG emissions. Such information not only helps
    sugarcane farmers make informed decisions regarding irrigation practices, but
    it also brings about opportunities provided by, for example, carbon markets. Although
    i-RAT, in its current functional form, has been developed for sugarcane grown
    in the Burdekin region, the methodology and framework are readily extendable to
    other crops and/or other regions globally. Declaration of Competing Interest The

  description: Enhancing resource use efficiency in agricultural field management
    and breeding high-performance crop varieties are crucial approaches for securing
    crop yield and mitigating negative environmental impact of crop production. Crop
    stress sensing and plant phenotyping systems are integral to variable-rate (VR)
    field management and high-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP), with both sharing
    similarities in hardware and data processing techniques. Crop stress sensing systems
    for VR field management have been studied for decades, aiming to establish more
    sustainable management practices. Concurrently, significant advancements in HTPP
    system development have provided a technological foundation for reducing conventional
    phenotyping costs. In this paper, we present a systematic review of crop stress
    sensing systems employed in VR field management, followed by an introduction to
    the sensors and data pipelines commonly used in field HTPP systems. State-of-the-art
    sensing and decision-making methodologies for irrigation scheduling, nitrogen
    application, and pesticide spraying are categorized based on the degree of modern
    sensor and model integration. We highlight the data processing pipelines of three
    ground-based field HTPP systems developed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
    Furthermore, we discuss current challenges and propose potential solutions for
    field HTPP research. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, robotic platforms,
    and innovative instruments is expected to significantly enhance system performance,
    encouraging broader adoption by breeders. Direct quantification of major plant
    physiological processes may represent one of next research frontiers in field
    HTPP, offering valuable phenotypic data for crop breeding under increasingly unpredictable
    weather conditions. This review can offer a distinct perspective, benefiting both
    research communities in a novel manner.

    system performance, encouraging broader adoption by breeders. Direct quantification
    of major plant physiological processes may represent one of next research frontiers
    in field HTPP, offering valuable phenotypic data for crop breeding under increasingly

  description: Given the complex interactions between soils, climate, and farm management,
    a tool is needed to guide agricultural land managers about which management practice
    changes are more likely to increase profitability and simultaneously deliver improved
    water quality and climate resilience outcomes. Using concepts drawn from social
    studies of science and technology, a ‘discussion’ support system (DSS) named Irrigation
    Rapid Assessment Tool (i-RAT) was developed through participatory processes designed
    to enhance co-learning from the development of this DSS. i-RAT is a rapid assessment-visualisation
    tool in the form of an interactive web application (https://i-rat.net) to visualise
    the impacts of changed irrigation practices for sugarcane farmers and extension
    staff. Specifically, i-RAT compares these impacts regarding farm economics, water
    quality, productivity, carbon and nitrogen cycles, and greenhouse gas emission.
    The core of i-RAT is the sugarcane module from the Agricultural Production Systems
    sIMulator (APSIM) modelling platform. i-RAT was first developed for the Burdekin
    sugarcane-growing region in Queensland (Australia’s largest sugarcane-producing
    region). A datacube from thousands of simulated scenarios was generated. Various
    soil types and management scenarios representing farming practices in the Burdekin
    region were used for simulations (1971-2021). The i-RAT’s objectives, modelling
    framework, and graphical user interface are described. An example ‘what-if’ analysis
    is presented to demonstrate the features of i-RAT and its potential to build an
    understanding of its ability to quantify economic and environmental outcomes associated
    with changed management practices.

    agricultureTomato 1. Introduction 1.1. The need for better and sustainable practices
    in agriculture Agriculture is the world’s largest industry as it employs more
    than one billion people worldwide and generates over 1.3 trillion dollars’ worth
    of food annually [1]. The so-called “green revolution” was characterized by intensive
    agriculture practices in developed countries where the abuse of the use of chemical
    fertilizers and pesticides, monoculture production, intensive irrigation, and
    deforestation were regular practices [2]. This approach led to water and soil
    pollution, pollinators’ distress, pest resistance, and human health problems.
    Irrigation now claims close to 70% of all freshwater appropriated for human use,
    and a 19% increase in agricultural water consumption is forecasted by 2050. Moreover,
    to meet food demand by 2050, worldwide production needs to increase by 70% [3].
    Monoculture production can cause the accumulation of weeds and promote plant diseases
    and soil infertility due to a lack of crop rotation practices resulting in loss
    of soil nutrients and even deforestation [4]. Approximately 30–80% of the nitrogen
    applied to farmland lixiviate and contaminate water systems which, once into the
    oceans, cause, among other effects, the seaweed deluge hitting Caribbean shores
    [2]. Facing an increasing population expected to reach 9.6 billion people by 2050,
    industrial agriculture systems cannot ensure the availability of healthy and innocuous
    products to minimize the environmental, health, and social impacts. Therefore,
    the development of knowledge and techniques to attain sustainable agriculture
    practices is, in consequence, one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century
    [5]. One out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for
    Sustainable Development is: “By 2030, to ensure sustainable food production systems
    and to implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and
    production. It is also expected that sustainable agriculture practices may help
    reduce the damage in ecosystems and help maintain food production despite climate
    change, extreme weather, drought, flooding, and other disasters and that progressively
    it will improve land and soil quality” [6]. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística
    y Geografía (INEGI) of México reported in the National Agricultural Survey (Encuesta
    Nacional Agropecuaria, ENA) of 2017 that 110 millions of hectares (ha) were dedicated
    to agriculture in México in 2017, 79% of which correspond to irrigated land [7].
    Farming land was distributed in 101,828 production units, from which 83% were
    productive open-air systems. Most of the productive units employed irrigation
    by gravity (70.8%), chemical fertilization (68.2%), chemical herbicides (66.9%),
    and pesticides (54.8%). In contrast, only 17,338 production units (17% of the
    total) corresponded to protected agriculture (PA) systems, most of them greenhouses
    (54%). Only 30.8% of the PA productive units used fertigation [7]. There is substantial
    room for improvement of Mexican farm productivity and the introduction of sustainable
    production systems. 1.2. The key aspects for achieving high quality, innocuous
    and sustainable production while maximizing the return on investment (the case
    of tomato) Tomato is currently the most profitable agricultural product that México
    exports to the USA, accounting for almost 30% of its national production. According
    to the “Servicio de Información Agroalimentaria y Pesquera“ (SIAP) of México the
    area planted with tomato in México for the agricultural year (AY) 2020 (October
    2019-March 2021) was estimated at 45,284 ha, slightly lower compared to AY 2019
    (47,372 ha) [8]. To produce this vegetable, different resources are required:
    water, fertilizers, and pesticides, both of synthetic and organic (or biological)
    origin; seeds, substrates, energy, plastics, and in the high-end producers, automated
    sensors and controls that help to achieve an efficient production [9]. The use
    of each of these resources must be analyzed in relation to its social, economic,
    and environmental impacts [9], [10]. The assessment of these impacts is necessary
    to promote the adoption of good practices by the producer in PA and agribusiness
    and minimize the impact on the environment. Moreover, the final product must comply
    with the quality and innocuity requirements of the final consumer [10]. The current
    importing policies by regulatory agencies established for food in countries such
    as México impose reliable evidence that improvements have been achieved in the
    following aspects [11]: • Water productivity (more kilograms of tomatoes per cubic
    meter of water) • Reduction in the use of synthetic fertilizers and reduction
    in the chemical load of agro-toxic inputs • Energy efficiency (more Kg of product
    per KWh) • Reduction in carbon footprint • Use of biodegradable and efficient
    plastics • Waste reduction in irrigation supplements, ferrous waste, bags, substrates,
    disinfectants, packing boxes, among others 1.3. Protected agriculture: state of
    the art and Mexican situation PA refers to buildings, sensors, actuators, and
    software that allow controlling the environmental variables and watering of crops
    to increase their yields, reduce water consumption, and increase profits [12].
    Traditionally, this control and monitoring have been achieved using robust and
    well standardized Programmable Logic Circuits (PLC), local control software, and
    a limited number of sensors. However, due to its high installation and maintenance
    costs, its use by farms is limited [13]. The technification of tomato crops in
    emerging economies, such as México, is diverse. According to the United States
    Department of Agriculture (USDA), 44,814 planted ha of tomato were reported for
    AY 2020 [14]; the planted area for tomato production was distributed in open-field
    (66.19%), greenhouse (16.12%), shade mesh (16.97%) and tunnel (0.72%) technologies.
    SIAP reported the yields for tomato production for AY 2020 in open-field was 37
    tons/ha·year, greenhouse 185 ton/ha·year, shade mesh 113 ton/ha·year, and tunnel
    73 ton/ha·year [8]. These data reflect the impact of tomato production under PA
    techniques. Nevertheless, the implementation of technology in greenhouses in México
    as in Latin America is scarce [15], [16], [17]. This is because the technological
    transfer between universities and companies is limited, coupled with a poor entrepreneurship
    culture and the high costs of technification. In this context, a project of medium-tech
    development such as the one we are presenting here aims to contribute with a system
    that is both technologically affordable and, at the same time, economically viable
    for the specific context and needs of producers located in emerging economies
    such as that of México or Latin America. 1.4. The need of a multidisciplinary
    approach with cost/benefits considerations When the multidisciplinary team that
    carried out the present work was formed, the need for proprietary and original
    developments was discussed, around the needs of the medium-technical Mexican producers.
    This was possible due to the plurality of capabilities that this multidisciplinary
    team possesses in which experts in the areas of agronomy, biotechnology, phytopathology,
    and process automation were involved (Fig. 1). The participation of FIRA, a financial
    institution from the Bank of México responsible for technological training and
    financial services to support Mexican agriculture development, was a critical
    factor to define technological objectives, economic assessment of the developed
    technologies, and the possibility of an effective technological transfer. Although
    there are works dedicated to instrumentation [13], [18], [19], phytopathological
    aspects [20], [21], [22], or biotechnology [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], as far
    as we know there are no documented experiences of multidisciplinary teams that
    cover physical, biological, and economic considerations altogether. Furthermore,
    the evaluation of production costs is rarely considered for projects that involve
    multiple aspects of crop production and commercialization. We believe that this
    is a crucial reason which explains why many developments, although technically
    robust, do not get to the market for solving concrete problems for the producer.
    The hypothesis of this work was: “Mid-tech greenhouse incorporating biocontrol
    and biofertilization increase growers’ profits in middle-income countries as México.”.

    of intermediate level in tomato crops. 1) The multidisciplinary background; 2)
    Technical developments and implementations; 3) Achievements obtained with the
    interaction of the group instrumentation. 2. The model of study and main objectives
    2.1. Tomato as an experimental model Tomato production area under PA has grown
    from 1,078 hectares in 2006 to 15,006 hectares in 2016, which means an average
    annual increase of 30%; while tomato production under PA increased from 6.5% to
    60.7% of the total [28]. In 2020 México produced 3.3 million metric tons and almost
    99.7% of the Mexican exports went to the United States. Of these, 40% of tomato
    produced was grown in greenhouses with only 16% of the total cultivated area (44,814
    ha) and an annual average yield of 180 mt/ha vs 36.8 mt/ha obtained in open-field
    [14]. Tomato occupies a third of the entire national infrastructure under PA and
    constitutes a business where small-scale producers participate from less than
    one to more than 1,000 ha. The profitability of this crop can be measured by some
    variables that can determine the stagnation, stability, or business success of
    the participants. These are, among others: a) the size of the production unit,
    b) the infrastructure and technology used, c) the technological production plans,
    and d) the market environment. These factors are of particular importance if the
    producer has a commercial relationship with a market with stringent quality and
    quantity demands. To meet this demand with competitive production costs, it is
    necessary to enhance the production yield making use of mid-tech greenhouse infrastructure
    and environmental and biocontrol techniques. In the present project, we used a
    tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) variety Frodo 1. We used coconut fiber (30% mixed
    with 70% of porous red volcanic rock) for the watering system to decrease water
    and fertilizer consumption. Also, to diminish the inorganic nitrogen consumption,
    we used Azospirillum brasilense as nitrogen-fixing bacteria and Bacillus velezensis
    83 as the biological control agent (BCA) of Leveillula taurica (foliar and substrate
    applications). The crop was housed in an automated greenhouse with an automatic
    watering system, shading, and relative humidity monitoring and control. The Frodo
    variety is recommended for growing tomatoes for commercial use. It produces medium
    cylindrical fruit with an intense red color that does not tend to break and, therefore,
    can be easily transported. Its productive cultivation can be extended for more
    than six months. This variety is also considered one of the earlier industrial
    varieties, as it can be harvested as soon as 66–75 d after transplanting the seedlings.
    2.2. The pathosystem tomato-powdery mildew, biofertilizers and biofungicides This
    project aimed to evaluate the yield, quality, and profitability of tomato crops
    housed in a mid-tech greenhouse production system using reduced amounts of agrochemicals
    to control fungal diseases. The results were compared to conventional greenhouse
    technological production management systems, which are highly dependent on agrochemicals.
    The pathosystem tomato-powdery mildew was selected as a model to evaluate a biofertilizer
    (A. brasilense) and a biofungicide (B. velezensis 83) to control this fungal disease.
    Powdery mildew is caused by various fungal species which affect leaves, stems,
    flowers, and fruits of Angiosperms; in the world, about 16 genera (900 species)
    are known [29], [30]. L. taurica (Lév.) G. Arnaud is a strict parasite endophytic
    fungus not cultivable on artificial culture medium, the major pathogen of tomato
    and other Solanaceae, Alliaceae, and Cucurbitaceae plant families [31], [32].
    L. taurica infections in tomato field crops have been reported to cause yield
    losses of 52% as well as adverse effects on quality fruit [33]. There are no L.
    taurica resistant cultivars available in the market. The control of this pathogen
    in tomato crops is conventionally carried out by spraying fungicides such as wettable
    sulfur, myclobutanil, and azoxystrobin [33], [34]. Bacillus spp. has been applied
    to tomato plants to stimulate plant growth and control different phytopathogens.
    As BCA, strains of B. subtilis MBI600 and B. amyloliquefaciens SQRT3 cause Induced
    Systemic Resistance (ISR) in tomato plants grown in greenhouse against soil-borne
    tomato pathogens (as Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium ultimum, and Fusarium oxysporum
    f. sp. radicis-lycopersici-Forl) and Ralstonia solanacearum (tomato bacterial
    wilt), respectively [35], [36]. As for PGPB, the inoculation of Bacillus fortis
    and Bacillus subtilis on tomato plants increased the plant''s root and shoot biomass
    and crop productivity [37]. The inoculation of B. subtilis in tomato variety Licurich
    and Moldova also increased tomato productivity [38]. Powdery mildew disease is
    recurrent in the experimental zone; because of this, B. velezensis 83 was applied
    on the growth substrate and foliar spray. Moreover, to increase productivity in
    tomato crops and reduce the amount of inorganic nitrogen administered, inoculants
    of Azospirillum brasilense have been used. In fact, inoculation of Azospirillum
    sp. as Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria (PGPB) on tomato varieties reduced transplant
    stress, increased yields, and diminished chemical fertilizers [39]. The overall
    aim of this work was to test if a mid-tech greenhouse incorporating biocontrol
    and biofertilization can increase growers’ profits in middle-income countries
    as México. 3. Methodology The materials and methods of the project were as described
    with more detail in a previous work [40]. These involved greenhouse technification,
    environment control, biofertilization, biological control, production, and considering
    the substrate that improves the decrease in water use. A summary is included in
    what follows. 3.1. Materials The support germination growing media was a commercial
    Peat Moss-based medium (Sunshine Mix 3, Sun Gro Horticulture, Agawam, MA). The
    tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) seeds var. Frodo (Hybrid Tomato, ITSCO, CdMx,
    México) were sown in pots. Tomato seeds were germinated in the presence of A.
    brasilense at 18–28°C. For biological control B. velezensis 83 (accession number
    LMG S-30921; Fungifree AB™ obtained from Agro&Biotecnia S. de R.L. de C.V.) was
    used. 3.2. Tomato seed management and treatments with biofertilizer and biological
    control Formulations of B. velezensis 83 and A. brasilense are already available
    in the Mexican market. Therefore, the A. brasilense liquid inoculant was used
    as a biofertilizer to diminish the nitrogen load and designed to evaluate the
    effect of nitrogen fixation associated with this product [23]. A. brasilense was
    used during the germination and at the transplantation phases, under a complete
    nutrition scheme, in which inorganic nitrogen was reduced by 25%. The germination
    of tomato (Frodo variety) took 21 d when was pre-inoculated with A. brasilense
    (without A. brasilense germination took 28 d). The set of experiments consisted
    of three production cycles. In each cycle, 14 treatments were evaluated using
    34 pots each. The cultivation cycles included between 150 and 160 days, with three
    harvest months. We used mixed coconut (30%) and porous red volcanic rock (70%)
    as a highly water-retention substrate. The seedlings were transplanted to 15-liter
    plastic pots containing the substrate described. Two seedlings were placed per
    pot, each pot was considered as an experimental unit. Statistical analysis was
    performed with the average value of production in terms of Kg/pot. The Kg/plant
    was calculated by dividing the registered value (Kg/pot) by 2. The density of
    the crop was 2.8 plants/m2. Two cycles were supposed to calculate the tons/ha
    year tomato production. For the statistical analysis of the data, Minitab™ 17
    Statistical Software (Minitab, LLC, Pennsylvania, USA) was used. The normality
    test of the data distribution was performed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method
    (α = 0.05) and the test of equality of variances with the Bartlett method (α =
    0.05). Since the data showed a normal distribution but there was not equality
    of variances a Welch''s test (α = 0.05) was performed assuming samples without
    equal variances, followed by the Games-Howell (α = 0.05) as the Post Hoc test.
    3.3. Mid-Tech systematization and greenhouse startup Two fully automated greenhouses
    of 360 m2 were built at FIRA (Tezoyuca, México). The greenhouses were equipped
    with a wet wall on the northern side, three exhaust fans on the southern side,
    active ventilation walls (eastern and western sides), and twelve in-house monitoring
    points, each equipped with sensors of temperature, relative humidity (RH), solar
    radiation (environmental parameters) as well as pH, electric conductivity, and
    moisture of the substrate (fertigation). Since the technological level of the
    greenhouse development intended for this project corresponded to middle technology,
    no attempt was made to create a micro-climate. These would have taken the project
    out of the economic constraints that the experts in costs indicated would correspond
    to the level of technology and resources that were characteristic of the local
    producers. As such, the controllers installed for shading, wet walls, and extraction
    fans had the purpose of limiting the temperature changes that are experienced
    from day to night cycles in the geographic region where the project was implemented.
    To make a quantitative assessment of this control, it is worth comparing data
    in the greenhouse, as measured in the range from 2016 to 2017 with averages provided
    by a Weather station of the Mexican Comisión Nacional del Agua (CONAGUA) [41].
    We registered a range of temperatures from 18.8 to 36°C in August of 2016 and
    between 14 and 34°C in August 2017. The closest weather station (Alpuyeca, México)
    reports an average in that region ranging from a minimum of 9°C to a maximum of
    40°C in the same month. Although the control was moderate, it was enough to keep
    the growing of tomatoes within a climate envelope that reduced temperature and
    humidity stress that leads to disease when extremes are reached. An independent
    automated irrigation system per line of pots was designed. The irrigation system
    acted depending on the soil variables to be controlled (pH, osmolarity, and programmed
    nutrition). The environmental variable monitoring system consisted of twelve monitoring
    points to measure the temperature, irradiation, and RH. Each monitoring box transmitted
    the readings to a central panel to calculate the readings’ averages and take the
    required control action. 3.4. Fertigation system The fertigation inputs were decided
    to be pH 6.3–6.4 and output pH 7.5–8.1, and the electrical conductivity between
    0.5 and 2.0 dS/m according to the plants’ phenological stage and the recommendation
    of FIRA staff. In some lines, the fertigation system was designed to supply 50%
    of the nitrogen load to a set of pots, another set with 75% nitrogen, and the
    rest with the conventional nutritional load. In Table 1 (reproduced from reference
    [40]) are shown the nutritional requirements of the tomato crop (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) in parts per million (ppm) by phenological stage proposed by FIRA staff. Table

    plants by L. taurica We promoted the infection of tomato plants in the greenhouse.
    Tomato plants infected with L. taurica were placed as inoculum sources inside
    the greenhouse. 4. The development of the project 4.1. Design, construction, implementation,
    and improvement of the greenhouse instrumentation During the project’s first year,
    the first main objective was to construct and automate a 360 m2 arched greenhouse
    at FIRA (Tezoyuca, México). In 2017, a second 360 m2 fully automatized greenhouse
    was built, with the exact technical specifications of the first greenhouse. The
    greenhouses were equipped with a wet wall on the northern side, three exhaust
    fans on the southern side, active ventilation walls (eastern and western sides),
    and twelve in-house monitoring points, each equipped with sensors of temperature,
    relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (environmental parameters) as well as
    pH, electric conductivity, and moisture of the substrate (fertigation) (Fig. 2).
    Variables’ acquisition was programmed at 15 min intervals, and control of the
    variables was performed through Proportional-integral-derivative retrofitting
    algorithms. The validation of the system was carried out in parallel with the
    experimentation. Some operational and technical problems were raised, and they
    had to be solved during experimentation. It is important to point out that the
    time required to validate the instrumentation and the control of the greenhouse
    must be planned before the operation. Download : Download high-res image (259KB)

    a 360 m2 arched PVC greenhouse at FIRA (Tezoyuca, México). The greenhouse was
    equipped with a wet wall on the northern side (A), three exhaust fans on the southern
    side (B), and active exterior roll walls (over the mesh walls) on the eastern
    and western sides (C). Twelve environmental monitoring points (temperature, relative
    humidity, and solar radiation, shown by arrows) were used (D). An automated pull
    wire mechanism of a horizontal screen was placed to decrease the luminosity and
    spray humidifiers were installed, both on the inside top of the greenhouses. Also,
    a particular fertigation system was designed to supply 50% of the nitrogen load
    to a set of pots, another set with 75% nitrogen, and the rest with the conventional
    nutritional load recommended by the FIRA experts (Table 1). The instrumentation
    was divided into a subsystem on environmental monitoring (RH, temperature, and
    solar irradiation), a webserver subsystem (capable of monitoring and sending information
    remotely, developed in Java), and a subsystem of control that action the wet wall
    in the northern side, spray humidifiers on the roof, up to three exhaust fans
    at the southern side, active ventilation walls on eastern and western sides and
    open/close the automated shading (to control the environmental parameters). We
    also designed an independent subsystem for automatic irrigation, which acted depending
    on the soil variables to be controlled (pH, osmolarity, and programmed nutrition).
    The environmental variable monitoring system was designed and built consisting
    of twelve monitoring points with four sensors each, which measured temperature,
    irradiation, and air RH. Each monitoring box transmitted the readings to a central
    panel to calculate the readings’ averages and take the required control action.
    A day/night cyclical tendency of the temperature, RH and luminosity data was expected,
    and the control was programmed to avoid abrupt departures on extremely hot or
    cold days. Thus, it was possible to maintain statistically similar intervals during
    seasonal changes. The environmental conditions to produce tomatoes were between
    14 and 34°C, RH in the range of 28–85%, and maximum light near 3,300 footcandles
    (∼35,000 lux) (Fig. 3), following also the FIRA staff recommendations. Overall,
    the control systems allowed for maintaining the greenhouse within the above-mentioned
    recommended intervals. Download : Download high-res image (148KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. As expected, a day/night cyclical tendency of the temperature,
    humidity, and luminosity data was obtained. The controllability was programmed
    to avoid abrupt departures on extremely hot or cold days. The controlled greenhouse
    was between 14 and 34°C (five sensors widely distributed), relative humidity between
    25% and 85% (five sensors widely distributed), and a maximum light of 3,300 footcandles
    (the sensors were located inside the greenhouse, below the automated pull wire
    mechanism of the horizontal screen). The temperature and humidity sensor that
    deviates from the other four is the one that is close to the exhaust fans. 4.2.
    Design and evaluation of the fertigation system A particular fertigation system
    was designed to supply 50% of the nitrogen load to a set of pots, another set
    with 75% nitrogen, and the rest with the conventional nutritional load recommended
    by the FIRA experts (Table 1). The nitrogen load reduction was designed to evaluate
    the effect of nitrogen fixation associated with the liquid inoculant formulation
    of the A. brasilense [23]. It has been reported that the reduction in inorganic
    nitrogen in the formulation of fertigation improves the fixation capacity of Azospirillum
    in crops [25], [42]. The fertigation inputs were decided to be pH 6.3–6.4 and
    output pH 7.5–8.1, and the electrical conductivity between 0.5 and 2.0 dS/m according
    to the plants’ phenological stage and the recommendation FIRA staff. The cultivation
    cycles were between 150 and 160 days in this production system, with three harvest
    months. The use of coconut fiber, in combination with the monitoring of the conductivity
    in the substrate, allowed to reduce water consumption (among 44–60%) from 60 L
    of water per plant using 100% porous red volcanic rock to 34 L of water per plant
    using the mixed coconut (30%) and porous red volcanic rock (70%) as substrate
    in 15 L plastic pots. A reduction of ∼28% in the tomato cost unit of production
    was achieved. 4.3. Design, implementation, and results of the experimental system
    The experiments were designed to integrate and economically evaluate existing
    technologies to produce tomato variety (Frodo 1, Maviri). It is important to point
    out that formulations of B. velezensis 83 and A. brasilense are already available
    in the Mexican market. B. velezensis 83 is commercialized under the label of Fungifree
    AB™, a biofungicide effective against several fungal plant pathogens (L. taurica,
    among others) attacking more than 20 different crops [40], [43]. A liquid formulation
    containing two combined A. brasilense strains (Maxifer™) was used as a nitrogen
    fixation inoculant, successfully used for biofertilization of several crops in
    México [23]. We initially carried out two production cycles, and twenty-two treatments
    were evaluated (480 pots), where production from eight to twelve tomato harvests
    in each cycle was evaluated. Unfortunately, high variability within treatments
    avoided obtaining conclusive results. Indeed, 20 pots per treatment were not enough
    to get significant differences between treatments which were one of the main lessons
    obtained from this first set of experiments. Farmers frequently rely on total
    productivity to evaluate new products or technologies as the leading indicator.
    This is probably an adequate parameter when large experimental set-ups are available,
    but not in the case where only a few experimental units are available. Considering
    this first set of experiments, two additional production cycles were done, and
    reliable results were obtained. In each cycle, 14 treatments (34 pots each) were
    evaluated. A. brasilense was used at the germination and at the transplantation
    phases under a complete nutrition scheme, in which inorganic nitrogen was reduced
    by 25%. 4.4. Biological control of L. taurica In the project, we promoted the
    infection of tomato plants in the greenhouse. Tomato plants infected with L. taurica
    were placed as inoculum sources inside the greenhouse, achieving infection two
    days after their introduction. Nevertheless, the incidence of powdery mildew was
    highly variable, and the experiment was not reproducible. No powdery mildew was
    detected in our conditions in any treatment (chemical or biological). So, it was
    not possible to evaluate the biological control of L. taurica by B. velezensis
    83. However, the results showed that the use A. brasilense and B. velezensis 83
    had a positive effect on total yield (∼39% higher) and fruit quality (∼55% more
    production of first quality) of tomato. In our experience, using this biofertilizer
    and biofungicide on tomato greenhouse production systems may be a viable alternative
    to obtain a higher yield and quality of tomato fruit without spraying synthetic
    fungicides to control powdery mildew. Our findings may be significant for some
    regions of México, where traditionally 13–18 applications of fungicides are made
    to prevent or control powdery mildew in intensive production systems in undetermined
    growth tomato varieties [34]. 4.5. Tomato growth evaluations using biological
    treatments The most relevant results of the last two consecutive tomato production
    cycles are reported here since the treatments included in the experimental design
    were refined according to each cycle experimented. The germination of tomato (Frodo
    variety) took 21 days and was pre-inoculated with A. brasilense (without A. brasilense,
    germination took 28 d). The seedlings were transplanted into 15 L plastic pots.
    Two seedlings were placed per pot, and the density of the crop was 2.8 plants/m2.
    For biological treatments, the commercial product Fungifree AB™ was used to evaluate
    the effect on the growth and yield of the tomato plants when applying B. velezensis
    83 on the foliage as biofungicide and to the substrate as plant growth-promoting
    bacteria. Three biological treatments and non-inoculated plants control were evaluated.
    For each treatment with Fungifree AB™, ten applications were done to the foliage
    and six to the substrate. To evaluate the effect of the treatments on the quality,
    the harvested fruits were classified according to their weight in first (≥100
    g/fruit), second (≤99-60 g/fruit), and third (≤59 g/fruit) quality. In terms of
    plant growth, there were no significant differences between the treatments evaluated
    and the control. It was also found that there were no significant differences
    in tomato production when the plants received Bv 83 foliar or Bv 83 foliar + substrate
    low treatment with respect to control plants (3.3 Kg/plant), since these plants
    produced 3.5 and 3.8 Kg/plant, respectively. In contrast, in the Bv 83 foliar
    + substrate high treatment the plants produced 4.5 Kg/plant (Table 2). The estimated
    tomato yield with the Bv 83 foliar + substrate high treatment was 254 ton/ha·year,
    which represented almost 43% more than the average yield of a crop in greenhouse
    agriculture technology in México, which between 2007 and 2017 was of ∼177 ton/ha·year
    [28]. Under the conditions in which tomato cultivation was developed in the greenhouse,
    this treatment increased the total tomato yield by 19% of first quality tomato,
    in contrast, to control plants (184 ton/ha·year). It is known that production
    yield always varies depending on the technologies used, from open-field cultivation
    to production in highly instrumented greenhouses with automated irrigation, nutrition,
    and phytosanitary control systems. As a referent, in México it is considered that
    the tomato yield production in low-tech greenhouses has yields of 120 ton/ha·year,
    in medium technology from 200 to 250 ton/ha, and in the high technology up to
    600 ton/ha [28]. Table 2. Greenhouse tomato production with different B. velezensis
    83 biological treatment. Treatment Tomato Kg/plant (±SD) Kg/m2/cycle Ton/ha·year

    letters mean significant differences according to Welch''s (α = 0.05) and Games-Howell
    (α = 0.05) test. 4.6. Economic analysis For profitability estimation, the unit
    cost of production (UCP) of the greenhouse-grown tomato was calculated considering
    the average tomato yield (ton/ha·year) estimated in each case (Table 2 and Table
    3). The cost of production involves the variable and the fixed costs. The variable
    costs were constituted by the cost of inputs (seed, agrochemicals, fertilization)
    and the direct labor cost. The fixed expenses were included by the price of accessories
    and tools for cultural activities, services (greenhouse rent, amortization of
    fixed initial investment), and technical assistance for tomato crop management.
    The cost of the fixed initial investment included the price of a plastic wall,
    irrigation equipment, and the structure of the greenhouse, the total capital needed
    was estimated at USD 125,000.00. The amortization was calculated considering a
    financing interest of 12%, paid for ten years. A sale price of 0.5 USD/Kg was
    considered [44]. The treatment with the highest profitability was the Bv 83 foliar
    + substrate high, while the one with the lowest profitability was the control
    (Table 3). The technical–economic study of the treatments showed that the UCP
    was 38% higher in control plants compared to the best biological treatment applied.
    Due to the higher yields obtained with the Bv 83 foliar + substrate high treatment,
    the profitability was 2 times higher than that of the control. Table 3. Profitability

    integrating a multidisciplinary team to tackle, in an integral way, an important
    problem in México: food supply security. One of the main problems we faced was
    the high biological variability of tomato production, an issue that has been reported
    previously [45], [46]. That forced us to increase the number of replicas in the
    experiments and thus limiting the number of experiments. Notably, the use of commercial
    seeds, currently used by producers, allowed us to confront the technology in an
    actual situation and obtain realistic results. Although to increase the reproducibility,
    the use of high-quality seeds (phenotypically) can be considered for future works.
    The project involved testing two commercial biological products developed by Mexican
    companies, which have worked closely with research institutions in México. This
    was a significant contribution because the producers can use products already
    available in the market, tested, and registered by the Mexican agencies [23],
    [43]. One critical aspect was the initial homemade instruments used to control
    temperature and moisture since they were not robust enough to resist environmental
    conditions inside the greenhouse. We had to use commercial instruments to fix
    this, allowing us to control the main environmental variables properly. As a result,
    we received several producers’ requests interested in the technologies. We also
    performed demonstrations to producers, which concluded that the technology developed
    can be implemented in modules, depending on their needs and financial/technological
    capabilities. Even though the greenhouse could be partially instrumented, the
    automatic irrigation is necessary. Despite the aspects commented (biological variability,
    reliable instrumentation, large number of tests), we were able to develop a set
    of technologies that could be named “intermediate technology” that producers can
    implement and that can represent an increase in profits of 45%, as compared to
    the conventional greenhouse technology (Fig. 4) [Supplementary video]. In the
    present work, we reduced the use of agrochemicals (pesticides) and almost 25%
    of chemical nitrogen-fertilization. Download : Download high-res image (559KB)

    project The multidisciplinary challenge, time, and cost constraints had secondary
    effects from which lessons learned and experienced, mistakes and goals achieved
    can be deduced. Here are some of these lessons and potential difficulties for
    multidisciplinary teams in developing innovative systems for agriculture. Positive
    experiences: - A multidisciplinary group allows to define more comprehensive and
    challenging aims and scopes on a development project as compared to those produced
    by a single group. In this project, the design criteria of the sensors and control
    had to meet both the technical requirements and the upper limits in cost, as the
    project is meant to be economically viable for Mexican producers. - Training producers
    and forming specialized human resources with a wider view of the problem-solving
    strategies is one of the significant outputs of a research project when a multidisciplinary
    team is available. - On the technical side, the comprehensive data collection,
    as obtained from the continuous monitoring of the greenhouse, provides data for
    future evaluation of artificial intelligence models and neural networks since
    it provides accurate environmental and physiological plant responses to real environmental
    inputs. - Due to the presence of Bank of México Staff (FIRA), with expertise in
    economics and experience with technical transference to farmers, the project was
    carried out with a philosophy of lean development, low costs, and transfer viability
    from the beginning, unlike academic projects, which are developed with fewer constraints,
    making them less practical at the technology transfer stage. Negative experiences:
    - The biological variability of the plants was not considered at the beginning,
    this lead to difficulties in relating the cause-effect of environmental control
    and crop production. Hence, choosing seeds with low genetic variability is essential
    to monitor the effects closely. However, this study exemplifies the reality a
    producer faces with access to seeds of different qualities. - The initial implementation
    of the instrumentation and control software in conjunction with the current biological
    control and water-saving experiments required time and training. This was also
    corrected in later stages and included commercial controllers and sensors as a
    parallel backup that assisted the systems developed by the group. 5. Conclusions
    The developed technology (including the integral use of environmental control
    of the greenhouse, fertigation, the use of a highly water-retention substrate,
    a biofertilizer, and a biofungicide) yielded up to 254 ton/ha·year of tomato (Frodo
    variety), achieving reductions of 44–60% in water consumption and 28% in the cost
    unit of production increasing the profits for the producer in about 45% about
    Mexican conventional greenhouses management. In addition, it was possible to reduce
    the use of agrochemicals (pesticides) and almost 25% of chemical nitrogen-fertilization.
    This case study has shown that it is possible to significantly increase profits
    in mid-tech greenhouse tomato production in middle-income countries like México
    by increasing productivity and crop quality and decreasing the use of water and
    agrochemicals using greenhouse automatization, crop management, and beneficial
    bacteria applied to the crop. Financial support This work was financed by the

  description: Most people in India depend on agriculture as their main source of
    income. Using the latest technology is a must to protect valuable water resources.
    Besides being the cornerstone of Industry 4.0, IoT also enhances its capabilities
    in smart agriculture. The research aims to create a low-cost cutting-edge technology
    for smart irrigation. IoT can be used to enable self-talk and connectivity between

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Pudukkottai, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture has been a significant occupation from the dawn of human civilization,
    and technology has advanced over time. Good farming practices are still an art
    [1]. These environmental changes are too great for traditional farming practices
    to handle. Controlling environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and
    moisture is essential for plant growth. Many plant processes, including pollination,
    germination and others, are affected by temperature. Higher temperatures have
    been shown to speed up respiration and reduce the sugar content of fruits and
    vegetables [2] -[4]. Low temperatures slow down photosynthesis. Many strategies
    have so far been developed to reduce water usage. A state-based approach to monitoring
    water status, based on plant canopy temperature, captures high or low irrigation
    water volume through thermal imaging. Another approach is to use dielectric moisture
    sensors to regulate actuators and conserve water by using information about soil
    volumetric water content rather than scheduling irrigation to run at specific
    times of the day [5]. The above mechanism only opens the valve and supplies water
    to the plants when the soil volume reaches a certain level. The study uses a second
    technique, where sensors are placed based on the water supply in fields and instructions
    are given to farmers via software. W ireless sensor networks, also known as wireless
    sensor and participant networks, are distributed spatially autonomous sensors
    that monitor and report environmental or physical conditions, such as temperature,
    pressure, noise, humidity and share this information to key location networks
    [6] -[8]. Each node in a WSN is connected to a sensor, and each sensor network
    node typically includes several components, including a radio transceiver with
    internal and external antennas, a microcontroller, a power source (e.g., circuits),
    and a battery. Humidity is responsible for plant water loss and temperature management.
    For high-humidity environment, the spread will be less and less, while the water
    in the leaf area will be saturated. As a result, the leaf''s porous area will
    undergo a growth and formation of only bacteria [9] -[11]. Advances in technology
    have made it possible to implement the latest technology at significantly lower
    costs. Wireless sensor networks (IOT) can be used for such systems to enhance
    their monitoring capabilities by deploying sensors throughout the site and monitoring
    environmental parameters remotely [12]. The Internet of Things consists of small
    nodes that operate independently and are embedded with sensors. They gather data
    and send it wirelessly to a centralized system that gathers and processes information
    from all nodes. In this project, an IoT -based agricultural monitoring system
    is developed for automation. Temperature, humidity and moisture measurements were
    considered for the study. Temperature and humidity are measured by integrated
    sensors, while humidity is measured and calibrated by a conductivity-based sensor.
    The Zigbee protocol is used for field data collection at the central node, while
    the user interface uses the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) service
    as it is reliable and easily accessible to most people [13]. The collected data
    is stored in local memory for future analysis. Consumer electronics, computer
    accessories, smart agriculture, building automation, security systems, personal
    care, and industrial monitoring and control are just a few examples [14]. Much
    of the development and experimental implementation of IoT tends to be implemented
    in cities. However, there are some studies reporting results deployed in vineyards,
    sharing the technology with people in rural areas. Below is a list of various
    contributions to our article. The system is demonstrated and evaluated in a real
    environment, starting with the hardware at the sensor/actuator nodes at the bottom
    and going up to the management subsystem at the top. The goal of the research
    work is to improve the design so that all nodes can interact with each other,
    while improving the communication stability of wireless sensors through better
    hardware and software design. In particular, an intelligent irrigation control
    system based on wireless sensor network is constructed, which uses real-time humidity
    data and expert data to make irrigation decisions. Different alternatives have
    varying levels of efficiency. In certain circumstances, specialized forms must
    be utilized for specific crops. The specific watering method there are many different
    sorts of them, but we may categorize them as follows: Water distribution options
    include: (i)flood irrigation, (ii) sprinkler irrigation, and (iii) drip irrigation,(iv)
    Irrigation with a sprayer. We can have the following in the presence of a sensor
    system: (i)Irrigation When the amount of water is not determined or predicted,
    (ii) plan without concern. Irrigation, in which water is delivered based on predicted
    demand over a given time, (iii) Ad the amount of water is computed based on sensor
    measurements for temporary irrigation. Target The project provides a crop monitoring
    and automatic irrigation system that: Interact with users and collect comprehensive
    information on crop cultivation. Estimate irrigation schedules throughout the
    season in advance. Obtain environmental and ground statistics. Evapotranspiration
    and irrigation decision-making based on neural networks. Inform irrigation equipment
    to activate zonal irrigation. Transfer sensor data to a MQTT broker to enable
    remote data monitoring. It can correctly detect and display the temperature and
    humidity of the greenhouse and accurately reflect the temperature and humidity
    values in real-time, according to the temperature and humidity management and
    water-saving watering system. Temperature and moisture time data may be presented
    on the system display screen; for water saving, the system can automatically decide
    whether to irrigate or spray water based on the temperature and humidity value
    and stop when the target value is reached. As a result, temperature and humidity
    control and water-saving irrigation systems, water, or spray plants stimulate
    growth while conserving water. SECTION II. Related Work The use of Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices enables efficient communication between different things.
    The use of IoT in agriculture is critical to simplifying the process. Around the
    world, smart farming systems have been developed using the concepts of the Internet
    of Things and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Within this approach, a branch called
    precision agriculture emerged. For various agricultural tasks, many researchers
    have created monitoring and automation systems. Data collection and transmission
    between IoT devices installed in the farm can be easily done through WSN. In the
    proposed method, a cluster-based WSN is used to receive high-quality, noise-free
    data through a Kalman filter (KF) with predictive analysis [15]. This approach
    reduces data transfer costs while improving data quality for analysis of WSN applications.
    Agriculture is the most populous economic sector and plays an important role in
    India''s overall socio-economic structure. Agriculture is primarily dependent
    on soil properties and water for irrigation. Traditional farming systems based
    on old ideas have failed to produce better results due to changing weather and
    climate conditions. Proper irrigation is necessary for better results. Recent
    developments in this technology have had a major impact on agriculture. This article
    focuses on work done in ML and IoT. In this article, we discuss the use of IoT
    for remote monitoring of soil properties, which has the potential to change agricultural
    practices. There is also a machine learning model that predicts crops based on
    soil characteristics, leading to high yield productivity [16] To maximize the
    use of water for crops, an automatic irrigation system was created. In the plant
    root zone, the system has a wireless network of soil moisture and temperature
    sensors. Gateway devices also process sensor data, activate actuators, and pass
    information to web applications. To regulate water flow, a microcontroller-based
    gateway was designed with algorithms for temperature and soil moisture limits.
    The system is powered by solar panels, and it features a duplex communication
    link based on a mobile internet interface that allows for programming of irrigation
    scheduling and web-based data control. In a 136-day test in a sage field, the
    automated technology saved up to 90 percent more water than traditional methods
    compared to conventional agricultural irrigation techniques. The automated method
    has been successfully utilized elsewhere for 18 months in three copies. The system
    has the ability to work in remote locations due to its low cost and energy isolation.
    The automated process has been used successfully for 18 months, in triplicate,
    in other places. The system is cheap and energy independent, which allows it to
    work in remote areas where water is scarce with limited water resources [17].
    An automatic irrigation system was created in order to maximize the water availability
    of the crops. A wireless distributed network of temperature, humidity and soil
    moisture sensors is part of the system. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) help to
    develop technology, with the rapid development and change of technology, automation
    plays an important role in human life. Thanks to automation, we can control gadgets
    automatically. In addition to providing comfort, it uses less energy, works more
    efficiently and saves time. This article aims to build an Android app that monitors
    plant growth using various factors, sprays fertilizer when needed and automatically
    manages water motors. The main goal is to understand data transmission over wireless
    media using wireless sensor networks and monitoring systems [18]. The system uses
    an automated irrigation system to maintain crop health and yield, and is designed
    to promote effective water management techniques to maximize water use. Each sensor
    node will have soil moisture, temperature and humidity sensors installed in the
    field. Batteries are used to power these WSNs. To collect sensor data, base stations
    will use radio frequency transceivers. To regulate the amount of water applied
    based on pre-determined thresholds; an algorithm was designed to monitor soil
    moisture and temperature. For various applications, Ramalingam et al. proposed
    the Blynk IoT server-based efficient data transmission method [19]. A wireless
    sensor network and Blynk were used to create an intelligent Internet of Things
    (IoT) device by Venkatramanan et al. This intelligent Internet of Things device
    has been used to gather and send data into the cloud [20] [23]. Using this IoT
    hardware design as a foundation, we create a low-cost smart device for missing
    person detectors. V. Suma et al. [21] presented an overview of Predictive Analytics,
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices with cloud management; multicultural security
    unit farmers'' previous experience is taken into account in the agriculture sector.
    It also demonstrates the difficulties and issues that might be expected when incorporating
    contemporary technologies into traditional farming practices. better based on
    statistics and quantitative methodologies revolutionary changes to the current
    agriculture system. Abul Bashar et al. [22] proposed the solution provided in
    this document employs an Android application to automate agricultural machines
    via IoT. The machine''s automation ensures that the work is completed automatically
    and without the need for human intervention. This procedure is repeated until
    the crops are harvested. Problem Statement: System performance can be affected
    by packet loss in communication between nodes and actuators. Actuators and node
    units have high power requirements. Different crops require different amounts
    of water depending on other factors such as soil type, temperature and other factors.
    While making irrigation selections, the system only measures soil moisture measurements.
    SECTION III. Proposed Method AI assists the design of farmland data monitoring
    system. This section includes home appliances and lights controlled using Wi-Fi
    for IoT and communication devices. This section contains solar panels used to
    generate energy from sunlight. Here voltage sensor and current sensor are used
    to measure the voltage and current generated by the panel and will be displayed
    on the LCD display with the help of Arduino. A. BLOCK DIAGRAM Fig. 1 Proposed
    Block diagram for IOT Show All B. WORKING PRINCIPLE Fig. 1 shows a proposed AI-driven
    IoT architecture for agriculture. Today, a variety of sensors are used to collect
    agricultural data, including soil moisture, air temperature and humidity. However,
    due to the lack of an integrated computing platform, such sensors can only monitor
    the environment and collect data; they cannot effectively use or analyze the data
    they collect. Here, an agricultural intelligence platform has been established
    to address this issue. Through the development of a smart agriculture platform,
    communication and multifunctional sensor components are integrated. System performance
    can be affected by packet loss in communication between nodes and actuators. Actuators
    and node units have high power requirements. The DC pump is activated if the humidity
    level is low. As indicated in Fig. 2, the sensor is placed outside the sensor
    platform, with the sensor probe in direct contact with the environment. In the
    deep location of the agricultural platform. This section details the design and
    implementation of controlled environment agriculture (CEA). The CEA system provides
    a program for automatic control and monitoring. This proposed work aims to provide
    ease of use. Efficient and reliable control system. It helps reduce the amount
    of water and energy required. The system will increase farmers'' yields at moderate
    and affordable costs. Fig. 2. Circuit Diagram [24] Show All An Arduino large development
    kit linked to a light sensor to gauge light intensity and an ambient temperature/humidity
    sensor to determine the ambient temperature and humidity is used to model the
    proposed system. Additionally, the system can be utilized to continuously assess
    temperature, water level, and the quantity of light hitting the plants —all of
    which are necessary for greenhouse systems. Analyzing the environment around plants
    requires temperature and humidity measurements. Different plant species have different
    ideal temperature and humidity ranges. Check and control plant temperature and
    humidity in drought and extreme temperatures. In addition, light sensors are crucial
    for measuring the light level information received by crops. The system includes
    various sensors. The built-in microprocessor in the Arduino mega development kit
    allows us to combine all the sensors, display the sensor values and use them as
    inputs. A touchscreen user interface is used to collect input from it. The system
    also has an IoT module that uses a wireless network to transmit sensor information
    to a server. In addition, users can view sensor data at any time through the server.
    C. Advantages of IOT Suitable for inaccessible places such as sea, mountain, countryside,
    deep forest, etc Flexible in random situations requiring additional workstations
    The price of implants is cheap. Avoid extensive wiring. Flexible physical division
    Can be accessed through centralized monitoring D. Applications IoT applications
    involve tracking, monitoring and control. IoT is primarily used for traffic and
    habitat monitoring, object tracking, nuclear reactor management, and fire detection.
    Area surveillance is a particularly popular use of IoT, which is created where
    certain events can be observed, such as a battlefield, where many sensor nodes
    may be deployed to detect enemy intrusions rather than using landmines. Wireless
    sensor networks can also be used to regulate greenhouse humidity and temperature
    levels. E. MODULE DESCRIPTION - IOT ENVIRONMENT One strategy to alleviate agricultural
    problems and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production is to
    employ sensor technologies to make farms \"smarter\" and more linked through \"precision
    agriculture,\" also known as \"smart agriculture.\" We created modules that sense
    soil moisture, temperature and humidity, rainfall frequency and light intensity.
    Through an interface, it advises farmers which seeds are suitable for the farm.
    The architecture of the system consists of sensors such as humidity, humidity
    and temperature sensors, Wi-Fi modules, etc. The software consists of an IoT platform
    that includes setting irrigation profiles based on seasons or daily and weekly
    patterns. The software sends messages to the main module to turn the system on/off.
    The sensor converts the analog value to a digital value after detecting all physical
    factors. Use temperature and humidity sensors to estimate the humidity and temperature
    at the location. Sensors combine in a module and collect data in real time. This
    information is then sent to the IoT network. The data is then transferred to the
    IoT platform using the Wi-Fi module (cloud) over the IoT network. The database
    will be in the system''s cloud. The data obtained from the IoT network will be
    maintained by it. The proposed system is schematically represented in Fig. 3 and
    4 proposed architecture and flow diagram. The FC-28 Soil Moisture Sensor measures
    soil moisture content as a percentage and determines how much moisture is present.
    This sensor primarily uses capacitance to determine soil water content (dielectric
    permittivity). This sensor works by putting it into the dirt, and the status of
    the water content in the soil is provided as a percentage. F. Environment from
    Data Fig. 3. Proposed Hardware block diagram Show All The DHT11 Humidity and Temperature
    Sensor measures humidity in percent and temperature in degrees Celsius. The light
    sensor LM393 measures light intensity in candela. The FC-37 Rain Sensor measures
    precipitation in millimeters and calculates the frequency of precipitation. Fig.
    2 illustrates the microcontroller components of the proposed system and the components
    of all of them. This microcontroller handles data collection using integrated
    sensors, which make up the system''s hardware. The microcontroller is responsible
    for interacting with the cloud storage, and it includes a built-in Wi-Fi module
    with a Wi-Fi range of 300 meters to facilitate information dissemination in the
    network. Many more microcontrollers than the few operate on any \"variant\" of
    the \"Arduino board family,\" but the Arduino board family. Provides a standard
    IDE that is extremely simple to use Has extensive peripheral support - including
    third-party support It contains a large number of sample applications to get started
    with G. Cloud and Network Storage The real time environmental data can be monitored
    through IoT using MQTT protocol. The NodeMCU has inbuilt Wi-Fi and low power consumption
    module for IoT application. The network is responsible for sending the data to
    cloud storage, which analyzes and calculates the collected sensor data, and then
    displays it on the IoT interface as raw data. Fig..4 IoT Architecture IoT based
    interface Show All There are two ways to connect hardware components to the cloud:
    one is to use an MQTT broker that uses the MQTT protocol, and the other is to
    use an HTTP module that uses the HTTP protocol. Since MQTT is message-driven and
    HTTP is document-driven, it can be more reliable than HTTP. IoT integration is
    all about APIs, applications use logical connectors to communicate with each IoT
    device. APIs expose data, enabling these devices to pass data to applications
    and act as data interfaces. They also allow your application to control the device
    and act as a functional interface. H. Hand held Device Web-based or mobile applications
    can be used to monitor data. These applications act as user interfaces and display
    data collected from sensors. Cell phones and other portable devices with LCD screens
    can run these applications. SECTION IV. RESULT ANALYSIS The system consists of
    Arduino, soil moisture sensor, soil temperature sensor, DHT-22 sensor, ESP32,
    LCD, GPS. FC-28 Soil moisture sensor-The required voltage for working is 5V. DHT
    11 sensor- he required voltage for working is 3-5V. The temperature range of the
    DHT11 is 0 to 50 degrees Celsius with a +-2 degree precision. The DHT11 has a
    sampling rate of 1Hz, which means it takes one reading every second. TABLE 1.
    Hardware Description Fig. 5 Transmitter hardware prototype Show All Fig. 6 Receiver
    hardware prototype Show All Fig 5, 6 shows the transmitter and receiver hardware
    prototype. The previous section describes the system architecture and hardware
    details. All sensors (temperature sensor, DHT11 sensor, and soil moisture sensor)
    were deployed in the field to evaluate the proposed system''s performance. The
    data is sent to the edge server via GSM module and Android app, and farmers can
    view the results as well. The user can then perform an action to open or close
    the valve. In general, packet loss reduces the speed or throughput of a particular
    connection. This can often result in a loss or degradation in quality for latency-sensitive
    protocols or applications, such as streaming video or voice-over IP, when accuracy
    is less critical. Packet loss will still have modest consequences since it may
    increase the CPU burden to process the extra network overhead. Fig. 7 Final output
    in display Show All Fig. 7 depicts the system''s results section. The numbers
    represent soil moisture values, temperature and humidity sensor readings, and
    pump status. Every instant value from the sensors is sent to the IOT server, which
    is in charge of reviewing the data (three sensor values every 30 seconds) and
    applying a model to predict the value for water consumption. This is the central
    idea behind the introduction of edge computing. It makes use of the trained model
    to forecast the amount of water needed and send the result to the server. The
    user receives this value and can use the app to view the outcome on his or her
    phone. For effective data collection, the water resource has been efficiently
    utilized. TABLE 2: Collected Data Set: Statistical Analysis Fig. 8 and 9 show
    temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data for the selected dates. Similar
    values can be found for any date during the plant''s growing season. Fig. 8 Measure
    data Soil moisture and soil temperature Show All Fig. 9 measured data for temperature
    and humidity Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this work, the IoT based smart
    agriculture irrigation system has been developed. It is made up of three modules:
    an irrigation unit (IU), a sensor information unit, and a low-cost smart Internet
    of Things (IoT) module (SIU). USP first spends some time in management mode before
    switching to one-time installation mode to compute evapotranspiration and irrigation
    schedules. During this time, data on the crop, planting date, and soil are collected.
    Finally, it switches to continuous monitoring mode, delivering sensor data to
    the SIU while processing data using the NN and sending decisions to the IU. For
    all modules, this document includes thorough results with sample test benches.
    Compared to the conventional way, the system saves 67% more water overall. Therefore,
    smart solutions are accessible for people living far from farms and in water-scarce
    locations with effective water usage and continuous monitoring. The usage of this
    automatic device is justified by the requirement to protect this natural resource.
    It is perfect for a variety of people due to its simplicity, cost, and practicality.
    For indoor vegetation, greenhouses, and other indoor environments, it is useful
    due to its versatility, adaptability, and mobility. Authors Figures References

  description: 'Laundry related activities produce huge quantity of wastewater that
    is very rich in lint, dyes, surfactants, and detergents. The large amount of laundry
    wastewater (LWW) is generated by extensive human activities. LWW needs to be treated
    in order to tackle the challenging problem of water pollution and to accomplish
    water sustainability. To achieve this success, LWW can be reused for several purposes
    such as irrigation, construction activities, vehicle washing etc. However, there
    are several challenges in the reclamation of LWW like effective handling of the
    wastewater and meeting the regulatory criteria. Based on the literature review
    it seems that a single treatment process is not sufficient to treat LWW up to
    acceptable reuse standards. To that end, different treatment chains have been
    proposed: i) hybrid processes combining membrane filtration with adsorption; ii)
    advanced oxidation process using ultraviolet (UV) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2);
    iii) coagulation-flocculation combined with sand filtration; iv) combination of
    ozonation process, adsorption, and ultrafiltration (UF). This review paper discusses
    the selection of suitable treatment technology depends on several factors: i)
    a well-designed equipment, ii) cost-effectiveness of treatment method and iii)
    desired characteristics of the treated water. The review paper also presents solutions
    for treatment and reclamation of LWW.'

    EPUB Abstract Laundry related activities produce huge quantity of wastewater that
    is very rich in lint, dyes, surfactants, and detergents. The large amount of laundry
    wastewater (LWW) is generated by extensive human activities. LWW needs to be treated
    in order to tackle the challenging problem of water pollution and to accomplish
    water sustainability. To achieve this success, LWW can be reused for several purposes
    such as irrigation, construction activities, vehicle washing etc. However, there
    are several challenges in the reclamation of LWW like effective handling of the
    wastewater and meeting the regulatory criteria. Based on the literature review
    it seems that a single treatment process is not sufficient to treat LWW up to
    acceptable reuse standards. To that end, different treatment chains have been
    proposed: i) hybrid processes combining membrane filtration with adsorption; ii)
    advanced oxidation process using ultraviolet (UV) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2);
    iii) coagulation-flocculation combined with sand filtration; iv) combination of
    ozonation process, adsorption, and ultrafiltration (UF). This review paper discusses
    the selection of suitable treatment technology depends on several factors: i)
    a well-designed equipment, ii) cost-effectiveness of treatment method and iii)
    desired characteristics of the treated water. The review paper also presents solutions
    for treatment and reclamation of LWW. Keywords: Laundry wastewater (LWW)treatment
    technologyreclamationreusesustainability Introduction Water is among the most
    valuable natural resources available on the earth. Among the existing water on
    Earth, 97% is saline (unfit for consumption), and merely 3% is available for human
    utilization.[ 1] However, 68.7% of the freshwater is in the form of icecaps and
    glaciers, which makes it hard to use for drinking, household, or industrial purposes.[
    1] As a result, approximately 99% of the existing water on Earth cannot be used
    for daily purposes. Pollutants leading to the deterioration of communal health
    and natural surroundings are found in the wastewater that emerges from the laundries.
    This eventually results in water pollution that has been a matter of concern for
    all the countries around the globe in recent years. Also, there have been concerns
    related to the increased production of laundry wastewater (LWW), which impacts
    the environment, specifically in countries with emerging economies that are progressing
    rapidly. The laundry industry consumes a huge amount of water on a daily basis.
    To handle 1 kg of washing clothes, the laundry industry consumes 15 L water, producing
    400 m3 of wastewater per day.[ 2] Such a substantial quantity of LWW demands operative
    procedures for wastewater remediation. Nevertheless, the lack of LWW treatment
    policies has been a perpetual setback. Laundry additives, baking soda, soap, and
    detergent are utilized for different processes in the laundry (bleaching, white-work
    washing, starching and bluing) to make it free from dirt, oil, and grease. Therefore,
    the composition of LWW mainly contains compounds from soap, soda, and detergent.[
    3] There is a large difference in the products used on commercial and residential
    scales, and hence there is a considerable variation in the composition of LWW
    at different scales. The sources of LWW generation are commercial laundries, household
    laundries, hotels, restaurants, and hospitals. The attributes of wastewater generated
    from all these laundries are almost the same except for hospitals laundries. These
    characteristics are dependent upon several factors like place of origin, the total
    number of people using the service, habits of the occupants, lifestyle, storage
    period, etc. LWW originated from commercial laundries have several pollutants
    like dye, phosphate-based detergents, surfactants like nonylphenol ethoxylates
    (NPEOs), sodium perborate, linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), and sodium percarbonate.
    The pollutants may contaminate the water system and results in eutrophication
    or harm aquatic life. In addition, hospital laundries consist of pharmaceutical
    products and chemicals. The aforesaid chemicals in the usable water can create
    a threat to the ecosystem.[ 4] A proper effective and eco-friendly management
    of LWW is necessary as utilization of surfactants over 0.5 mg L−1 poses a major
    health threat.[ 5] The existing innovative technology arrangements conclude how
    the reuse of LWW is quite difficult but still achievable by applying integrated
    processes.[ 6, 7] This review aims to summarize previous research published by
    experts round the globe, describing the characteristics of LWW and methods of
    LWW treatment. This would be extremely helpful in lieu of prior planning before
    any research is carried out on the subject. This work is also unique in its approach
    to resolve the drawbacks of single technology utilization for dealing with LWW.
    This review paper also emphasizes on combination of two or more treatment processes
    to give better-augmented results for the reusability of the LWW. Laundry wastewater
    (LWW) The habits and procedures followed during the washing of the clothes, along
    with the nature of the washing machine affect the composition of LWW.[ 8] The
    orientation (horizontal vs. vertical axis) provided by the washing machine supplier
    defines the two categories of the machine available in the market. European countries
    have a large market for the horizontal ones, whereas the vertical ones are more
    popularized in American, Asian, and Australian cities.[ 9] Washing behavior includes
    the temperature, average load, and the total number of washing rounds. In a research
    on 38 countries, it was conveyed that the yearly water expenditure in Europe’s
    laundry was approximately 10 m3 less than the other countries.[ 8] The maximum
    water consumption was reported in Japan and Malaysia, as a consequence of which
    the highest amount of 60 to 80 m3 LWW/household/year was generated in these countries.
    The main reason credited by the author for this huge variation was given to the
    utilization of vertical axes in Asian countries that leads to more number of washing
    rounds.[ 10] Therefore, this evidence establishes the necessity for treatment
    and reusing of treated LWW for other purposes. The sources and reuse purposes
    of treated laundry wastewater are depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Depiction of
    source and LWW reclamation for reuse. Sources of the images used in diagram.[
    150–155] Display full size As the initial characteristics of LWW differ widely
    between the individual apartments, it is not practical to install the same treatment
    unit for all of them.[ 11] However, several studies reported some applications
    for water recycling after small modifications in treatment approach for different
    types of LWW.[ 6, 11–14] It was proposed in a study to collect separately LWW
    from all the individual apartments in a collection basin and then apply the treatment
    process.[ 11] The suggested processes can be implemented during the design stage
    of the building by providing separate plumbing facilities to each apartment for
    LWW collection.[ 11] The study suggests that LWW has high reuse potential for
    secondary purposes.[ 11] A study reported that, after simple treatment (for instance
    using chemical coagulation or ultrafiltration process), domestic LWW can be effectively
    used as toilet flushing water, irrigation water and also in the first wash cycle
    of the laundry.[ 12, 14] Another study reported the reuse of treated commercial
    LWW in the wash cycles of the laundry. A treatment process combining (i) physicochemical
    pretreatment (coagulation, flocculation and Dissolved Air Flotation or DAF); (ii)
    sand filtration; (iii) ozonation; (iv) Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filtration
    and (v) cross-flow ultrafiltration (UF) on flat membranes realized in polyvinyledene
    fluoride (PVDF).[ 12] The study indicates that, treated wastewater from GAC outlet
    fulfills the required permissible limit for discharge in Italy. Further treatment
    from UF membrane enhances the quality of treated wastewater, allowing it to reuse
    in washing process.[ 12] Other researchers reported the possibility to reuse of
    LWW generated from petroleum refineries in Pakistan.[ 13] It was achieved by using
    an economical treatment system comprising of sedimentation and filtration units.[
    13] The treated water was only used in the first rinsing cycle of the laundry.[
    13] Another study reported the reuse of industrial LWW previously treated by electrocoagulation
    and electroflotation process.[ 6] The treated LWW were used in the washing process.
    At least, 90% removal of pollutants was achieved under the best operating conditions
    imposed: current density of 5.26 mA cm-2, pH 5.5, and treatment time of 5 min.[
    6] Likewise, hospital LWW were subjected to treatment using coagulation-flocculation,
    anthracite filtration and advanced oxidation process (UV/H2O2) with a view to
    reuse treated effluent for washing process. During the treatment process low pressure
    UV-C lamp was used and treatment efficiency was investigated using factorial block
    design.[ 15] Properties of LWW LWW generation source, along with the washing load,
    its procedure, and proficiency of the machines, sums up the measurable attributes
    of LWW.[ 16] LWW principally is categorized into industrial, domestic, and hospital
    laundry wastewater.[ 10] Among these, hospital LWW has been considered dangerous.[
    17] Physical parameters of wastewater are temperature, suspended solids (SS) concentration,
    color, turbidity, and electrical conductivity. Temperature is among the most noteworthy
    parameter as it governs the percentage of reaction and existence of microbes,
    which is necessary for aerobic wastewater treatment. Normally, temperature for
    LWW lies between 30-36 °C.[ 18, 19] Measurement of the turbidity and SS of LWW
    provide some data about the concentration of colloidal fragments that might clog
    pipes, used for transportation of wastewater. Turbidity for domestic laundries,
    commercial laundries, and hospital laundries wastewater has been described in
    the range of 14-400 NTU, 40-150 NTU, 87.9 NTU, respectively.[ 14, 20] Electrical
    conductivity for wastewater lies between 190-1400 µS cm-1 for domestic laundries,
    640-3000 µS cm-1 for commercial laundries, and 808-2000 µS cm-1 for hospital’s
    laundry wastewater.[ 14, 20, 21] SS has been reported in range of 16-330 mg L-1,
    and total solids (TS) vary between 113-2410 mg L-1.[ 18] The biological and chemical
    characteristics of LWW are very important from the treatment perspective. The
    main chemical characteristics of LWW are pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),
    nanophenol ethoxylate (NPEO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), linear alkylbenzene
    sulfonate (LAS), Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides (DDAC, DSDMAC), nitrates and
    nitrites, and phosphate. The biological parameters include the occurrence of microorganisms
    in wastewater. For the commercial laundry, the typical value of pH lies between
    9-11, the COD value is in the range of 376-910 mg L-1, and BOD value is between
    48-1200 mg L-1.[ 22, 23] Hospital laundry wastewater encompasses all the above
    parameters along with some pathogens and some pharmaceutical products.[ 17] So,
    for the treatment of hospital laundry wastewater, a separate treatment process
    such as disinfection using catalytic photozonation is required, which can take
    care of the contaminants along with surfactants.[ 24] The properties of laundry
    wastewater in accordance with the source of origin have been stated in Table 1.
    Table 2 outlines LWW characteristics in different countries. Table 1. Characteristics
    of LWW in accordance with the source of origin. Download CSVDisplay Table Table

    CSVDisplay Table The limits in accordance to British regulations for raw LWW on
    total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), E. coli, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biochemical
    oxygen demand (BOD) measurably surpassed at a margin of 92.0%, 89.0%, 73.8%, and
    over 100%, respectively as per the studies and experimentation of Ho et al.[ 29]
    In the residential LWW, considerable COD, BOD, and anionic surfactants have been
    detected in high concentration.[ 29] The augmentation of the biodegradability
    of LWW was established by the mean ratio of COD to BOD as 1:5, which was calculated
    by Makropoulos et al.[ 30] Residential, domestic laundries showed a presence of
    heavy metals too. A small concentration of lead and chromium was detected, but
    elevated concentration of zinc (0.20 ± 0.16 mg L-1) and copper (43 ± 29 μg L-1)
    was found probably because of plumbing materials and coatings of the water outlets.
    The plumbing materials and coatings from the pipe network leach out during LWW
    disposal. The exceeding levels of turbidity, total phosphorus (TP), conductivity,
    and total suspended solids (TSS) were detected in the LWW produced from industries
    when compared to domestic LWW sources, reported in Kim et al.[ 26] and Shang et
    al.[ 31] Some of these values were found to be more than that of the discharge
    limits (Table 3). For example, TP was 26 mg L-1, which was more than the required
    limits of 18 mg L-1. All solids classes combined were discovered in high levels
    when residential LWW was mixed with university campus LWW.[ 37] When compared
    with another LWW sources, relatively less polluted wastewater was discovered in
    LWW collected at the university campus.[ 38] Alternatively, extensive COD (500-580 mg
    L-1) along with high amounts of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) (13.2-15.0 mg
    L-1) were observed in LWW that was generated after washing of the bedding used
    in trains.[ 39] Finally, slightly excessive total organic carbon (TOC), COD, and
    hardness like magnesium and calcium were observed by Guilbaud et al.[ 16]; while
    experimenting and studying with LWW that was generated from a ship.[ 16] Treatment
    of LWW according to the discharge limits and its reuse is the need of the hour
    because of several applications of treated LWW. Therefore, effective LWW remediation
    technologies have been advocated for water-scarce regions to resolve the problem
    of water availability and management.[ 40] Table 3. International permissible
    limits for LWW. Download CSVDisplay Table Regulatory standards for reuse of treated
    LWW Documentation describing LWW reclamation and reuse benefits has been reported.[
    6, 12, 13, 21, 41–46] Water reclamation and reuse contribute to solving water
    scarcity problems.[ 29, 47] The development of a new water source after reclaiming
    LWW has been reported, which helps in reducing the expenses of freshwater consumption.[
    4, 47, 48] Nonetheless, purpose of reusing or reclaiming wastewater are restricted
    to their aims like drinking water for human or livestock, irrigation, industrial
    cooling water, or construction. The recommended specifications and regulations
    related to suitable water consumption are set all over the world by various local
    and international institutions, following which if the limit is obtained, the
    wastewater is consumable and can be utilized. It is observed that regular LWW
    do not meet the acceptance limits of phosphate, nitrate, pH, SS, nitrite, iron,
    COD, ammoniacal nitrogen, and copper. Thus, the required, acceptable levels of
    these parameters need to be brought down by additional treatment. National Water
    Quality Standards (NWQS), as set by the governmental agencies all over Canada
    regulating irrigation and livestock drinking purpose, can only be achieved after
    treating LWW by efficacious methods.[ 49] The LWW used for irrigation purpose
    has reduced stringent necessities compared to livestock drinking, which takes
    into account the health hazards on cattle and the customers. Employing treated
    LWW for agricultural purposes, can act as a substitute to commercial fertilizers
    because of presence of phosphorus and nitrogen in treated LWW. LWW falls into
    the category of greywater, which can be reclaimed and reused for drinking purposes.
    In some countries like Australia, Singapore, and Namibia have developed and applied
    technologies to treat LWW for drinking purposes.[ 50] A standardized guideline
    for drinking water quality was created by the World Health Organization (WHO,
    2011) on an international level. These guidelines were adapted and further utilized
    to set domestic drinking water consumption guidelines by the countries worldwide.
    The Public Utilities Board (PUB) in Singapore, based on WHO’s strategies, developed
    a product called NEWater that strictly followed these guidelines. Utilizing its
    innovative island-wide sewage protocol, this product is made fit for reuse through
    a chain of treatment methods using double membrane filtration, conventional wastewater
    procedure, and ultraviolet (UV) treatment technology.[ 2] Since 2003, NEWater
    technology has been extensively consumed in domestic as well as in industrial
    purpose all over Singapore. The data shown in Table 3 was included from several
    references from innumerable international specifications for watercourse discharge,
    drinking water, cattle drinking water, irrigation water, and construction water
    eminence. Table 3 gives all the LWW parameters and their permissible limits in
    various watercourses. Conversely, strict limits are followed for the extreme occurrence
    of COD and LAS. Consequently, merely by handling COD along with LAS can create
    LWW throwaway to watercourses. Surfactants, microfibers and microplastics: source
    of emerging contaminants Surfactants like NPEOs, LAS, and DDAC are widely employed
    as detergents in the laundry industry. They are considered as emerging contaminants
    and are continuously discharged, creating an adverse potential effect on the environment.
    Surfactants are amphoteric in nature, which permits them to behave like acid or
    base therefore, they are employed as cleansers in several industries. Surfactants
    may exist in numerous forms like cationic, anionic, and nonionic; mainly, they
    exhibit LAS. However, surfactants, when enter the water bodies, they can adversely
    impact aquatic life and also human health. The literature clearly demonstrates
    the adverse effect of surfactants on flora, fauna, and human health. The excessive
    concentration of LAS may cause respiratory problems in humans and may also cause
    skin irritation.[ 51, 52] On the other hand, anionic surfactants exhibit toxic
    character attributable to their highly reactive nature with cellular units and
    combine with several macromolecules like DNA, peptides, and protein, causing damage
    of their function.[ 51, 52] The measure of inhibitory activity of a substance
    on a specific biological or biochemical function is referred as the half-maximal
    inhibitory concentration (IC50). Könnecker and coworkers discovered that the IC50
    standards for Daphia magna, fish, and algae are 9.6 mg L-1, 8.9 mg L-1, and 12.8 mg
    L-1, respectively.[ 53] Thus, eliminating LAS from laundry wastewater is essential
    to decrease deleterious environmental effects. Although various categories of
    chemical and physical treatment methods exist, most of the techniques are economically
    not feasible and yields toxic by-products. Toxic by-products are more hazardous
    than preliminary compound. The practice of biological treatment processes can
    eradicate the poisonous compounds and change them into less poisonous by-products.[
    54] Microplastics (MPS) and nanoplastics (NPS) are other emerging contaminants
    that are present in LWW. Synthetic fibers released during the washing process
    are the major source of MPS in LWW.[ 55] Studies indicate that LWW is one of the
    primary contributors of microfibers (MFS) in the aquatic system.[ 56] Studies
    also indicate that these microplastics can stay in the environment for many years
    due to chemical stability. Due to its large surface area, endurance, and fluidity,
    MPS can readily adsorb metals, harmful bacteria, and organic chemical pollutants,
    which results in the increase of microplastics in the aquatic environment.[ 57–59]
    Because of the small size and light density MPS and NPS are easy to consume by
    aquatic animals. These MPS can cause an ecotoxicological effect on aquatic animals
    and adversely affect human health.[ 55, 60] The accumulation of MPS can cause
    intestinal blockage and abrasion in aquatic animals.[ 61] Currently, MPs have
    not been included in the Effluent Discharge Objectives (EDOs) of municipalities,
    but due to their serious environmental effects, it is necessary to develop feasible
    and cost-effective treatment technology. Although most of the MPS (>90%) can be
    eliminated in the wastewater treatment plants, but still some fraction of MPS
    bypasses the system and enters to the environment. So far, no specific treatment
    process has been implemented in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for the
    removal of MPs and NPs, with the exception of existing technologies, such as sedimentation,
    grit chamber, skimming, screening, membrane bioreactor, and tertiary filtration.
    Moreover, many researchers are working to develop new technology approaches for
    MPs and NPs degradation in wastewater.[ 60, 62] Effects on human health and the
    environment The wastewater generated from the laundry activity is highly rich
    in SS, energy (heat), dye, surfactant, total solids, and COD. The surfactants
    like NPEOs are the chief ingredients of detergent, which is considered as an endocrine-disrupting
    compound. When water containing NPEOs is directly discharged within the open water
    bodies, it can adversely affect the ecosystem and the aquatic animals. It may
    lead to genetic mutation of the aquatic animals and can affect the reproduction
    capability of the fish.[ 63] NPEOS may be toxic when it exceeds a certain aggregate
    in water bodies.[ 64] The surfactants that are cationic, anionic, and nonionic
    in nature exhibit hydrophilic and lipophilic nature. The lipophilic tail is biologically
    active with surfactants. The anionic surfactants possess the ability to get attached
    to the bioactive macromolecules such as peptides, enzymes, DNA. As a result, surface
    charge on the bioactive macromolecules get altered along with improper folding
    of polypeptide chain. On the other hand, the cationic surfactants may attach to
    the bacterial membrane, and can alter the performance of the bacteria. The nonionic
    surfactants are capable of combining with phospholipid membrane and proteins,
    resulting in the increased permeability of the membrane and vesicles. An increase
    in the permeability of the cell membrane can lead to cell disruption due to release
    of low molecular weight compounds from the cell.[ 65] Laundry wastewater treatment
    processes Overall, the LWW treatment system may be divided into three principal
    procedures: biological, physicochemical, and the combination of biological and
    physicochemical methods (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Laundry wastewater treatment processes.

    Chemical coagulation Since many decades, chemical coagulation has been utilized
    for wastewater treatment. The inorganic coagulants like aluminum sulfate or iron
    salts (ferric sulfate, ferrous sulfate or ferric chloride) were the first ones
    to be used for the treatment. However, FeCl3 is corrosive and FeSO4 works only
    in the pH range of 8.5-11. Therefore, preference was given to aluminum sulfate
    and ferric sulfate which can be utilized in a varying pH range of 5-9 and 4-11,
    respectively.[ 20] Hazardous by-products like metal hydroxides are produced with
    the usage of above coagulants, which creates an additional problem of removing
    these metal ions from the treated water. Therefore, chemical coagulation process
    must be combined with adsorption. A high efficacy has been found with ligand based
    composite adsorbents that are selective for removal of metal ions from the LWW.[
    66] Natural and synthetic organic coagulants are supposed to give high efficacy
    with lower doses and hence, they tend to produce less volumes of sludge. They
    provide higher removal of turbidity and COD than the inorganic coagulants.[ 67]
    However, best results were obtained when low molecular weight polymers were added
    as coagulants during LWW treatment.[ 26] For chemical coagulation process, COD
    and turbidity removal rate is dependent on SS concentration in LWW.[ 31] High
    COD and turbidity removal rate is generally observed for high SS concentration.
    For high removal rates, working pH, coagulant concentration, sedimentation time
    and mixing speed must be experimentally optimized. Generally, jar tests are employed
    for this type of experiments.[ 31] The effectiveness of chemical coagulants like
    ferric chloride and polyaluminum chloride (PACl) was studied for microfibers removal
    from LWW.[ 68] It was found that 90-94% of microfibers were removed using ferric
    chloride in the absence of detergent, and 90% removal efficiency was obtained
    using PACI.[ 68] Electrocoagulation The pollutants like ions, organic colloids,
    and inorganic colloids are removed from various wastewater effluents by using
    electrocoagulation process (EC). During the treatment process wastewater passes
    through the EC cell and voltage is applied. At the anode electrode, EC delivers
    the coagulant in situ by anodic dissolution in wastewater subjected to treatment.
    At the cathode surface, water is reduced into hydrogen gas and hydroxyl ion. The
    dissolved metal ions (coagulating agents: Al3+ or Fe2+/Fe3+) then encounter suspended
    particles to neutralize the negative surface charge. The coagulating agents can
    also react with hydroxyl ions and produce iron (or aluminum) hydroxides having
    a considerable sorption capacity. These metal hydroxides can simultaneously remove
    suspended solids, heavy metals, and other pollutants by co-precipitation or complexation.
    Figure 3 shows the treatment mechanism of EC process. Figure 3. Treatment mechanism
    of EC process. Source: Original image by the author. Display full size The active
    coagulant precursors are produced when sacrificial anodes are dissolved via applied
    potential.[ 69] Table 4 summarizes some remarkable findings using electrocoagulation
    for handling LWW. Arrangement of dissimilar electrodes in EC has proved to be
    beneficial in terms of minimizing energy consumption, as discussed by various
    researchers.[ 74–76] Table 4. LWW treatment using electrocoagulation. Download
    CSVDisplay Table A moving particle electrode granular activated carbon (GAC) was
    utilized under optimized specific operating conditions (current intensity 354.3 mA,
    pH 5.4, reaction time of 55 minutes, and GAC dosage of 47.1 g L-1) for LWW treatment.
    Then, treated LWW was used for irrigation and construction activities.[ 70] In
    supplementary research by Janpoor et al.[ 73], utilizing additional four aluminum
    electrodes, created an extensive range of managed laundry effluent evaluations
    and also testified optimum circumstances (pH = 6, 30 V, and inter-electrode distance
    of 1.5 cm) to accomplish best elimination efficacy: 93.2% COD, 90.1% color, 96.7%
    phosphorus, and 93.5% detergent.[ 73] The maximum turbidity removal rate was achieved
    after 90 min of treatment. The enmeshment in a precipitate and the neutralization
    of surface charges (consequently stimulating coagulation) are the two elimination
    procedures that eradicates these contaminants utilizing the classes of aluminum
    species generated. An impermeable film on the cathodes is formed as a consequence
    of the passivation of aluminum anodes which may interfere with the performance
    of electrocoagulation.[ 77] The energy consumption increases when a high voltage
    for long terms is applied for the breaking of the inhibition layer produced on
    the electrode surface. Also, the electrodes are exhausted after such long-run
    usages. The performance of this technology was improvised through the application
    of a low-frequency sonic field (40-200Hz) to overcome the above-mentioned problems
    SO4− and Cl− were coagulated after augmenting the iron hydroxide concentration.[
    78] Some discrete combinations of electrodes in a relative investigation were
    also utilized underneath acidic circumstances (pH = 3).[ 71] An efficacious 87.1%
    and 75.1% COD removal was achieved with iron electrode pair and iron-aluminum
    electrode pair, respectively, due to the dissipation of iron into divalent Fe(II)
    and trivalent Fe(III) ions and sturdily dissipation of aluminum into trivalent
    Al(III) ions. Lastly, the decay of harmful contaminants was simplified by the
    supplementation of oxidizing materials (like hydrogen peroxide) under specific
    operating conditions like pH = 5, current density of 0.5 mA cm-2, and 10 min of
    treatment time. In the study 81.6% of elimination efficacy was achieved for SDS
    removal using above process.[ 72] Likewise, electrocoagulation process can effectively
    be used to remove MPs and NPs from LWW. More than 90% of MPs and NPs were removed
    from wastewater while using aluminum electrode operated with 10 V applied voltage
    density during 6 h of retention time at pH 7.2.[ 56] In a similar study, 98% removal
    of MPs was obtained using Fe-Al electrode with 2.16 A current intensity at pH
    9 and for 60 min treatment time.[ 79] Another study suggests that electrooxidation
    (EO) and electro-peroxidation (EO-H2O2) can effectively degrade 86.8% of NPs from
    wastewater.[ 60] In another similar study, Kiendrebeogo et al.[ 60] showed that
    up to 89 ± 8% of MPs could be degraded by using electrooxidation process comprising
    of boron doped diamond (BDD) anode operated at a current density of 108.4 mA cm−2
    and in the presence of 0.03 M Na2SO4 used as supporting electrolyte.[ 60] The
    scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the remained MPs in water after
    the electrooxidation demonstrated all of them were unchanged, suggesting the complete
    mineralization of MPs at the anode surface.[ 60] Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
    also confirmed this suggestion by observation of the formation of no MPs with
    lower size than the initial MPs. It was also verified by Fourier transform infrared
    spectroscopy (FTIR) detecting no C = O bond by FTIR analysis on the MPs after
    electrooxidation.[ 60] This process has innumerable benefits: easy, cost-effective,
    environment-friendly, flexible, competent, and broad-spectrum (being capable to
    eliminate concurrently various kinds of contaminants).[ 75] Nonetheless, a consistent
    substitute of the sacrificial anode is essential while the anode disperses in
    the solution, and cathode passivation may happen that diminishes the ability of
    electrocoagulation. To tackle the challenge of passivation and short operation
    time, the suitable electrode material can be investigated, which can provide better
    treatment efficiency and less passivation. Another strategy could be the addition
    of continuous coagulant dose while maintaining the cell potential low during extended
    EC operations. Using alternative current (AC) supply, polarity reversal, ultra-sonification,
    and increasing the flow velocity to increase the scouring could be another solution.
    Besides this, additional research needs to be performed to accomplish high performance
    in electrocoagulation through statistical modeling and computational fluid dynamics.
    Membrane filtration The high separation efficiency has been a major reason for
    adopting membrane technology as an economical and eco-friendly process for treating
    wastewaters.[ 43] The existing volumes of surfactants in LWW have been the center
    for the selection of an appropriate membrane.[ 80] The critical micelle concentration
    (CMC) is attained when coalescence of surfactants happens inside the aqueous solution,
    and spherical micelles are generated. Inside an aqueous solution, surfactants
    combine to form spherical micelles when CMC is attained in solution. The range
    of spherical micelles generated by CMC can be between 2-20nm, as a consequence,
    microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes are chosen when the retrieval of
    surfactants is on or beyond CMC. Alternatively, nanofiltration membrane is acclaimed
    during circumstances where it cannot surpass the CMC value.[ 80] The statistics
    on the efficiency of membrane filtration for LWW treatment are presented in Table
    5. Table 5. LWW treatment using membrane filtration. Download CSVDisplay Table
    Studies have been reported for reusing treated LWW post-MF treatment utilized
    a MF membrane made of cellulose nitrate for LWW treatment and permeate (treated
    LWW) could be employed for sanitary toilet flushing or landscaping.[ 14] But treated
    LWW could not be reused for washing laundries because it did not follow permissible
    limits of BOD content (10-30 mg L-1).[ 14] However, application of a separate
    MF membrane - mixed cellulose ester (MCE), generated an effluent of 233.5 mg L-1
    COD with COD elimination of 90% in the permeate, that needed further dilution
    before its use in sanitary toilet flushing.[ 10] Ashfaq et al.[ 81] studied that
    more advanced treatment process is required in case of hospital LWW, besides MF.[
    81] As UF membrane was utilized with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 5 kDa,
    after which the authors found 90% COD elimination in the permeate under following
    operating conditions: transmembrane pressure = 2.5 bars, flow rate = 2.5 LPM.
    The reutilization of LWW (initially treated by MF) in toilet flushing does come
    with a considerable number of challenges. Even though UF membranes procedures
    effectively eliminate SS, the permeate still possess high concentration of organic
    materials and according to EU guidelines, can not be used as bathwater.[ 46] Implementation
    of a rotating disk system (RDM, at 2000 rpm) attached to NF270 membrane to treat
    genuine detergent wastewater produced 350 L m-2 h-1 permeate flux and 97% COD
    elimination.[ 82] Apart from the various innumerable advantages of membrane technology,
    it has certain shortcomings as well. The major shortfall is membrane fouling,
    which occurs when the particles are accumulated on the surface and/or within the
    pores of the membrane. The membrane fouling demands repeated washing to re-establish
    the permeate flux and, utilizes more energy at high pressures.[ 38, 83] To alleviate
    the drawbacks of membrane filtration, solutions like hydrodynamic operation (control
    of turbulent flow), pretreatment techniques, and membrane surface modifications
    can be employed to treat the LWW as per the limits. In general, it has been determined
    that single-step treatment is inefficient for producing high-quality effluent
    which fulfills the allowed limits for wastewater reuse.[ 81, 84–86] One-step membrane
    filtration is a feasible process for LWW treatment and there have been recent
    advancements in membrane manufacturing techniques. It has been reported that use
    of small pore size membranes (NF and UF membrane) in single-phase filtration,
    may generate high quality permeate for on-site recovery.[ 16] Hospital LWW treated
    through a single-step UF filtration (MWCO: 5 kDa) has been investigated to generate
    reusable water in China, USA, and Italy.[ 81] NF filtration system has been installed
    at marine ships to handle LWW to remove microbes and SS while resulting in low
    COD (48 mg L-1) and TOC (7 mg L-1) in treated LWW.[ 16] Eighty percent of treated
    LWW was recovered and reused for washing of the laundry. The authors reported
    35% decline in permeate flux due to membrane fouling by fibers and pollutants
    in LWW. To resolve the above problem, the authors recommended use of NF RDM. Shear
    strength dynamic filtration was used to reduce gel layer formation and concentration
    polarization. This enhanced permeate flux from 26% to 57%, while COD removal increased
    by 4%.[ 82] UF membranes made of polysulfone could remove up to 80% sodium dodecycl
    sulfate (SDS) surfactant from LWW.[ 87] However, the surfactant retention rates,
    and the permeability of membranes rapidly decrease with the increase of surfactant
    concentrations.[ 87] In order to solve the problem of membrane permeability and
    stability during laundry wastewater treatment (for long-time operation), many
    researchers have suggested the use of ceramic membranes. Ceramic membranes have
    higher chemical and thermal stability, excellent structural integrity, and low
    fouling tendency and can be effectively used for LWW treatment containing relatively
    high surfactant concentrations.[ 88–90] For instance, the permeability of the
    ceramic membrane was much higher (50 L m−2 h−1 bar−1) than the polymeric organic
    membrane (4.2 and 29.2 L m−2 h−1 bar−1).[ 87, 91] Another study shows that the
    ceramic UF membrane was more effective in removing suspended particles compared
    to removing organic matter removal.[ 92] Adsorption Various kinds of adsorbents
    retain active functional groups, which deliver selective affinity through electrostatic
    interaction or synchronization mechanisms with respect to innumerable surfactants.[
    93] Schouten et al.[ 85] reported variation of adsorption efficacy due to the
    surface charge and the adsorbents’ pore size.[ 85] The ionic interfaces of the
    cationic resin will help in promoting adhesion of an anionic surfactant. On the
    same hand, dispersion of surfactant molecules will be controlled by both macropores
    (450 nm) or mesopores (2–50 nm) together. They adsorb the surfactant molecules
    at the interior core of adsorbents.[ 51] There have been substantial attempts
    for activation of different adsorbents at varying temperature and pH Zhang et
    al.[ 94] studied the primary amino-cross-linked chitosan microspheres (ACCMs)
    to demonstrate strong affinity toward anionic surfactants that preserved 94.3%
    adsorption following 8 adsorption-desorption cycles under sub-optimal temperature
    and pH.[ 94] Adsorbents for LWW treatment can be chosen based on type of surfactant
    – anionic or cationic.[ 95] Approximately 95% heavy metals were eliminated from
    treated LWW by using activated carbon generated from banana stem waste.[ 96] Moreover,
    iron oxide powder (hematite and magnetite) is an efficient adsorbent for removal
    of cationic surfactants. Large amount (17 g L-1 to 51 g L-1) of the adsorbent
    was crucial to attain 90% elimination of cationic surfactants in 10 minutes.[
    32] In another study, zeolite-4A provided better performance than other adsorbents
    materials (vermiculite and zeolite) to reach adsorption equilibrium, which was
    found to be effective for 98.7% removal of radionuclide species (Sr2+, Cs+, and
    Co2+) from LWW of nuclear facilities.[ 97] A record of notable studies on adsorption
    have been depicted in Table 6. To sum up, adsorption for LWW management is contemplated
    as an efficient and cost-effective technique, which can eliminate pollutants from
    wastewater. As cited, several parameters influence the efficacy and functioning
    of adsorbents like pH, preliminary pollutant concentration, stirring speed, ionic
    strength, contact time, adsorbent amount, coexisting ions, and temperature. Table
    6. LWW treatment by Adsorption. Download CSVDisplay Table Biological treatment
    Aerobic decay of contaminants has been reported via numerous techniques, such
    as batch biodegradation, aerobic bioreactor, or trickling filters.[ 101] The study
    of a two-stage aerobic moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) (Kaldnes K5 as bio-filter
    media) was carried out to effectively treat LWW. MBR was successfully operated
    for four months which resulted in removal of 95-98% BOD5, 85-96% surfactant and
    finally 89- 94% of COD.[ 102] The sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) setup
    removed approximately 86.5% of COD, >85% of micropollutants, 98.4% ammonium, and
    71.4% TN from LWW.[ 103] Aerobic degradation may resolve drawbacks of other LWW
    treatment methods. The River Die-Away (RDA) biodegradation test on shampoo surfactants
    reported mercantile shampoo products comprised of surfactants, which are resilient
    to biodegradation compared with biodegradable shampoo.[ 104] Varied modifications
    in LAS elimination efficacy through an assortment of industrial detergents have
    revealed that additives like softeners, antibacterial additives, bleaching products,
    and fragrance in detergents can limit the microbial efficiency for biodegradation.[
    105] It has been reported that anaerobic biodegradation of LWW varies analytically
    on the composition of LWW. Many studies used SBR, anaerobic fluidized bed reactor
    (AFBR) for LWW treatment, expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB), and up-flow anaerobic
    sludge blanket (UASB).[ 106–108] Denitrifying microbes in anaerobic batch reaction
    were able to eliminate 99.9% LAS with 97.5 mg L-1 ethanol and 88 mg L-1 nitrates.[
    109] LAS elimination (84%) was observed in an EGSB reactor after the supplementation
    of Fe3+ ions.[ 110, 111] The role of Fe3+ as terminal electron acceptor can produce
    energy and provide microbial growth. In contrast, the microbial activities accountable
    for LAS elimination were found to be inhibiting after supplementing the effluents
    with a sulfide concentration of more than 20 mg L-1.[ 108] LAS mixture and other
    substances present in detergent can produce harmful volatile fatty acids in the
    effluent.[ 112] The presence of xenobiotics as nonionic surfactants was beneficial
    for the decay of LAS through the promotion of microbial growth.[ 113] In the synthetic
    LWW, LAS decay observed was 45% whereas in the actual LWW, 82% decay of LAS was
    reported in a UASB reactor.[ 113] Similarly, a study reported that no influence
    on LAS decay was found in anaerobic bioreactor if there were impurities like metals,
    organic acids, and xenobiotic compounds in sanitary sewage.[ 113] Effluent intensity
    is a major reason for impacting the anaerobic biodegradation efficacy of LWW.[
    113] In a different study, when LAS intensity in LWW was enhanced to 5-36 mg L-1
    in a pilot-scale EGSB reactor (LWW co-digestion with municipal sewage), elimination
    of COD and LAS was found to be 44-61% and 32-71%, respectively. Literature also
    supports the anaerobic degradation efficacy in AFBR through different media.[
    22] The elimination of LAE, organic matters, and LAS was found to be 98%, 40.4%-85.1%,
    and 24.7% 56%, respectively in AFBR.[ 32] In the meantime, 99% elimination of
    LAS and 97% COD removal was obtained after operating AFBR with clay, glass beads,
    activated carbon, and sand with 18 h of HRT.[ 114] The use of wetland to manage
    wastewater has been observed as noteworthy accomplishment as testified in the
    collected works.[ 115] Elimination of 77% LAS in LWW was established in an ideal
    artificial wetland operating at 15 days of HRT and comprising Schoenoplectus americanus
    (an aquatic flowering plant). The treated LWW was targeted for re-utilization
    in gardening. S. americanus was dipped fully in a 40 cm water depth with gravel,
    tezontle, and agave fiber as supports in the prototype synthetic wetland.[ 115]
    During biological treatment there is a formation of foam in the aeration basin
    owing to the presence of surfactants in LWW. The stable foams were generated due
    to the interaction of gas bubbles with hydrophobic particles and surfactants.[
    116] The hydrophobic particles come together at the water-air interface and reinforce
    foam stability.[ 116] If the presence of surfactant causes excessive forming,
    antifoam agents (such as Zeta Airspel 300®, dimethyl siloxane (DMS), silicone
    defoamer, etc.) can be used to minimize foam formation in LWW.[ 117–119] Some
    studies also suggest that foaming can be controlled by reducing the sludge retention
    time (SRT).[ 120, 121] Integrated processes Integrated physical and chemical processes
    As mentioned above, a single technology cannot attain the regulatory limits in
    an economical and eco-friendly manner. The physicochemical procedures combined
    by other treatment processes for the effective management of LWW are depicted
    in Table 7. Combining coagulation with other treatment technologies can enhance
    treatment efficiency of LWW.[ 128] In a study, a combination of bipolar electrocoagulation
    and electro flotation procedure has been reported to treat industrial LWW in an
    electrochemical apparatus.[ 122] The charged hydroxyl-cationic complexes such
    as Al6(OH)153+ and Al7(OH)174+, Al8(OH)20 4+ and Al13O4(OH)247+, were generated
    on the anodic side as a consequence of the hydrolysis and polymerization of Al3+.
    The higher coagulation rate was promoted by the hydroxyl-cationic complexes, while
    the promotion of floc floatation was done by the by-products gases (H2 and O2).[
    122] The same experiment was replicated at a pilot-scale reactor of 1.5 m3 h-1
    treatment capacity with actual LWW from Harbin, China. The pilot-scale reactor
    resulted in 84.80% removal of methylene blue active substances (MBAS) and 95.84%
    removal of COD. In another study, the utilization of ultrasound along with electrocoagulation-and-electroflotation
    cell has been reported for LWW treatment.[ 123] The contaminant level in treated
    LWW was brought down by the combined technique.[ 123] Electrocoagulation/electrofloatation
    process successively operated at the laboratory and large scale for LWW treatment
    was studied by Dimoglo et al.[ 6] Color, surfactant and turbidity could be respectively
    removed up to 90% under the best operating conditions (current density = 5.26 mA
    cm-2, pH = 5.5, and treatment time of 5 min).[ 6] Table 7. Integrated processes
    for LWW treatment. Download CSVDisplay Table Combination of coagulation and chemical
    adsorption has several advantages. The combination of adsorption with electro-coagulation
    has been reported for treatment of industrial LWW.[ 86] In this study, two different
    adsorbents obtained from organic waste (left-over hazelnut shell (HS)) were used:
    polyaniline (PANI/HS) and polypyrrole (PPy/HS). PANI/HS (0.70 USD g-1) resulted
    in COD elimination of 75% while PPy/HS (3.21 USD g-1) resulted in COD removal
    of 20% from LWW.[ 86] Noutsopoulos et al.[ 21] combined three processes for LWW
    management: i) coagulation ii) sequential sand filtration, iii) adsorption using
    activated carbon, iii).[ 21] The combined technique resulted in 85% COD removal.
    The treated LWW met the regulatory standards in Greece for urban utilization,
    irrigation of crop fields and toilet flushing. Combination of coagulation with
    membrane filtration has been reported for LWW treatment.[ 129] Such combination
    has two major benefits: enhanced elimination of natural organic matter (NOM) compounds
    and decrease in membrane clogging.[ 130] Earlier, studies focused on membrane
    filtration for LWW treatment where, UF and reverse osmosis (RO)were widely used.
    A sequential UF followed by RO arrangement resulted in 98.9% COD removal, 99.2%
    BOD5 removal and 75% mineral oil removal from LWW.[ 50] The membrane fouling in
    UF/RO can be reduced to 50% by combination of a pretreatment method.[ 26, 131]
    Membrane clogging can also be reduced through hydraulic washing amid filtration
    rounds. Effective LWW treatment can be obtained by combining coagulation along
    with another removal processes like flotation, membrane filtration, adsorption,
    and flocculation. Such combinations result in a robust, efficient and faster treatment
    process.[ 132] However, the chemical treatment process often generates non-recyclable
    waste that increases the overall costs after treatment. As a result, exploration
    for new alternatives is focused on sustainable, biodegradable, and non-chemical-based
    materials (organic substances). However, intensive research needs to be carried
    out with these materials for elimination of pollutants from LWW. Integrated treatment
    approach using combination of biological and other techniques The most common
    example of physical–biological treatment is membrane bioreactor (MBR).[ 133] There
    are several advantages of MBR: i) it can treat elevated organic loading though
    biological treatment ii) it has advantage of membrane separation process iii)
    ease of automation and iv) requirement of smaller space.[ 134] The domestic-legislated
    release criteria were linked with the efficient treatment of industrial LWW in
    Poland that showed promising results on the MBR efficacy.[ 102] The study testified
    removal of various pollutants in the following range: 95%–98% BOD5, 89%–94% COD,
    55%–71% TP, 32%–84% TN, 98.8%–99.4% nonionic surfactants and 94.5%–99.5% anionic
    surfactants. In a different study, the authors presented a pilot-scale finding
    of side-stream MBR, operating for 4-month period.[ 106] The treated LWW from MBR
    was used for laundry washing cycles.[ 106] The treated LWW from MBR do not require
    further treatment technology like RO. An amalgamation of phytoremediation with
    physicochemical treatment process for LWW treatment was recommended.[ 127] Expending
    plants Kiapu (Pistia stratiotes) and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) were
    used to simplify phytoremediation, followed by adsorption to deal with LWW. It
    was reported that when adsorption functioning reached 50%, the phytoremediation
    process removed 54.3% phosphate, 77.5% COD, and 99.9% surfactants. Apart from
    adsorption, centrifugation also has been recommended to remove SS in LWW that
    may not be eliminated through the phytoremediation process. The authors reported
    that centrifugation of LWW, enhanced the removal of pollutants by microalgal phytoremediation
    (Chlorella variabilis). During the combined treatment, removal of COD, BOD5, TP,
    and TN was observed to be 92%, 91%, 85% and 97%, respectively. Addition of pretreatment
    steps (e.g., flotation, membrane filtration, flocculation, adsorption) is the
    most common method to selectively eliminate pollutants harmful to the MBR unit.
    Economic analysis of LWW treatment Conventional approaches for treating laundry
    wastewater comprise of innumerable arrangements of chemical, physical, and biological
    methods. Concerning high operational expenses of above processes, it is necessary
    to explore cost-effective and efficient techniques.[ 135] Low energy consumption,
    minimum chemical expenditure and reduced installation space should be the criteria
    for these cost-effective techniques. Following are the factors that need to be
    considered for economics of treatment processes: Power consumption Power utilization
    of current wastewater treatment plants varies between 20 and 45 kWh population
    equivalent per year. Smaller plant has lower power expenditure. Generally, cost
    of power consumption is 50% of capital cost of the treatment plants.[ 136] Authors
    reported that the energy consumption for NF is higher (45.5 kWh m-3) as compared
    to EC (1.25 kWh m-3) and thermophilic aerobic membrane reactor (TAMR) (10 kWh
    m-3). The automatic laundry washing services bring about a huge difference in
    power consumption cost of treatment plant. For example, power consumption cost
    of treatment plant is dependent on the variation in the number of annual laundry
    wash cycles, influent temperature set, and type of the washing machine. The common
    washing practices vary from laundry to laundry, which impact the influent quality
    and electricity consumption cost. Japanese families, for instance, require supplementary
    water for washing compared to other countries. European households use lower amount
    of water due to horizontal axis washing machine, leading to more contaminated
    LWW. This may perhaps be a paradigm additionally for further countries, like Japan
    and South Korea, where extreme concentrations of pretreatments and post-treatments
    of laundry are recounted, which depart various of cleaning processes from the
    washer. This directs to the query of washing implementation that is accomplished
    by the washer and uncertainty it is adequate for user requirements. Higher concentrations
    of washing treatments exterior to the washer indicate a depleted concentration
    of washing implementation endowed by the machines. These supplementary practices
    consume furthermore pertinent expanses of water and energy, which are not contemplated
    in the inspection.[ 137] In several studies, it has been reported that energy
    consumption largely depends upon the type of treatment technology used.[ 19, 89,
    138] Figure 4 presents the cost breakdown of different treatment processes used
    for the LWW treatment. The processes like NF and NF combined with RO has high-energy
    consumption cost contribution (9% and 30% respectively), while processes like
    adsorption using GAC and submerged MBR has lower energy consumption cost contribution
    (4% and 4.5% respectively).[ 19, 89, 138] Capital cost of the treatment system
    A study reported that capital cost of LWW treatment plant has increased in the
    previous 15 years due to increase in wastewater recycling rates. Studies show
    that the capital cost is one of the main and largest cost associated with the
    LWW treatment process. Researchers estimated that the capital cost for adsorption,
    NF, NF combined with RO and submerged MBR are 21%, 47%, 27% and 95% respectively.[
    19, 89, 138] From the above data it can easily concluded that the capital cost
    of submerged MBR is high and it requires 95% of the total cost of the LWW treatment
    system.[ 19] In another study Jamil et al.[ 13] designed an LWW treatment system
    by using sand and gravel filter. The treatment unit was able to treat 1.8 m3 of
    LWW on the daily basis. The capital & electricity cost for the system was estimated
    to be 1336 US $ and 6.75 US $ year-1 respectively.[ 13] Operation and maintenance
    cost (O&M) A study implied that data for operation and maintenance costs incorporate
    costs of substances (chemical procurement for operation and maintenance), workforce,
    and electricity for treatment, but it does not include water circulation costs.
    WHO reported O&M cost of $807 million annually in 2007.[ 139] The highest contributor
    of this expenditure was workforce expenses ($302 million), while material and
    energy charges contributed $198 million and $199 million, respectively. Additional
    supplementary expenses were estimated to be $108 million.[ 139] The O&M cost linked
    to the procurement and treatment will be determined by type of treatment technology,
    volume of LWW, and type of water handled.[ 139] In Figure 4, the cost breakdown
    of LWW treatment process shows that the maintenance cost is one of the major cost
    contributors. The treatment process like submerged MBR and NF combined with RO
    requires lower operating cost (0.5% and 23% of total cost), while NF & adsorption
    requires higher operating (64% and 74.5% of total cost) for the operation.[ 19,
    89, 138] Figure 4. Cost breakdown for different LWW treatment processes. Data
    Sources.[ 19, 89, 138] Calculation: The energy cost for adsorption, NF, NF combined
    with RO, and submerged MBR are 4.5%, 9%, 30%, and 4.5%. The capital cost for adsorption,
    NF, NF combined with RO, and submerged MBR are 21%, 27%, 47%, and 95%, respectively.
    The operation and maintenance costs for adsorption, NF, NF combined with RO and
    submerged MBR are 74.5%, 64%, 23%, and 0.5%. Display full size Table 8 presents
    the total cost associated with the different LWW treatment process. Highest treatment
    cost was reported for NF (5 € m-3) while lowest treatment cost was reported for
    sand filtration (0.04 € m-3).[ 19, 89, 138] Table 8. Cost of laundry wastewater
    treatment. Download CSVDisplay Table LWW reuse: role in circular economy Over
    the last years, the main objective of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is treatment
    of wastewater and sewage sludge. However, there is an enhanced demand of the recovery
    of nutrients and recyclable water from wastewater. It allows to modify a WWTP
    into a sustainable technological. A study reported that linear economy model creates
    an annual economic burden of 7.2 trillion euros in Europe.[ 141] The replacement
    of the linear economic model by a circular economy model has several advantages:
    enhanced resource productivity, reduction in waste and decrease in dependency
    on natural resources. As a result, circular economy model can generate a direct
    profit of up to 0.6 trillion euros/year and an indirect profit of up to 1.2 trillion
    euros by 2030. This will lead to 25% cost reduction when compared to the linear
    economy model.[ 141] LWW contains huge amounts of useful resources which can contribute
    to circular economy.[ 142] Among them, treated wastewater (reusable for several
    applications) and wastewater sludge (a valuable source of nutrients). Figure 5
    shows reuse of treated LWW in context of circular economy. Hence, recovering resources
    from LWW can contribute to the concept of circular economy.[ 143, 144] There is
    considerable nutrient content in wastewater sludge: 50-55% carbon, 10%-15% N and
    1%- 3% P, 0.5%-1.5% S.[ 145] As a result, sludge can be used as a resource for
    many products like fertilizer, animal feed etc. This will also counter a serious
    environmental impact by reducing dependency on nonrenewable resources.[ 146, 145]
    Figure 5. Circular economy in laundry wastewater treatment. Source: Original image
    by the author. Display full size Apart from recovering nutrients from treated
    wastewater streams, water reuse is also necessary due to high water requirement
    for industrial and agricultural activities, tacking climate change, urbanization
    and population growth.[ 147] As a result, treated water can reduce the freshwater
    demand for industrial and agricultural uses.[ 148] Under the \"European Green
    Deal\", European Union (EU) proposed an action plan toward zero pollution. The
    target to achieve zero pollution ambition has been set by the year 2050.[ 149]
    The goal of the plan is to decrease pollution up to a level that will no longer
    be considered dangerous to the ecosystem and health.[ 149] Under this action plan,
    they set a target to reduce significantly total waste generation and by 50% residual
    municipal waste generation by 2030.[ 149] The zero-pollution hierarchy follows
    reversing the pyramid of action in which it has been proposed to prevent the pollution
    at the initial level, minimize and control it at the next level and, at the bottom,
    eliminate and remediate it. Under Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, the EU
    plans to recover nutrients from the wastewater and reuse the treated wastewater
    for other purposes.[ 149] The deal also addresses emerging contaminants like microplastics
    and micro-pollutants like pharmaceuticals. The plan also aims to improve water
    quality by reducing microplastic release (by 30%) in the environment.[ 149] Challenges
    and future perspectives Chemical coagulation is one of conventional methods for
    LWW treatment. However, high cost of chemicals, adverse environmental impact and
    handling large volume of sludge are challenges associated with chemical coagulation.
    Bio-flocculants can act as alternative to chemical flocculants. Extensive research
    needs to be done to produce cost-effective flocculants. Electro-coagulation is
    a replacement for chemical coagulation and has several benefits: easy & cost-effective
    process, environment-friendly, flexible, competent, and broad-spectrum (being
    capable to eliminate concurrently various kinds of contaminants). However, cathode
    passivation and electrode degradation may happen that diminishes the efficiency
    of electrocoagulation. Besides, additional research works need to be performed
    to accomplish high performance in electrocoagulation through statistical modeling
    and computational fluid dynamics. To tackle the challenge of passivation and short
    operation time, the suitable electrode material can be investigated, which can
    provide better treatment efficiency and less passivation. Another strategy could
    be the addition of continuous coagulant dose while maintaining the cell potential
    low during extended EC operations. Using alternative current (AC) supply, polarity
    reversal, ultra-sonification, and increasing the flow velocity to increase the
    scouring could be another solution. Membrane filtration is commonly used for LWW
    treatment. The major shortfall in membrane filtration is membrane fouling, which
    occurs when the particles are accumulated on the surface and/or within the pores
    of the membrane, which demands repeated washing to re-establish the permeate flux
    and utilizes more energy at high pressures. Membrane filtration is unable to remove
    surfactants from LWW as per the desired limits. To resolve above problems, solutions
    like hydrodynamic operation (controlling turbulence flow), pretreatment techniques,
    and membrane surface modifications can be employed to treat LWW as per desired
    limits. In the combined treatment systems, a pre-filtration technique (by means
    of sand filtration or a bag filter) followed by membrane filtration using ceramic
    membranes could be the basis of a process able to reduce clogging issues during
    LWW treatment. Adsorption for LWW management is considered as an efficient and
    cost-effective technique. However, high cost of commercial adsorbents and high
    regeneration cost (due to high temperature, high volume of solvents) are major
    disadvantages of this technology. Low-cost adsorbents need to be produced from
    agricultural wastes and tested at laboratory scale. Effective regeneration of
    adsorbents can be one of the solutions to reduce the overall cost of the adsorption
    process and minimize the use of costly adsorbents. Combined remediation strategies
    like biological, physicochemical, or integrated processes can be used to treat
    LWW treat as per the required limits. MBR is a combined method, capable of treating
    LWW with high removal of pollutants. However, it has high capital cost and energy
    expenditure. Also, due to membrane clogging in MBR, there is high operational
    cost due to repetitive washing and replacement of membranes. Additional pretreatment
    steps (e.g., flotation, membrane filtration, adsorption, and/or flocculation)
    are the most common procedure to selectively eliminate pollutants harmful for
    the MBR unit. However, this will enhance the overall operating cost and affect
    environmental footprint of the treatment process. Also, developing and underdeveloped
    countries may not have required infrastructure or resources to install this type
    of technology. Intensive research is required to develop LWW treatment processes,
    which are cost-effective, ecological, and acceptable to the community and can
    meet the permissible limits for water reuse. Conclusion Due to rapid urbanization,
    large amount of untreated LWW effluents is discharged into sewage lines, which
    imparts load on wastewater treatment plants. Surfactants (like LAS), nitrate,
    COD, BOD, phosphate, SS, turbidity, and sulfates are the chief impurities in LWW.
    Besides, additional tiny aggregates of volatile acids, alkalinity, fabric, deodorizing
    agents, food, non-biodegradables, body fluids, a limited concentration of metals
    (Zn, Cd, Cu, Fe) and different xenobiotic organic compounds are present in LWW.
    Proper management of LWW can create a concept of circular economy, resulting in
    reclaimed water for many useful purposes, such as irrigation, construction, car
    washing, toilet flushing etc. Based on literature review it seems that a single
    treatment process is not sufficient to treat LWW up to acceptable reuse standards.
    To that end, different treatment chains have been proposed: i) hybrid processes
    combining membrane filtration with adsorption; ii) advanced oxidation process
    using ultraviolet (UV) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); iii) coagulation-flocculation
    combined with sand filtration; iv) combination of ozonation process, adsorption,
    and ultrafiltration (UF) techniques. By use of appropriate treatment technology,
    the freshwater supply dependency can be reduced, leading to the minimization of
    freshwater consumption cost. Data availability statement Data sharing not applicable

  description: 'Yield gap (Yg) analysis is useful to map the scope for sustainable
    intensification of agriculture, but explaining and quantifying the underlying
    causes of yield gaps remains a considerable challenge. The objective of this study
    was to decompose maize yield gaps under different nitrogen (N) application rates
    and soil quality conditions across irrigated and rainfed cropping systems in China.
    A comprehensive database consisting of 5228 on-farm trials located in three major
    maize production regions of China was used for this purpose. The on-farm trials
    contained detailed information for four different treatments: fertilizer omission
    (control), optimal N rate (optimal N), 50% of optimal N rate (low N) and 150%
    of optimal N rate (high N). These were combined with biophysical and yield potential
    data from the Global Yield Gap Atlas (http://yieldgap.org). An analytical framework
    integrating stochastic frontier analysis and principles of production ecology
    was applied to decompose the overall maize yield gap into components of efficiency
    (and respective management and soil quality effects, Yg-M and Yg-S), resource
    (Yg-R), and technology Yg (Yg-T). The potential yield (Yp) of irrigated maize
    averaged 14.5 Mg/ha in Northeast China (NE) and 11.9 Mg/ha for North China Plain
    (NCP), and the water-limited potential yield (Yw) of rainfed maize averaged 12.0
    Mg/ha in NE and 10.5 Mg/ha in Southwest China (SW), respectively. Maize yield
    gaps were highly variable across N treatments and cropping systems and ranged
    between 27–56% of Yp or Yw. Larger absolute yield gaps were observed in irrigated
    cropping systems in NE (4.8–8.1 Mg/ha) than in NCP (3.8–6.1 Mg/ha) and in rainfed
    cropping systems in NE (3.6–6.7 Mg/ha) and SW (2.8–5.9 Mg/ha). The components
    of the yield gap differed in size across cropping systems and N treatments. Yg-T
    was fairly small and consistent across N treatments ranging between 7.0% and 12.0%
    of Yp for irrigated maize and only ca. 2.0% of Yw for rainfed maize in NE. Yg-R
    was strongly associated with the N treatment explaining between 16.0–26.0% of
    Yp (or Yw) for control and low N treatments and being close to negligible for
    the optimal and high N treatments. Yg-M due to inefficient crop management accounted
    for 6.0–14.0% of Yp (or Yw) across cropping systems and N treatments, which is
    equivalent to 0.7–1.8 Mg/ha. The Yg-S explained the largest proportion of the
    total yield gap, especially in trials with low and medium soil quality levels,
    accounting for 11.0–24.0% of Yp or Yw (1.3–3.1 Mg/ha). The Yg-S was linked to
    partly manageable soil properties, such as low soil organic matter contents and
    low available P and/or K. This study is one of the first to incorporate the effects
    of soil quality in yield gap analysis and provides a basis to target management
    practices that can improve soil quality and N use efficiency while narrowing maize
    yield gaps in China.'

    yield gap atlas 1. Introduction Maize (Zea mays L.) is the main food staple in
    the world contributing to 24% of the world’s agricultural calories (Tilman et
    al., 2011). China is one of the largest maize producers accounting for 21% of
    the global cultivated area and 23% of the total grain maize production (FAO, 2019).
    With the projected economic and population growth by 2030, demand for maize in
    China is expected to increase by 47% compared with maize production of 2012 (Chen
    et al., 2014). Further increases in cereal production must come from increased
    yields per unit area rather than from area expansion (Fan et al., 2012). This
    can be achieved through genetic improvement of crop yield potential (Godfray et
    al., 2010) or through narrowing yield gaps (Yg), the difference between the potential
    yield (Yp) and the actual yield observed in farmers’ fields (van Ittersum and
    Rabbinge, 1997; van Ittersum et al., 2013; Fischer, 2015; Lobell et al., 2009).
    Substantial progress has been made to estimate the magnitude and variability of
    the yield gaps for the major cereal crops in China using crop modeling and field
    experiments (Liu et al., 2017; Meng et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2012; An et al.,
    2018). The Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA; http://yieldgap.org) developed a standard
    approach to estimate yield gaps from local to regional scale (van Ittersum et
    al., 2013; Van Wart et al., 2013). Currently, yield gaps of irrigated and rainfed
    maize are estimated 35–42% of Yp (Liu et al., 2017; http://yieldgap.org). Yet,
    explaining and quantifying the underlying causes behind yield gaps remains a challenge
    as it requires many on-farm trials and associated data and the use of different
    methodologies (Lobell et al., 2009; Beza et al., 2017). Suboptimal crop management
    practices (e.g., sowing date, plant density, tillage, fertilization, irrigation)
    were identified as major causes of yield gaps in cereal production systems (van
    Ittersum et al., 2013; Hochman and Horan, 2018; Mueller et al., 2012; Chen et
    al., 2014; An et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2017a, 2017b). Nitrogen (N) is one of
    most important yield-limiting factors in cereal cropping systems around the world
    (Cassman et al., 2003). Chinese agriculture has serious problems of over-application
    and low use efficiency of N fertilizer (Zhang et al., 2012; Fan et al., 2012;
    Chen et al., 2014). For example, the N rate applied to summer maize by farmers
    in North China Plain (NCP) was on average 260 kg N/ha, which was more than 100
    kg N/ha greater than the estimated economically optimal N rate (ca. 160 kg N/ha)
    in this region (Cui et al., 2008). However, there is an enormous variation in
    the total N application rates in farmers’ fields, ranging from 50 to 500 kg N/ha
    across maize cropping systems in China (Zhang et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2018).
    Thus, it is essential to assess the linkages between existing yield gaps and sub-optimal
    N management. It is recognized that soil quality could be a key cause of yield
    gaps (Fermont et al., 2009; Tittonell and Giller, 2013; Beza et al., 2017; An
    et al., 2018; Di Mauro et al., 2018). However, there is little quantitative understanding
    on how soil quality may interact with or constrain yield gap closure. Crop productivity
    is a net result of complex interactions between genotype, environment (climate
    and soil), and crop management (van Ittersum and Rabbinge, 1997; Cassman, 1999),
    and it is difficult to isolate the relative importance of soil properties from
    other factors. Secondly, many soil properties, including native fixed attributes
    (e.g., soil type and soil texture) and more dynamic soil fertility factors (e.g.,
    soil organic matter (SOM) and soil nutrients), interact with each other and impact
    crop growth and yield with both trade-offs and compensating effects. Previous
    studies proposed a quantification of a soil quality yield gap (An et al., 2018),
    however, linking soil quality-derived yield gaps to easily manageable and key
    soil properties is critical to move towards identifying concrete management practices
    to narrow yield gaps. Thus, there remains a need for an integrated conceptual
    and analysis framework accommodating the contributions of sub-optimal crop management
    and soil quality to yield gaps. The objective of this study was to assess the
    contribution of N management and soil quality to yield gaps of irrigated and rainfed
    maize in China. We build upon an existing framework (Silva et al., 2017a, 2017b)
    for decomposing yield gaps into their efficiency (Yg-E), resource (Yg-R) and technology
    (Yg-T) components. That framework was expanded to further disentangle the efficiency
    yield gap into its crop management (Yg-M) and soil quality components (Yg-S).
    Here, soil quality is defined as the capacity of the soil to provide nutrients
    and water and the capacity of the crop to access these and support crop productivity
    (Bünemann et al., 2018). Yield gaps and their intermediate components, including
    soil quality, were quantified for specific climate zones (CZ) and soil types.
    It is hypothesized that maize yield gaps in China can be mostly attributed to
    the Yg-S, in view of the intensive crop management practices and soils with low
    quality properties across the major maize cropping systems in the country. A large
    database of on-farm trials (n = 5228) with four different N treatments conducted
    in different soil quality levels during the period 2006–2012 was analyzed for
    this purpose. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Theoretical framework to disentangle
    yield gaps A theoretical framework considering five different yield levels and
    four intermediate yield gaps was used to disentangle maize yield gaps in China
    (Fig. 1). In this approach, yield gaps are specific for a well-defined biophysical
    environment (i.e., unique year, climate zone and soil textural class) and explained
    by sub-optimal management of N and of other inputs referring to limiting (water
    and other nutrients) and reducing factors (pests, diseases, and weeds), and/or
    soil conditions. The Yp is defined as the maximum theoretical yield of a specific
    crop genotype when grown in a well-defined biophysical environment under non-limiting
    water and nutrient supply and biotic stresses effectively controlled (van Ittersum
    and Rabbinge, 1997). Yw is defined similarly to Yp with the difference that crop
    growth is limited by water supply. Yp and Yw are the benchmarks for irrigated
    and rainfed cropping systems, respectively. The highest experimental yield (YHE)
    refers to the yields achieved with optimum N input and with very high soil quality
    (see definition below) within a given year × climate zone × soil type combination.
    The technical efficient yield (YTEx) reflects the maximum yield that can be achieved
    with a given observed amount of inputs and in trials with very high soil quality
    levels. The soil-efficient yield (YSEx) refer to the highest possible yields obtained
    with a given amount of N and a given soil quality level. The experimental yield
    (Yexp) reflects the productivity measured in the on-farm trials for different
    N treatments. Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Theoretical framework to decompose yield gaps in a well-defined
    biophysical environment (i.e., unique climate zone and soil textural class). The
    potential yield (Yp) and water-limited yield (Yw) are the biophysical benchmarks
    for irrigated and rainfed crop production systems, respectively. The highest experimental
    yield (YHE) refers to the highest yield achieved with optimal inputs and crop
    management under favorable soil quality. The technical efficient yield (YTEx)
    refers to the maximum experimental yield for a given input level and under favorable
    soil quality. The soil efficient yield (YSEx) refers to the maximum yield for
    a given input and soil quality level. The experimental yield (Yexp) reflects the
    productivity recorded in on-farm trials. It is assumed that the observed yield
    gap could be attributed to low soil quality, crop management imperfections and/or
    sub-optimal amount of inputs applied. Yg-M stands for management yield gap, Yg-S
    for soil quality yield gap, Yg-R for resource yield gap and Yg-T for technology
    yield gap. The efficiency yield gap refers to the sum of Yg-M and Yg-S. Four intermediate
    yield gaps can be computed based on the aforementioned yield levels.The efficiency
    yield gap (Yg-E) is defined as the difference between YTEx and Yexp and indicates
    sub-optimal timing, spacing and form of crop management practices and low soil
    quality in the on-farm trials (Silva et al., 2017a, 2017b). This yield gap is,
    in this study, attributed to crop management imperfections (Yg-M) and/or low soil
    quality (Yg-S). The experimental yield in nutrient omission plots was treated
    as an indicator of soil quality (Fan et al., 2013;Tittonell and Giller, 2013).
    For soil properties, intrinsic properties (e.g., soil texture) were used to define
    specific climate-soil zones (see below Section 2.3.1.) and manageable soil fertility
    factors were considered as explanatory factors of the Yg-S. As a result, Yg-S
    in the current study is attributed to differences in soil properties that can
    be managed by farmers mostly through long-term soil management practices that
    can ensure adequate soil pH, soil organic matter and soil nutrients for nutrient
    uptake and plant growth. The resource yield gap (Yg-R) is defined as the difference
    between YHE and YTEx and indicates the potential to increase yields in the short-term
    due to increases in the amount of N inputs applied in fields with very high soil
    quality in a given growing season (Fig. 1). Yg-R is expected to decrease with
    increasing N fertilizer rates and thus to be smaller in the N treatments with
    optimal N rates tested in on-farm trials. The technology yield gap (Yg-T) refers
    to the difference between Yp or Yw and YHE and it can be explained by a lack of
    technologies able to reach Yp or Yw (e.g., precision farming or full pest and
    disease control). Yg-T can also be attributed to sub-optimal input use if the
    amount of inputs observed in the on-farm trials underlying YHE are smaller than
    that needed for Yp or Yw. On-farm trials tested different N application rates
    and followed best crop management practices at local level. Hence, our analysis
    does not fully capture actual yields and farmers’ management practices. As a result,
    the Yg-M and Yg-R reflect yield gaps caused mostly by inefficient N management
    practices. 2.2. Database of on-farm fertilizer trials 2.2.1. Maize-based cropping
    systems Maize-based cropping systems in China were classified as irrigated and
    rainfed based on climatic and hydrological conditions. Field trials of irrigated
    maize were located in two main agroecological zones, namely Northeast China (NE)
    and NCP. For rainfed maize, field trials were located in NE and Southwest China
    (SW). Irrigated and rainfed maize in NE were grown as a single crop in a year
    from April to October. Irrigated maize in NCP was grown from June to October and
    rotated with winter wheat in the same year. Rainfed maize in SW was grown from
    March to July either as single crop or rotated with wheat, oilseed rape or potato
    in the same year. In total, these regions and cropping systems account for more
    than 90% of total harvested area and production of maize in China (National Bureau
    of Statistics of China, 2017). An overview of the cropping systems, geographical
    location and provinces covered is shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res

    irrigated conditions in North China Plain (NCP), under rainfed conditions in Southwest
    China (SW), and under both irrigated and rainfed conditions in Northeast China
    (NE). 2.2.2. Crop data and fertilizer treatments Data on maize yield, fertilizer
    application and soil properties for each cropping system were obtained from on-farm
    trials conducted under the auspices of national soil test and fertilizer recommendation
    projects during the period 2006−2012. The on-farm trials included four treatments:
    fertilizer omission (control), optimal nitrogen (N) rate (optimal N), 50% of optimal
    N rate (low N) and 150% of optimal N rate (high N). Plots with fertilizer omission
    received neither organic amendments (i.e., manure and crop residues) nor mineral
    fertilizer. The optimal N rates were recommended by agricultural scientists or
    local agricultural extension officers based on economic criteria and the soil
    nutrient conditions. The optimal amounts of P2O5 and K2O were applied and kept
    constant in all treatments, except control plots which did not receive P and K.
    Best management practices in relation to cultivar, sowing date and density and
    supplementary irrigation (in irrigated cropping systems) were used in the trials.
    The final database contained data for 3115 on-farm trials in irrigated (n = 1609
    in NE and n = 1506 in NCP), and 2113 trials in rainfed (n = 1022 in NE and n =
    1091 in SW) maize-based cropping systems in China. 2.2.3. Biophysical conditions

    in Table 1. Weather data during the growing season were obtained for each on-farm
    trial in the county or municipality where the trial was conducted from the Chinese
    Meteorological Administration (http://data.cma.cn). These included daily mean
    temperature (Tave), maximum (Tmax) and minimum temperatures (Tmin), precipitation
    (PRE) and sunshine duration (SSD). Sunshine duration was converted into daily
    solar radiation (RAD) using the WeatherAid module in the Hybrid-Maize model (Yang
    et al., 2004; http://www.hybridmaize.unl.edu/). The growing degree days (GDD)
    were calculated as an annual sum of daily mean temperatures over a base temperature
    of 10 °C during the crop growing period (Ramankutty et al., 2002). Table 1. Descriptive

    soil organic matter (SOM), soil total nitrogen (TN), soil available phosphorus
    (Olsen-P) and potassium (Avail-K) and pH. All soil parameters were measured from
    topsoil samples taken at a depth of 0–20 cm. SOM was analyzed with the potassium
    dichromate volumetric method (digested by K2Cr2O7-sulfuric acid (H2SO4)) and TN
    with the Kjeldahl method (digested by H2SO4 and cupric sulfate-sodium sulfate
    (CuSO4-Na2SO4) as the catalyst agent). Olsen-P was determined with the Olsen method,
    and Avail-K was analyzed with a flame photometer following extraction with 1 M
    ammonium acetate (NH4OAc). Soil pH was measured using a glass electrode in a 1:2.5
    soil/water (H2O) suspension. Soil texture was expressed in three levels, namely
    sandy soil, loamy soil and clay soil determined by the relative proportion of
    clay, sand and silt particles. 2.3. Yield gap analysis 2.3.1. Climate-soil zones
    Spatially explicit data from the Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA, www.yieldgap.org)
    were linked to the database of on-farm trials based on the GPS coordinates of
    each trial. These data included simulated potential and water-limited yields (as
    explained in Section 2.3.2), climate zones (van Wart et al., 2013) and other biophysical
    information (e.g., soil type). The climate zones consist of a matrix of three
    climate variables namely GDD with base temperature of 0℃, temperature seasonality,
    quantified as the standard deviation of monthly average temperatures, and annual
    aridity index (AI), calculated as the annual total precipitation divided by annual
    total potential evapotranspiration (van Wart et al., 2013). Irrigated maize trials
    were located in nine climate zones in NE and seven climate zones in NCP, rainfed
    maize trials were located in nine climate zones in NE and eight climate zones
    in SW. Within each climate zone, arable land was further divided into three climate-soil
    zones based on soil texture types (sandy soil, loamy soil, and clay soil). In
    total, irrigated maize trials were located in 27 and 21 climate-soil zones in,
    respectively, NE and NCP and, rainfed maize trials were located in 27 and 21 climate-soil
    zones in NE and SW, respectively. 2.3.2. Yield potential Yp and Yw were simulated
    with the Hybrid-Maize model following the protocols of GYGA (Liu et al., 2017).
    As an exception, Yw was expressed as YHE for rainfed maize cropping systems of
    SW because YHE in this region was consistently greater than the simulated Yw.
    The reasons for the low Yw in this region are discussed in the Supplementary Material
    (Fig S1; Table S1) but mostly refer to the fact that the on-farm trials analyzed
    in this study are only representative of the high yielding areas in SW while the
    simulations of Yw in GYGA cover a wider range of biophysical and management conditions.
    2.3.3. Technical efficiency yields and efficiency yield gap Stochastic frontier
    analysis (Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000) was used to estimate the production frontier
    and the efficiency yield gap. Quantitative input-output data for unique combinations
    of field × climate zone × year × soil type × cropping system were used for this
    purpose. The production frontier was assumed to follow a translog functional form,
    which mathematical formulation is as follows: (1) (2) vit ∼ N(0, sigmav2) (3)
    uit ∼ N+(mu, sigmau2) (4) (5) where the yit is the maize yield from on-farm trials
    in climate-soil zone i and year t. The vector of biophysical and management variables,
    xk, and N (N fertiliser rate), is designed to capture growth-defining and -limiting
    factors (van Ittersum and Rabbinge, 1997). SQit is a categorical variable expressing
    different soil quality levels and was constructed based on the experimental yields
    in the control treatment (see further explanation below). The continuous variables
    y, xk and N were mean-scaled and log-transformed prior to the analysis. The random
    errors vit capture the influence of random noise and are assumed to be independently
    and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to a normal distribution with mean
    0 and variance sigmav2 (Eq. 2). The non-negative random errors uit capture the
    technical inefficiency due to sub-optimal crop management or soil quality and
    are assumed to be identically distributed but according to a half-normal distribution
    truncated at 0 with mean mu and variance sigma u2 (Eq. 3). Finally, α0, βk, θkj,
    δk and λk are parameters to be estimated using maximum likelihood as implemented
    in the sfa() function of the “frontier” package in R (Coelli and Henningsen, 2013).
    The growth-defining factors considered in xk were growing-degree days (℃) and
    solar radiation (MJ/m2) during the growing season and two dummy variables for
    climate zones and year. The variables considered as growth-limiting factors were
    the rainfall in the growing season (mm), the amount of N fertilizer applied, soil
    type expressed as a categorical variable with three levels (sandy soil, loamy
    soil, and clay soil) and soil quality of each on-farm trial. The soil quality
    level of each trial was constructed based on the experimental yields of the fertilizer
    omission plots (control treatment) and had four levels (very high, high, medium,
    and low). On-farm trials with very high soil quality level were identified as
    the ones with the top 10th percentile experimental yields in the control treatment
    in a given climate zone × year × soil type × region combination. A similar approach
    was followed to identify on-farm trials with high (experimental yields in the
    control treatment between 60th and 90th percentiles), medium (experimental yields
    in the control treatment between 30th and 60th percentiles) and low soil quality
    level (experimental yields in the control treatment below the 30th percentile).
    Therefore, and by definition, we expect Yg-S to be greater in on-farm trials with
    low, medium and high soil quality levels than in on-farm trials with very high
    soil quality levels, where Yg-S is negligible. YTEx was estimated by fitting the
    stochastic frontier model (Eq. 1–3) to on-farm trials with very high soil quality
    level to predict the maximum yields that could be achieved with the various N
    inputs. This was done with the fitted() function in R by using the estimated production
    frontiers for each maize cropping system (cf. Table 2), rather than using Eq.
    5 as in Silva et al. (2017a, 2017b). For the fitting procedure, the soil quality
    dummy was set to very high soil quality and all other variables were kept as in
    the original database. This allows us to quantify the yield differences between
    different soil quality levels, for a given N treatment and maize cropping system
    (cf. Fig. 1). YSEx and the Yg-M were estimated with Eq. 4 and 5. Yg-S was the
    difference between YTEx (i.e., the frontier yield under very high soil quality
    level) and the YSEx predicted for high, medium and low soil quality level. Table

    Highest experimental yields, resource yield gap and technology yield gap The resource
    yield gap (Yg-R) was quantified as the difference between YHE and YTEx for unique
    combinations of individual years and climate-soil zones. Therefore, the YHE was
    estimated by averaging the YTEx with optimal N fertilizer rate and very high soil
    quality level (cf. Fig. 1). Yg-T was thus calculated as the difference between
    Yp (or Yw) and YHE for irrigated (rainfed) cropping systems, while controlling
    for individual years and climate-soil zones. Crop model simulations were used
    for maize cropping systems in NE and NCP. It was not possible to quantify Yg-T
    in the SW because YHE was consistently greater than the simulated Yw (see Section
    2.3.2 and further information about the reasons behind this in the Supplementary
    Material). 2.4. Soil properties for different soil quality levels Differences
    in soil chemical properties namely SOM, TN, Olsen-P, Avail-K and pH were assessed
    across fields with different soil quality levels in order to link manageable soil
    fertility factors to Yg-S as a means to identify concrete management practices
    to narrow soil quality yield gaps. For this purpose, linear mixed-effects models
    were estimated considering soil factors in their absolute values as the dependent
    variables, soil quality as a fixed effect and climate zone and year treated as
    random effects. The linear mixed-effects models were fitted using the R function
    lme() in the package “nlme” (Pinheiro et al., 2015). Differences between groups
    were considered statistically significant at 5% significance level. 3. Results
    3.1. Magnitude and variability of maize yield gaps The Yp of irrigated maize in
    NE averaged 14.5 Mg/ha and was greater than in NCP (11.9 Mg/ha, Fig. 3). The Yw
    of rainfed maize in NE (12.0 Mg/ha) was greater than YHE, a proxy for Yw, in SW
    (10.5 Mg/ha). Yexp were highly heterogeneous across and within cropping systems,
    with ranges of 2.0–16.6 Mg/ha (Fig. 3). Across N treatments, Yexp were on average
    6.4–9.8 Mg/ha, 5.8–8.1 Mg/ha, 6.1–9.3 Mg/ha and 4.7–7.8 Mg/ha for irrigated maize
    in NE and NCP, and rainfed maize in NE and SW, respectively. Download : Download

    Yp of rainfed maize in SW is not shown in figure, as explained in the Supplementary
    Material. Each bar corresponds to an individual field-year combination. The red,
    dark green and light green portions of the bars indicate Yp, Yw and Yexp, respectively.
    Yexp indicates experimental yield achieved in plots with fertilizer omission (control),
    optimal nitrogen rate (optimal N), 50 % of optimal N rate (low N) and 150 % of
    optimal N rate (high N) treatments. Horizontal lines indicate average Yp (solid
    lines), Yw (long-dashed lines), and Yexp (short-dashed lines) (For interpretation
    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article). There were large variations in maize yield gaps
    across N fertilizer treatments (Fig. 3) with a coefficient of variation of 46.8%
    in NE and 38.0% in NCP for irrigated maize systems, and 55.3% in NE and 51.4%
    in SW for rainfed maize systems (Fig. 3). Across the four maize cropping systems,
    yield gaps were on average 5.9 to 8.1 Mg/ha, 3.6–5.8 Mg/ha, 2.8–4.8 Mg/ha and
    3.1–5.1 Mg/ha for control, low N, optimal N and high N treatments, respectively
    (Fig. 3). Experimental yields, Yexp, were 44.0–68.0%, 59.0–65.0%, 68.0–73.0% and
    65.0–72.0% of Yp or Yw for control, low N, optimal N and high N treatments, respectively
    (Fig. 3). The yield gap in the optimal N treatment was on average 4.6 Mg/ha and
    3.8 Mg/ha in irrigated maize cropping systems for NE and NCP, and 2.7 Mg/ha and
    2.8 Mg/ha in rainfed maize cropping systems for NE and SW (Fig. 4), which was
    less than that in the treatments with no, low, and high N. This shows N rates
    in the optimal fertilizer treatment are generally sufficient to narrow yield gaps
    in the cropping systems studied. Download : Download high-res image (473KB) Download

    efficiency (Yg-S), resource (Yg-R) and technology (Yg-T) yield gaps for different
    N treatments of irrigated maize cropping systems in Northeast China (NE) and North
    China Plain (NCP), and rainfed maize cropping systems in Northeast China (NE)
    and Southwest China (SW). Data are averaged across soil quality levels. Yexp variability
    across all N treatments was associated with biophysical conditions and crop management
    practices and ca. 70% of the variation observed in Yexp could be explained by
    the biophysical and management variables included in the stochastic frontier model
    (Table 2). The dummy “CZ”and“year” were both statistically significant in all
    maize cropping systems, indicating that climate zone and the year-specific weather
    have a considerable effect on Yexp. However, climatic variables showed different
    effects on Yexp across the different cropping systems. For example, the effect
    of precipitation on Yexp was positive for irrigated maize of NE, but negative
    for irrigated maize in NCP and rainfed maize in NE. Soil type significantly affected
    Yexp in both irrigated and rainfed maize cropping systems of NE, in which Yexp
    was significantly greater in sandy soils than in clay and loamy soils for irrigated
    maize while the opposite was true for rainfed maize. The positive significant
    effect of N rates and soil quality on Yexp indicates that Yexp was greater in
    treatments with greater amounts of N applied and in plots with higher soil quality
    (i.e., greatest yields in the control treatment). For all maize cropping systems,
    yield responses to N decreased with increasing levels of soil quality as indicated
    by statistically significant interaction between N fertilizer rates and soil quality
    (Table 2). The significant positive effects of N rates and soil quality on Yexp
    were also observed when the stochastic frontier models were fitted to a subset
    of the data excluding the nutrient omission plots (see Supplementary Material,
    Table S3). Yet, yield responses to N in soils with high soil quality became not
    significantly different from yield responses to N in soils with very high soil
    quality for all cropping systems. Similarly, yield responses to N in soils with
    moderate soil quality were not significantly different from yield responses to
    N in soils with very high soil quality for rainfed maize in NE and SW, while for
    the irrigated maize in NE yield responses to N in soils with low soil quality
    were not significantly different from yield responses to N in soils with very
    high soil quality. 3.2. Decomposition of maize yield gaps across N fertilizer
    rates The parameter estimates of maize production frontiers in Table 2 show that
    the inclusion of two random errors (vit and uit, see Eq 1) is appropriate for
    all cropping systems. This is indicated by the gamma (γ) values which were relatively
    close to 1 (Table 2), meaning that most of the unexplained variability in Yexp
    can be attributed to the efficiency yield gap (uit) rather than to statistical
    noise (vit). The components of the yield gap differed in size across cropping
    systems and N treatments (Fig. 4). Yg-T was fairly small across N treatments ranging
    between 7.0% and 12.0% of Yp for irrigated maize in NE and NCP, and ca. 2.0% of
    Yw for rainfed maize in NE. This translates into 0.3–1.5 Mg/ha across maize cropping
    systems and N treatments. Yg-R was, evidently, related to N treatments. For instance,
    it accounted for 17.4–27.0% (1.9–2.8 Mg/ha) and 5.6–9.8% (0.7 – 0.9 Mg/ha) of
    Yp (or Yw) for control and low N treatments, respectively. However, Yg-R was very
    small to nil for optimized N and high N treatments in the different cropping systems.
    Yg-S was substantial in all cropping systems: 17.4–24.1%, 10.7–14.7%, 10.5–16.1%
    and 10.8–16.2% of Yp (or Yw) for control, low N, optimal N and high N treatments,
    respectively (Fig. 4; Table S2). This is equivalent to 1.3–3.3 Mg/ha in absolute
    terms. Yg-S was 16.1–22.8%, 10.5–17.4%, 14.7–24.1% and 13.3–22.2% of Yp (or Yw)
    for irrigated maize in NE and NCP, and rainfed maize in NE and SW, respectively
    (Fig. 4). Yg-M was still large but consistent across cropping systems and N treatments
    (6.0–14.0% of Yp or Yw, which is equivalent to 0.7–1.8 Mg/ha). 3.3. Soil quality
    contribution to maize yield gaps The yield gap decomposition in the optimal N
    treatment across different soil quality levels is presented in Fig. 5. The total
    yield gap decreased from about 40% of Yp (or Yw) to less than 20% from low to
    very high soil quality levels (Fig. 5). Yg-S varied from 17.7 to 26.9% of Yp (or
    Yw) in low soil quality level to 11.5–18.5% in medium soil quality level and 6.0–10.2%
    in high soil quality level across maize cropping systems (Fig. 5). Based on our
    framework, Yg-S in on-farm trials with very high soil quality levels was nil by
    definition. The relative values of Yg-S are equivalent to 2.1–3.7 Mg/ha, 1.4–2.7
    Mg/ha and 0.7–1.4 Mg/ha for low, medium, and high soil quality levels, respectively.
    Conversely, Yg-M, Yg-R and Yg-T were similar for the different soil quality levels,
    accounting for 7.8–14.1%, 0–3.3% and 3.3–12.3% of Yp (or Yw) across maize cropping
    systems, respectively. Results for other N rates are provided in the Supplementary
    Material (Figures S4, S5, S6) and were similar to those reported for the optimal
    N treatments. Across soil quality levels, Yg-S showed ranges of 9.6–25.8%, 6.0–17.7%,
    9.9–22.1% and 10.2–26.9% of Yp (or Yw) for irrigated maize in NE and NCP, and
    rainfed maize in NE and SW, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (447KB)

    North China Plain (NCP), and rainfed maize cropping systems in Northeast China
    (NE) and Southwest China (SW). Data for the other N treatments are provided in
    Supplementary Material. Significant differences in soil properties such as SOM,
    TN, Olsen-P, available K and pH, were found for different soil quality levels
    in all maize cropping systems (Table 3). Lower SOM and Avail-K content were found
    in trials with irrigated maize in NE on medium and low soil quality levels (SOM,
    25.5–25.6 g/kg; Avail-K, 141.7–148.1 mg/kg) compared with trials with very high
    and high soil quality levels (SOM, 25.7–27.2 g/kg; Avail-K, 151.1–157.3 mg/kg).
    Olsen-P was similar for trials with very high, high and medium soil quality levels
    (20.3–21.1 mg/kg), but significantly lower in trials with low soil quality levels
    (19.1 mg/kg). For irrigated maize in NCP, SOM contents in trials with very high
    and high soil quality levels (SOM, 15.9 g/kg) were significantly greater than
    those in trials with medium and low soil quality levels (SOM, 14.4–15.2 g/kg),
    and Olsen-P in trials with low soil quality levels (20.8 mg/kg) was significantly
    lower than in trials with higher soil quality levels (22.5–24.1 mg/kg). For rainfed
    maize in NE, SOM contents in trials with very high soil quality level (SOM, 30.9
    g/kg) were significantly greater than those in trials with low soil quality level
    (SOM, 29.1 g/kg); and Olsen-P and Avail-K were similar in trials with high, medium
    and low soil quality levels (Olsen-P, 24.2–26.1 mg/kg; Avail-K, 138.3–144.3 mg/kg),
    but lower than in trials with very high soil quality level (Olsen-P, 30.4 mg/kg;
    Avail-K, 161.7 mg/kg). For rainfed maize in SW, only Olsen-P significantly increased
    from 17.0 mg/kg with low soil quality level to 20.44 mg/kg with very high soil
    quality level; and Avail-K was similar in trials with very high, high, and medium
    soil quality levels, but lower in trials with low soil quality level (111.4 mg/kg).

    yield gaps in China Maize yield gaps were estimated and decomposed for the main
    maize cropping systems (irrigated and rainfed) in China. Thousands of on-farm
    trials conducted with four different applied fertilizer treatments were linked
    to biophysical data and to simulated Yp and Yw available from the Global Yield
    Gap Atlas (www.yieldgap.org). Results indicate that maize yield gaps ranged from
    2.8 to 8.1 Mg/ha across N treatments and maize cropping systems (Fig. 4). In absolute
    terms, yield gaps in irrigated maize cropping systems were greater than those
    in rainfed maize cropping systems (Fig. 4). In relative terms (experimental yields
    as a percentage of Yp or Yw), yield gaps were similar across maize cropping systems
    (Fig. 4). The average yield gap across cropping systems and three N rate treatments
    was 27–40% of Yp or Yw which is similar to the 35–42% of Yp or Yw reported by
    earlier studies on maize yield gaps in China (Liu et al., 2017; Meng et al., 2013;
    Tao et al., 2015). As over- and under-applications of N fertilizer are common
    in actual farmers’ practices in maize production in China (Zhang et al., 2008;
    Fan et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2018), the yield gap derived from the on-farm trials
    with four N application rates may well reflect the actual yield gap variation
    of maize production at field scale in China. Previous research on the quantification
    of yield gaps in Chinese cropping systems focused on national or regional scales
    (Liu et al., 2017; Meng et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2016; Tao et al., 2015), and
    such results help informing national and regional agricultural policies. However,
    national or regional analysis always mask the heterogeneity of yield gaps at field
    scale (van Ittersum et al., 2013), especially for smallholder farming systems
    (Cui et al., 2018; Tittonell and Giller, 2013). Quantifying and understanding
    Yg variation at field scale is a key approach towards enabling policy makers and
    farmers to take concrete action on land management. 4.2. Yield gap components
    and soil quality yield gap The YHE in the four maize cropping systems approximated
    or even exceeded 80% of Yp or Yw, resulting in a small Yg-T of 2% of Yw in NE
    and 7.0–12% of Yp in NE and NCP. (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). This Yg-T is much lower than
    that estimated in other cereal production systems in Southeast Asia and East Africa
    (Silva et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2019, Assefa et al., 2020). This is explained by
    the high YHE for maize in China, which is a result of intensive crop management
    practices (Zhang et al., 2012; Fan et al., 2012). Moreover, it is also possible
    that Yp and Yw are underestimated for maize cropping systems in China (see Supplementary
    Material). Generally, the results suggest less scope to further increase yields
    of rainfed maize compared to irrigated maize, considering the fact that Yg-T is
    only 2% of Yw for rainfed maize in NE and considering the highly heterogeneous
    production environment for rainfed maize in SW (see Supplementary Material). The
    magnitudes of Yg-M and Yg-R were strongly associated with N rate in all maize
    cropping systems (Fig. 4; Table S2). Yg-R accounted for a larger proportion of
    Yg for treatments with no or low N rates (17.4–27.0% of Yp or Yw), but very small
    to nil proportion with optimal and high N supply (Fig. 4). Yg-M accounted for
    6.0–13.7% of Yp (or Yw) across maize cropping systems and N treatments, and its
    value was nearly constant in low, optimal and high N treatments (Fig. 4; Table
    S2). N fertilizer application in current on-farm trials is split to match maize
    requirements at different growth stages and represented locally available practices
    based on agronomic knowledge. Thus, Yg-M could be greater under farmers’ management
    practices than in on-farm trials analyzed, due to inefficient N management strategies
    deployed (Zhang et al., 2012). However, the results of Yg-M and Yg-R with optimal
    N rate indicate that current recommended optimal N rates could match the maize
    crop requirements, but the timing, placement and form of the N fertilization remain
    important to explain yield gaps in maize cropping systems across China, suggesting
    it is possible to further improve crop management (Chen et al., 2014; Cui et al.,
    2018). Yg-S explained the largest share of the total yield gap and ranged between
    11.0 % and 24.0% of Yp or Yw, which is equivalent to 33.0%–52.1% of the total
    yield gap (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The Yg-S in NCP was lower than in other maize cropping
    systems most likely because in this region maize is cultivated in a hot rainy
    season (June to October), which is likely beneficial for soil nutrient mineralization
    and provision. In contrast, maize in NE and SW is cultivated in a spring season
    (April to May), when low temperatures in early spring and/or drought have a negative
    effect on Yexp. Thus, soil constraints for maize production in NCP are less pronounced
    than in other cropping systems. Yg-S in low N, optimal N and high N treatments
    was similar in all maize cropping systems, but lower than that in control treatment
    (Fig. 4), which suggests that yield gaps due to poor soil quality can be partly
    overcome through adequate N fertilizer rates (Cassman, 1999). Moreover, experimental
    yield responses to N fertilizer decreased with increasing soil quality levels
    (Table 2). Yet, soil quality explains a large share of the total yield gap, even
    when sufficient N is applied. The total yield gap decreased from low to high soil
    quality levels (Fig. 5). Yg-S contributed to more than half of total yield gap
    in on-farm trials under optimal N rate in medium and low soil quality levels,
    but only a quarter to a third in high soil quality levels (Fig. 5). These results
    confirm the statistically significant positive effect of soil quality on experimental
    yields (Table 2) and are consistent with the hypothesis that lower levels of soil
    quality substantially accounted for maize yield gaps in China. Depending on maize
    cropping systems, SOM, TN, soil Olsen-P, available K and/or pH were significantly
    different between different soil quality levels (Table 3). For instance, the association
    between SOM and soil quality levels were greater in the irrigated maize cropping
    systems of NE and NCP than in the rainfed maize cropping systems of SW (Table
    3). The latter may be attributed to heterogeneous biophysical conditions across
    regions. The climate in NE and NCP is colder than that in SW, so that higher SOM
    translated into greater availability of nutrients. Besides, SOM content was lowest
    in NCP, and soil management practices fostering C sequestration have been proposed
    as an effective strategy to enhance soil quality in NCP region (Lal, 2009; Fan
    et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2016). Soil Olsen-P and available K also showed positive
    associations with soil quality, suggesting the importance of soil nutrient supply
    on soil quality. As an exceptional case, soil available K had a smaller significant
    association with soil quality in irrigated maize cropping systems in NCP than
    in the other maize cropping systems (Table 3), which could be attributed to the
    widespread return of straw to the field in this region (He et al., 2015). Clearly,
    management of soil nutrients, SOM and/or pH can be key strategic options towards
    obtaining higher soil quality as a means to narrow Yg-S in diverse maize production
    regions. For maize cropping systems in NE and NCP, soil management practices should
    prioritize elevating SOM, whereas optimized fertilizer management practices can
    contribute to improve soil nutrient pools in rainfed maize cropping systems in
    SW. It must be acknowledged that the use of nutrient omission plots to assess
    soil quality introduced uncertainties in the assessment of Yg-S. The Yg-S was
    calculated as the difference between YTEx and YSEx in a given climate zone × year
    × soil type combination, which is likely to minimize the contribution of non-soil
    factors to Yg-S. Yet, other factors, most notably crop variety, which can exhibit
    different responses to soil quality, might also be captured in the Yg-S due to
    lack of data to explicitly consider this factor in the analysis in addition to
    the key manageable soil properties used to explain Yg-S (Table 3). Other soil
    constraints not considered in the analysis, and likely to contribute to the Yg-S,
    include thinned topsoil and soil compaction, which have demonstrated detrimental
    effects on maize yields in China (Lindert, 2000; Fan et al., 2013). 5. Conclusion
    Maize yield gaps were highly variable within and across the major maize cropping
    systems in China. The magnitude of the intermediate yield gaps varied with N application
    rates, soil quality levels and cropping systems. Overall, the efficiency yield
    gap explained most of the maize yield gap in China. The soil quality component
    of the efficiency yield gap accounted for a considerable proportion (33.0–52.0%)
    of the total maize yield gap. The management and resource yield gaps accounted
    for 11.7–46.6% and 0–46.7% of the total yield gap, respectively. The technology
    yield gap was generally small (2–12% of Yp or Yw). This study highlights the importance
    of soil factors and N management practices in maize yield gaps and informs policy
    makers and practitioners about the magnitude and causes of maize yield gaps in
    China. The method employed to estimate the role of soil quality in narrowing yield
    gaps may also be meaningful for other developing countries, sub-Saharan Africa
    in particular, where yield gaps remain high and where crop production is being
    challenged by shortage of fertilizers and poor soil fertility. Declaration of

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Thessaloniki, Greece SECTION I. Introduction
    Water is a critical input for agricultural production. Water conservation is a
    very important issue, especially in regions where it is scarce. Irrigation has
    significantly improved agricultural production worldwide. Today, irrigated agriculture
    represents about 21 percent of cultivated land, but contributes approximately
    40% of the total global crop production [1]. Integration of advanced irrigation
    systems and technology is essential to improve crop water productivity and yields.
    The researchers have proposed to use innovative technologies, such as enhanced
    irrigation systems on crop water yields [2]. Innovative irrigation practices can
    enhance water efficiency, gaining an economic advantage while also reducing environmental
    burdens [3]. Advances in new irrigation technologies with more refined measuring
    techniques and soil water sensors will help improve knowledge and management techniques.
    In this regard, recent years have witnessed major advances in developing user-friendly
    and affordable soil water sensors, which farmers are using increasingly in their
    farm management strategies. With these techniques, it is then possible to identify
    irrigation scheduling strategies that minimize water demand with minimal impacts
    on yields and crop quality. Irrigation has become common practice to ensure the
    long-term sustainability of viticulture. Irrigation in grapevines has to ensure
    normal physiological activity and an adequate balance between vegetative and reproductive
    development while preserving yield quality [4]. Because irrigation contributes
    to sustainable crop production, it is important to quantify the irrigation water
    during crop production. During the implementation of sustainable soil management
    practices and smart agriculture, understanding the distribution of soil moisture,
    temperature and plant water needs is essential for determining water measurements
    in soils. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the modern choice for irrigation applications
    and is still in early stage [5]. IoT is a viable approach to address the issue
    of vineyard monitoring and control. Smart wireless sensors are used frequently
    as an infrastructure of IoT systems and can be used to monitor vineyards, determine
    the optimum irrigation timing, and assist in making crop-related decisions. The
    SW-WHU network by Wuhan University adopts an NB-IOT technique for data transmission
    with soil moisture and temperature sensors and the data of network is particularly
    valuable for soil moisture monitoring, and application at a very high spatio-temporal
    resolution [6]. In this article, a prototype NB-IoT based quasi-smart water management
    platform for irrigation for the rational exploitation of vineyard in correlation
    with the soil moisture and temperature potential is deployed, as part of the AREThOU5A
    project. SECTION II. Materials and Methods Within the AREThOU5A framework, an
    experiment was carried out in irrigated vineyard in the community of Peta village
    in the Achaea Region. The vineyard is about 11 acres and 3300 stumps of grape
    cultivar ''Mavrodafni'' (Vitis vinifera L.). The vineyard management system is
    conventional. The vineyard is irrigated by electrified drilling with an installed
    drip irrigation system. The determination of the vineyard’s needs in water quantities
    at certain periods during the annual crop cycle was done through the grower’s
    experience. Irrigation start time was in mid-May and end time was in early August.
    Irrigation was carried out on average every 15-20 days and for 7-8 hours. Fig.
    1. Αerial photograph of the experimental vineyard (source: Google Maps) Show All
    Since the water needs are directly linked with soil moisture and soil temperature,
    an intelligent irrigation system is being developed to determine the real needs
    in the efficient use of water. AREThOU5A develops a system for regularly and reliably
    monitoring the status of soil hydration and reporting it to a centralized entity.
    In other words, it provides a cost-effective solution \"from soil to cloud\".
    An IoT node was installed in vineyards, and it operated using connected hardware/software
    and IoT devices. Ad-hoc supply of information on moisture and temperature soil
    sampling is performed at various a single depth of 20 cmunder the canopy of the
    trees by the AREThOU5A project team using IoT technologies for rational management
    and for saving water resources in agricultural production. SECTION III. Architecture
    A. The IoT Platform Initial Installation of the platform commenced in October
    2020. The implementation of the experiment is based on 1 soil moisture sensor
    from Pino-Tech (Model: SoilWatch 10), 1 temperature sensor, and 1 indoor moisture
    and temperature sensor connected to the geographical coordinates (38.043972, 21.467611)
    at a depth of 20 cm in a spiral. Fig. 2 Installation of a new NB-IoT node in the
    Vineyard Show All Fig. 3 Installation of a new NB-IoT node in the Vineyard Show
    All Soil depth is very critical for plant growth [7]. According to the bibliography
    [8], the maximum depth of the rhizosphere for a vineyard is 1.0-2.0 m. Of course,
    these data, especially the large ones extreme values, are for perfectly healthy
    crops grown in highly fertile soils, with great depth available for root growth,
    under standard irrigation conditions, and generally without restrictions that
    may be imposed by any uneven distribution of soil moisture or by the existence
    of soil layers with a significant deviation of their characteristics. According
    to [9] and [10], the rhizosphere represents 80-90% of the active roots, which
    are contained in the upper 60-75% part of the whole rhizoid. This means that in
    the vine the average maximum depth of the active rhizome is about 1 meter. So
    it is desirable to know the fluctuations of humidity throughout the depth of the
    soil profile in which the active rhizome grows, as well as to be able to detect
    possible changes in humidity close to a depth of one meter. Irrigation performance
    and rooting depth of vine is not easy to incorporate in considerations or calculations
    [11]. The usual practice of soil sampling in Greek agricultural lands is the taking
    of samples at different depths, depending of the active rhizome. In this case,
    in the present study, soil moisture and temperature sensors were installed to
    monitor the amount of water stored in the soil profile at a depth of 20 cm of
    the soil surface. Soil moisture is measured by determining the dielectric constant
    of the medium (ground, substrate, etc.), based on frequency-domain reflection
    (FDR) technology. The frequency of the sensor''s emitted signal (70 MHz) is such
    that it minimizes deviations in measurements that may exist due to certain soil
    parameters, such as soil structure. The Connected Sensors are 1 Soil Moisture
    Sensors: Pino-tech Soil Watch 10 at a depth of 20 cm, 1 Outdoor Temperature Sensor,
    Waterproof (DS18B20)m, and 1 Indoor temperature and humidity sensor, integrated
    into the electronic circuit board (based on the SI7021 chip). Sensor and communication
    control material are 1 com Pycom GPy Microcontroller, 1 Li LiPo 3.7V battery,
    capacity 6600 mAh, Electronic sensor, and battery level control circuit (original
    circuit developed for the AREThOU5A project), 1 × Flexible antenna LTE antenna
    824-2170 MHz 10cm (Molex), 1 × Box MULTIPURPOSE ABS 180 × 125 × 56ΜΜ IP65, 2 IP
    IP68 screw cable glands (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 AREThOU5A IoT Node architecture Show
    All The primary measurable sizes are Pinotech Sensor Output Voltage (mVolt), Box
    Temperature / Humidity, Outdoor Soil Temperature, with a measurement period of
    1 hour. The measured operating metadata are Battery Level (Volt), NB-IoT RSSI,
    SNR, network connection installation time. Sensor and communication control software
    is the \"microPython\" open source software, developed by the AREThOU5A project
    team and the communication protocol is NB-IoT, with connectivity NB-IoT, 1xSIM
    by a local telecommunications provider, NB-IoT service (512 KB/month) and data
    transfer protocol CoAP / IPv6. CoAP is a UDP-based protocol widely used in communication
    of low-end devices (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Constrained Application Protocol Packet sent
    from AREThOU5A IoT Nodes to Telecom back end (Cloud) Show All For supporting IPv6
    in the specific microcontroller, changes to the original firmware have been also
    applied by the development team. Τhis irrigation application is focused on vineyard
    localization using a public NB-IoT network. The cost of the prototype Unit and
    the sensors is economically affordable. B. Physical architecture The system for
    smart irrigation in a vineyard is developed upon customized IoT hardware based
    on low-cost microcontrollers with embedded sensor interfaces and telecommunication
    modems, open-source software, open and standardized data transport protocols,
    thus keeping capital and operational costs at low levels. This system for smart
    irrigation in vineyards has NB-IoT data communication capability, as well as software
    tools, developed to integrate data into a platform in an application-oriented
    environment. The system’s goal is to enable smart irrigation of the vineyard by
    hosting NB-IoT devices that send data to the cloud directly. The subsystems located
    within the vineyard are: The measurement subsystem. The routing subsystem. The
    interconnection subsystem. The Internet interface subsystem. SECTION IV. Results
    and discussion The design and development of software applications for the interconnection
    of the IoT subsystem with infrastructure have commenced. It will provide the possibility
    of storing the collected measurement data from the vineyard in a central database,
    as well as their distribution in a web application, enabling graphic display of
    measurements. The proposed platform presents several novel features in terms of
    hardware integration, operational options, and connectivity support. The NB-IoT
    is still in the process of development, but that the solutions using this method
    suggests a possible future application [12]. In summary, the following activities
    have been implemented: Collection of data in the vineyard. A specially designed
    routine has been created that communicates with the system’s interface and with
    the service provided by the device data collection base (Device Measurement Data
    Collection Function). Application of identification to create a secure infrastructure
    at the data level, but also for the storage and retention of user data. It was
    necessary to create an application programming interface (API) to establish a
    communication channel between the Graphical User Interface and the User Database.
    Application of a communication interface. A web service has been created for collecting
    and sharing vineyard data between the individual subsystems. This application
    is an Application Programming Interface (API), which via the Internet (HTTP),
    enables the exchange of information with the Central vineyard Database. Storage
    of data collected by the system (device data, user registration data). The stored
    information is related to the characteristics of the vineyard. In particular,
    we concentrated the various measurements for each piece of vineyard, the type
    of measurements, the characteristics of each vineyard, the characteristics of
    the sources from which the various measurements originated, the characteristics
    of the crop, the irrigation system installed in each subfield site (if any), the
    characteristics of the soil and the aggregate values of the measurements. There
    is also the User Database in which the information related to the users of the
    system is stored. Specifically, it stores users’ personal information, users’
    status information (active/inactive), contact information, verification and authorization
    information, and the role of each user. Soil moisture and temperature sensor readings
    in the period of the months of the season were presented in Fig. 6. Soil moisture
    and temperature readings are taken every one minute of an hour on a 24-hour basis.
    The first results showed that the average soil moisture ranged from 13-28 % and
    soil temperature ranged from 11, 5-15,8 0C at 20 cm depth during the experiment.
    Fig. 6 Collection of data by the system in the vineyard Show All SECTION V. Conclusions
    and future observations The system for smart irrigation in a vineyard is developed
    upon customized IoT hardware based on low-cost microcontrollers with embedded
    sensor interfaces and telecommunication, open-source software, open and standardized
    data transport protocols, thus keeping capital and operational costs at low levels.
    This system for smart irrigation in vineyards has NB-IoT data communication capability,
    as well as software tools, developed to integrate data into a platform in an application-oriented
    environment. There are still some implementation issues, but they are related
    to the size of the antennas and the range, which significantly degrade the presence
    of obstacles. As expected, for applications with higher data speeds or higher
    transmission rates, a NB-IoT system may not be sufficient to implement such a
    solution, but it is a very effective solution for developing systems that require
    many low-cost, low-power sensor devices. In this paper the firsthand results of
    real-vineyard localization experiments using a public NB-IoT network were provided.
    In the future, will continue collecting NB-IoT measurements in the irrigated vineyard
    in the community of Peta village in the Achaea Region. NB-IoT system will be further
    investigated and a larger data set will be published. Declaration of Competing

  description: Gulf cities are generally characterized by hot, arid climates and extremely
    rapid developments with resulting demographic increases and accompanying environmental
    degradation. Until now, resources, technology, and capital have allowed expansion
    without limits—into the ocean with landfills and artificial islands, into the
    sky with tall buildings, and into the desert with Zero Energy Cities (Grichting,
    Int J Middle East Stud, 50(3), 580–585, 2018) With an economy largely focused
    on non-renewable energy sources, many of these Gulf countries are now looking
    to develop new postcarbon identities and to improve the sustainability and livability
    of their cities (Grichting, Int J Middle East Stud, 50(3), 580–585, 2018). Climate
    change and extreme weather conditions are also affecting the region, with more
    frequent and intense flooding (Al Jazeera, https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/raining-qatar-season-181112125930905.html.

    Abstract Gulf cities are generally characterized by hot, arid climates and extremely
    rapid developments with resulting demographic increases and accompanying environmental
    degradation. Until now, resources, technology, and capital have allowed expansion
    without limits—into the ocean with landfills and artificial islands, into the
    sky with tall buildings, and into the desert with Zero Energy Cities (Grichting,

    of their cities (Grichting, Int J Middle East Stud, 50(3), 580–585, 2018). Climate

    and extremely rapid developments with resulting demographic increases and accompanying
    environmental degradation. Until now, resources, technology, and capital have
    allowed expansion without limits—into the ocean with landfills and artificial
    islands, into the sky with tall buildings, and into the desert with Zero Energy
    Cities (Grichting 2018) With an economy largely focused on non-renewable energy
    sources, many of these Gulf countries are now looking to develop new postcarbon
    identities and to improve the sustainability and livability of their cities (Grichting
    2018). Climate change and extreme weather conditions are also affecting the region,
    with more frequent and intense flooding (Al Jazeera 2018). In October 2018, Qatar
    experienced unprecedented Flash Floods and the capital city of Doha received 84
    mm of rain (Floodlist 2018) the equivalent of the average rainfall of Qatar for
    one whole year. Buildings, roads, tunnels and coastal areas were severely flooded.
    In 1990, Qatar’s only sources of water were groundwater abstraction (65%) and
    desalinated seawater (35%) (MDPS Ministry of Development, Planning and Statistics
    2017). Treated wastewater for agriculture and green spaces irrigation purposes
    (5%) came into use in 2004, and increased to 11% in 2014 (MDPS 2017). Today, municipal
    potable water is obtained 99% from desalination and 1% from groundwater (Government
    of Qatar Web Portal undated). At the same time, the waters of the Gulf are becoming
    increasingly polluted due to desalination, over-fishing and pollution from hydro-carbon
    industries and shipping. Researchers believe that the Gulf marine environment
    has already surpassed its buffering capacity, with very poor circulation of water
    and extreme pollution (Nadim et al. 2008). In the face of climate change, rising
    sea levels, food, water, energy insecurity, and loss of biodiversity - citizens,
    communities, and nations must work on common visions to address these future challenges
    by working with, and not against nature. In the words of IUCN President Zhang
    Xinsheng at the 2018 Global Forum on Urban Resilience and Adaptation ‘We must
    connect cities with nature to build resilience in the face of climate change and
    natural disasters’ (IUCN 2018a, b). He underlined IUCN’s role in developing the
    concept of Nature-based Solutions to bring humans closer to nature and to address
    complex challenges such as climate change in order to achieve SDG Goal 11: ‘make
    cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’ (UN.org).
    A ‘Resilience thinking approach’ is vital for city dwellers living with the unpredictable
    disturbances of climate change effects (Meerow et al. 2016). Nature Based urban
    design must be accompanied by self-organising tools and measures to face fast
    changes. This includes retaining knowledge in neighbourhoods and cities, valorization
    of labour and preparing students to translate their intellectual and aesthetic
    work into effective contributions to their communities, aware of all the other
    communities that could be affected by their choices (Lombardi 2017). One such
    approach is to consider the city as a regenerative system of organic streams,
    eg. grey water, sewage, organic waste, urban runoff and storm waters. Capturing
    the rising amount of rain, storm waters and increasing waste water provides the
    resources and materials for establishing new layers that are key to the city’s
    sustainability and resiliance. With a combination of modular environmental technology,
    open form infrastructure and landscape urbanism these material streams will become
    a steady source of power for the new organic layers of the city composed of parks,
    trees, water elements, wetlands, green roofs, wild nature, urban farms and collective
    gardens. These layers reduce the heat-island effect of the city, capture carbon,
    reduce pollution, produce a comfortable micro-climate, promote urban biodiversity,
    encourage pedestrian movability, produce food, create an attractive public entourage,
    amongst other ecosystem services (Roggema et al. 2017). Therefore, aside from
    governments and professional practices, one level at which this nature based approach
    needs to be addressed is in academia, and new approaches to design education must
    include a holistic, systems and nature-based approach to landscape, urban and
    architectural design. This chapter presents a selection of design projects developed
    with students at Qatar University in the Master’s program in Urban Planning and
    Design with a strong focus on ecological and nature based solutions. As part of
    the pedagogic process, students consulted with experts in Ministries and the private
    sector, and numerous field trips with experts were conducted to Water Treatment
    facilities, wildlife reserves, abandoned quarries, etc. to address a wide array
    of urban and landscape themes that are not necessarily seen as design projects
    by the authorities or the academic establishment. In this way, the pedagogic approach,
    and the design studio, addresses contemporary needs, and trains the students to
    identify important and pressing projects and to bring them to life and to competent
    authorities. As an example, some of the projects were presented to the President
    of the Public Works Authority as well as the Minister of Municipality and Urban
    Planning (Abu Nakhla Constructed Wetland). Other projects were developed in collaboration
    with Research Centers at Qatar University – The Environmental Research Center
    (ESC) such as the Project for Turtle Conservation. This bottom-up process is not
    common in the autocratic culture of the Gulf. Associated with a Nature Based and
    participatory landscape approach to planning, from the ground up, it is the way
    forward to achieve more sustainable and resilient urban design in the Region.
    9.2 From Green to Blue Design Green has been the colour of sustainability for
    many years. But is green really a color of sustainability for a yellow desert
    and dryland? A beautiful green lawn consumes much water and is maintained by pesticides
    and herbicides that are harmful to people, animals and birds. In a dry land like
    Qatar it is necessary to look at the Blue, to consider the water resources, the
    types of water, water consumption and water management (Grichting 2012), and how
    we can best recycle water – grey and black water – preferably onsite, using natural
    and organic systems. It is also important to consider the sweet and salt water
    sources, the impact desalination has on the ocean, and the relationship between
    urbanization on land and in or at sea. Blue Design is proposed here as a methodology
    with three approaches: 1. It focuses on the relationship between oceans and urbanization
    (Blue Urbanism), 2. It is water-based urban design (Blue Networks) 3. It promotes
    an active, rather than passive, approach to Design (Green to Blue). The concept
    of Blue Design was coined by Saatchi and Saatchi (2008) – and goes beyond the
    Green to look at systems and designs that are not only carbon neutral but that
    also give back to the planet. Blue Urbanism – a term used by Timothy Beatley –
    takes as a starting point the facts that our human fate here on the blue planet
    is intimately tied to ocean health and that two-thirds of our global population
    lies within 400 km of a shoreline (Beatley 2014). It seeks a balance between urbanization
    on the land and its effects on the oceans. Green to Blue was proposed by the author
    as a new way of approaching urban and landscape design in Qatar and was formulated
    as a framework for teaching design studios in sustainable urban and landscape
    design (Grichting 2012). As mentioned previously, there is very little rainfall
    in Qatar. However, when rain does fall, there is a lot of flooding, highlighting
    an absence of consideration for the topography, with the assumption that Qatar
    is flat. For a nature-based approach to urbanism, there is a need to radically
    overturn the approach to planning, which is top down and which lays buildings
    and infrastructures on the land as a tabula rasa approach, and to begin with topography,
    natural systems and water sources. In this way, we design the urban landscape
    as an infrastructure for the city, and its systems. The landscape is no longer
    a decoration, a beautification, an amenity or the icing on the cake. It becomes
    the foundation for building the city. A Nature based approach to urban design
    also looks at buildings as living systems that are in symbiosis with their environment.
    Similar to the blue design concept, adopted by Saatchi & Saatchi, it is also about
    designing buildings and landscapes that are productive, that return more to the
    community and the environment than what they take. With green design we talk about
    carbon neutrality while blue design creates places that go beyond carbon neutrality
    and actually add surpluses to the world. To reverse global warming, we can no
    longer be passive in our designs. Instead, we need to be active and restore the
    planet and its resources. For example, recycled water can be re-injected into
    a buildings’ water systems or recycled for landscaping and food production. In
    the past there was a tendency to think about architecture, landscaping and urban
    design separately. Additionally, we also tend to think of water, energy, food
    and waste as being separate concepts At present, we start to think of buildings,
    landscape and urbanism as an integrated system, with symbiotic relationships.
    Symbiosis is about interaction between two organisms and typically to the advantage
    of both. For example, buildings can produce more energy than they consume and
    the water they use can be recycled for surrounding landscapes including trees
    and green roofs. The trees can be planted in a way so that they will produce shade
    to buildings and help cool them, the green roofs also help to reduce the heat
    island effect and insulate the building, therefore reducing the use of energy
    for heating and cooling. Furthermore, the buildings and landscapes become habitats
    for diverse species, promoting urban biodiversity. This new approach to design
    represents a fundamental shift in how engineers, designers and architects should
    view the challenges of local projects and thinking in systems, rather than designing
    icons. The measures of successful design in future will include the level of giveback
    the project generates for its occupants as well as to the greater global community.
    The future of the design and planning sector will demand an intervention and expertise
    of a wide range of professionals such as economists, biologists, chemists and
    also a range of social science experts such as demographers, anthropologists and
    geographers. We will present two groups of projects developed with students at
    Qatar University. The first group is based on Nature based design in the Coastal
    Interface, the second group focuses on nature-based design using different types
    of recycled waters. 9.3 Blue Design in the Coastal Interface Military conflicts,
    lack of harmony among Gulf littoral states, and diverse prioritization of coastal
    issues have impeded the implementation of a sustainable coastal management program
    in the Persian Gulf region, even though the GDP has increased rapidly in the past
    few decades (Nadim et al. 2008). With the current Gulf crisis, which includes
    an embargo/blockade of Qatar since June 2017 (Ulrichen 2018), it is even more
    important for authorities, planners, designers, environmental scientists, and
    coastal managers in the Gulf states to focus on smart-planned development, which
    includes coastal preservation and ecological protection. Nature based urban design
    must go beyond national and political borders, to embrace ecosystem and watershed
    based zoning, that takes into account water systems and species habitats. Additionally,
    zoning and planning should not stop at the water’s edge, or at the coastal boundary,
    but extend into the sea and the waters. Timothy Beatley positions Blue Urbanism
    as an emerging set of ideas and perspectives around developing a mutually sustaining
    relationship between cities and oceans, where city planning carefully evaluates
    and regulates the effect of urban development on the marine environments (Beatley
    2014). According to Beatley, cities should have jurisdiction over near-shore habitats
    and extend their zones of planning and management to offshore areas. Coastal zones
    compromise a very complex system and interacted subsystems, yet the planning of
    these zones is most often ignored or fragmented by policy and decision makers,
    regulators, scientists, planners and designers, economists, locals and beneficiaries,
    project managers and engineers, and international and regional agencies, and their
    complex and dynamic nature makes their management challenging. Qatar’s Integrated
    Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) plan aims to address these issues and to unify
    objectives and instruments to achieve desired objectives (Afifi et al. 2016).
    Several research and design projects being undertaken by the author and students
    at Qatar University address these coastal interfaces in Qatar. These projects
    include visions of new ecologies for the Doha Corniche, which create scenarios
    for mitigating storm surge and sea level rise, minimizing the pollution of the
    urban waters, increasing urban biodiversity, creating more socially integrated
    public landscapes, and designing productive landscapes both in the water and on
    land using emerging technologies and processes such as micro algae and sea farming
    as well as ecological engineering (Grichting 2016a, b). The Ecological Conservation
    Master Plan for Al Fuwairit Beach is intended to develop an ecologically protected
    area for the critically endangered hawksbill turtle by restoring and protecting
    turtle habitats, as well as the archeological sites adjacent to the turtle beach,
    and to strategically plan future developments that will preserve the cultural
    and archeological assets of Al Fuwairit and curate them for ecotourism. Dohasis,
    a conceptual proposal developed during a workshop on New Directions in Sustainable
    Urbanism in Qatar, invites free flooding of the sea to become an active part of
    the cityscape by introducing a series of controlled cracks in the flood defense
    walls and by designing free water movement within free spaces in the city (Roggema
    et al. 2017). Using soft engineering as opposed to hard engineering techniques
    and processes, it prepares the city to deal with the future rise of the sea level
    and changing weather conditions, where urban water elements also act as stormwater
    relief channels and contribute to the microclimate of the city. New, mixed fresh
    and salt water greenery are introduced into the city and coastal areas, developing
    them into partial urban mangrove ecosystems and inviting back original site-specific
    forms of flora and fauna. Offshore ecological engineering with oyster reefs will
    contribute to cleaning the polluted sea waters while creating barriers from storm
    surges, and will bring back pearl oysters, an important aspect of Qatar’s traditional
    culture. Other projects along Qatar’s coastlines include the Mangrove Belt systems
    and the Gulf EcoGateway between Qatar and Bahrain. 9.4 Blue Belts. Integrated
    Coastal Zone Management for Rising Seas This design project addresses rising sea
    levels and biodiversity protection through ecological infrastructure. It is based
    on a concept of ecosystem service modeling and the mapping of informed management
    scenarios to develop an ecosystem based zoning scheme in the coastal areas. It
    calls for data and information gathering to create a comprehensive map of human
    activities and coastal and marine ecosystems for Qatar, combined with stakeholder
    engagement and review. It is an alternative to the sprawling coastal developments
    that are threatening the habitats of endangered species such as the Hawksbill
    turtles, who nest in Qatar. It addresses two main threats to Qatar which are also
    regional and global threats: biodiversity loss and sea level rise, through a multi-stakeholder
    approach, with new legislations to implement a nature based coastal development.
    The project proposes the implementation of a mangrove belt around the coastline
    especially around existing mangrove ecosystems and nature protected areas. Moreover,
    it aims to protect endangered marine animals, such as dudongs and Hawksbill turtles
    by mapping their habitats and migratory paths. It includes the protection of sea
    grass and planting grass belts in areas of dugongs and Hawksbill turtles existence
    as they are critical to their survival. The project proposes the creation of a
    marine buffer zone consisting of different types of beds (oyster, mangrove or
    grass beds) that will aid in the decrease of rise in sea level impact. This Blue
    Belt or buffer zone should be complementary to the existing ecosystems and preserved
    areas and benefits both the biodiversity and citizens of Qatar, introducing a
    new, nature based approach to coastal planning. Newly drafted urban design regulations
    include urban lighting regulations for sensitive species such as the Hawksbill
    turtle as well as offset of urbanism zoning along preserved beaches and sustainable
    building codes that include structures and facades that enhance biodiversity.
    With regard to zoning, it will be important to create protected areas that cover
    both the land and the sea for critically endangers species that appear on the
    IUCN Red List, such as the Hawksbill turtle. Currently, protected areas are on
    land only. The multiple stakeholders for implementation of the design and projects
    include: coastal and ocean users: fisheries, tourism development and recreation,
    shipping and port operations and offshore oil operations; Non-governmental organizations
    (NGOs) which include local and international environmental NGOs such as RAMSAR,
    IUCN, UNESCO, ROPME, as well as Friends of the Environment Qatar and local youth
    organizations; Landowners and Business owners; Investors for Public Private Partnerships;
    Government and Ministries; Universities, Scientific and Research institutions
    and other education entities. The project is implemented in the northern and southern
    areas of Qatar, which are not yet highly urbanized, but face pressure of urbanization
    on the coastlines. The northern zones are slated for development in the new master
    plan that looks to develop secondary cities in Qatar. The southern site is the
    location of Doha’s New Industrial Port. The main areas are Al-Ruwais-Al Shamal,
    Al Fuwairit and surround turtle nesting areas, and Al Messaid. In these sites,
    different typologies of coastal edge landscaping infrastructure, based on Mangrove
    Belts, are proposed to guide development, mitigate effects of sea level rise and
    promote and preserve biodiversity (Fig. 9.1). Additionally, the mangrove ecosystem
    captures carbon and filters and cleans the water. In the Al-Ruwais, where rainfall
    is the highest in Qatar, the system is based on a constructed Tidal Sea Pool system,
    associated with Mangrove plantings, which will filter stormwater, provide recreational
    activities in the developing urban areas, providing car free zones connected to
    the new transit system being implemented in Qatar. In turn, these will provide
    new public and civic spaces, connecting people to nature and acting as an ecological
    infrastructure for water treatment, storm water management, leisure and education.
    In the Al Fuwairit and turtle nesting coastal zone, the system will act as a biological
    breakwater, to mitigate storm surges and sea level rise, and to protect the nesting
    beaches from erosion. Additionally, they will create leisure zones and wildlife
    reserves for migrating birds and other sensitive species and participate in a
    careful management and protection of the highly sensitive turtle nesting areas.
    In the Messaied Industrial coastal area, a system of Mangrove edges will be combined
    with floating mangrove systems, to reduce the effects of sea-level rise and storm
    surge and to create an ecological interface between the on-shore and offshore
    industrial activities. Fig. 9.1 The Mangrove Belt Locations and Systems. (Source:

    stress caused by rapid development of the city of Al Thakhira is studied with
    a focus on mangrove ecology, which is increasingly threatened by rapid urbanization.
    The Mangroads project proposes to improve the lives of the coastal communities
    and the quality of the natural environment in the area of Al Thakira on the Western
    coast of Qatar, using natural systems, ecological engineering and landscape design.
    The area of Al Thakira is a protected area, with a large potential for nature
    based tourism which can protect the species and habitat while curating outdoor
    activities in a natural environment. These activities contribute to the economy
    of coastal communities and creates an indirect way to change the mindset of the
    people to create a closer relationship between the communities and the surrounding
    environment. In the case of Althakhira, the Mangroves are considered an important
    key to enhance the urban and natural environment. The interactive and education
    areas are the Mangroves Farms which will be located in the urban and natural areas:
    near the residential area in Alkhor and close to the existing mangrove areas.
    This project builds on a previous project for the Al Thakira protected area, which
    included a detailed analysis of the sites with the establishment of different
    zones of intervention, including the core zones of biodiversity, buffer zones
    and zones for the development of nature based leisure and tourism activities (Fig.
    9.2). The Mangroads creates a series of floating mangrove islands including an
    observation island, an educational center and a recreation center, as well as
    interactive areas along boardwalks and mangrove nurseries. These mangrove islands
    also serve as beacons that mark sensitive areas in the gulf waters, acting as
    a buffer zone to contain movement and tourism and to protect and restore the martime
    ecosystem. Fig. 9.2 Program and location of the Mangroads Project. (Source: Maryam
    Al Suwaidi) Full size image A sensitivity mapping (Fig. 9.3) was conducted for
    each of the ecosystem types, with respect to their fragility and their interest
    for biodiversity (Supreme Council for Environment and Nature Reserves 2007). The
    types with very high sensitivity are coral formations and dense mangroves, represented
    by reef inner slopes, seagrass beds and scattered mangroves. Intertidal sand banks,
    mud flats, and shallow lagoon are of medium sensitivity. Coastal sabkha, beach
    rocks and subtidal cap rocks deep seagrass and algae beds have been classified
    as types with a low sensitivity. Pathways and transportation systems are adapted
    to the sensitivity zones, and modes such as jet-skies and high-speed motor boats
    will be restricted in these areas. Soft mobility systems that will be used are
    kayaking, water bicycles, rowboats, waterboards, stand up paddle etc. And for
    those who are not capable of using them, public boats will be offered in specific
    timing of the day to commute to and from the islands. Fig. 9.3 Sensitivity mapping

    Full size image 9.6 Blue Line. Biodiversity Conservation for Flagship Species
    The Hawksbill turtle nests on Qatar’s shores and has been visiting the peninsula
    for thousands of years. The females migrate thousands of miles and come back to
    nest on the beaches they were born on. This species is now on the Red List of
    Endangered Species of IUCN, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
    (IUCN Red List 2018b). Of the seven species of sea turtle, it is the most critically
    endangered. Marine turtles are some of the oldest surviving reptiles on the planet
    and are irreplaceable ecological resources. They are recognized as playing the
    role of indicator species for the relative health of its surroundings, both marine
    and terrestrial. Biodiversity conservation cannot be successful unless local communities
    both receive their fair share of benefits from local biological resources and
    assume a greater role in managing them. It is believed that whether sea turtles
    ultimately vanish from the planet or whether they remain a wild and thriving part
    of the natural world will reflect the ability of humans to sustainably coexist
    with the diversity of life on Earth. However, today in Qatar and worldwide, sea
    turtles face intense threats of extinction directly caused by human acts of consumption
    and development. Researchers are currently tagging sea turtles with satellite
    transmitters in order to track these intangible animals and support research in
    new ecological technologies towards prospective solutions to many global development
    challenges (Chatting et al. 2018). Al Fuwairit is an important area of Qatar’s
    coastline, as it represents a popular tourist destination, as well as being a
    key nesting site for the Hawksbill turtle. Al Fuwairit beach, located on the north-east
    coast of Qatar, is immediately adjacent to a number of ecologically sensitive
    habitats including: nearshore coral reefs, foreshore rocky beaches, sand dunes,
    a brackish lagoon and a mangrove habitat. Al Fuwairit beach serves to protect
    against coastal erosion and has several exposed geological features of interest.
    As an entire ecosystem, the Al Fuwairit area is rich in biodiversity, and home
    to many threatened species of flora and fauna. Habitats surrounding, and including
    Al Fuwairit Beach, provide foraging grounds for many bird and animal species and
    are home to diverse plant communities, which together represent a high biodiversity
    index (Grichting 2016a, b). Overall, the ecosystem of Al Fuwairit Beach can be
    considered as an ecological ‘hotspot’ for the rich marine natural history of Qatar.
    Unfortunately, in recent years, Al Fuwairit beach has been subject to increasing
    human pressure and is now in urgent need of protection. Threats to the ecological
    value of the area include tourists visiting and driving across the beach and adjacent
    sand dunes, as well as leaving behind excessive amounts of rubbish. In particular,
    sand dune habitat is being compacted and destroyed by vehicle traffic, turtle
    nests are at risk from poachers, and mangrove habitat and bird nesting areas are
    being disturbed. All of these activities contribute to the degradation and decline
    of the ecosystem. The objective of the turtle habitat conservation measures and
    of the Conservation Master Plan is to strike a balance between controlled access
    for the public who come to Al Fuwairit Beach for recreational purposes, and the
    conservation of ecological habitats and biodiversity for the benefit of Qatar.
    Combined, the project will serve to enhance and protect the ecosystem for current
    and future generations and will support the Al Fuwairit ecosystem to become an
    area of international conservation status, with associated green tourism benefits
    for Qatar. The project proposes two components. One deals with the more urgent
    turtle conservation measures that should be implemented with high priority and
    prevent further population loss in Qatar and the region. This is integrated into
    the second component: the conservation Master Plan - with phases of interventions
    based on priority and resources. In terms of the development of the conservation
    Master Plan (CMP) for Al Fuwairit Beach, and the wider ecosystem, the main aims
    will be to: Develop the CMP for Qatar’s first Eco-Beach and Nature Reserve; Create
    a safer habitat for endangered turtles by designating and defining the boundaries
    of the protected area(s); Create landscape and ecological designs to restore habitat
    including: dunes, marine habitats, turtle habitats, etc.; Take landscape measures
    to enhance existing habitats – e.g. turtles light pollution screen, dune creation,
    tree planting, interpretive signage, bird hides etc.; Increase the accessibility
    of infrastructure – e.g. vehicle access, roads, parking; as well as boardwalks
    (see below for example), etc. Design a permanent Turtle Information Center for
    the benefit of scientists and visitors; Use renewable energy sources e.g. solar
    power, and reduce waste, noise, air and light pollution in the area; Propose “soft
    activities” for visitor recreation that are compatible with the turtle reserve
    (no engines, no excessive noise, etc.). Specific Hawksbill turtle conservation
    measures under the project may include: 1. The protection of coastal sand dunes.
    Fencing should be erected around the existing dunes to protect against vehicles
    driving over the dunes and destroying vegetation. A planting program should be
    undertaken to restore beach dune vegetation, and to enhance protection against
    coastal erosion. Ecological engineering shall be implemented to assist in the
    restoration of the dunes and the protection of the coastline. 2. Sand de-compaction.
    Vehicles driving over Al Fuwairit Beach and compacting the sand create a major
    impediment to nesting turtles. As well as restricting vehicle access, a sand harrow
    could be deployed to de-compact the sand 1 month prior to the turtle nesting season.
    A sand harrow is a metal linked low impact wire mechanism used to plough compacted
    shore areas. The harrow allows nesting turtles to dig nests more easily and reduces
    the stress level of the nesting female. 3. Turtle Hatchery & Information Center.
    A hatchery should be set up on Fuwairit beach to optimize hatching success and
    allow for visitors to observe hatching in a sustainable, controlled and educated
    manner. A permanent Turtle Information Centre at Al Fuwairit Beach would serve
    to inform the public about the importance of the Hawksbill turtle and its habitat,
    as well as the value of the ecosystem. 4. An example of habitat conservation for
    public education. A public walkway (or boardwalk) through the mangrove habitat
    could be erected to allow controlled public access and increase public awareness
    and education on the importance of the mangrove habitat. This would be designed
    in a way to minimise impact on the mangrove habitat and the bird species through
    the use of bird hides, interpretive information boards, and ecotourism guides.
    This project was developed in collaboration with the Environmental Science Center
    (ESC) of Qatar University, which has been responsible for conducting Hawksbill
    turtle conservation on behalf of Qatar Petroleum and the Ministry of Municipality
    and Environment for many years at Al Fuwairit and other nesting sites in Qatar.
    The development of a Conservation Master Plan (CMP) for Al Fuwairit beach and
    its surrounding habitats has been ongoing with students in the Department of Architecture
    and Urban Planning at Qatar University. This collaborative work with the ESC builds
    capacity and knowledge in Conservation Master Planning and will also raise awareness
    amongst the student population and community. (Fig. 9.4). Fig. 9.4 Layers of the

    In a bottom-up approach, guided by Qatar’s national vision pillars, this project
    tries to attract decision-makers attention through a living laboratory concept
    Master Plan proposal in the area of Fuwairit beach and archeological site, which
    will stimulate ecological accountability of municipal bodies and highlight their
    role undertaking policy formulation, regulation, implementation of networking
    infrastructure and comprehensive planning projects towards sustainable urban future.
    The project integrates a system of resilience loops in order to make the project
    self-sustaining and reduce resource use and pollution. (Fig. 9.5). Fig. 9.5 Resiliance

    Interviewing research members familiar with the site and acknowledging unique
    heritage and natural habitat within the marine and land interface in Fuwairit
    resulted in revitalization strategies that focus on habitat, development, social
    responsibility and resilience, aimed to discover distinctive ways urban master
    plans can foster collaboration between diverse sectors of community, organizations,
    stakeholders and inspire holistic vision of the problems and opportunities presented
    by coastal development. From an organizational standpoint, the elaboration of
    existing urban heritage, land use and green systems in Fuwairit avoiding any pressures
    on the natural and ecological systems whilst focusing on disseminating this experience
    to our communities will introduce ecological practice in planning and development
    as future development model. 9.7 Blue Bridges. The Gulf Eco Gateway. Transboundary
    Planning for Biodiversity Conservation Prior to the current Gulf crisis, the concept
    of the modern state—introduced into the Gulf by the European powers—coupled with
    the increasing importance of boundaries to define ownership of oil deposits—were
    at the origin of territorial and boundary disputes in the Gulf region. The contestation
    between Bahrain and Qatar over the Hawar Islands was settled only in 2001 (Wiegand
    2012), after 36 years of dispute, and today they belong to the island of Bahrain.
    Plans for a friendship bridge to link the peninsula of Qatar to the island of
    Bahrain, inscribed in a new regional rail network for the GCC countries, have
    been drafted to increase exchanges and mobility between the two states. However,
    recent events - the blockade of Qatar in June 2017 - have shattered the Gulf geographies
    and the Gulf Cooperation Community, and not only interrupted the flow of resources
    to and from Qatar, but also shut down the air, sea, and land borders between Qatar
    and the neighbouring states. The Hawar Islands, situated off the East coast of
    Qatar, lie on the path of thousands of endangered migrating birds, playing an
    important role in regional marine ecologies. Khor al Adaid is also a formerly
    disputed border zone, and it is a unique assemblage of terrestrial and marine
    environments with a large tidal embayment lying in an area of mobile dunes that
    straddles the border with Saudi Arabia, recognized as an area of global ecological
    importance. Both of these border areas have been nominated as UNESCO World Heritage
    Site and could one day become zones of cross-border ecological cooperation that
    could guarantee lasting human and ecological security between Qatar and its neighbors
    as well as provide well-designed and managed spaces for nature observation. Scientific
    research, stakeholder engagement and ecological Master Planning should be undertaken
    as a way to engage cross-border collaboration between scientists and nature conservationists
    on both sides of the border, with the aid of international NGOs such as UNESCO,
    International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the Ramsar Convention
    on Wetlands. The example of the Korean DMZ, the Cyprus Green Line Buffer Zone,
    the Jordan River Valley, and other transboundary areas in conflict or contested
    zones can be examples for these projects when scientists, artists, academics,
    and NGOs on both sides collaborate in common future visions despite the current
    crisis/embargo. One research and design project that aligns with these visions,
    undertaken with students at Qatar University’s Master in Urban Planning and Design,
    is the Gulf Eco Gateway and the Master Planning for the Hawar-Al Reem Transboundary
    Protected Biosphere Reserve. The First project builds on the proposed Bahrain
    Friendship bridge, which would connect and link the high-speed rail network that
    is planned for the GCC. The second is a proposal to link the Al Reem Biosphere
    reserve, proposed as a UNESCO site, with the Hawar Island Protected Area. The
    conservation of Nature, species, and ecosystems cannot be undertaken in isolation,
    and this project is a great opportunity to continue working on collaborative visions
    despite the current crisis. As mentioned earlier, in these research projects on
    borders and transboundary cooperation - between scientists, nature conservationists,
    and artists, - it is imperative to continue the visioning of these projects, and
    to prepare the ground for when the conditions are ripe for implementation (Grichting
    and Zebich-Knos 2017). While the current Gulf crisis precludes this type of transboundary
    planning with its neighbours, ecological and nature based planning, based on species
    and habitat conservation, must go beyond borders to be effective. The Gulf-Eco
    Gateway aims to reweave the land-sea interface between the State of Qatar and
    the Gulf of Bahrain Hawar Islands. (Fig. 9.6) This region is recognized as hosting
    on of the Gulf’s richest biodiversity hotspots of coral, algae and seagrass ecosystems
    and includes endangered turtles and dugong species. Based on existing sensitivity
    mapping and ecosystem studies of flora and fauna (Supreme Council for the Environment
    and Natural Reserves, SCENR 2008) the project is structured around the proposed
    Qatar-Bahrain Friendship bridge that was proposed after the resolution of the
    territorial dispute. While the bridge has been criticized as being unfriendly
    and a threat to the environment, it is proposed here as a gateway marking a new
    protected area, and as an ecological infrastructure to contribute to the remediation
    and regeneration of the threatened ecosystems, flora and fauna. The degradation
    and threats include oil and gas pollution, fishing nets and debris, coral bleaching
    due to rising temperatures and lack of currents, increasing salinity from brine
    from desalination plants, amongst others. The floating bridge will act as a plug-in
    biome and host the border facilities, as well as bio-reactors, algae open ponds
    and ecology farms, food farms, a floating island museum, an educational center
    for endangered species – Dugong and Turtles – and an underwater aquarium. An Eco
    hub will contain a research center and eco-lodges for tourism. The entire area
    will be classified as a transboundary biosphere reserve, and host Bird sanctuaries,
    Turtle Marine reserves, dugong reserves, educational facilities, eco-villages
    and ecological activities for eco-tourism – kayaking, stand-up paddle, camel safaris,
    etc. Fig. 9.6 Gulf eco-gateway. (Source: Najeeba Ali) Full size image 9.8 Cyan
    Corniche. The Fusion of Blue and Green Urbanism on Doha’s Corniche 9.8.1 The Corniche
    As a result of landfill policies over recent decades the Doha Corniche now forms
    almost a complete circle, and this influences the macroform of Doha city. While
    old Doha, located on the south bank of the Corniche, originally had an intricate
    circulation system, the semicircular shape of the coastline gave rise to a new
    planning approach based on ring roads and radial arteries. The Corniche is perceived
    as a public space and a marker of Doha’s city edge; initiating a dynamic dialogue
    between blue and urban scapes. One of the challenges of urbanism in Doha is spatial
    division and social segregation, yet the Corniche remains one of the few places
    where all communities of the city come together, acting as a social interface
    that is accessible without cars. Today, reweaving the public realm is one of the
    major potential legacies to achieve the Qatar National Vision 2030 for a sustainable
    future, with the potential for Corniche Park and Promenade to become more integrated
    and accessible, with improved connections to the city and surroundings, as well
    as increased social and cultural diversity. Since its construction in 1970s, the
    Corniche has been the site of numerous urban and landscape projects developed
    through competitions sponsored by the government. In 1998 the Doha Corniche Project
    Competition (INNOCENT 2003) involved Jean Nouvel, Zaha Hadid, Martha Schwartz,
    and other international architects but none of the designs was implemented. Recent
    landscape and urban design projects envisaged for the Corniche to include mangrove
    parks, beaches, and biodiversity biomes, following new trends in landscape design
    that are shifting toward ecological planning, systems thinking, and more holistic
    and sustainable approaches to designing public spaces and urban environment. Landscape
    Urbanism concepts involve bio-cultural landscape ecologies, linear urban infrastructures,
    social and economic functions of landscapes and ecological networks (Grichting
    2016a, b). To sum up, the Corniche can be defined as: A backbone that ties esplanades,
    public spaces and parks; A landscape system physically connecting city with sea;
    A cultural and social interface for diverse communities; A climatic front bringing
    sea breeze into the city; An ecosystem edge bringing marine & terrestrial ecosystems.
    9.8.2 Cyan Corniche Cyan is a color halfway between Blue and Green in the color
    wheel, representing the fusion between the Blue and Green Urbanism and thus representing
    the project goal and intention. The Cyan Corniche project is a proposal to implement
    Saline Agriculture in the Corniche of Doha, tackling the issues of urban agriculture,
    food security, scarcity of ground water as well as sustainable urban realm and
    landscapes and a productive waterfront for the city. The project aims to create
    a sustainable agricultural landscape in the waterfront of Doha, which serves functionally
    as a means to increase food security, as well as providing sustainable public
    realm that allows interaction and engagement with the environment. Cyan Corniche
    proposes resilient planning for urban food during a critical time in Qatar’s history.
    The recent embargo on Qatar in June 2017 interrupted food supplies from Saudi
    Arabia, one of the country’s main supplier of food. This project addresses Qatar’s
    food security and integrates local culture and agricultural heritage into modern
    urban food practices. It creates a multifunctional Green and Blue infrastructure
    to serve today’s and tomorrow’s challenges within the dynamic urban area. It enhances
    Doha’s waterfront space, making it into an interactive, productive and ecological
    space for all communities – human and non-human. It provides a platform for regional
    and international exchange of innovation and technologies on saline and urban
    agriculture. The project approaches the Corniche through a site analysis of the
    flows of food, water, energy and waste. (Fig. 9.7) While it considers all potential
    and future water sources on the site, it focuses on saline agriculture as a nature-based
    solution to many of the country’s resource and ecological problems. Fig. 9.7 Cyan
    Corniche. Water, Energy, Wast and Food systems. (Source: Asmaa S Al-Mohannadi,
    Albandari S Al-Harami, Heba S. Elgahani) Full size image The project responds
    to a number of existing problems such as food insecurity, scarcity of groundwater,
    global warming and climate change, rising sea levels, decrease in biodiversity,
    unsuitable land for agriculture, lack of sustainable public realm, organic waste
    management, lack of urban trees, air pollution and CO2-emissions and energy efficiency.
    The solutions proposed in the project include local urban agriculture, alternative
    methods of irrigation using Treated Sewage Effluent (TSE), saltwater, produced
    water from the towers in West Bay, coastal protection infrastructures, species
    habitats, public spaces for inclusive social interaction, waste recycling, renewable
    energy sources, innovative technologies and applied research on sea farming. An
    innovative strategy for enhancing land and water availability is the use of salted
    soils and salted water, in a strategy designated as saline agriculture. Saline
    agriculture can be defined as the profitable and integrated use of genetic resources
    (plants, animals, fish, insects and microorganisms) and improved agricultural
    practices to obtain better use from saline land and saline irrigation water on
    a sustained basis (Saline Agriculture Worldwide 2018). It is a rich collection
    of possible systems for the use of saline resources. The components of these systems
    will vary according to the needs of the farmers and the capabilities of the land
    and water. The saline water that may be used in halophyte crop irrigation can
    be, for example, seawater, salt-contaminated phreatic sheets, brackish water (from
    estuaries), drainage water from other plantations, drainage water from human areas,
    such as sewage, or even water derived from aquaculture waste. Qatar is a peninsula
    and an arid region, much of its land is unsuitable for agricultural activities
    due to salinized soil and the dominance of coastal deserts. The agricultural use
    of saline water or soils can benefit Qatar, specifically by the integration of
    salt-tolerant plants that can utilize land and water unsuitable for salt-sensitive
    crops (glycophytes). Salt-tolerant crops and salt-tolerant vegetable gardening
    can produce high salt tolerant to low salt tolerant plants. High salt-tolerant
    plants include beets, bell peppers, broccoli, cabbage, kale, loquats, spinach,
    tomatoes. Moderate salt-tolerant plants include carrots, cauliflower, lettuce,
    peas, potatoes, squash, sweet corn. Low salt-tolerant plants include beans, celery,
    cucumbers, radishes. The sea water can be mixed with sweet water to create different
    degrees of salinity, dependent on the type of vegetable desired. Moreover, common
    halophytes of Qatar were investigated including Aeluropus Lagopoides, Anabasis
    Setifera, Arthrocnemum Glaucum, Avicennia Marina, Cressa Cretica, Cyperus Conglomeratus,
    Halocnemum Strobilaceum, Halopeplis Perfoliatam, Limonium Axiliare, Salicornia
    Europaea, Salsola Marina, Suaeda Aegyptiaca, Suaeda Vermiculata and Zygophyllum
    Qatarense. Based on site analysis and several case studies, the comprehensive
    Master Plan allows free flooding of the sea and recreates a canal that marks the
    former shoreline of Doha, bringing salt water into Al Bidaa park to create salt
    water lakes and provide water for the halophytes and productive landscapes. (Fig.
    9.8) The design project radiates out from the circle of the Corniche edge, into
    the city landscapes and out to the sea (Fig. 9.9) The island in the center is
    used for composting of organic materials and builds up a natural landscape through
    the accumulated materials. It is extended with breakwaters to protect the corniche
    edge from storm surges. Along the corniche, towards the historic center to the
    south, a series of piers jut out into the water, recalling the former jetty’s
    that were used to dock ships, before the modern city port was constructed. These
    piers host community herb gardens with local species and medicinal and culinary
    herbs as well as productive gardens with halophytes. In the center of the Corniche,
    the road is buried underground and the Al Bidda park extends into the sea, creating
    a more natural edge with the city. Towards the northern edge of the corniche,
    towards the business district of West Bay, a system of boardwalks follow the curve
    of the corniche, and are intermingled with urban and floating mangroves, creating
    a biodiverse ecosystem that attracts birds and fish species. The abandoned towers
    in the West Bay are restructured to host hydroponic and aquaponic farming, increasing
    food security in the district. Radiating out to the sea, a series of oyster reefs
    provide food and protect the land from flooding and coastal erosion. The oysters
    also filter water and remove nitrogen, which is the cause of algae blooms and
    dead zones in coastal waters. Further afield, we find floating gardens and fisheries.
    The Old Doha Port, which is no longer used by commercial boats, aside from cruise
    boats, is converted with underwater farms, market zones, and a waste collection
    and transformation center. Fig. 9.8 Plan for Cyan Corniche. (Source: Asmaa S Al-Mohannadi,

    Full size image 9.9 Blue Green Design with Urban Water Systems Sustainable development
    must include water quantity and quality as indicators applied to both human and
    ecosystem health and this across a full range of land use, including urban agriculture
    and industry. New approaches to sustainable urban design – more precisely from
    the Landscape Urbanism field (Bélanger 2010) – propose that water supply and treatment
    infrastructure must be incorporated into Master Planning. Retrofitting existing
    cities and systems is possible and also necessary and requires coordinated efforts
    from government agencies, designers and citizens as well as the private sector.
    Increasing land and coastal flooding are bringing this imperative to the forefront
    of resilient urban design for cities and green and blue infrastructure will become
    the foundation for sustainable urbanism. The form and hardscapes of the city no
    longer play the ecological role required of a city today (Austin and Yu 2016).
    Because of rapid agricultural, industrial and social developments and the massive
    increase in Qatar’s population, conventional water resources have become seriously
    depleted and non-conventional alternatives such as desalinated water and, to a
    lesser extent, treated sewage effluent (TSE), now have an increasing role in the
    planning and development of an expanded water supply (Al Mohannadi 2010). Additional
    water resources are also currently being researched, such as saline water and
    halophytes for food and medicinal plants as well as microalgae, produced water
    from the oil and gas industries as well as from air conditioning units, and treated
    sewage effluent for food production. Until now, TSE is only used for landscaping,
    and this is regulated so as not to include public parks where children play. However,
    it is proposed in a number of the projects presented here to grow food. The current
    technology of water treatment is of very high quality, and it is possible to use
    the water for agriculture. Currently cultural issues and the regulation do not
    allow the use of TSE for food production that is for human consumption. In just
    35 years, the frequency of disasters worldwide has more than doubled, driven by
    climate-related and weather-related hazards like flooding, tropical cyclones and
    droughts. UN Water estimates that 90 per cent of all natural hazards are water-related
    (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction UNISDR 2015), and the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts even more extreme events going forward
    (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC 2018). For the year 2017, the
    Standing Committee of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands approved Wetlands for
    Disaster Risk Reduction as the theme for World Wetlands Day, so as to ‘raise awareness
    and to highlight the vital roles of healthy wetlands in reducing the impacts of
    extreme events such as floods, droughts and cyclones on communities, and in helping
    to build resilience’ (RAMSAR 2017). Wetlands are essentially land areas that are
    flooded with water, either seasonally or permanently. This way they form a natural
    buffer against disasters. The Ramsar Convention website sums up much of their
    significance: ‘Along the coastline, wetlands act as a natural protective buffer.
    For example, they helped avoid more than USD625 million in damages from Hurricane
    Sandy in 2012. Inland, wetlands act as a natural sponge, absorbing and storing
    excess rainfall and reducing flooding. During the dry season, they release the
    stored water, delaying the onset of droughts and reducing water shortages. When
    well-managed, wetlands can make communities resilient enough to prepare for, cope
    with and bounce back from disasters even stronger than before’ (RAMSAR 2017).
    Landscapes and ecosystems everywhere around the world are increasingly threatened
    by urbanisation. There are many types of wetlands, from coastal to inland, and
    from freshwater to saltwater. There are also natural as well as constructed wetlands.
    Qatar has several important coastal wetland areas, mainly mangrove ecosystems,
    which are important not only for the habitats and biodiversity, but also for their
    contribution towards building resilience against coastal erosion and acting as
    an interface between coastal and terrestrial ecosystems (Gulf Times 2017). Qatar
    also has some very interesting constructed wetlands. These were not initially
    designed as wetlands but were built as ponds to receive excess TSE (Treated Sewage
    Effluent). Gradually, as in the case of the Abu Nakhla Wetland, these ponds naturally
    evolved over time with riparian vegetation, creating habitats for sedentary and
    migratory birds. These wetlands are important as they create habitats for biodiversity
    and landing spots for migratory birds, as well as become natural landscapes that
    the people of Qatar and visitors can enjoy. Students at Qatar University designed
    landscapes and urban developments for reconstructed wadis (Wadi Jalal) and artificial
    lagoons (near Al Raqqiyah farms and in urban areas) as well as remediating neighbourhood
    areas that suffer from flooding and water infiltration to create productive landscapes
    and leisure parks including butterfly parks. By using TSE and storm water in this
    manner it can be avoided that huge amounts of water are wasted by pumping it deep
    into the ground as there is no sensible use for it. In what ways can wetlands
    help urban planning of a city? If water management is better integrated into urban
    planning, recycled water, whether it is grey water, TSE, or storm water, can be
    used to create attractive urban landscapes. An integrated urban water system not
    only makes better use of all the types of water in a city, including seawater
    and TSE, but also creates attractive landscapes for inhabitants and a more resilient
    urban realm that can mitigate the impact of extreme weather, be it heavy rain
    or sandstorms. Urban Forestry, an emerging field in urban landscape planning,
    encourages the planting of trees to provide many urban ecosystem services, which
    include improving air quality, mitigating the urban heat island effect, producing
    food, creating shade, capturing CO2 and creating attractive and healthy landscapes
    for the city’s inhabitants. These urban forests and greenways can be created with
    the city’s waste water and storm water networks, as well as the sea water along
    the coastal areas. The following projects use recycled and alternative water sources
    to create natural systems and nature based approaches to resilient urban design.
    9.10 Blue-Green Belts and Networks. Urban Forestry and TSE This nature-based approach
    to urban planning and design is based on trees and citizens and contributes to
    improving air quality in the city, along with numerous other benefits and ecosystem
    services. The concept behind this is ‘better cities through better citizens’ (Food
    and Agriculture Organization, FAO 2016). The idea is that the urban forester becomes
    a better citizen. Urban forestry is the management of trees for their contribution
    to the physiological, sociological and economic well-being of urban society (Grey
    and Deneke 1986). There are multiple benefits from implementing a city-wide Tree
    Charter supported by local business and academic institutions to spotlight the
    importance of indigenous trees and plants in modifying microclimate, stabilising
    soils, beautifying the city and inspiring an urban forestry movement at local
    and city-wide level. An urban forestry program can also include a community heritage
    tree component, which would include the propagation of indigenous species from
    known heritage trees in the city, with certain areas of the city promoted as urban
    forest reserves (Gibbons 2018). The rapid urbanization in Qatar leads to environmental
    challenges. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Qatar is number 12
    among the 20 most polluted cities (WHO 2016). This is primarily because of its
    dominant fossil fuel industry and consumption. Additionally, due to its geographic
    and climatic conditions, on a yearly basis Qatar faces several sand storms that
    affect the health of its citizens. Moreover, the rapid urbanization is not always
    accompanied by sufficient or suitable green spaces. Qatar National Vision 2030
    (QSA 2008) defines the five major challenges in the development of the country
    and four main pillars, by which the challenges must be addressed. Environmental
    development and sustainability is one of the four pillars with which Qatar’s future
    development must be aligned. The project on Urban Forestry aims to improve the
    urban environment of Qatar using minimum resources to create a maximum of ecosystem
    services. Urban Forestry in Qatar is expected to build more resilient landscapes
    through better resource management and to respond to major environmental challenges
    through an Urban Forestry (UF) approach, using excess TSE (Treated Sewage Effluent).
    It delivers a number of ecosystem services, as well as shade and leisure landscapes
    using a waste resource, TSE that is currently being discharged into the sea or
    into the ground as it is in excess quantities due to the increasing desalination
    and water recycling. The Urban Forestry project aligns with the projected Green
    Belt that surrounds the city of Doha, and branches through its major transportation
    routes towards the heart of the city, creating a system of Greenways. The Green
    Belt is proposed as a Productive Greenbelt for the growth of food, filtering dust
    storms, leisure landscapes and biodiversity conservation, and links via the green
    network to the coastal forestation of the Corniche. A larger Green Climatic Greenbelt
    is proposed beyond the city limits to filter the frequent dust storms and to mitigate
    their effect on the city, as well as to capture carbon. The project builds on
    the concept of the Greenbelt from the Qatar National Development Framework (MME
    2016). The research proposes scenarios and a series of urban interventions for
    Urban Forestry in Doha. The forestation concept is developed to address a series
    of urban functions: 1. Coastal protection; 2. Urban connections; 3. Urban protection;
    4. Climatic protection. An analytical study of the concept was taken into consideration
    starting with climate, accessibility, agriculture and existing functions in proximity
    to the green belt. Moreover, the various systems of TSE, trunk water and infrastructure
    were investigated for the implementation of the project and its feasibility. (Fig.
    9.10) Additionally, an analysis taking into consideration the stakeholders and
    actors, and the policies and regulations was considered that would build up the
    legislative framework of the project for implementation. Finally, various nodes
    within the proposed green shield were further developed into more focused design
    proposals. These design scenarios were presented to professionals from landscape
    forestry, urban planning and urban legislation, as well as water policy fields
    to discuss the feasibility and implementation. Fig. 9.10 Systems used for the

    focused on different layers: (Fig. 9.11) 1. The Climatic Green Belt focusing on
    forests and fields; 2. The Urban Green Belt, which is more people and society
    focused; 3. The Green corridors, connecting the urban and agricultural greenways;
    4. The Coastal Green-Blue Belt which interfaces the city and the sea. Fig. 9.11

    of the QNDF 2032 (MME 2016), this research contributes to knowledge on green and
    blue infrastructure, and it is an opportunity to understand the merits of the
    green belt in Qatar and Drylands, and to start to envision the implementation
    of such a project at multiple scales. 9.11 Blue Oasis. Constructed Wetlands and
    Wildlife Conservation Green and blue infrastructure are well-known natural features
    in cities. Wetlands are found in virtually all cities and because wetland ecosystems
    have both terrestrial and aquatic characteristics, they represent both types of
    infrastructure. And because the colors green and blue together make turquoise,
    urban wetlands provide turquoise services. Urban wetlands designed to treat wastewater
    effluent are expected to provide nutrients and the uptake of contaminants (Childers
    et al. 2015). In Qatar, one of the largest inland water features is the Abu Nakhla
    Wetland, which equals approximately the size of the Doha Corniche Bay. Constructed
    wetlands are conceived as productive ecosystems that provide benefits and services
    to the people and contribute positively to the overall ecosystem. They are defined
    as ‘areas of marsh, fen, peat land, or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent
    or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including
    areas of marine waters, the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters’
    (Hollis 1990). Negative factors influencing the wetlands involve adverse climatic
    effects, environmental changes, non-sustainable alternative uses, and disruption
    (Babiker and Osman 2012). A few of the wetlands in arid zones are supported by
    locally generated water supplies. Abu Nakhla Wetlands is a treated wastewater
    pond that was constructed in 1979 and was established in 1982 (Abdulfatih et al.
    2002). The wetland is located approximately 12 km outside the city of Doha along
    the southern borders of Abu Nakhla village It is a special place for both humans
    and the wildlife as it is considered as a more moist point than in other regions.
    The pond is supplied by municipal water (TSE) on a regular basis. Treated municipal
    water from Doha-West and Doha-South wastewater treatment plants is discharged
    to the pond. The treated wastewater pond is approximately 37-38 m elevated above
    sea level while the water depth ranges from one to two meters. The capacity of
    the lake is five million sqm., taking 2 km length by 2 km width. In case of rain,
    the water level rises without changing the outer boundaries of the lake. Since
    2006, the borders have been fixed so that it does not flood and damage the surrounding
    areas. Presently, at Abu Nakhla, the treated sewage effluent is used solely for
    fodder crops for animals and for landscape irrigation. In this project, the optimization
    of treated wastewater is proposed with systems that enable recycling. Implemented
    systems emphasize maintaining further treatment to Abu Nakhla treated wastewater
    through constructive wetlands technologies. The purified water could then be used
    for irrigation of animal fodder, landscaping, and irrigation of crops. The resulting
    food production can be sold in the market to serve local demands and support diversification
    of the economy. Harvest waste can be recycled and composted to become natural
    fertilizers that can be utilized in the food production process. To overcome cultural
    sensitivies, the food products can be labelled to indicate the water source. Such
    a system supports sustainability and contributes to the local economy in an environmentally
    friendly way. Students worked on a regeneration plan for Abu Nakhla, to mitigate
    the negative effects of the pond such as seepage, smell, inaccessibility, danger,
    etc. and to design it as a biodiversity hotspot and eco-leisure zone. An analysis
    of the plant and animal species, including sedentary and migratory birds, was
    previously conducted (Abdulfatih et al. 2002) and used as a basis for the design
    of the eco-reserve and habitats. Proposals to resolve the seepage through bio-drainage,
    that is the plantation of deep rooted and fast-growing trees, would contain the
    waters of the pond, provide shade for public areas as well as habitats for wildlife.
    A zoning was established with priority and core conservation areas, as well as
    more active zones for the public, including a botanical garden, food growing zones,
    community gardens, and a Center for Research on Wetlands in Drylands (Fig. 9.12).

    Al-Qahtani, Amna Al-Jehani, Ayla Shawish, Dalal Harb, Esra Mutlu, Nada Ghanem
    and Rana Awwad) Full size image Unfortunately, despite efforts to save Abu Nakhla,
    it has been decommissioned as a TSE pond and is gradually drying out. On a positive
    note, the planning authorities and Public Works are constructing a landscape,
    along the same lines as the proposed project for Abu Nakhla, at Doha North Sewage
    Treatment Plant. This will become a landscape for nature, biodiversity and leisure
    and hopefully will lead the way for other similar projects in Qatar. However,
    this is a constructed landscape being built from scratch, whereas the Abu Nakhla
    landscape evolved naturally over 40 years. (Fig. 9.13) So there is a great economic
    cost to creating fast, artificial landscapes as opposed to planning and allowing
    more natural landscapes to emerge that function with recycled water and also act
    as ecological infrastructures for water management. Fig. 9.13 Abu Nakhla Reservoir.

    Full size image 9.12 Blue Ways for West Bay. Transit Oriented Development and
    Public Space Located nearby Doha city’s coastline, West Bay is the major business
    district in Qatar. It was built on reclaimed land as part of the Master Plan by
    Pereira and Associates for the Doha Corniche (Adham 2008, p. 233). It was designed
    as a typical downtown business center, car oriented with huge spaces dedicated
    to open parking, and very little public space or connectivity. As part of future
    plans for a Transit Orient City the district will host two of the major train
    stations on the Red Line rail route, the West Bay Central Station (WCS) and the
    Doha Exhibition and Convention Centre (DECC). This design project combines new
    public spaces generated by the transit stations with landscape connections along
    blue ways, urban rivers that are supplied with treated waste water, storm water
    or sea water. (Fig. 9.14) Currently, there is a large outlet for TSE at the Sheraton
    Hotel, which is discharged directly into the sea. These blue ways will be landscaped
    with bio-landscapes to operate the bio-remediation of the water before it enters
    the sea. (Fig. 9.15). Fig. 9.14 Master Plan for Blue Ways with Transit Oriented
    Development. (Source: Dina Saleh, Angelica Caccam) Full size image Fig. 9.15 View
    of Blueways for West Bay (Source: Dina Saleh, Angelica Caccam) Full size image
    The project begins with an analysis of the topography and natural hydrology of
    the West Bay, and links it the integrated water system, where waste water from
    the surrounding buildings will be directed to the blue ways, after treatments.
    Storm water and other TSE sources can be cleaned through the landscape, so that
    the water that arrives at the public spaces of the Corniche, and is led into the
    sea, is cleaned. 9.13 Conclusions With the blockade of Qatar in June 2017, including
    Saudi Arabia through which 80% of its food transited, Qatar had to rapidly resource
    its imports of food through Iran and Turkey as well all its building- and raw
    materials. While it has ample reserves of non-renewable energy through its offshore
    gas fields, it relies on desalination for the majority of its sweet water resources.
    Additionally, the air quality in the main city of Doha is very poor because of
    the effects of the fossil fuel industries and automobile reliance. While it may
    seem contradictory to propose Nature-based urbanism in a desert or dryland, that
    is in a place that does not naturally have much green nature, Nature-based urbanism
    that works with natural resources and systems, creating regenerative systems,
    is introduced in this chapter. The city as a regenerative system is like an organism,
    or ecosystem, that runs on positive and negative feedback loops. Capturing increasing
    amounts of water, dust and organic waste provides resources and materials for
    a new urban organic layer, which is key to urban sustainability. Materials brought
    to the city, whether it is water from the sea or dust from storms, have the potential
    to transform a desert into an oasis. These material streams become a steady source
    of power for this layer composed of parks, trees, water elements, wetlands, green
    roofs, wild nature, urban farms and collective gardens. These layers reduce the
    heat island effect of the city, produce a comfortable microclimate, encourage
    pedestrian movability, and create an attractive public entourage and a new urban
    ecological luxury (Roggema et al. 2017). A recent conference in Qatar on Future
    Landscape and Public Realm (Qatar University 2017) brought together the landscape
    industry, consultants, the public sector, and academia. The future of the landscape
    industry in relation to the Gulf crisis was discussed. Aside from the opportunities
    that any crisis offers, with more resource efficiency, self-reliance and resilience,
    there is also a concern about the status of landscape projects in the hierarchy
    of economic interests and budgets, as well as in the project management process.
    With reduced spending, landscapes projects, which are still considered beautifying
    amenities, are often largely reduced in budget or even eliminated. Landscape departments
    have been closed in important public works and planning administrations. At the
    same time, the landscape industry is coming up with innovative and highly cost-reduced
    solutions such as use of native plants and reducing water consumption, but these
    projects are not being accepted in the planning and construction authorization
    permission process. It is time to elevate landscape to the role of infrastructure—and
    to position it as a foundation for urban and architectural projects. In the words
    of the great landscape architect Ian McHarg (1992), who has inspired many landscape
    urbanists, it is imperative that we work with, and not against, nature in shaping
    our cities and environments. This requires a shift in the conceptualization of
    urban plans to begin with natural systems and integrate technological solutions,
    with the aim of giving back to nature and the biosphere (Grichting 2017). Perhaps
    the Gulf crisis will be an opportunity for landscape urbanism to take a leading
    role and take its place in the design and development of future Gulf cities and
    landscapes. Hopefully, designers and scientists will continue to envision common
    futures across boundaries, looking beyond the borders to create more efficient,
    resilient and sustainable systems at the local and regional scale. As with the
    Blue Peace initiative in the Middle East (Waslekar 2011): ‘an innovative approach
    (…) for harnessing and managing collaborative solutions for sustainable regional
    water management'', water can become an agent for future nature-based solutions
    in the Gulf and in the Region. Additionally, a less anthropocentric, and more
    biodiverse approach will enable us to re-create habitats for some of the endangered
    and lost species, and perhaps one day bring the dolphins back in to Doha bay’.

  description: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) forms an interconnection between
    machines and functions with an internet connectivity. These IIoT devices enhance
    manufacturing or industrial process as they are interconnected with each other
    to perform industrial applications using intelligent industrial operations with
    advanced data analytics techniques. By using IIoT, the industries can be able
    to use real-time supply chain methods for tracking status of materials, equipments,
    and products as they move out to consumers. This may interrelate the consumers,
    suppliers, and manufactures to get updated information about the product status
    in applications such as ERP, PLM, and other software systems. As we move from
    manpower to digital technology, IoT revolutionized the digital industry in the
    fields of agriculture, city infrastructure, medical care, and healthcare. However,
    IIoT has brought a next big boom in the business market with smart industrial
    technologies. At present, the industries leverage the benefits of IIoT in water

    Innovations in Communication and Computing ((EAISICC)) Abstract Industrial Internet
    of Things (IIoT) forms an interconnection between machines and functions with
    an internet connectivity. These IIoT devices enhance manufacturing or industrial
    process as they are interconnected with each other to perform industrial applications
    using intelligent industrial operations with advanced data analytics techniques.
    By using IIoT, the industries can be able to use real-time supply chain methods
    for tracking status of materials, equipments, and products as they move out to
    consumers. This may interrelate the consumers, suppliers, and manufactures to
    get updated information about the product status in applications such as ERP,
    PLM, and other software systems. As we move from manpower to digital technology,
    IoT revolutionized the digital industry in the fields of agriculture, city infrastructure,
    medical care, and healthcare. However, IIoT has brought a next big boom in the
    business market with smart industrial technologies. At present, the industries
    leverage the benefits of IIoT in water industry for smart water management by
    enabling smart water meters, detectors, and irrigation methods. In case of oil
    and gas industries, IIoT devices help to reduce instant leakages and in case of
    any unavoidable situation alert systems are also used to maintain security for
    the employees. As an exponential growth, IIoTs witnessed in auto industry with
    some boarding impacts such as product tracing, transportation management, enhanced
    routes, and motorist behavior. The IIoT systems are used in integrated smart transportation
    system for following up the real-time activities of the driver as well as the
    vehicle and notifying drivers regarding potential dangers on the roads. Even though
    healthcare is a vast ecosystem, the IoT has been adopted rapidly in healthcare

    monitoring systems. In this, new digital transformation of industries to IIoT
    which uses secure operating protocols for an Open Platform Communication infrastructure.
    It uses IoT protocols for enhanced remote asset monitoring with increased operational

    chapter PDF Introduction Manufacturing industries experience complex difficulties
    in building supply chain connection in this technological business world. To develop
    a successful system, new concepts such as Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Technology,
    and Cyber Systems have gained more importance in the industrial sector including
    manufacturing units. The evolution in the digital era defines the Fourth Industrial
    Revolution (Industry 4.0) and it is also recognized as German high-tech strategy
    for future manufacturing industries [1]. Industry 4.0 produces overwhelming results
    by transforming the manufacturing and production process of industries. In addition,
    Industry 4.0 will play a vital role in transforming well-established companies
    into Smart industries with the help of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Systems.
    A distributed approach produces an immense value in Industry 4.0, which highlights
    self-determining organization of processes and smart objects throughout the network
    by collaborating on the processes of real and virtual world [2]. The development
    of incorporated processes and human-machine communication motivate involvedness
    and liveliness for data transmission between industrial chains [3]. With the assistance
    of Industry 4.0, industries gain lot of operational efficiency in time, cost,
    and production. Designing and developing the infrastructure of IoT offer common
    platforms via cloud systems between associates in supply chains; consequently,
    business processes get optimized [4]. The notion of Industry 4.0 has gained great
    significance in the recent years. The increase in the usage of computerized systems
    after the Third Revolution, Industry 4.0 deals with developing more digitized
    systems and network incorporation via smart systems. Through Industry 4.0, smart
    systems would facilitate the substitution of human beings in assured tasks and
    effortlessness in the working atmosphere. As IIoT features are similar to that
    of IoT in the industrial sector, and Industry 4.0 concepts are effectively subsets
    of IIoT, as shown in Fig.11.1, in identifying the difference between IoT and IIoT.
    Even though the fundamental concepts of both are the same, i.e., interrelated
    smart devices that permit remote sensing, data collection, processing, monitoring,
    and control are the parameters that recognize the IIoT as a subset of IoT, there
    are the strong necessities for constant operation and safety as well as the equipped
    technology employed in the industrial sector. Therefore, this chapter includes
    an evolutional study of IIoT in Section “Evolution of IIOT”. Section “Innovations
    and Recent Technologies in IIoT” evaluates the innovations and recent technologies
    used, Section “Protocols in IIoT” discusses the protocols used for designing this
    environment, and finally Section “Conclusion” concludes this chapter. Fig. 11.1
    Evolution of technology Full size image Evolution of IIOT The Industrial Internet
    of Things (IIoT) is a commercial technology, and because of its major benefits,
    it occupies a major part in the development of an industry. These technological
    developments have made innovations in the implementation of smart factories and
    predictive technology. As the machines are equipped with sensors, industries train
    the employees on the supply and delivery chains with the specific industrial tools
    to monitor and reply the output from the sensors and companies can be able to
    rationalize and restructure the industrial business operations. The Industrial
    Internet of Things (IIoT) discusses how the interconnected sensors, instruments,
    and other devices are interrelated together with workstations for industrial applications,
    including manufacturing and energy management. This connectivity permits data
    collection, exchange, and analysis, theoretically facilitating developments in
    efficiency and productivity as well as other economic benefits. The IIoT is an
    evolution of a distributed control system (DCS) that allows for a automation by
    using cloud computing to improve and enhance the method controls. The big data
    and analytics are preliminary to influence the end users. IIoT is flagging the
    method for a broad change of predictable business processes from gathering to
    delivery to preservation to fabrication. Warehouse sensors permit firms to monitor
    stock cleverly so that shares and supplies are well-organized whenever needed.
    This prevents overstocking and under stocking of essential items. Sensors along
    the delivery chain make it likely to track shipments from the moment they leave
    the factory premises to the moment they arrive at the customer premises. Sensors
    along the production line lead to timely detection of potential breakdowns. By
    depending on projecting care to fix problems before they happen, companies sidestep
    costly interruptions and disruptions in production. All these exhibitions improve
    efficiency, minimize unnecessary expenses, and maximize quality. Contemporary
    Responses and Mass Facilities IIoT has designed an alteration in the organization
    and updated expectancies. The smooth access up to the moment records, products,
    and services that our mobile devices provide us has caused an improved demand
    for real-time systems and responses, which is even more common in IIoT. As sensors
    provide present perception and statistics about warehouses and machines, a greater
    need for immediate, or real-time, services has arisen. The purpose is obvious:
    IIoT, this connection of business machines and sensors up the internet and different
    devices, is useless without mechanisms in area that react up to the moment notifications
    and updates. There is no experience in understanding about forthcoming issues
    or shortages if there is no manner up to date respond with the necessary speed
    and accuracy that avoid potential issues. This shortage has marked a new beginning
    to an entire different innovation: crowd offerings. Businesses pool collectively
    all their assets—employees, partners, subcontractors, freelance professionals,
    and specialists—to create a pool of available service vendors to respond to the
    elevated demand generated through actual-time services. This crowd is based on
    discipline provider control software program and their mobile devices to live
    informed of service requests, product information, consumer records, and more.
    Industry 4.0 The industrial IoT 4.0 is a suitable method for processing data such
    as sensor output, consumer input, identification of the service provider availability,
    knowledge provider, and other various effective real-time responses given by mobile
    devices and also gives an idea about the next step to industrial revolution. As
    the evolution of IoT to IIoT after twenty years created a potential evident in
    the new industrial technology. To imagine the continuous change in technology
    and redefine the daily lifestyle and work over the course made a remarking foundation
    in the field of IIoT. The connections between devices and accumulation of raw
    data with the help of Big Data Analytics made the industries to rely on artificial
    intelligence (AI) and edge computing for processing and analysis. Revolution of
    IoT In the revolution of IoT , Kevin Ashton created awareness that physical objects
    can be linked to a network during 1999. By this it is known that information to
    computers no longer needed to be programmed and given in the form of functions
    but sense the world around them by fingers without any added information given
    by the humans this process created a new computational technology era. IoT has
    evolved in all the perspectives from GPS to smart homes and smart cars to health
    and fitness monitoring and other smart environments and also sets a stage for
    the next industrial revolution by giving way to IIoT. As an example, a smart home
    owner controls his home devices by working on an app on his mobile by just making
    some clicks and swipes for switching on the AC or heater and also checks the status
    of the refrigerator for pickup things from supermarket. Other apps from the mobile
    could be able to update the real-time status and current scenario around their
    living environments. The smart application system software is developed to perform
    the user-defined task much faster and controls the devices automatically by connecting
    with internet. The inputs and outputs from the devices can be viewed by using
    electronic gadgets, and also the overall process can be analyzed. Built-in sensors
    are used to make a trustworthy connectivity between devices for better determination
    of data and sequence of transmission while performing the required task. Versions
    of IIoT In the past centuries, goods and other necessary products are manufactured
    by using hand or by using animals. However, at the beginning of the nineteenth
    century manufacturing and production drastically introduced industry 1.0 and other
    operations rapidly developed based on the requirements [5]. The different versions
    of IIoT are listed as follows. Industry 1.0 During the 1800s, water- and steam-powered
    machines were developed to aid the workers who started the industrial revolution
    1.0 as the production capabilities increased and also business grew to a next
    level where the owners, managers, and other employees serving customers used steam-powered
    engines and water as a source of power. This led to a lot of changes in textile
    industries and constituted a major part of the British economy. Industry 2.0 At
    the beginning of twentieth century, electricity became the primary source of energy
    for functioning the machineries. The users felt easier to use when compared with
    water- and steam-powered individual machines. Eventually, new machines were designed
    to use electric power sources and also with portability. To increase the efficiency
    and effectiveness in manufacturing units, this period created a drastic development
    in major management programs where labors works for a part of job by increasing
    the productivity. The concept of assembly lines increased mass production. Lean
    manufacturing principles further enabled manufacturing industries to improve the
    quality and also produce good products. The electrified machines in factories
    massively increased the production rates. The mass production from steel industries
    helped introduce railways into the system. Innovations in chemical industries
    lead to the invention of the synthetic dye, which marked a primitive state in
    the fabric design with various colors. Industry 3.0 After a few decades of the
    twentieth century electronic devices using transistor, integrated circuits chips
    made automated individual machines to supplement the use of operating workers.
    Later, developments were made in the software side to control the electronic hardware.
    By this embedded mechanism, the components are integrated where material planning
    is made by using enterprise resource planning tools where humans can plan, schedule,
    and track products from industry to the customer. The concept of supply chain
    management formalized the result of extended geographic dispersion. As the third
    revolution resulted in huge development in computers and information and communication
    systems, the industries lean on the digital technology in production that offered
    a Digital Revolution, which led to a change from analog and mechanical systems
    to digital systems. The digital era is also known as Information Age Industry
    4.0 In the twenty-firstt century, the industrial revolution 4.0 gets connected
    with IoT using manufacturing techniques to enable systems for sharing information
    and analyze and use it for performing intelligent actions. It creates a cutting-edge
    technology in additive manufacturing, robotics, artificial intelligence and other
    cognitive technologies, advanced materials, and augmented reality, according to
    the article [6]. The development of new technology Industry 4.0 was first developed
    during the later stages of the twentieth century. Manufacturing execution systems,
    shop floor control, and product life cycle management were farsighted concepts
    that lacked the technology needed to make their complete implementation possible.
    Although “Industry 4.0” is the common term referring to the fourth industrial
    revolution, academics still argue to appropriately define the methodology (Fig.
    11.2). Fig. 11.2 Industrial evolution Full size image Applications of IIoT 1.
    Industrial Automation Industrial automation is the most substantial and common
    application of IoT. Automation systems make machines and tools to function in
    an efficient way by using sophisticated software tools that act as an observer
    and make developments for succeeding process rehearsals. A greater level of improvement
    has been shown by machine automation with accuracy. Automation tools such as PLC
    (Programmable Logic Control) and PAC (Programmable Automation Control) use smart
    sensor networks associated with a central cloud system, which collect huge amount
    of data. Application-oriented software are designed to analyze the data that improves
    accuracy, efficiency, error control, and easy access and reduces man power in
    specific tasks in industrial automation. The industrial IoT provides solutions
    in connecting industries with major components such as machines, tools, and sensors
    for network connection. These components provide effective solutions to check
    the status, shipment, schedule maintenance, and also monitor the process flow
    overtime. 2. Smart Robotics Intelligent robots are developed by the industries
    based on the required specification and are created by IoT-enabled industries.
    By utilizing these robots, manufacturing units ensure smooth handling of tools
    and materials with efficiency and accuracy. Robots are designed to perform complex
    tasks with high embedded sensors that analyze real-time environment as an interface
    for man-machine interaction. Robotics networks are connected to cloud in a secure
    way for monitoring and controlling. Engineers and designers can be able to access
    and analyze the data to yield quick actions for product enhancements and also
    prevent any unexpected failure due to machine failure. 3. Predictive Maintenance
    Modern industrial machines are equipped with smart sensors for continuous monitoring
    of the current status of major components for detecting any critical issues before
    the system gets completely failed. The smart sensors notify even the maintenance
    warning to the centralized system and also send alert messages to the responsible
    teams for further processing. For every maintenance procedure, engineers are allotted
    with an analyzed schedule maintenance plans which do not affect the routine task
    and also unnecessary problems in the production line. Some unexpected machine
    failure may happen which leads to damage of products, delay in delivery, and also
    loss in business for producers. But in recent years, the development of technology
    has made maintenance of machines on real-time basis by storing the overall performance
    to a cloud system. History of each machines helps to process a predictive maintenance
    system. 4. Integration of Smart Tools/Wearables Workforce can perform its task
    with improved accuracy and efficiency by integrating smart sensors in tools and
    machines. Specially planned wearables and smart glass support workforces to reduce
    error and expand safety at the functioning environments. Smart wearables can be
    able to intimate the users by giving instant alert messages to employees during
    critical situations such as gas leak or fire. Wearables can be designed for monitoring
    health conditions of individuals continuously. 5. Smart Logistics Management Logistics
    is one of the major areas in many industries which needs continuous development
    to support increasing demands. Smart technology provides a perfect solution to
    solve complex operations and manage the delivery of goods to the customers efficiently.
    Marketing monsters such as Amazon uses drones to deliver goods to their customers.
    Advanced technologies such as drones offer better efficiency, accessibility, speed
    and require less manpower. However, initial investments are huge compared to conventional
    methods and implementation has limitations. Airline is an added major industry
    that uses IoT for performing its daily operations at the manufacturing and predictive
    maintenance of planes in service. At the manufacturing plant, airline companies
    use IoT solutions to track thousands of components required for every single day
    at work. Unified management of portfolios helps to manage its supplies effortlessly.
    6. Software Integration for Product Optimization Smart analytics of any IoT system
    enhances the possibilities of the system for optimization and improvement. Many
    industries and major companies implement a customized software for deep analysis
    of huge data collected by the sensor networks and machines. The analyzed data
    gives a better overview of process improvement strategies for optimizing the products.
    The analysis of data and its behavior patterns provide cost-effective solutions
    in a period of time. As though analysis of large amount of data was very hard,
    inaccurate and more time consuming before the introduction of software tools.
    7. Smart Package Management The manufacturing units deliver its products without
    any damage by using IoT technology for package management, which gives a lot of
    convenience and efficiency. The smart sensors embedded on the packages could be
    able to detect the vibrations, atmospheric conditions such as temperature and
    humidity, and also they can be able to monitor the stages of packages and update
    the status periodically. Finally, the product delivery to customers is confirmed
    by sending messages. 8. Autonomous Vehicles Industries use automotive vehicles
    using the IoT technology by enabling self-driving system to carry goods within
    the company premises. These vehicles can be able to detect obstacles along its
    path and find another route to reach its prescribed destination using the GPS
    technology and wireless technology to communicate with the control station [7].
    Pros of Industrial Internet of Things Enhanced accuracy Optimization of product
    and process Analytical preservation and exploration Advanced competence Distant
    accessibility and observing Improved security Scalability of network Reduced energy
    consumption Challenges in IIoT Business becomes a constant battle for balancing
    the benefits of new technology with increased risks using sophisticated data.
    However, things are different in the case of critical infrastructure. Before adopting
    the IIoT with smarter components, it is wise to think about some challenges to
    overcome with efficient benefits. 1. Security: Major Concern Increased usage of
    digital connectivity in IIoT deployment sets to lot of security risks. As the
    machines and other collected data are placed in a common cloud environment, it
    leads to higher risks creating cyber attacks against the critical infrastructure.
    Even though the records are maintained in a common repository, all the security
    measures have to be placed by using protocols. 2. Preserving Visibility of “Things”
    Tracking of things make network engineers to build systems that show network visibility
    where the intruders can be able to easily analyze the valuable goods by getting
    a clue from either the customer or the suppliers. But the network could get started
    from the initial zero to potentially thousands of connected sensors and devices.
    It is really very hard to manage visibility for a single factory floor, but the
    Industrial Internet of Things will add additional challenges as you scale it globally.
    3. Protecting the Industrial Ethernet The industrial Ethernet creates a highway
    for building an IIoT environment where 100% internet connectivity is needed to
    perform each task. Hence, maintenance of systems can be made only through online
    services, but to go offline for maintenance can be guaranteed by using proper
    cables only for permanent usage with a logic of no data loss even during the connectivity
    issues. 4. Unified Legacy Systems and IIoT Infrastructure A unified legacy system
    environment using IoT infrastructure focuses less on security and more attention
    on performing optimizing operations and third-party integrations. But in case
    of IIoT environment, a new modernizing infrastructure is developed by adding smart
    technologies, which focuses individually on security, third-party intrusion, and
    on all stages of processing. 5. Data Storage As large amount of data being generated
    from different sources for any analysis to be made ensures rapid development of
    IIoT. All the raw data cannot be stored in the IIoT devices due to its less memory
    size and limited energy level. If the network is deployed in an unreachable or
    unreliable area, it may cause vulnerable threats leading to computational problems.
    To avoid the challenging aspects such as data processing, secure data storage,
    efficient data retrieval, and dynamic data collection in IIoT can be solved by
    designing a flexible and economic framework using for computing and cloud computing
    techniques. Innovations and Recent Technologies in IIoT The new innovations and
    implementation of recent technology have made the IIoT industries to enhance their
    process by increasing the production, marketing, and other business fields [8].
    The new innovations can be able to provide some list services to the industrial
    group. Collaborative Enterprise In the current scenario, companies undergo high
    pressure from customers, stakeholders, and global competitors. To improve the
    performance, there must be an operational improvement focusing on business process
    and collaborative concepts. A collaborative management model (CMM) provides information
    on the complex interactions, applications, collaborations, and processes that
    an enterprise demands. This framework model is a basis for organizing and controlling
    the key business processes in an enterprise (Fig. 11.3). Fig. 11.3 Collaborative
    enterprise Full size image Cybersecurity for Industries and Smart Cities Cybersecurity
    secures the information and conditions transmission through the network. An effective
    integration of other technologies creates its own boundaries increasing the reliability.
    Cybersecurity concerns are obstructing determinations to implement new approaches
    for lower costs and more-competitive business approaches [9,10,11,12,13]. Cybersecurity
    Advisory Service can help to address the challenges through perceptive reports,
    individual consultations with experienced analysts, and peer networking opportunities.
    This provision provides an ultimate way to learn what others are doing, how they
    are doing it, and the benefits they are achieving. It also enables the consumers
    to keep updated on the several new developments occurring in cybersecurity technologies,
    practices, and principles (Fig. 11.4). Fig. 11.4 Cybersecurity management system
    Full size image Digital Transformation A successful digital transformation promotes
    an organization in a process that transforms its current state to a desired future
    state. In case of production operations, there involves moving from a local, soloed,
    procedural operating model to a more comprehensive model that is integrated to
    the enterprise, responsive to customers and market changes, and optimized in the
    context of overall business performance. The transformation is made based on the
    following (Fig. 11.5): 1. Customer-focused Innovation 2. Transformation framework

    image Protocols in IIoT The IIoT infrastructure uses client/server protocols for
    transmitting data. These protocols are used to show how the request and response
    roles are executed and define the technique that is to be monitored in a smart
    industrial environment. OPC UA OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a machine-to-machine
    communication protocol used for industrial automation designed and developed by
    the OPC Foundation. Some distinguished characteristics are as follows: Emphasis
    on connecting with manufacturing tools and data gathering Open source and freely
    accessible and maintainable under GPL 2.0 license Cross platform not linked with
    the operating system or system language Service-oriented architecture (SOA) Essential
    complication Robust safety The vendors and organizations model their complex data
    to a service-oriented architecture of OPC UA protocol based on integral information
    model for forming statistical infrastructure. This protocol is used by industries
    such as pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, building automation, industrial robotics,
    security, manufacturing, and process control for functioning and performing optimistically.
    HTTP (REST/JSON) REST stands for Representational State Transfer that depends
    on a displaced client-server and primary infrastructures. In most of the cases,
    the transmission is made using the HTTP protocol. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    is a lightweight data-interchange format that makes easy and user friendly for
    reading and writing for the users. MQTT [14] MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
    is an ISO standard publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on the
    upper layer of the TCP/IP protocol. It is measured for connections with distant
    locations with limited network bandwidth. An MQTT system contains customers connecting
    with a server frequently called as “broker.” A client may be an originator of
    data or a subscriber. All the clients can get connected with a broker for performing
    a task. To access an information, the procedure is arranged in the form of a hierarchy
    where a publisher can distribute a new data set and control messages are sent
    to the broker. The brokers distribute the information to the clients who need
    to access it. The publisher need not have the information about the data subscribers
    and vice versa. While publishing the client first gets connected with a broker
    and sends a default message as an acknowledgment to the subscribers if the brokers
    detect the publishing client (Fig. 11.6). Fig. 11.6 Example for MQTT protocol
    Full size image CoAP [6] Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a protocol
    that is used to specify how the low-powered computing constrained devices can
    be operated in the IoT environment. This protocol was designed by Internet Engineering
    Task Force (ITEF) for enabling simple devices and controlling them to join IoT
    by using constrained network with low bandwidth and availability. CoAP functions
    as aHTTP for constrained devices that perform as a sensor or an actuator used
    in machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Finally, this protocol is designed
    for better reliability with low bandwidth and high congestion with reduced overhead
    (Fig. 11.7). Fig. 11.7 CoAP architecture Full size image DDS: The Data Distribution
    Service (DDS) is a networking standard that links the sensor nodes to the cloud
    server. DDS uses a connectionless data model with the ability to publish and subscribe
    to data with the desired quality of service (QoS). A DDS-based system does not
    interact with the application systems. A DataBus exists in the structure that
    robotically determines and attaches publishing and subscribing applications. The
    DataBus contests and imposes QoS. DDS disables problems related with system-to-system
    integration, such as lack of scalability, interoperability, and the ability to
    evolve the architecture. It allows plug and play simplicity, scalability, and
    especially high performance. Possibly the best way to understand DDS is to inspect
    the systems that use it. Applications extend to the areas such as healthcare,
    energy, defense, transportation, industrial automation, and communications industries.
    AMQP AMQP stands for Asynchronous Message Queuing Protocol , which is an open
    standard that uses binary application layer protocol designed for message-oriented
    middleware for communicating producers, brokers, and consumers through messages
    that increase coupling and scalability. The AMQP enables a wide range of submissions
    and assemblies to work together, irrespective of their inner designs, regulating
    enterprise messaging on an manufacturing scale (Fig. 11.8). Fig. 11.8 AMQP system
    Full size image Conclusion Thus, the IoT ecosystem has been adopted by the existing

    of Santa Cruz County implemented a project to improve irrigation management through
    providing field assistance to growers. A web-based decision support tool called
    CropManage (https://v3.cropmanage.ucanr.edu) developed by the University of California
    Cooperative Extension (UCCE) of Monterey County aids growers with irrigation scheduling.
    However, CropManage requires a flowmeter and a monitoring station to track water
    use in the field. In this article, we describe a device that was conceived as
    a low-cost alternative to Campbell Scientific flowmeter-monitoring stations that
    include data logger, modem, enclosure, battery, solar panel and charge regulator
    and cost above $2000. The device was designed for low-cost, ease of construction
    and with the capability of emulating the Campbell Scientific equipment functions
    and outputs. The devices were enabled with FTP communication to a central FTP
    server and were built with an Arduino MEGA, an Adafruit Datalogging Shield and
    an Adafruit FONA cellular modem. A voltage divider was added to monitor the external
    12 V battery voltage and a DC/DC converter was used to convert 12 V to 5 V. Each
    field station, including the device, battery, enclosure and solar panel has a
    total cost below $300, while the FTP server costs less than $100. The device was
    tested for two years in filed conditions and gave output equivalent to the Campbell
    Scientific equipment. The device is a low-cost technology that enables growers

    context In the framework of a basin-wide effort for water conservation in agriculture,
    the Resource Conservation District of Santa Cruz County implemented a partnership
    with the University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE) of Monterey County
    to increase irrigation efficiency in berry and vegetable production in the Pajaro
    Valley, California. One of the key features of the program is providing field
    assistance to growers to improve irrigation management. Dr. Michael Cahn, Farm
    Advisor for irrigation with the UCCE of Monterey County developed a web-based
    decision support tool called CropManage (https://v3.cropmanage.ucanr.edu) to aid
    growers with irrigation scheduling and nitrogen management [3]. The tool calculates
    irrigation requirements based on the crop evapotranspiration occurred from the
    latest irrigation event. To keep track of irrigation events of a specific ranch,
    CropManage has the capability to import datafiles generated by dataloggers installed
    in the field to monitor flowmeters. This also allows the software to keep records
    of irrigation amounts and provides a useful tool for growers to compare their
    irrigation water use against the evapotranspiration-based recommendations. Additionally,
    CropManage has also a data visualization feature to graph data from soil sensors,
    including tension, moisture and salinity that can be monitored by the same dataloggers
    used for flowmeters in the field. In the development and validation program to
    maintain and improve CropManage, the UCCE personnel employs research-grade datalogger
    from Campbell Scientific Inc. [13] to collect data from flowmeters and soil sensors.
    The Campbell Scientific setup employed includes a datalogger and a cellular network
    modem installed in the field and hard-wired to a flowmeter, and a central server
    to collect data from the logger by calling the modem. Additionally, the Campbell
    Scientific data collection system makes use of a Windows OS software (called LoggerNet)
    that facilitates and automates data collection from many datalogger-modem stations
    in the field. Files of field data are then stored in a network location that the
    CropManage server is white-listed to access. While essential for research efforts,
    the Campbell Scientific system is beyond the reach of the average commercial grower
    that would like to monitor water use and obtain recommendations from CropManage,
    particularly if they would like to monitor more than one field or ranch, as it
    is often the case. This is because one single Campbell Scientific flowmeter-monitoring
    station including logger, modem, enclosure, battery, solar panel and charge regulator
    costs above $2000. In this article, we describe a device that was essentially
    conceived as a low-cost alternative to the Campbell Scientific equipment. Our
    device was designed to replicate the functionality of the Campbell Scientific
    solution while affordability offers growers the opportunity to adopt CropManage
    as an irrigation management tool. The device was designed in order to meet the
    following requirements: 1. Low cost per unit (<$500) 2. Low power requirement
    3. Capability to count pulses from the “reed switch” output from the flowmeter
    4. Generating a comma-separated file with two-minute entries in the same format
    as Campbell Scientific datalogger and thus directly importable by CropManage 5.
    Ready availability of components and ease of construction 6. Capability to transfer
    files through the FTP protocol 7. Possibility to scale-up a large number of devices
    (up to 30 with the current software) 8. Ability to monitor battery voltage 9.
    Capability to run on 12 V batteries 10. Possibility to monitor soil sensors in
    addition to a flowmeter One key difference of our system from the Campbell Scientific
    setup is that the datalogger-modem stations in the field are automatically sending
    data into an FTP server after midnight, without the need of a central management
    software such as LoggerNet. Low-cost microcontrollers have become available during
    the last decade allowing a variety of applications that range from education,
    environmental variable monitoring, data collection for Internet of Things (IoT)
    applications etc. The use of these devices has also entered the research world,
    thanks to their affordability and intuitive programming language. These devices
    are being extensively applied in technology and in academic research, for instance
    in the physical [12] and biological sciences [5], thank to their affordability,
    portability, and accuracy [4]. Various applications of Arduino micro-controller
    in irrigation and water management are also common, particularly in soil moisture
    monitoring [11], [9], [8], [6] combined with monitoring of other environmental
    parameters [2], [7] and with the use of IoT applications [1] and allowing automation
    [10]. Unique caracteristics of our project compared to earlier work were: 1. Necessity
    to output data in a. csv text format that mimic the time stamp and file structure
    of the Campbbell Scientific data loggers. 2. Necessity of continuous sampling
    of flowmeter activity, compared with monitoring of an environmental variable (i.e.
    soil moisture) that can be sampled and any time interval. 3. Necessity to include
    in the field devices a modem to automate data transmission to the FTP server 2.
    Hardware description The hardware was composed by field datalogger-modem stations
    and by a central FTP server. The datalogger-modem stations were made from an Arduino
    MEGA 2560 Rev3 board, by attaching an Adafruit Assembled Data Logging shield for
    Arduino and an Adafruit FONA 800 2G cellular modem (Fig. 1). Download : Download
    high-res image (223KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The main components
    of the electronic hardware. The Adafruit datalogger shield was equipped with a
    3 V lithium coin cell battery (CR1220) to power the clock and with an 8 GB SDHC
    memory card to store data. The prototyping area of the shield was used to install
    additional hardware including a) a 4-terminal spring connector for the flowmeter
    output cables and external 12 V battery cables; b) connections to a DC/DC converter
    used to convert the battery voltage from 12 V to 5 V to power the Arduino microcontroller;
    and c) a voltage divider in order to allow the datalogger to monitor the 12 V
    battery voltage (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The components of the datalogging shield and
    prototyping area. The system took 4 external wires as inputs which came through
    the 4 spring connector terminals attached to the Adafruit datalogger shield. The
    4 spring connector terminals were used to attach to the shield the battery cable
    (two wires, 12 V and negative) and the flowmeter (two wires, positive and ground).
    The terminal attached to the 12 V battery positive wire was connected to the 12 V
    input pin of the DC/DC converter and to the voltage divider, while the negative
    battery wire terminal was connected to the ground pin of the MEGA. All connections
    were made using 22 AWG solid core wires and 60/40 lead rosin-core solder wire.
    The flowmeters used in the project are made by various manufacturers, including
    Netafim, Bermad, Seametrics and McCrometer. These flowmeters typically have two
    output cables, one positive and one negative connected to a reed switch that is
    triggered by a magnet. Every time that a certain quantity of water (usually 10
    gallons) flows through the flowmeter, the flowmeter magnet activates the reed
    switch to close the circuit between the flowmeter output wires. This sends a “pulse”
    to the datalogger which records 10 gallons passing. The wire terminal of the flowmeter
    positive output cable was connected to the MEGA digital pin 9 and the wire terminal
    of the flowmeter negative cable was connected to ground. Pin 9 was configured
    as an input and pulled-up, so that the microcontroller keeps a voltage of 5 V
    at the pin. Thus, when the reed switch closes the circuit between the positive
    and negative flowmeter output cables, it grounds pin 9 and the Arduino MEGA records
    10 gallons. Additionally, one of the optional LEDs on the datalogging shield was
    tied to digital pin 8 on the MEGA and pin 8 was coded to blink every time pin
    9 is grounded. This way the user can get a visual assessment that the datalogger
    is receiving pulses from the flowmeter. The DC/DC converter used was a Recom R-78E5
    linear regulator replacement DC/DC converter with output 5 V at 500 mA and input
    7 V to 28 V. The 12 V pin of the converter was connected to the spring connector
    terminal attached to the 12 V battery wire. The 5 V pin of the converter was used
    to power the MEGA microcontroller and was connected to the “voltage in” (Vin)
    pin. Resistors used in the voltage divider were a 100 kΩ and a 6.8 kΩ resistor.
    The 100 kΩ resistor was installed between the 12 V battery terminal and the analog
    0 pin (A0) of the MEGA microcontroller. The A0 pin was configured as an input
    pin and used to measure battery voltage. The 6.8 kΩ resistor was installed between
    the A0 pin of the MEGA microcontroller and ground. These resistors were chosen
    in order to protect the MEGA A0 pin that can be damaged if exposed to a voltage
    above 5 V. The voltage divider described results in a voltage under 5 V up to
    a 78.5 V input from the battery, while maintaining a high accuracy in the battery
    voltage measurement from the Arduino analog-to-digital converter. Stacking headers
    were installed on the Adafruit datalogging shield to hold an Adafruit FONA 800
    2G GSM cellular modem shield. The Adafruit FONA required a 500 mA lithium ion
    polymer battery and was equipped with a mini cellular quad-band antenna. The Adafruit
    FONA shield was modified by cutting the trace tying the Key pin to ground and
    the Key pin was instead connected to digital Pin 6, in order to be able to turn
    on and off the shield via software for better power management. The Pwr (power)
    pin of the FONA shield was connected to digital pin 7, to monitor via software
    whether the shield was on or off. Finally, the trace tying the FONA shield’s TX
    pin to the MEGA’s digital pin 3 was cut and the shield’s TX pin was connected
    to the MEGA’s digital pin 11, since digital pin 3 on the MEGA microcontroller
    cannot be used for software serial communication with the FONA shield (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerial).
    Outdoor ABS plastic NEMA box enclosures were used to house the datalogger-modem
    and batteries in the field. A 12 V 10 W solar panel with charge regulator was
    used to charge the 12 V battery that powered the datalogger-modem device. Enclosure
    and solar panel were mounted on a metal pole next to the flowmeter using U-bolts.
    Cables were inserted into the enclosure through waterproof nylon cable gland joints
    size DB11. The FTP server was built using a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian operating
    system, using Pure-FTPd (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ftp.md)
    to transfer files from the datalogger-modems in the field to the Raspberry Pi
    located at an office location with network connection and firewall. The Raspberry
    Pi FTP server was put in the DMZ of the firewall and router allowing traffic on
    the FTP port (21) to be redirected to the IP address of the Raspberry Pi. Two
    users were made, one accessible from the outside and one invisible from the outside.
    The datalogger-modem stations were setup to transfer daily datafiles after authentication
    to the user in the FTP server accessible from the outside. A simple cron job was
    set up in the Raspberry Pi to copy the data from the outside user to a network
    folder behind the firewall but accessible by CropManage. 3. Software description
    The software for the device was coded on an Arduino IDE platform (downloadable
    at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). The software had the following features
    (Fig. 3): 1. Data logging: the device is always listening for flowmeter pulses
    and tallying them in local memory. 2. Data storage: the device accesses a daily
    file and every two minutes evaluates and appends a string of data including timestamp,
    pulses, gallons per minute and battery voltage to the onboard SD card. 3. Data
    transmission: at midnight (where it is less likely that an irrigation event will
    take place) the device turns on the FONA cellular shield, connects to the network,
    enables GPRS communication and transfers the daily datafile via FTP to the server.
    It will also upload any previous data files that it failed to upload on a previous
    day. At the end of communication, the device shuts down the FONA cellular shield
    and continues datalogging in the two-minute loop described above. 4. Interrupts:
    depending on settings, the flowmeter data will continue to be monitored even during
    FTP upload. 5. Staggered data transmission: each device has an identification
    number that also corresponds to the time of communication, to avoid two devices
    transmitting data at the same time. Download : Download high-res image (216KB)

    on the prototyping area of the Adafruit Datalogging shield aligning its 12 V and
    ground terminals to the 12 V and ground (first and second) terminals of the spring
    connector (Fig. 3). The DC/DC converter terminals were soldered to the spring
    connector terminals using 22 AWG wire on the lower side of the Adafruit Datalogging
    shield. The 5 V terminal of the DC/DC converter was connected to the voltage input
    (Vin) pin of the shield and the ground terminal of the DC/DC converter was connected
    to the ground pin on the shield using 22 AWG solid core wire. The second and third
    terminals of the spring connector were connected together soldering a wire bridge
    between them in order to use the third terminal as ground connection for the flowmeter
    output cables. The fourth terminal of the spring connector was used to connect
    the positive flowmeter output cable and was connected to digital pin 9 on the
    shield with a 22 AWG solid core wire. A voltage divider consisting of two resistors
    was built on the upper side of the Adafruit Datalogging shield (Fig. 2). One side
    of the 100 kΩ resistor was aligned with the 12 V terminal of the DC/DC converter
    and soldered to it (the soldered connection is visible from the lower side of
    the Datalogging shield in Fig. 3). The other side of the 100 kΩ resistor was inserted
    into the analog pin 0 (A0) on the shield. The 6.8 kΩ resistor was placed across
    the analog pin 0 and the ground pin on the Datalogging shield (Fig. 2) and soldered
    from the bottom of the shield. A 22 AWG solid core wire was placed between the
    optional LED 2 (L2) pin and the digital 8 (D8) pin on the Datalogging shield and
    the connections were soldered from the bottom of the shield (Fig. 2). The trace
    tying the Key pin to ground on the Adafruit FONA shield was cut using a sharp
    utility knife, taking care of not damaging the adjacent electronic components.
    The trace was then tested measuring resistance with a digital multimeter. Solid
    core wire 22 AWG were placed between the TX pin and the digital 11 (D11) pin,
    between the Key pin and digital pin 6 (D6) and between the Power pin (Pwr) and
    digital pin7 (D7) (Fig. 5). All the connections were soldered from the bottom
    of the shield (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (217KB) Download :

    enclosure with a 5/8-inch spade drill bit and two waterproof nylon cable gland
    joints size DB11 were installed to allow the solar panel cable and the flowmeter
    output cable to be inserted into the enclosure. A hole was drilled on the top
    side of the enclosure with a 5/16-inch drill bit to house the SMA connector for
    the cellular antenna. The 12 V battery, charge regulator and microcontroller-shield-modem
    assembly were placed in the enclosure and the solar panel and battery cables were
    secured to the charge controller with screw terminals. Two additional cables from
    the battery and the flowmeter output cables were connected to the corresponding
    spring terminals on the Datalogging shield. 6. Validation and characterization
    Initial laboratory validation of the device was done by pumping water through
    a flowmeter from and into a tank. The flowrate measured by the flowmeter was compared
    with the device output file received by the FTP server. Two flowrates were tested,
    about 5 gpm and about 20 gpm. One issue identified during initial testing was
    that at slow flowrates the reed switch kept the wire terminals connected for a
    relatively long time, in the order of the tenths of a second. In certain circumstances,
    these long pulses caused the logger to count one pulse as two. To avoid this error,
    a debouncing procedure interval was included in the code. From the maximum flowrate
    measurable by the flowmeters used, we calculated the shortest interval between
    pulses that the data logger can be expected to record i.e. 0.9 s for a 3″ Netafim
    flowmeter with maximum flowrate of 660 gpm. Hence, the debouncing interval in
    the code was set at 0.7 s. Field deployment of a datalogger device without modem
    capabilities started in 2016. Two full stations with datalogging and modem capabilities
    were deployed during the irrigation season 2017 and three stations in 2018. For
    these stations, the ranch and planting were set up on CropManage redirecting the
    flowmeter cable to the path and filename corresponding to each flowmeter on the
    network folder. CropManage correctly imported the data file and the data was visualized
    on the website as an irrigation event (Fig. 6). Additional field validation of
    the datalogging device was done by comparing the gallon per minute measured by
    the devices deployed in seasons 2017 and 2018 with the theoretical flowrate calculated
    from the dripline nominal flowrate and drip line length (Fig. 7). Slight deviations
    between theoretical and measured flowrate could be due to differences in nominal
    pressure (8 psi) and the actual pressure in the driptapes observed in the field
    (commonly ranging between 6 and 15 psi). Download : Download high-res image (473KB)

    different ranches and the theoretical flowrate calculated from the drip tape nominal
    flowrate and the configuration of the irrigation system. Additional laboratory
    validation was performed in spring 2019, comparing data collected with a Campbell
    Scientific CR1000 and by an Arduino-based device. Two experiments were conducted,
    one by pumping water from a tank through a flowmeter at different flowrates, simulating
    irrigations events by setting the pump on a timer that automatically turned the
    pump on/off every 30 min. The second experiment was conducted by holding a reed
    switch close to a rotating magnet to simulate flowmeter output at high flowrates.
    The magnet was glued to a drill bit and an electrical drill was clamped to make
    the bit spin at constant speed (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (380KB)

    In the first panel we pumped water from a tank into a flowmeter at different flowrates
    and measured the output from the reed switch with the Arduino-based logger and
    with the commercial Campbell Scientific CR1000. In the second panel we glued a
    magnet to a drill bit and rotated it at constant speed, while holding the reed
    switch close to it, to simulate the flowmeter output at high flowrates. Data recorded
    by each data logger was collected and analyzed with R statistical software. Irrigations
    were simulated for about 5, 12, 175, 350 and 750 gpm. The data collected from
    each data logger is plotted in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res image (806KB)

    5, 12 gpm (top panels) and about 175 to 350 and 750 gpm (bottom panels). For each
    irrigation, we calculated the average flowrate and these results for each data
    logger were compared with linear regression analysis (Fig. 10). The linear regression
    analysis yielded an adjusted R2 of 0.9965 and a slope significantly different
    from zero with a p-value < 0.001. The intercept was not significantly different
    than 1. While at low flowrates the measured flowrates (5 and 12 gpm) were exactly
    equal for both data loggers, at higher flowrates the average simulated flowrates
    measured presented slight differences. This was presumably due to the irrigation
    being interrupted before the end of the 2-minute cycle resulting in a lower data
    point at the end of the irrigation (for example for the CR1000 on 4/19/2019 at
    12:32). The lower data point decreased the average value for the irrigation event.
    Another reason for discrepancies observed at higher flowrates was the gradual
    depletion of the battery of the electrical drill that was used to simulate the
    flowmeter output (Fig. 11). Download : Download high-res image (327KB) Download

    7. Conclusions This work shows the development of a low-cost technology that enables
    growers to gain access to CropManage cheaply and reliably. The same platform can
    also be used to collect data from soil or other environmental sensor in the field
    and transmit it via FTP into a central location. The system currently serves up
    to 30 devices transmitting data into a single FTP server. However, if necessary,
    a better device identification system could be implemented unlocking an immensely
    larger number of devices transmitting data to a single FTP server. Additionally,
    given the simplicity and low cost of the Raspberry Pi FTP server employed here,
    it seems feasible that different institutions (e.g. a large grower, a cooperative
    extension county office, a local environmental agency, etc.) may build an FTP
    server to accommodate their devices. Future challenges for the system are expected
    to be the possible sunset of the 2G network (although T-Mobile has not announced
    decommissioning of the network), that would require switching to a different cellular
    shield. Arduino compatible shields with 3G cellular technology are available on
    the market for about $50 to $80, so this possibility would impact minimally the
    total cost of the system. Currently, cellular connectivity is purchased from a
    service provider specializing in machine-to-machine (M2M) communication for less
    than $30 per device per year. Since the data transmitted are just a few strings
    of text per day, the devices have extremely low data consumption. This is expected
    to increase if more sensors were to be connected to a single device. A possible
    further development of the device is to employ LoRa communication from devices
    deployed in the field either to a central location connected to the internet or
    to a cellular gateway located at a central location in the field that could transmit
    data by FTP to a server. Another future development is switching transmission
    protocol from FTP to HTTPS to implement secure encrypted communication. FTP is
    deprecated for being insecure, although Finally, a new version of the device software
    is under development that uses interrupts to record pulses from the flowmeter.
    This would allow the device to record an irrigation event even during data trasmission,
    temporarily interrupting the transmission process. With this new software, the
    flowmeter pin (currently wired to pin 9 on the Mega) will be wired to a pin on
    the Mega that supports interrupts. Declaration of Competing Interest None declared.

    in Initial Management of Open Fractures     9 Citing Articles TO THE EDITOR In
    reporting on the results of the Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds (FLOW) trial, Bhandari
    et al. (Dec. 31 issue)1 describe the initial management of open fracture wounds.
    According to their protocol, the investigators aimed to perform irrigation and
    débridement for skin and soft-tissue defects or to close wounds that had delayed
    union or nonunion with the use of grafting or muscle flaps within 7 to 14 days
    after the initial surgery. The use of low-pressure wound therapy (vacuum-assisted
    closure) was described. We wonder whether the investigators adhered to the protocol
    regarding definitive wound coverage, and we wonder about the number and duration
    of vacuum-assisted closure procedures used in the trial, since the application
    of these techniques is controversial. Delayed wound healing may result in exogenous
    superinfection, which is often polymicrobial.2 In our experience, superinfection
    is not prevented but may be facilitated by prolonged vacuum-assisted closure therapy.3
    Skin flora microorganisms can migrate into the wound and adhere to internal fixation
    material, leading to nonunion or a high rate of recurrent infection.4 One of the
    primary end points of the trial was reoperation at the operative site within 12
    months after the initial procedure in order to treat an infection. Information
    on the number and duration of vacuum-assisted closure procedures used in the trial
    might provide valuable insight into the association of the use of this procedure
    with later infection. Parham Sendi, M.D. Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland
    parham.sendi@ifik.unibe.ch Martin A. McNally, M.D. Oxford University Hospitals,
    Oxford, United Kingdom No potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter
    was reported. 4 References TO THE EDITOR Bhandari et al. analyzed the effectiveness
    of irrigation in the management of open fracture wounds and found no difference
    in the primary trial end-point event (reoperation within 12 months after the index
    procedure in order to treat an infection, manage a wound-healing problem, or promote
    bone healing) according to the type of irrigation pressure used. However, the
    rate of reoperation was higher in the soap group than in the saline group. Even
    if large-volume irrigation is always recommended, débridement is the most important
    procedure to perform. Adequate débridement is thought to be key to reducing the
    prevalence of infection after open fracture.1-3 However, information regarding
    débridement practices is lacking in the protocol for the FLOW trial. How was the
    quality of the initial débridement evaluated by surgeons? Débridement should be
    extensive in patients with Gustilo–Anderson type III fractures but limited in
    patients with Gustilo–Anderson type I fractures (the Gustilo–Anderson classification
    ranges from type I to type III, with higher numbers indicating greater injury
    and a higher potential for complications).4 Culture specimens should be obtained
    from the wound after initial débridement, as well as before and after irrigation
    at each operative procedure, in order to assess the reduction of the bacteriologic
    load according to the type of irrigation pressure used. Olivier Barbier, M.D.

    conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported. 4 References RESPONSE
    The authors reply: Sendi and McNally inquire about vacuum-assisted closure of
    wounds in the FLOW trial. A post hoc analysis indicated that 331 patients underwent
    a vacuum-assisted closure in our trial. Although we did not stratify patients
    according to the use or nonuse of vacuum-assisted closure, the study groups (the
    irrigation-pressure groups and the solution groups) were balanced with respect
    to the use of the vacuum-assisted technique. Table 1. Rate of Infection, According
    to the Method of Wound Closure and Fracture Type. As expected, the use of vacuum-assisted
    closure was directly proportional to the severity of the open fracture wound (according
    to the Gustilo–Anderson fracture type). In all types of fracture wounds, the use
    of vacuum-assisted wound closure was associated with an increased rate of infection
    (by a factor of 5.3 among patients with type I wounds, a factor of 2.4 among patients
    with type II wounds, a factor of 2.0 among patients with type IIIA wounds, and
    a factor of 1.5 among patients with type IIIB wounds) (Table 1). A new analysis
    of factors associated with rates of reoperation is currently a priority for the
    prespecified secondary analysis of our data set. This analysis of factors includes
    wound closure and management as a covariate among several other variables. The
    extent to which vacuum-assisted wound closure predicts infection within 1 year
    after fracture may be of interest in future trials. Exploration of the biologic
    rationale for this observation is warranted. In reply to Barbier and Pasquier:
    our trial carefully evaluated approaches to wound irrigation as procedures included
    in the composite primary end point. However, removal of all nonviable skin, muscle,
    and other tissues, also called wound débridement, was standardized to the extent
    feasible in our global pragmatic trial. Although the approach to débridement was
    left to the discretion of the operating surgeon, we encouraged a thorough approach
    consistent with the standard of care. Indeed, similar amounts of skin, muscle,
    fascia, and bone were débrided in patients across the treatment groups; as expected,
    these amounts increased with the severity of fracture wounds. Furthermore, our
    trial did stratify patients according to the severity of open wounds to ensure
    a balance across treatment groups with respect to the most severe types of wounds.

    Wound Irrigation in Initial Management of Open Fractures     9 Citing Articles
    TO THE EDITOR In reporting on the results of the Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds (FLOW)
    trial, Bhandari et al. (Dec. 31 issue)1 describe the initial management of open
    fracture wounds. According to their protocol, the investigators aimed to perform
    irrigation and débridement for skin and soft-tissue defects or to close wounds
    that had delayed union or nonunion with the use of grafting or muscle flaps within
    7 to 14 days after the initial surgery. The use of low-pressure wound therapy
    (vacuum-assisted closure) was described. We wonder whether the investigators adhered
    to the protocol regarding definitive wound coverage, and we wonder about the number
    and duration of vacuum-assisted closure procedures used in the trial, since the
    application of these techniques is controversial. Delayed wound healing may result
    in exogenous superinfection, which is often polymicrobial.2 In our experience,
    superinfection is not prevented but may be facilitated by prolonged vacuum-assisted
    closure therapy.3 Skin flora microorganisms can migrate into the wound and adhere
    to internal fixation material, leading to nonunion or a high rate of recurrent
    infection.4 One of the primary end points of the trial was reoperation at the
    operative site within 12 months after the initial procedure in order to treat
    an infection. Information on the number and duration of vacuum-assisted closure
    procedures used in the trial might provide valuable insight into the association
    of the use of this procedure with later infection. Parham Sendi, M.D. Bern University

    analyzed the effectiveness of irrigation in the management of open fracture wounds
    and found no difference in the primary trial end-point event (reoperation within
    12 months after the index procedure in order to treat an infection, manage a wound-healing
    problem, or promote bone healing) according to the type of irrigation pressure
    used. However, the rate of reoperation was higher in the soap group than in the
    saline group. Even if large-volume irrigation is always recommended, débridement
    is the most important procedure to perform. Adequate débridement is thought to
    be key to reducing the prevalence of infection after open fracture.1-3 However,
    information regarding débridement practices is lacking in the protocol for the
    FLOW trial. How was the quality of the initial débridement evaluated by surgeons?
    Débridement should be extensive in patients with Gustilo–Anderson type III fractures
    but limited in patients with Gustilo–Anderson type I fractures (the Gustilo–Anderson
    classification ranges from type I to type III, with higher numbers indicating
    greater injury and a higher potential for complications).4 Culture specimens should
    be obtained from the wound after initial débridement, as well as before and after
    irrigation at each operative procedure, in order to assess the reduction of the
    bacteriologic load according to the type of irrigation pressure used. Olivier

    conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported. 4 References RESPONSE
    The authors reply: Sendi and McNally inquire about vacuum-assisted closure of
    wounds in the FLOW trial. A post hoc analysis indicated that 331 patients underwent
    a vacuum-assisted closure in our trial. Although we did not stratify patients
    according to the use or nonuse of vacuum-assisted closure, the study groups (the
    irrigation-pressure groups and the solution groups) were balanced with respect
    to the use of the vacuum-assisted technique. Table 1. Rate of Infection, According
    to the Method of Wound Closure and Fracture Type. As expected, the use of vacuum-assisted
    closure was directly proportional to the severity of the open fracture wound (according
    to the Gustilo–Anderson fracture type). In all types of fracture wounds, the use
    of vacuum-assisted wound closure was associated with an increased rate of infection
    (by a factor of 5.3 among patients with type I wounds, a factor of 2.4 among patients
    with type II wounds, a factor of 2.0 among patients with type IIIA wounds, and
    a factor of 1.5 among patients with type IIIB wounds) (Table 1). A new analysis
    of factors associated with rates of reoperation is currently a priority for the
    prespecified secondary analysis of our data set. This analysis of factors includes
    wound closure and management as a covariate among several other variables. The
    extent to which vacuum-assisted wound closure predicts infection within 1 year
    after fracture may be of interest in future trials. Exploration of the biologic
    rationale for this observation is warranted. In reply to Barbier and Pasquier:
    our trial carefully evaluated approaches to wound irrigation as procedures included
    in the composite primary end point. However, removal of all nonviable skin, muscle,
    and other tissues, also called wound débridement, was standardized to the extent

    a balance across treatment groups with respect to the most severe types of wounds.

    Get rights and content Abstract From field to basin scales, there are many appropriate
    interventions used to manage rainfall efficiently and productively in smallholder
    farming systems. Yet, successful targeting and scaling-out of these approaches
    remains a challenge. This paper presents an innovative approach in decision support
    called ‘Targeting Agricultural Water Management Interventions’ (TAGMI) with application
    in Limpopo and Volta river basins (available at http://www.seimapping.org/tagmi/).
    The online open-access TAGMI uses country-scale Bayesian network models to assess
    the likelihood of success for outscaling various agricultural water management
    (AWM) interventions at sub-national level. The web tool integrates multiple sources
    of expertise on the enabling environment for outscaling based on key social, human,
    physical, financial, and natural factors. It estimates the relative probability
    of success of an AWM intervention across the Limpopo and Volta river basins. Here
    we present TAGMI as a ‘proof of concept’, areas of high, medium, and low probabilities
    of success for three AWM technologies common in Limpopo and Volta River Basins:
    the soil water conservation/in situ rainwater harvesting technologies in rain-fed
    systems, small-scale private irrigation and small reservoirs used for communal
    irrigation purposes. We then apply a climate change scenario and discuss the robustness
    in potential AWM, according to the TAGMI tool. Finally, we discuss the need for

    adoptionTAGMILimpopoVolta 1. Introduction Agricultural water management (AWM)
    is one principal management strategy to increase production and productivity of
    crops in smallholder farming systems under climatic stress, such as in semiarid
    and sub-humid sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) (e.g., Stevenson et al, 2014, Biazin et
    al, 2012, Cooper et al, 2008, Rockström et al, 2003). Yet to date, water management
    in both rainfed and irrigated crop production continues to challenge farmers''
    livelihoods. Dry spells and droughts, as well as floods and water inundation,
    cause substantial losses in yields. These affect both income and food security
    at local and national scales. At a continental scale, despite yield increases
    in smallholder farming, crop systems in SSA on average produce less than a quarter
    of biophysical potential (e.g., FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the
    United Nations), 2011, Mueller et al, 2012), the lowest of any region in the world.
    And yet, crop production and productivity for major staples and cereals have increased
    in SSA (e.g., Benin et al., 2011) albeit still lagging behind population growth
    and dietary change. As a consequence, several SSA regions are a net importer of
    staple foods (e.g., Rakotoarisoa et al., 2011). In addition, data by FAO show
    the net staple crop production and food supply increasing above the production
    and productivity of the 1960s, only in the last 10 years (e.g., Grassini et al,
    2013, Rakotoarisoa et al, 2011). Hence, the use and implementation of agricultural
    water management interventions for crop and livestock production improvements
    continue to be a major contributing factor towards securing food supply in the
    future (e.g., Tilman et al., 2011). Here we focus on the opportunities in targeting
    AWM interventions for smallholder farming systems in SSA. The Volta and Limpopo
    basins are still subject to substantial poverty and food security challenges,
    especially in rural smallholder farming context. Both basins are subject to high
    rainfall variability, where deviation from the long-term average of ±2 standard
    deviations is the norm rather than exception. Dealing with such rainfall and subsequent
    stream flow variability is a profound challenge for the farming systems. The need
    for rainfall and water management strategies from field to landscape scale is
    fundamental to securing crop growth. Whereas there are a range of well known,
    well tested and widely promoted AWM interventions, there is an understanding that
    smallholder farmers, in particular, may benefit from broader adoption of various
    AWM interventions. Alongside this consensus, there is also growing evidence that
    AWM uptake, adoption and outscaling are complex processes combining biophysical,
    human and social factors. To date, decisions support tools (DSS) for policy, development
    agents and investors have little explicit account for these multidimensional system
    components. There are already various spatially explicit DSS tools available for
    identifying potential areas for AWM interventions for sub-Sahara Africa conditions.
    Some are more locally focused, whereas others are national to sub-continental
    (e.g., Mati et al, 2006, Mbilinyi et al, 2007, Andersson et al, 2009). However,
    these tools emphasise biophysical aspects (agro-ecological zone, climate, slope,
    soil, surface water distance, etc.) and possibly incorporating some dimensions
    of human (labour availability, population density), financial (poverty/income
    proxies) and physical capitals (typically market access). To date, the incorporation
    of social and human capital dimensions is not common, and factors such as institutional
    capacity, leadership and community cohesion are largely absent. Yet, these factors
    are critical to lever AWM outscaling and adoption processes (e.g., Noble et al,
    2006, Barron, Noel, 2011; see further in de Bruin et al., 2015). In response to
    this gap in DSS tools for AWM outscaling we propose a new approach to incorporate
    multiple factors and describe the uncertainties in factor descriptions. Our conceptual
    model for the DSS tool to identify where conditions are promising for outscaling
    assumes that: (i) there are multiple factors that contribute to the success or
    failure of AWM intervention adoption (biophysical, social and institutional, technological
    and implementation-specific); and (ii) the factors and relations usually cannot
    be observed directly, but indirect evidence can be identified by experts and practitioners.
    The knowledge and expertise of important factors for AWM outscaling is embedded
    in different communities of practise, including researchers, policy makers and
    farmers engaged in outscaling processes. Hence, research knowledge alone is insufficient
    to develop relevant and valid relations for modelling factors affecting AWM outscaling.
    The objective of this study was to develop and evidence a knowledge-based AWM
    outscaling tool for decision-support in AWM investments and development action
    to benefit smallholder farming systems in Volta and Limpopo basins. Using a Bayesian
    approach to deal with multiple factors and input uncertainties, and building on
    different sources of expertise to construct this conceptual framework, a web-based
    decision-support tool ‘Targeting AGwater Management Interventions’ (TAGMI)1was
    developed. The purpose of the tool was to assist in identifying sites where the
    introduction of AWM interventions for smallholder farming systems is likely to
    be successfully outscaled and adopted. Here we describe the underlying principles
    of the TAGMI tool and the process of elicitation (consultation) to merge different
    sources of expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the TAGMI tool to three
    categories of AWM intervention relevant to the Volta and Limpopo smallholder farming
    systems. We discuss the TAGMI decision support tool predictions on potential outscaling
    in current and potential climate change scenarios for the two basins. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Bayes model approach in decision support tool 2.1.1. The Bayesian
    network model The model behind the TAGMI tool is implemented as a Bayesian network,
    following the approach used by Kemp-Benedict et al. (2009) to analyse the likelihood
    of water poverty for local rural livelihoods in a South-East Asian example. Bayesian
    network models have been used for natural resource management in several different
    contexts (Bacon et al, 2002, Borsuk et al, 2004, Bromley, 2005, Cain, 2001, Henriksen
    et al, 2007, Newton et al, 2006, Sadoddin et al, 2005), including agro-ecological
    examples (Kemp-Benedict et al, 2009, Otero et al, 2006). The core Bayes model
    used here for AWM interventions is structurally simple: it relates factors of

    TAGMI model linking underlying indicators to prediction of successful agricultural
    water management interventions in a Bayesian approach. The variables in such a
    model are discrete probability distributions, rather than fixed values; in the
    targeting model described in this paper the success indicator – as a Bayesian
    variable – takes on two possible values, “yes” and “no”, and the output displayed
    to the user is the probability that the value of the success indicator is “yes”,
    given the current value of key variables. ‘Success’ is the likelihood that an
    AWM technology introduced in a target community will still be in use 2 years after
    the intervention project has ended. This definition is drawn from the project''s
    first expert consultation workshops as described in de Bruin et al. (2015). 2.1.2.
    The core model and relation to observed data The core model relates factors of
    success Fi, i = 1, … , n to the success indicator S through a conditional probability
    distribution P(s|f1, f2, … , fn). The conditional probability distribution can
    be read as, “The probability that the success indicator S takes on a particular
    value s, given that the values of each of the factors of success are f1, f2, … ,
    fn.” We will use the standard shorthand P(S|F1, F2, … , Fn) to represent the matrix
    of all possible values for the factors of success. Different factors of success
    can have different numbers of possible states, but given the limited data available
    to calibrate the model it is best to keep the number of states small and discrete.
    In this model, factors can be present (positive) or absent (negative). In a few
    cases, the factors of success are directly observable, but most of them are not.
    This is a common problem when building and fitting models – there is a mismatch
    between the model variables and observed data, so practitioners suggest “proxy”
    variables to stand in for the model variables. In the Bayesian approach these
    are called evidence variables, and we denote them by Ej, j = 1, … , m (Fig. 2a).

    value of success (S) dependent on factors (F), as given by proxy evidence (E);
    (b) final structure of model including Livelihood capitals (C), and accounting
    for incomplete information through dummy variable (C′) at capital level. The Bayesian
    framework allows for an improvement over the proxy variable approach. Usually
    proxy variables are associated with only one model variable and the relationship
    is assumed to be direct. In the Bayesian framework it is possible for one evidence
    variable to be associated with more than one model variable, and the relationship
    can be probabilistic. We therefore construct a conditional probability distribution
    P(s|{ej}), where ej are the possible states of the evidence variables by calculating
    where the sum is the overall combinations of states of the factors of success.
    The first probability under the sum is the conditional probability of success
    given the states of the factors of success; the second relates the (observed)
    evidence variables to the (unobserved) factors of success. In the model, each
    factor is described by 1–3 evidence variables; for example, Labour availability
    (factor) is indicated by the relative size of the working age population and the
    gender ratio in the population (evidence variables). The evidence variables describe
    the context at the level of each administrative unit (district or département)
    and can take three states: low, medium or high. The classification of the data
    into the three states is described in Section 2.1.5. A level of clustering was
    introduced to organise the factors according to the DFID Sustainable Livelihood
    Framework (SLF, DFID, 1999) (see Supplementary Table S1). In this way, ‘Success’
    is assumed to be conditional on adequate presence of all five types of capital:
    Human, Social, Financial, Physical and Natural. Water resources are included as
    a separate 6th capital given its centrality to AWM. The presence of each capital
    is determined by the combined probability of 2–4 relevant factors of success being
    present. For example, human capital is defined as “the skills, knowledge, ability
    to labour and good health that together enable people to pursue different livelihood
    strategies and achieve their livelihood objectives” (DFID, 1999) and is therefore
    described in the model by the factors Skills, Labour Availability and Health.
    2.1.3. Combining capitals with incomplete information variables There are, potentially,
    a large number of factors contributing to the success indicator, some of which
    may not adhere to the SLF framing. The number of possible combinations is extremely
    large and it would be quite challenging for an expert to estimate the joint probability
    of success given all combinations of states for the factors of success. Also,
    the guiding assumption is that all factors of success are important (that is,
    we do not assume that they are substitutable, although that is a possible extension).
    To reduce the cognitive burden on the expert while keeping faithful to the conceptual
    structure of the model, we insert, between each capital (representing a set of
    factors of success Fi) and the success indicator, an intermediate “pseudo-factor”
    that can take one of two values – present and absent. The success indicator shows
    success only if all of the pseudo-factors are present, but there is a probabilistic
    relationship between the factors of success and the pseudo-factors; such a construct
    is called a “noisy-and”. The complete model can now be written where we have emphasised
    that the relationship between the pseudo-factors and indicator of success is deterministic
    by labelling it , for “and”. It is equal to 1 for s = “yes” if and only if all
    of the are equal to “present”, and zero otherwise. The information about the relationship
    between the factors of success and the success indicator is therefore collected
    in the separate probabilities (Fig. 2b). The “noisy-and” thereby also provides
    a leak mechanism, to account for any factor that might influence success, that
    has not been taken into account in the model, i.e. if all factors in the model
    are absent, there is still a chance (however slight) that success can be present.
    The range of results received for the probability of the success indicator being
    ‘yes’ is classified equally to low, medium or high after running the input dataset.
    Based on the initial models'' settings all being very near one-third (33%), the
    thresholds are currently set so that the low-to-moderate threshold is 0.3 (30%)
    and moderate-to-high at 0.35 (35%). The classified results are displayed as a
    map of the study area to present which locations have a low or high probability
    of successful adoption and outscaling, relevant to the rest of the study area.
    2.1.4. Measure of certainty of model prediction One advantage of a Bayesian model
    is that not all of the evidence needs to be specified. If there is some location
    where one or more evidence variable is missing data, then it does not have to
    be set. But in that case it is important to signal that the value for the probability
    of success is less certain than in other locations. We do this by calculating
    the information entropy of the probability of success, which measures the change
    in the model outcome from a null state (no evidence) to an informed stated (with
    evidence). The result of the information entropy calculation informs the ‘strength
    of evidence’ that is displayed in the tool, which gives an indication of the strength
    of the prediction. This is a measure of the quality of the data used, as well
    as the amount of missing data. For example, if data are old, or available at a
    coarser geographic coverage or scale of analysis than the model is at (district-level),
    the evidence base for the result is weak, and the strength of evidence will be
    LOW. Low strength of evidence can also reflect an uncertainty in how well the
    data used are related to the concept they describe. Alternatively, if the data
    are recent, consistently representative across the country, at district level
    and highly relevant for all factors in the model, the evidence base for the result
    is strong and the strength of evidence will be HIGH. 2.1.5. Expert elicitation
    of probabilities Consultation workshops were held in each country during 2011,
    2012 and 2013. The consultations followed similar protocol in 4 countries (Zimbabwe,
    South Africa, Ghana, Burkina Faso) with national level expert meetings, in-depth
    case studies at local community and district level, and followed by 2 additional
    consultations at national level, testing the TAGMI proof of concept. At national
    level, a mixture of academics, policy and development implementers attended. At
    local level, male and female farmers, public and NGO/CBO development agents and
    practitioners provided the inputs. The consultation process is thoroughly described
    in as described by de Bruin et al. (2015). The initial learning event provided
    lists of key variables that have contributed to either the success or failure
    of examples of AWM technology projects from the area or region (factors of success).
    The initial list of variables was analysed and aggregated into a list of six main
    categories of factors capturing aspects of the biophysical and social economical
    context (human, social, environmental, physical, financial), corresponding to
    the DFiD livelihood framework, plus the category of water resources (Supplementary
    Table S1). The expert consultations also deliberated on factors for success in
    a seventh category: the processes of AWM intervention implementation. While processes
    of implementation are critical, they are also within the control of individual
    project facilitators and which is discussed by de Bruin et al. (2015). Therefore,
    only contextual factors are included in the spatial tool of TAGMI described here.
    These factors may not be directly measurable, but can be represented in part by
    various indicators (evidence variables). Further participatory workshops discussed
    data sources for the evidence database, confirmed the network structure and developed
    the conditional probability relationships for the model. With sufficient data,
    it is possible to fit the conditional probability distribution of the model''s
    relationships through a process called “training”. However, we expect to apply
    the tool in data-poor environments, and so must rely on expert elicitation. It
    is difficult for experts to provide conditional probability distributions, as
    the number of probabilities required is exponential to the number of variables
    involved and the number of states each variable can have. There are not only well-tested
    elicitation techniques, but also well-known problems with any of these techniques
    because of people''s cognitive limitations. For this project we follow a particular
    approach to eliciting conditional probability distributions (Kemp-Benedict, 2008).
    In this approach, the expert assigns weighting factors rc to each of the states
    of the child node, and also to each of the parent nodes . Then the log likelihood,
    to a user-specified base b, is set equal to In this way, a conditional probability
    table can be constructed, which will have a Gaussian distribution, having been
    mathematically generated, but is skewed more or less from an even distribution
    by the weighting factors rc. This method requires far less input from the experts,
    and is more comprehensible (Kemp-Benedict, 2008, Kemp-Benedict et al, 2009). Using
    this approach, the conditional probability for each relationship was developed
    by asking experts the following questions: • For evidence-factor: if you know
    that [the data] in all of 10 villages are low, in how many of those villages is
    it likely that [the factor] is also low? repeat for medium and high. The answers
    may be expressed as a proportion or percentage, to be used as the weighting factors.
    • For factor-cluster: How important is a high level of [factor] to achieving high
    [capital]? Essential – Very important – Important – Somewhat important – Not important.
    These categories equate to weighting factors of 1 – 0.75 – 0.5 – 0.25 – 0.05 •
    For cluster-success: How necessary is [capital] for successful projects? Absolutely
    necessary – Necessary – Somewhat necessary – Not necessary. These categories equate
    to weighting factors of 0.01 – 0.25 – 0.75 – 0.99, reflecting that if a capital
    is absolutely necessary to success, the chance of success without that capital
    is 1%. For detailed descriptions of the weightings defining the models, refer
    to the technical documentation on the tool''s website http://www.seimapping.org/tagmi/documentation.php
    (Morris et al., 2013). Finally, the key elements of the TAGMI decision-support
    tool are: (i) a Bayesian network model; (ii) a database of district-level contextual
    data; (iii) a program written to run the Bayes model for all districts in a country;
    and (iv) the web interface that displays the results as a map (Fig. 3). Download

    components. 2.2. Application of Bayes model for AWM outscaling in Volta and Limpopo
    2.2.1. Study locations and AWM technologies The decision-support tool was developed
    for the Limpopo and Volta river basins, to operate at the second or third administrative
    levels in each country, according to the data available (districts in most cases,
    départements in Burkina Faso). The tool includes all administrative units that
    fall wholly or partly within the river basin boundary, and operates a separate
    model for each country and AWM technology. For the Limpopo, all four basin countries
    are included (Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe). However, in the
    Volta basin, only Burkina Faso and Ghana are included, while Mali, Cote d''Ivoire,
    Togo and Benin are not (Fig. 4). In total, the surface area covered by the tool
    is 705 000 km2 (Limpopo) and 334 000 km2 (Volta). Download : Download full-size

    FAO Geonetwork (FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations),
    2014), accessed 2014. The study addresses three categories of agricultural water
    management (AWM) technologies in this proof-of-concept phase, chosen through the
    consultations describe earlier as relevant for outscaling in respective basins.
    The AWM technologies represent AWM interventions along the spectrum from rainfed
    to irrigated crop systems, including systems with water storage: (i) Conservation
    agriculture/soil and water conservation: In-situ technologies which have the objective
    to maximise the use of rainwater by retaining surface runoff, improving infiltration
    and improving soil water holding capacity by increasing soil fertility. In Limpopo
    consultations, the principal technology of interest in the rainfed realm was conservation
    agriculture, a soil and water conservation approach that could be manual or mechanised,
    encompassing at least minimum tillage for improved infiltration, with fertility
    and/or manure management. In the Volta context, the broader category of soil and
    water conservation technologies was discussed, referring to in-situ/ex-situ rainwater
    harvesting, and/or ‘soil and water conservation’ measures. Typically this included
    a wide set of structures in field or beyond, such as earth or stone bunds, zai
    planting pits, vegetative barriers to slow runoff; mulching and reduced tillage
    to improve infiltration and reduce soil transpiration; and adding compost or manure
    for improved fertility. (ii) Small-scale irrigation: Irrigation systems developed
    and managed by individual farmers, requiring a combination of water storage, access
    and distribution infrastructure. Water storage may be in the form of shallow or
    deep wells, ponds or tanks, or nearby streams, reservoirs or rivers. Water access
    ranges from water lifting technologies using a rope to various manual, electric,
    solar or diesel pumps, with distribution by buckets or canals. (iii) Small reservoirs:
    Ex-situ irrigation and multiple use schemes developed and managed by communities,
    based on small reservoirs (less than 1 million m3 storage capacity (Cecchi et
    al., 2009)) which are usually built with external support. 2.2.2. Applying TAGMI
    in a climate change scenario To test the sensitivity in prediction of AWM outscaling
    by the TAGMI tool, a climate change scenario was applied to the TAGMI models of
    AWM interventions. For the Limpopo and Volta basins, the most significant climate
    impact to affect the likely success of AWM technologies is the change in precipitation,
    available from the latest regional downscaling estimates (Volta: Jalloh et al.,
    2013; Limpopo: IPCC, 2013a), and the resulting change in water availability (de
    Wit and Stankiewicz, 2006). A dry scenario was developed for the Limpopo Basin,
    based on the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report mean prediction (IPCC, 2013b) of 10–20%
    loss in precipitation by 2081–2100 (Fig. 5). A similar drier state scenario was
    developed for the Volta basin from Jalloh et al. (2013), where a predicted change
    of −200 to −50 mm by 2050 translates into an 8–20% loss in precipitation across
    the basin when compared to the current mean annual rainfall, which ranges from
    500 mm to 1350 mm, the dry scenario. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5.
    Climate change scenarios using expected mean annual rainfall deviations (%) applied
    to Limpopo basin (left), as interpreted from IPCC (2013b); and Volta basin (right),
    as interpreted from Jalloh et al. (2013). The accessibility of surface water is
    indicated by drainage density (the ‘proximity to river’ evidence variable). To
    calculate the change in drainage density (and therefore change in proximity to
    river) it was assumed that the rainfall change will predominantly impact river
    length rather than volume. A conversion scale was extracted from the rainfall–drainage
    response curve in de Wit and Stankiewicz (Fig. 6, after fig. S3A in de Wit and
    Stankiewicz, 2006), to calculate the percent change in drainage density according
    to which class of mean annual rainfall each district fell into (Table 1). Download

    (after fig. 8.4 in Molden, 2007) and Hein et al. (after fig. S2 in Hein et al.,
    2011). (a) River drainage network New mean annual rainfall (2050/2090) Change

    that changes in response to less rainfall is landscape availability of biomass.
    The ‘potential biomass production’ evidence variable was therefore scaled in response
    to rainfall change, and modified by aridity, according to the relationship between
    mean annual rainfall and net primary production (Hein et al, 2011, Molden, 2007)
    (Table 1b). The final evidence variable affected by changing rainfall patterns
    is the risk of dryspells, which was therefore re-calculated for the new rainfall
    using the derived relationship between current data on mean annual rainfall and
    drought hazard index (Limpopo) and rainfall variability (Volta), expressed as
    the equation of the trendline with closest fit. 2.3. Validation and calibration
    of TAGMI results The TAGMI proof of concept is built on the consultations and
    expert elicitation processes (see de Bruin et al., 2015), and hence, not easily
    calibrated and validated in a conventional approach as with e.g. more deterministic
    models. Here, we propose two different approaches in testing model prediction
    outputs against independent sources of evidence. Firstly, we check TAGMI model
    prediction against independently collected information on existing known uptake
    of a given AWM technology. Only one consistent study of soil water conservation
    uptake could be found, i.e., the national agricultural census of Burkina Faso,
    which maps out farmers'' use of SWC (MAHRH (Ministère de l''Agriculture, de l''Hydraulique
    et des Ressources Halieutiques) and DGPSA (Direction Générale des Prévisions et
    des Statistiques Agricoles), 2007). The second source of validation of TAGMI results
    can be by identifying peer studies direct investigation similar relations as described
    in the TAGMI model. Here we provide a small example, based on recent research
    from Limpopo basin conservation agriculture experience. 3. Results 3.1. The TAGMI
    tool factors and evidence across AWM interventions The TAGMI tool proof of concept
    was developed for three technologies across the Volta and Limpopo basin. There
    was a consistent agreement on which factors are critical for all AWM interventions
    across the basins (Table 2). Of the total number of factors, ranging from 16 to
    18 for individual AWM technologies, at least 15 factors were in agreement across
    the basin for a given technology. When ranking factors for their importance for
    successful outscaling, there was a high degree of consensus across consultations
    (details in Supplementary Table S2). The consultations resulted in highest importance
    being given to market access for access to inputs and produce; human capital-related
    factors in the form of skills, knowledge, labour and health; access to credit;
    water availability; land availability and soil suitability. Table 2. Agreement
    of factors in the Bayes model as determined in consultations across Limpopo and
    Volta basins for three categories of agricultural water management (AWM) technologies.

    15 Case-specific factors Land tenure Conflict Biomass Land tenure Biomass Water
    quality Combining the priority rating of factors from all consultations within
    a basin for each technology also resulted in common agreement on the most influential
    livelihood capitals. For soil and water conservation (SWC) and conservation agricultural
    (CA) practices, representing the rainfed realm of AWM technology span, the most
    important inputs required from the farmer perspective for successful uptake were
    biomass and manure, for mulch and compost, and labour, for digging pits or building
    bunds and for weeding. Therefore, the prioritised capitals for higher likelihood
    of success of CA or SWC in addition to Water Resources (i.e., rainfall regime)
    was Natural Capital for biomass production, soil characteristics and drought hazard.
    By comparison, small-scale private irrigation requires water storage, access and
    distribution infrastructure, which needs to be realised by mobilising the financial
    investment at least in part by the individual farmers. According to consultations
    the most important requirements for potential successful outscaling of small scale
    irrigation were therefore: the finances to purchase the equipment either by cash
    or credit, and access to market, as the higher value crops need market for sales.
    The factor ‘Market access’ incorporated both the presence of a market with sufficient
    demand to absorb the irrigated produce, and access to inputs such as pumps and
    pipes for small scale irrigation and good quality fertilisers and seeds. Therefore,
    the most important livelihood capital for success, in addition to Water Resources,
    is Physical Capital for market availability and road infrastructure. Small reservoirs
    were considered to require large investments for construction, and in the past,
    most were developed through external resources from government or international
    aid organisations. Therefore, the important requirements from the farming community
    are predominantly around management and maintenance of the reservoir functions.
    Hence, for successful adoption the social organisation for managing water use
    equitably and sustainably was considered a critical factor, alongside having the
    skills or training and the equipment to maintain the reservoir and canal infrastructure.
    As in the previous technology, access to market was considered a very important
    factor as irrigated crops such as vegetables and rice need to be sold for profitability
    with short turnover. The most important capital, in addition to Water Resources,
    was agreed by participants in Volta to be Physical Capital, for access to market,
    but Financial Capital in Limpopo (Fig. 7). Download : Download full-size image

    basin. For images of all networks, see the country-level tool pages on the website:
    http://www.seimapping.org/tagmi/tool.php. Although there was slightly less agreement
    about evidence variables, still a minimum of 78% of evidence overlapped between
    specific AWM technology models across basins (Table 3). However, some evidence
    variables proposed through the consultations were challenging to populate with
    data appropriately, in particular for factors within the Human and Social Capital
    groups. For example, farming experience and training (skills) were considered
    as crucial for successful AWM technology uptake among smallholder farmers across
    basins, but during the consultations it was agreed that these input data were
    largely unavailable, unless from specific project sites where household surveys
    had been taken. As a proxy, data on extension services available would be the
    next-best indicator. These data were only published for the whole basin at national
    or regional level; department or district level data would need to be collected
    by visiting each regional office, so after consultation among the research teams
    of the projects, literacy rate became the (rather weak) evidence of Skills in
    the AWM technology models. Table 3. Agreement of social, economic, human, physical

    (V); (ii) Women''s access to assets (L) vs women with credit (V). 3.2. The TAGMI
    tool results in proof of concept The TAGMI tool identifies areas of high-medium
    and low potential for outscaling the three categories of AWM technologies across
    the Limpopo (Fig. 8) and the Volta (Fig. 9) basins. All predictions are associated
    with low certainty (a low strength of evidence) due to several evidence variables
    only having data available at lower than desired resolution (i.e. at region or
    province level rather than department or district level). At least half the data
    were also collected prior to 2010, and therefore at risk of being out-of-date
    and no longer representative of the conditions, therefore undermining the targeting
    process. Conservation agriculture (CA) and soil water conservation (SWC) were
    predicted (with low strength of prediction), to have overall higher likelihood
    of success than small-scale irrigation or small reservoirs in terms of the number
    of districts. However, when calculating the sum of cropland area in all districts
    falling in each likelihood class (Fig. 10), the potential for outscaling over
    the largest area appears to be for small reservoirs, both in Limpopo and in Volta
    basin. The highest likelihood of success for outscaling of SWC or CA was in semi-arid
    to sub-humid parts of the basins (Fig. 8, left, and Fig. 9, left). This is intuitively
    agreeing with arid regions not being successful for soil moisture management strategies
    such as in-situ/SWC or CA, whereas too much rainfall tends to be unsuitable as
    these strategies inundate crops with water, reducing actual yields. Small-scale
    irrigation had overall the lowest likelihood of success of the three technologies,
    possibly related to the dependence on access to credit, which was generally low.
    High likelihood areas for small-scale irrigation, particularly in Limpopo (Fig.
    8, middle), were associated with large urban centres (Bulawayo, Johannesburg and
    Gaborone) where market access and credit access are better. In Limpopo, small
    reservoirs had highest likelihood of success predicted in the drier parts of South
    Africa and Zimbabwe, where they are most needed for storage, and lowest likelihood
    in the driest part of the basin, in Botswana, where annual rainfall is too low.
    For the Volta Basin, the high likelihood areas predicted in drier northern Ghana,
    and central to north-west Burkina Faso agree with previous analyses based on aridity
    and livelihood demand (FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations),
    n.d.). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Predictions of potential for

    Estimated cropland area across districts with high, medium and low likelihood
    of successful outscaling of conservation agriculture/soil water conservation,
    smallholder irrigation and small reservoirs for Limpopo (left) and Volta (right).
    The predictions for areas of high likelihood of successful outscaling in Volta
    basin (Fig. 9) were largely overlapping. This relates to the priority and resulting
    weights given to the capitals across the different categories of AWM technologies.
    In Volta all the AWM technologies prioritised the Water Resources capital and
    the Physical Access capital, and hence similar underlying factors and evidence
    had the most influence in identifying successful AWM outscaling areas in Volta
    basin. In the AWM technology models of Limpopo, the consultations'' prioritisation,
    and therefore weighting, of both capitals and factors of success was more varied
    (Supplementary Table S2, extracted from appendix A in Morris et al., 2013), which
    results in map outputs that differ more in prediction of location for successful
    outscaling for the respective AWM technologies. Presenting the TAGMI predictions
    according to cropland area (Fig. 10), the models suggest that more than 80% of
    the Limpopo, that is 11.4 × 106 ha of cropland is under high and medium likelihood
    of successful outscaling of conservation agriculture (with low strength in prediction).
    For Volta, the equivalent is in the region of 75% of total basin crop area. The
    likelihood of successful outscaling for small reservoirs is in a similar order
    of magnitude, with high and medium likelihood of successful outscaling predicted
    for >70% of crop area in Limpopo, and >85% of crop area in Volta basin, suggesting
    real opportunities for investments to support adoption. As expected, smallholder
    irrigation does not show as high likelihood in Limpopo, likely due to the low
    accessibility of water and also market access. These factors, identified as critical
    for successful outscaling of smallholder irrigation, do not appear to affect opportunities
    in Volta for the same technology. An estimated crop area subject to potentially
    high or medium successful outscaling is similar to the soil water conservation
    technology at >70% cropland. 3.3. Testing TAGMI predictions for climate change
    To demonstrate potential use of the TAGMI tool, a climate change scenario was
    implemented for the three AWM technologies in the Volta and Limpopo basin context.
    The purpose was to identify where current potential areas of high successful uptake
    of an AWM technology may persist, even in view of climate change and significant
    change in water access, i.e., where are investments likely to have high successful
    outcome also under future climate change? In the Limpopo Basin, climate change
    predictions mostly agree on a reduction in annual rainfall by up to 20% by the
    end of the century (IPCC, 2013a). In the Volta Basin, climate change predictions
    do not agree to the same extent (Jalloh et al., 2013). Four different global models
    predict possible scenarios ranging from −200 mm to +200 mm change by 2050, equal
    to a drier scenario with as little as −20% of current rainfall (CSIRO Mark 3 GCM,
    figure 4.15 and figure 6.15 in Jalloh et al., 2013) and a wetter scenario with
    as much as 50% more than current rainfall (MIROC 3.2 medium-resolution GCM, ibid).
    In this study, the drier scenario was used, to match the predictions in the Limpopo
    basin. As well as changing the rainfall in the TAGMI model, the associated stream
    flow and biomass were modified as described in Section 2.2. The results show a
    slight shift of more existing cropland being subject especially to medium potential
    for successful outscaling of AWM technologies. This is a reflection of the increasing
    challenge in accessing water under reduced rainfall, both for soil moisture management
    and for irrigation and reservoirs in landscapes. The exception is for small scale
    irrigation in Volta basin, which suggests doubling of cropland under low potential
    for successful outscaling of smallholder irrigation as a result of lower rainfall
    and less access to irrigation water. We speculate that the reduction in rainfall
    affects stream density (river length) in particular, which is relatively dense
    in the current Volta basin context enabling success of small scale irrigation.
    Under reduced rainfall, with the scaling function used here (Section 2.2), Volta
    is relatively more affected than in Limpopo. We suggest that the TAGMI tool can
    provide guidance in decisions of targeting of AWM development also in view of
    potential futures. In this study''s application with drier climate, there are
    areas that show consistent potential for successful AWM outscaling. This information
    can be a sign of robustness, where an investment will not only be an opportunity
    today, but also under drier climate providing opportunities for successful adaption
    of the selected AWM. This is confirmed by comparing spatial changes in the predicted
    likelihood of successful outscaling of AWM technologies under current conditions
    (in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Section 3.2) with the predicted likelihood of outscaling under
    climate change in Limpopo basin (Fig. 12) and in Volta basin (Fig. 13), as summarised

    of concept was tested against two sources of independent data. Firstly, we checked
    TAGMI model prediction against existing known uptake of a given AWM technology.
    For Volta basin, we were able to compare the TAGMI predictions of soil and water
    conservation with known adoption of soil and water conservation strategies by
    smallholders in Burkina Faso, as measured in the 2006 agricultural survey (MAHRH
    (Ministère de l''Agriculture, de l''Hydraulique et des Ressources Halieutiques)
    and DGPSA (Direction Générale des Prévisions et des Statistiques Agricoles), 2007).
    The data show moderate agreement in model predictions versus existing implementation,
    in that 25 of the 34 districts fully covered by TAGMI have a matching ‘high’,
    ‘medium’ and ‘low’ potential and implementation, corresponding to 74% agreement
    (Morris and Barron, 2014) (Fig. 14). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14.
    Validating TAGMI predictions on Soil Water Conservation (SWC) technology potential
    for success against actual adoption rates in Burkina Faso (BF). Data Source: actual
    SWC adoption rates from Burkina Faso agricultural survey (MAHRH (Ministère de
    l''Agriculture, de l''Hydraulique et des Ressources Halieutiques) and DGPSA (Direction
    Générale des Prévisions et des Statistiques Agricoles), 2007). Secondly, we propose
    to check model factors and their evidence variables against existing references
    on enabling drivers and barriers of AWM technology uptake. This should be done
    beyond biophysical appropriateness, which is often available in extension service
    manuals and technology design documentation for given agro-climatic areas. For
    the specific technologies of AWM in the Volta and Limpopo basin context, two approaches
    were used. The research teams in the Limpopo Basin Challenge Programme Water and
    Food, that focused on livelihood and social sciences, could verify through qualitative
    work on smallholder irrigation and small scale water infrastructure that the incorporated
    factors in the TAGMI models were appropriate, especially from a biophysical but
    also from labour and gender perspectives. Elsewhere, recent literature on especially
    conservation agriculture in sub-Sahara Africa provides independent evidence to
    check relations and values of the TAGMI models. Corbeels et al. (2014) suggested
    that a principal driver for uptake is functional market links for input of supplies
    and output for produce sales for adoption of conservation agriculture. This was
    specific not only for the south east Zimbabwe and southern Burkina Faso, but also
    valid for cases in e.g., Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia. A study by Mazvimavi and
    Twomlow (2009) studying >200 households'' drivers for adoption causes of conservation
    agriculture in Zimbabwe concluded that agro-ecological zone and institutional
    support through private, public or NGO extension service were critical for successful
    uptake, whereas labour availability and even prevalence of HIV did not affect
    adoption of CA in their sample. These references correspond to the many studies
    analysing drivers of technology adoption (e.g., Knowler, Bradshaw, 2007, Feder,
    Umali, 1993, Tesfaye et al, 2008, Sinyolo et al, 2014) which derive insights from
    similar technology adoption process, albeit not specific for the Volta and Limpopo
    basins as studied here. 4. Discussion There is a need to support decision makers
    in development and investment for the benefit of smallholder farming systems in
    Sub-Sahara Africa. There is a vast body of research addressing this process, the
    factors and potential responses (e.g., Knowler, Bradshaw, 2007, Mazvimavi, Twomlow,
    2009, Corbeels et al, 2014, Feder, Umali, 1993, Tesfaye et al, 2008, Sinyolo et
    al, 2014), and also a vast body of knowledge among practitioners, including farmers
    themselves. Yet, decision support tools to date in the outscaling of agricultural
    water management (AWM) technologies have two drawbacks: (i) having mainly been
    constructed by researchers; and (ii) having more emphasis on biophysical suitability
    for technologies rather than on the social, human and economic constraints and
    other opportunities which affect AWM adoption to scale. Only one reference using
    a consultative approach for a DSS was identified for conservation agriculture
    in northern Tanzania (Ndah et al., 2012). The example uses a different approach
    and has less representation both in consultation process and scope of technologies
    and geographic scale. Here we present the ‘Targeting AGwater Management Interventions’
    (TAGMI) tool, with applications as a ‘proof of concept’ for decision support (DSS)
    for AWM outscaling in Volta and Limpopo basins. TAGMI is taking DSS one step further,
    firstly by incorporating different sources of expertise in model design through
    a process of engagement with researchers, farmers, investors and policy makers
    working to enable outscaling of AWM in Limpopo and Volta basins. As a result,
    social, human and financial factors have equal or more prominence as critical
    factors affecting outscaling, and the representation of such factors is imperative
    in the DSS. In general, although the order of priority may change, there is a
    high level of agreement on the key factors influencing success, between technologies
    and across basins. The definition of conditional probabilities and weighting of
    factors, however, could be more detailed, as the model results are still coarse.
    This is a particular consideration, given that the elicitation of conditional
    probabilities and weightings is subjective rather than quantitative. As more case
    studies are conducted that apply the TAGMI tool, a common knowledge base of probabilities
    and weightings should be compiled which can then be used to strengthen confidence
    in the subjective values. In addition, the consultations recognised that equally,
    if not more, important to the success of a technology outscaling at farm level
    are the ‘Best practices of implementation’ which are in the implementers'' control:
    community ownership, the implementing organisation has engaged with stakeholders
    throughout the process, and a clear demand for the proposed technology. Furthermore,
    the intervention must have clear objectives and offer an appropriately designed
    technology (de Bruin et al, 2015, Anderson et al, 2012). We conclude that the
    opportunity in levering success in AWM outscaling is not only hinged on existing
    social–biophysical conditionalities (which can be described in more or less detail
    spatially, as in TAGMI), but more effort must be paid to the process, once potential
    locations for investments and/or development action have been identified. Bayesian
    network modelling was shown to be a useful approach of integrating socio-economic,
    institutional and biophysical aspects of a district to build a decision-support
    tool, providing both capacity to incorporate different pools of knowledge, and
    also enable the display in strength of prediction – a feature rarely provided
    in DSS and modelling (e.g., Johnston & Smakhtin, 2014). However, the TAGMI tool
    with its proof-of-concept application to three AWM technologies in Volta and Limpopo
    basins is still at an early stage. We identify some key areas in need of further
    research to strengthen the TAGMI concept. Firstly, the sensitivity and calibration–validation
    process need further development to ensure the validity in predictions. To date,
    there is little independent evidence on farmers application of AWM strategies
    which is explicit in spatial extent (i.e. beyond a specific community and/or <100
    ha) with records of impact (i.e., significant yield, income benefit for farmer
    household/community), particularly in Limpopo basin consultations. Hence, the
    evidence to verify TAGMI predictions is scarce, at least at basin scale. We present
    here an example of validating against SWC outscaling evidence in north and central
    Burkina Faso (Morris and Barron, 2014), with an R2 = 0.75, which is normally acceptable
    for comparing observed and modelled output in e.g., a biophysical crop-water and
    hydrological context. As outlined by Douxchamps et al. (2014), outscaling of AWM
    is also affected by the discourses at time of investments, i.e., the factors perceived
    as critical in 2014 are likely different from the factors perceived critical in
    AWM investments done in the 1980s or 1990s. Two examples can be mentioned here,
    regarding small reservoirs. In the Volta basin, the small reservoirs were largely
    supported by external investments in the 1980s (e.g., Cecchi et al., 2009), hence
    we expect a different set of factors were used for positioning the existing small
    reservoirs in Volta basin, making a validation with the current TAGMI Volta basin
    factor model difficult to achieve with high agreement. Similarly, although parts
    of Limpopo also have a significant number of small and medium reservoirs, these
    were largely implemented by commercial large-scale farmers, and the factors in
    the TAGMI Limpopo small reservoir outscaling model are unlikely the same underpinning
    decisions as for the commercial large-scale farmers at the time of investments.
    Secondly, the input data used for different evidence variables need to be of higher
    resolution in order to strengthen the predictions by TAGMI and make them more
    relevant to the existing context. Ideally the resolution of input data should
    be at least an order of magnitude finer than the output resolution. In particular,
    efforts to improve the social–human data input would be important to better reflect
    the consolidated weight of influence that the social and human factors have on
    the AWM adoption and outscaling. It turned out to be very challenging to populate
    especially social and human capital related evidence layers at sub-national level.
    Yet, these were perceived as critical for determining likelihood of successful
    AWM technology uptake. Data were often available at national level (e.g. World
    Bank and FAO databases) or at very fine scale for individual case studies, covering
    local communities and villages. These case studies are rarely put into a bigger
    context, to assess representativeness and value for generic lessons. Another major
    challenge with socio-economic factors is agreeing on evidence variables that satisfactorily
    describe the factor and the causality from evidence to factor. For example, social
    cohesion, local leadership and organisational capacity in communities were identified
    as important, both for community-run technologies, and for collective learning
    and spreading of individual technologies. But the evidence to measure the factors,
    as well as the benefit of specific factors for different AWM technologies, still
    needs further work. Thirdly, the TAGMI approach would benefit from a systematic
    sensitivity analysis to better identify any critical concerns about model structure
    that could be strengthened further. A particular concern is the threshold limits
    of each evidence variable, and how to verify these for the contribution to successful
    potential for AWM outscaling. These thresholds could be better elicited by various
    experts, in addition to verification in scientific literature. The TAGMI approach
    with the ‘proof of concept’ of three categories of AWM technologies and the respective
    potential for outscaling in Limpopo and Volta is to date unique. Early results
    of verification suggest it can be an opportunity to embed best available knowledge
    in a meaningful and inclusive way for improved DSS for targeted investments in
    AWM development to benefit smallholder farmer practise. The process and model
    is generic and open source. The TAGMI tool can be expanded by developing additional
    Bayesian network models tailored for other technologies beyond agricultural water
    management. Such examples could be post-harvest practices, enhancing livestock
    and aquaculture management or support in specific crop system improvements beyond
    water management practices. 5. Conclusions Agricultural development needs urgent
    acceleration of uptake of best practises in sub-Saharan Africa, to meet climate,
    food security and income growth challenges in the near future. As part of this
    process, decision-makers need access to best knowledge and tools to target interventions
    and investments to support farmers in adopting agricultural water management (AWM)
    interventions, alongside other crop–livestock system improvements. The online
    open source decisions support tool ‘Targeting Agricultural Water Management Interventions’
    (TAGMI) can assist in spatially identifying areas with high/medium/low potential
    for successful AWM. TAGMI presents several innovative features over existing AWM
    decision support: it is based on a consolidated source of knowledge drawing from
    expertise of multiple communities of practise including policy, farmers and researchers;
    it incorporates critical social and human factors alongside biophysical and economic
    features; and it provides strength of prediction estimate to ensure best knowledge
    is underlying the outputs. Within the study, and in line with other studies, there
    is a high level of agreement on the factors affecting outscaling across technologies,
    countries and basins. The study showed that there is opportunity for outscaling
    of soil and water conservation, smallholder irrigation and small reservoirs but
    prediction strength is low based on current data. Data for the evidence variables
    are not always available at district level or finer, that at the same time covers
    the whole region. In particular, data on social–human layers are critical, and
    need improvement to reflect critical information for development progress. In
    addition, ‘Best practices in implementation’, together with a suitable context,
    are critical to achieving successful outscaling. The TAGMI ‘proof of concept‘
    incorporating best to-date knowledge in a highly accessible decisions support
    system needs further development, but the process and practise of TAGMI is generic
    and can be further developed for other technology/interventions addressing smallholder
    farmer needs in other geographical spheres. The TAGMI approach can be further
    strengthened in prediction certainty with development of especially social–human
    related factors affecting outscaling, as well as determining thresholds in opportunity
    and barriers. Acknowledgements This article is based on the TAGMI documentation

    Abstract Controlled and efficient agricultural irrigation management is required
    to avoid negative effects of the increasing world water scarcity and therefore
    to assure a sustainable production. Within this context, the project ‘Participatory
    multi-Level EO-assisted tools for Irrigation water management and Agricultural
    Decision-Support’ (PLEIADeS: http://www.pleiades.es) addressed the efficient and
    sustainable use of water for food production in water-scarce environments. The
    project aimed at improving the performance of irrigation schemes by means of a
    range of measures, made possible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation
    (E.O.) data and interactive networking capabilities of Information and Communication
    Technologies (ICT). Project partners, represented by a set of pilot case-studies,
    included a broad range of conditions characteristic for the European, Southern
    Mediterranean and American regions. Algorithms for a number of basic products
    for the estimation of Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) have been defined in
    an operational framework. In this study a review of application of these algorithms,
    applied and validated within different case-studies during the project, is presented.

    remote sensing 1. Introduction The potential of Earth Observation techniques in
    the management of land and water resources has been widely acknowledged (FAO,
    1995, Schultz and Engman, 2000). The repeatability of observations on a cyclic
    basis and the availability of high spatial resolution multispectral data – which
    are common characteristic to sensors on-board several orbiting platforms – are
    particularly suitable for mapping crops and irrigated areas with satisfactory
    accuracy and in a cost-effective way. During recent years, the amount of available
    sensors, with enhanced observation capabilities, has increased enormously the
    possibilities of acquisition, opening to operational services in irrigation water
    management. Nowadays space-based systems provide intensive agriculture with the
    capability to monitor crop status, predict crop yield, detect diseases and insect
    infestations, and support the management of farming inputs and tasks, within the
    broader concept of “precision farming”. In spite of these research and technological
    developments, the management of irrigation is often not adequately addressed by
    operative applications of Earth Observation; furthermore, such support is nearly
    nonexistent in developing countries. Irrigated agriculture requires appropriate
    information to support appropriate environmental and development strategies, which
    can be provided in an effective way by implementing Earth Observation services.
    The project ‘Participatory multi-Level E.O.-assisted tools for Irrigation water
    management and Agricultural Decision-Support’ (PLEIADeS: http://www.pleiades.es),
    launched in 2006, has addressed the utilisation of novel technologies for promoting
    an efficient and sustainable use of water for food production in water-scarce
    environments. These technologies include wide space-time coverage of Earth Observation
    (E.O.) data and interactive networking capabilities of Information and Communication
    Technologies (ICT). The controlled and efficient use of the water resources is
    achieved by monitoring Irrigation Water Requirement (IWR) on an operational basis
    and by implementing Irrigation Advisory Services (IAS) as management instruments
    to support decisions on water use made at different levels, from farms to river-basins.
    One of the outputs of the PLEIADeS project has been the definition of a complete
    portfolio of Earth Observation (E.O.) products for irrigation water management,
    together with a set of consolidated methodologies to derive them. Three different
    levels of E.O.-based products have been defined: (L0) Land-use data, i.e. maps
    of irrigated vs. nonirrigated crops and crop inventory maps; (L1) Basic products
    for operational use, including canopy parameters (fractional vegetation cover;
    leaf area index (LAI), surface albedo, crop-coefficient (Kc), evapotranspiration
    under standard conditions (ETp), Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR); (L2) Advanced
    products, such reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from geostationary satellites,
    actual evapotranspiration, biomass and yield. In this paper we present examples
    of derivation of L1-basic products, resulting from experimental activities carried
    out during the project by different teams in a broad range of arid and semi-arid
    conditions. Five case-studies were selected from the PLEIADeS framework, representing
    different agricultural systems: (a) the Nurra site in Italy, (b) the Yaqui Valley
    in Mexico, (c) Marrakesh and Agafay sites in Morocco, (d) Montijo in Spain, and
    (e) the Caia district in Portugal. Herbaceous crops were mainly considered with
    the exception of site (c) were tree crops such as olive and orange orchards were
    dominant. The products of PLEIADES have been derived by applying the methodologies
    described in this work with different types of multispectral E.O. data, from Landsat
    TM to high-resolution Formosat images, during the irrigation seasons 2007 and
    2008. 2. Definitions of Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) and estimation methods
    Irrigation Water Requirement (IWR) can be defined as the amount of water, net
    of effective precipitation, needed to fulfil evapotranspiration for maximum plant
    growth and yield of a given crop in a specific climate regime and at a given time
    of its phenology: (1) Pn is the effective precipitation, i.e. net of foliage interception.
    The evapotranspiration ETp in Eq. (1) is determined when the so-called “standard
    conditions” occur, as introduced by the well-known FAO-56 procedure of Allen et
    al. (1998) for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration. This procedure
    is based on the schematisation of Monteith and Unsworth (1990) for describing
    the exchange of mass and energy between the canopy and the atmosphere and requiring
    climatic data and canopy parameters, namely the leaf area index, LAI, the surface
    albedo, r, the crop height hc and the canopy resistance rc. This latter term is
    dependent on the crop physiology, plus climatic and hydrological conditions, i.e.
    incoming solar radiation, vapour pressure deficit and soil water status. Under
    standard or potential conditions, as introduced above, i.e. when soil water is
    not limited, the canopy resistance reaches a minimum value rc,min that can be
    estimated using the expression (Szeicz and Long, 1969, Allen et al., 1998): (2)
    In Eq. (2) rleaf,min is the minimum stomatal resistance of a single leaf, approximately
    equal to 100 s m−1, and LAIeff is the fraction of leaf area index effectively
    taking part in the evapotranspiration process. It is common to take LAIeff = LAI
    until the value of 0.5 LAImax is reached, after which LAIeff is kept constant.
    Kelliher et al. (1995) showed that a minimum value rc,min = 50 to 70 s m−1 applies
    to most crops hence the relationship (2) is valid for LAI ≤ 4. For larger values
    of LAI, a constant rc,min is taken. As such, the evapotranspiration under standard
    conditions ETp is a function of meteorological variables (incoming solar radiation,
    air temperature and humidity, wind speed) and canopy parameters (LAI, r and hc).
    The equation to calculate ETp from these data is defined as the direct calculation
    of the FAO-56 procedure (Allen et al., 1998), to which we refer for further analytical
    details. For canopies not covering completely the soil surface, we need to distinguish
    between soil evaporation and canopy transpiration. The potential soil evaporation
    rate Es,p can be estimated from ETp as a function of LAI, accordingly to the model
    proposed by Ritchie (1972): (3) where c is an extinction coefficient. This relationship
    is in agreement with the approach suggested by Ritchie (1972), which is based
    on the extinction of net radiation as an exponential function of LAI. Then, the
    potential transpiration rate Tp is derived as the residual term between potential
    evapotranspiration and soil evaporation rates: (4) It is important to remember
    that the parameter LAI is also needed to calculate the net precipitation Pn in
    Eq. (1) from rain-gauge data (Braden, 1985). The difficulties related with the
    measurement of the set of canopy parameters have determined the recurrent usage
    of the “old” crop-coefficient concept, introduced by Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977).
    The value of crop-coefficient Kc is commonly attributed from a field evaluation
    of the crop development and phenological stage by using the tables proposed by
    the original authors and also reported in the FAO-56 procedure. It is clear that
    the crop-coefficient Kc is a proxy of the canopy parameters (LAI, r and hc); indeed,
    an analytical expression relating Kc to climatic data and canopy parameters can
    be easily found, as shown later. It is interesting to notice that the same canopy
    parameters entering the direct calculation of ETp are also influencing to a great
    extent the spectral response of a cropped surface, i.e. the way it appears from
    a remote sensor in the visible and infrared wavelengths. Given this background
    information, we can distinguish between empirical and physically-based methodologies
    for using Earth Observation data in irrigation-related applications. In the first
    case, canopy parameters, namely LAI and crop-coefficient Kc, are estimated by
    using empirical relationships between vegetation indices and field observations.
    Physically-based methods rely on the applications of two successive steps: (i)
    radiative transfer models for deriving canopy parameters (LAI, albedo); (ii) direct
    calculation of ETp by using the FAO-56 equation with E.O.-based canopy parameters.
    3. Empirical methods for deriving L1-products Owing to the reflective properties
    of vegetation and its relationships with canopy characteristics, such as LAI,
    albedo, Kc, various E.O. based methodologies, ranging from empirical to more physically-based
    algorithms, have been exploited in recent years. The simplest method is the relationship
    between satellite-derived indices and the parameter of interest. The normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the most widely used vegetation index (VI),
    and it has been related to a variety of biophysical variables such as fractional
    vegetation cover (fCover) (Carlson and Ripley, 1997), fraction of absorbed photosynthetic
    active radiation (fAPAR) (Sellers et al., 1997), primary production (Monteith
    and Unsworth, 1990), leaf area index LAI (Gilabert et al., 1996) and crop-coefficient
    Kc (Neale et al., 1989). Even though a high number of alternative indices has
    been developed during the last decades, the NDVI remains the most well-known and
    acknowledged index applied on optical remote sensing data. For this reason and
    the possibility to quickly and easily determine living green plant components,
    the index was also implemented in the PLEIADeS context, by using top-of-atmosphere
    or surface reflectance in the red (ρ R) and infrared waveband (ρ NIR) regions
    of satellites sensors: (5) Linear or exponential relationships between NDVI and
    some of the parameters of interest in the L1-products group have been established,
    also by using different types of sensors with cross-calibration procedures. Fractional
    vegetation cover describes the horizontal vegetation density, i.e. the percentage
    of soil covered by vegetation and corresponds to the gap fraction in the nadir
    direction. Since fCover is a canopy intrinsic variable (i.e. without dependency
    on variables such as the geometry of illumination), it is seen as a very potential
    candidate to replace classical VIs in view of vegetation monitoring (Baret et
    al., 2005). Eq. (6) gives an empirical relationship between fCover and NDVI, found
    by D’Urso and Calera Belmonte (2006): (6) The leaf area index (LAI) is the biophysical
    surface parameter attracting most interest in studies dealing with E.O. data.
    LAI is defined as the total one-sided area of photosynthetic tissue per unit of
    ground area (Breda, 2003). Due to the role of green leaves in a wide range of
    biological and physical processes, LAI represents a key parameter, characterizing
    the structure and functioning of vegetation cover. Simplified empirical methods
    are available to estimate leaf area index from satellite-based surface reflectance
    with satisfactory accuracy for operational applications. In such cases, LAI is
    derived by means of regression equations with different types of vegetation indices
    to reduce the atmospheric effects or the soil background influence. The canopy
    is generally assumed to behave as a Lambertian surface, thus the canopy reflectance
    is constant with the angle of observation. The accuracy of these expressions is
    confined within the validity of calibration of the regression used, which are
    often crop-dependent and sensor specific. A very common method is based on the
    empirical relationship between LAI and NDVI according the following exponential
    formula: (7) where A and B are fitting parameters. A more physical basis underlies
    the approach based on the weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI) defined
    by Clevers (1989) as follows: (8) where the subscript s is referred to bare soil
    conditions. The ratio of near-infrared and red soil reflectance is also known
    in the literature as the “soil line slope”, and it can be derived by analysing
    a scatterplot of bare soil pixels identified within the image; its value is generally
    close to 1. Finally, the LAI is related to WDVI of the observed surface through
    the expression: (9) In Eq. (9), A* is an extinction coefficient to be determined
    from simultaneous measurements of LAI and WDVI; WDVI∞ is the asymptotical value
    of WDVI for LAI → ∞. This approach has been validated by means of numerical models
    simulating the reflectance of leaf and canopy in a wide range of conditions. These
    models confirmed that an accurate estimate of LAI requires the knowledge of the
    leaf angle distribution, and, to a minor extent, of other factors, such as sun-zenith
    angle, chlorophyll content and mesophyl structure. The estimation of surface albedo
    r can be done by using a simplified form of its physical definition. By invoking
    the Lambertian assumption again, the spectral integration of surface reflected
    radiance K↑ is approximated in discrete form as follows: (10) In Eq. (10) the
    spectral (reflected) radiance, (W m−2), and the extraterrestrial solar irradiance,
    (W m−2), are integrated values over the width of each spectral band λi; ϑ0 and
    d0 are the solar zenith angle and the sun–earth distance in astronomical units.
    When using atmospherically corrected surface reflectance values, the surface albedo
    can be calculated as (Menenti et al., 1989): (11) where the weighting factors
    wi are calculated for each type of sensor from the following equation: (12) Crop
    height hc is, as LAI, strongly correlated to the aerodynamic properties of uniform
    vegetation canopies. Wind regime parameters, such as zero displacement height
    and roughness length are dependent on crop height and canopy architecture, which
    consequently influence the transfer of heat and water vapour from the evaporating
    surface (Monteith and Unsworth, 1990). Measurements of aerodynamic properties,
    such as crop height, are still very difficult to perform on a routine basis by
    using E.O. data. For some crops a strong relationship between hc and NDVI/LAI
    was observed. Although these relationships are dependant on the crop type and
    on the canopy architecture, the resulting estimation errors do not affect in a
    very significant way the calculation of ETp in summer conditions. However, in
    radiation-dominated environments such as summer conditions in Mediterranean regions,
    the assumption of a constant crop height may result in a satisfactory compromise
    in the calculation of daily values of evapotranspiration for most applications.
    The value of the so-called “crop-coefficient” Kc value is strongly influenced
    by the spectral behaviour of observed canopies. As such, crop-coefficients values
    can be related to canopy development and fractional vegetation cover. Since these
    vegetation characteristics are well correlated with spectral reflectances, it
    is possible to establish a correlation between remote multispectral observations
    of uniformly growing crops and corresponding Kc values derived from field investigations
    (Bausch and Neale, 1987, Choudhury et al., 1987). The following equations give
    examples of empirical NDVI–Kc relationships, applied within the PLEIADeS project:
    (13) by D’Urso and Calera Belmonte (2006), (14) by Neale et al. (1989) and: (15)
    by Calera Belmonte et al. (2003). Satellite-derived VIs, such as the NDVI, have
    been widely used to predict canopy attributes and vegetation processes. These
    empirical models are related to composite properties (e.g. of leaf chlorophyll
    content, leaf area, canopy cover and structure) than to single attributes (Glenn
    et al., 2008). According to the definition of the L1-product in the PLEIADES project,
    these relationships should not be applied for crops experiencing stress conditions.
    It should be emphasized that the Kc–NDVI approach is simple and immediate; as
    such it is very suitable for operative real-time applications. On the other hand,
    this method has several critical points: the relationship between Kc and NDVI
    is based on subjective evaluations of crop development in the field, and as such
    can not be validated extensively on different types of crops (excluding well-maintained
    lysimeter installations); the NDVI of a vegetation cover is also very much dependent
    on the viewing angle. Deviation from a viewing angle larger than 20° from nadir
    may result in an overestimation of NDVI; the radiometric information of NDVI is
    very limited, and thus is not able to detect many surface patterns which may affect
    its reflectance behaviour. Consequently, site and sensor- or crop-specific calibrations
    are often required, implying time and cost-intense field measurement programs
    (Baret and Buis, 2008). 4. Physically-based methods for deriving L1-products 4.1.
    Radiative transfer models (LAI, albedo) Physically-based radiative transfer models
    (RTM) offer an interesting alternative to empirical methods and they have been
    employed with success over various crops (e.g. Combal et al., 2002, Vuolo et al.,
    2008). RTMs are implemented to interpret the spectral signal acquired by a multi-
    or hyperspectral sensor (from 400 to 2500 nm) as a function of a number of canopy
    and soil parameters as well as illumination and viewing conditions. In principle,
    the physical approach may achieve a more accurate estimation of canopy parameters
    compared to empirical methods, without needed field calibration data. Nevertheless,
    other restrictions, such as the need of an extensive parameterization, as well
    as the high computational demand, depending on the model complexity, have to be
    considered. In the PLEIADeS context, we have tested one of the most well-known
    and wide-spread RTMs: the SAILH model (Kuusk, 1991, Verhoef, 1984), combined with
    PROSPECT (Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990) to “PROSAILH”. The model offers a good compromise
    between the complexity of the represented processes and the computation time.
    Moreover it has been widely validated (e.g. by Weiss et al., 2000, Atzberger et
    al., 2003 or Richter et al., 2009) and is already implemented in operational processing
    chains (e.g. Bacour et al., 2006). Briefly, the SAILH model simulates canopy bi-directional
    reflectance as a function of three structural parameters i.e. LAI, average leaf
    inclination angle (ALA), and hot spot parameter (HotS) – roughly defined as the
    ratio of the leaf size to canopy height – soil spectral reflectance plus a multiplicative
    factor indicating variations of superficial soil water content (Atzberger et al.,
    2003), leaf reflectance and transmittance, fraction of diffuse irradiance and
    the view and illumination geometry. Leaf reflectance and transmittance are simulated
    by the PROSPECT model as a function of four structural and biochemical leaf parameters:
    leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), dry matter content (Cm), leaf water thickness
    (Cw) and a leaf mesophyll structural parameter (N). Moreover, when calculating
    the reflectance, the SAILH model estimates the gap fraction, defined as the probability
    of a ray of light passing through the canopy without encountering foliage or other
    plant elements, corresponding consequently to the complement to 1 of fCover. Model
    inversion was performed using a fast, simple and robust look-up table (LUT) (e.g.
    Weiss et al., 2000, Richter et al., 2009). 100,000 canopy parameter combinations
    have been input to the RTM, providing a satisfactory balance between computer
    resources requirement and estimation quality (Weiss et al., 2000). Sampling schemes
    of variables can be taken from field measurements, literature or experimental
    tests. The LUT is generated by running the model in the forward way (using the
    illumination geometries for the respective satellite sensor overpass), calculating
    thus bi-directional reflectance and fCover for a defined spectral sampling (corresponding
    to the sensor channels, such as SPOT). In order to solve the inverse problem a
    cost function is applied, based on the minimisation of the RMSE values between
    simulated and measured spectra: (16) where Rmeas corresponds to the measured reflectance
    in the respective waveband λi, and RLUT to the reflectance simulated from the
    model. The resulting output parameters set (and thus values of LAI and fCover)
    is determined by calculating the mean of all cases corresponding to the spectra
    being within 20% of the best radiometric match (Koetz et al., 2005, Richter et
    al., 2008). To calculate the surface albedo, model forward simulations are carried
    out with PROSAILH, simulating the reflectance (R) from 400–2400 nm integrated
    in 10° (or 20°) steps of possible view geometries for a given sun elevation (Richter
    et al., 2008). The parameters estimated from the LUT in the preceding model inversion
    process (such as Cab, LAI, ALA and Cw) are used as input for the simulation: (17)
    where is the viewing zenith angle of the sensor and ϕ the relative azimuth angle
    between sun and sensor. Eq. (17) is calculated considering dθv = dϕ = Δθv = Δϕ
    = 0.017684 rad and dλ = Δλ = 1 nm. However, the long computation time of the physical
    model approach may inhibit its suitability for an operational use in agricultural
    monitoring. 4.2. Direct calculation of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) and
    crop-coefficient Kc The determination of the required canopy parameters (albedo,
    LAI and crop height) is the main limitation in the direct calculation of ETp in
    the FAO-56 procedure (one-step approach). The procedures described in the previous
    section provide a solution to this limitation. This approach would indeed eliminate
    the calculation of the crop-coefficient Kc; nevertheless, due to its wide use
    in irrigation practice, we can derive a physically-based Kc on the basis of the
    FAO one-step approach. Considering that the Kc value is related both to the actual
    development of the canopy and to the environmental conditions, it can be analytically
    defined by applying twice the one-step approach: the first one with actual canopy
    parameters to calculate ETp, the second time with the values of reference surface
    for ET0 calculation. As such, Kc can be expressed as an explicit function of the
    canopy properties, LAI, r and hc, and of the meteorological data K↓, Ta. RH, U.
    This approach leads to a physically-based approach to determine Kc (Stanghellini
    et al., 1990, D’Urso and Calera Belmonte, 2006): (18) As mentioned earlier, under
    conditions of high solar irradiance, the influence of crop height on ETp is not
    so relevant, and as the analytical expression of Kc can be further simplified
    by assuming a constant value for hc (i.e. 0.40 m regardless of the crop type).
    5. Case-studies and data acquisition in the PLEIADeS project The methods described
    in the previous sections have been tested in several test-site areas of the PLEIADeS
    project, to evaluate their accuracy in operational applications under different
    agricultural and climatic conditions. In this paper we briefly describe the results
    of five test sites where L1-products have been applied and validated. In three
    sites, Nurra (Italy), Yaqui Valley (Mexico) and Agafay (Morocco) detailed experiments
    for field validations have been carried out; in the other two sites (Montijo,
    Spain and Caia, Portugal), we describe some examples of transferability of the
    validated procedures for deriving L1-products in operational applications. 5.1.
    Field validation, site (a): Nurra, Italy The Nurra site is located within the
    Cuga river basin of Sardinia, Italy, and it is characterised by herbaceous crops
    and vinyears. Measurements were carried out during July and August 2007, at two
    farms: the regional experimental farm “Bonassai”, aiming to represent dominant
    land-cover types and satisfying the spatial scale requirements (maize and alfalfa,
    being under central pivot irrigation), and at a commercial vineyard farm. Ground
    measurements of LAI were collected nearly every 2 days along the 2 months campaign
    by means of the LAI-2000 (LiCOR) instrument. Actual crop evapotranspiration ETa
    was monitored by means of the eddy covariance (EC) method from 13 to 25 July at
    the maize field, from 26th July to 12th August at the alfalfa field. Acquired
    data were processed to determine the crop evapotranspiration ETa on hourly intervals
    as the residual term of the surface energy balance. Measurements of incoming solar
    radiation, wind speed, air temperature and humidity were aggregated on an hourly
    basis in order to calculate the reference evapotranspiration ET0 according to
    the FAO-56 procedure. In order to estimate canopy characteristics from maize and
    alfalfa, multi-temporal hyperspectral acquisitions were collected throughout the
    campaign by using an ASD-Field-Spec UV-VNIR field spectrometer operating in the
    spectral range from 350 to 1050 nm. In addition, Landsat-TM-5 and SPOT 4 images
    were acquired. The following relationship between LAI and NDVI was found at the
    Italian test site by using ground measured LAI data of alfalfa and maize for calibration
    (13% of total measurements; R2 = 0.94): (19) As shown in the plot of Fig. 1, the
    application of Eq. (19) (data used for calibration are excluded) can be considered
    as satisfactory, with an RMSE of 0.71 m2/m2. However the plateau-effect of the
    NDVI-LAI relationship is evident, i.e. saturation occurs at LAI values higher
    than 3–3.5. A comparably good correlation was found for concurrently measured
    hc and LAI of maize (Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Correlation

    The best results have been obtained with the configuration corresponding to the
    future Sentinel-2 ESA satellite, as expected from its higher spectral resolution.
    However, satisfactory results are also obtained with Landsat TM. The reliability
    of RTMs application has also been confirmed for the estimation of surface albedo,
    which results, shown in Fig. 4, evidenced a better accuracy than the empirical
    approach. Realizations of canopy characteristics and further details of the model
    set up can be found in Richter et al. (2008). Download : Download full-size image

    approaches for the estimation of ETp have been compared on two well-irrigated
    fields of maize and alfalfa at the Bonassai farm, where the crop water status
    was coherent with the FAO definition of “potential conditions”. The calculations
    were performed by using field spectrometer measurements (ASD Field-Spec HH) and
    data from the EC station. Hourly values of ETp, calculated by using six different
    methods to derive the canopy characteristics, were compared against the independent
    set of ETa achieved from the EC-measurements: ET0 − Kc(NDVI): crop-coefficient
    derived from NDVI empirical relationship—Eq. (13). ET0 − Kc(FAO): based on crop-coefficient
    tables of FAO-56. ETp(meas): by using field measurements of canopy parameters
    LAI, albedo r and crop height hc. ETp (WDVI): by using WDVI (Clevers, 1989) semi-empirical
    model for LAI, measured r and hc. ETp (lut): by using the LUT-based model inversion
    to retrieve LAI and r and measured hc. ETp (lut0.4): by using the LUT-based model
    inversion to retrieve LAI and r but fixing hc at 0.4. In the case of maize (Fig.
    5) RMSE ranged from 0.07 (ET0 − Kc (FAO)) to 0.14 mm h−1 (ET0 − Kc (NDVI)). All
    approaches – except ET0 − Kc (FAO) – indicated an overestimation of the evapotranspiration
    compared to the measured data of actual ET. Even though the crop was regularly
    irrigated, the high temperatures in this period leaded to a fast depletion of
    soil moisture: during the 12-days period maize plants reached approximately 0.9–1.2
    m height, hence not yet fully covering the ground (fCover ≅ 0.6) and thus facilitating
    fast evaporation rates. This effect might partially explain the fact that ETa
    is slightly larger than ETp, which is quite unusual in Mediterranean conditions.
    Considering these aspects, it is difficult to evaluate which method showed the
    most realistic results. However, results based on the FAO one-step approach applied
    by using either direct measurements or physical estimations of canopy parameters
    have shown the highest coefficients of determination (R2 = 0.93/0.94). Download

    case study). ETp values were estimated using the FAO methodologies with six different
    approaches to retrieve canopy parameters such as LAI, r or Kc-coefficient. In
    case of alfalfa (Fig. 6), ETp(lut0.4) and ETp (meas) achieved the highest estimation
    performance (RMSE = 0.04 mm h−1). The other four approaches revealed a slight
    overestimation of ETp, ranging from RMSE = 0.06 (ETp(WDVI)) to RMSD = 0.11 mm
    h−1 (ETp(lut)). However, alfalfa plants covered almost completely the ground,
    especially in the last days being shortly before harvesting. Hence, evaporation
    losses from soil background were less than for maize and ETp and ETa should be
    very close. Also in the case of alfalfa test site, it could be concluded, that
    the FAO one-step approach was the best performing method, when using measurements
    or physically-based estimations of LAI and r, even with fixed canopy height. Download

    canopy parameters such as LAI, r or Kc-coefficient. 5.2. Field validation, site
    (b): Yaqui Valley, Mexico The Yaqui Valley, Sonora, is located in the northwestern
    part of Mexico; measurements were carried out from December 2007 to May 2008 mainly
    on wheat fields. Furrow irrigation is practiced in the area. An EC station was
    employed from January 3 to May 10, 2008 in a wheat field (variety ‘Átil’) to measure
    ETa on half-hourly intervals. Meteorological data were acquired and aggregated
    to an hourly basis in order to calculate ET0 according to the FAO-56 procedure.
    Multi-temporal/spectral acquisitions were collected throughout the campaign by
    using MSR5 & MSR16 multispectral radiometers (CROPSCAN) operating in the spectral
    range from 450 to 1750 nm (+/−). Forty-two cloud-free Formosat-2/RSI images were
    collected from 15th November 2007 to 6th June 2008. The elaboration of spectral
    data was performed to derive ETp by using three empirical and one physical approach:
    ET0 − Kc(NDVI): crop-coefficient derived from NDVI empirical relationship—Eq.
    (13). ET0 − Kc(FAO): based on crop-coefficient tables of FAO-56. ETp(meas): by
    using field measurements of canopy parameters LAI, albedo r and crop height hc.
    ET0 − Kc(day): previously derived Kc values as function of emergence date. The
    experiment covered the whole crop cycle almost from emergence, when fCover was
    around 0.1, through full cover (fCover = 1) to senescence. Even though the crop
    was well irrigated, the effect of irrigation (direct and soil evaporation) is
    not evident in the measurements except for the first irrigation. In Fig. 7 the
    four approaches to calculate daily ETp are plotted against independently measured
    ETa. RMSE between measured and estimated ET ranged from 0.51 (ET0 − Kc(FAO)) to
    0.82 mm day−1 (ETp(meas)). The ET0 − Kc (FAO) estimation approach were closest
    to the measurements with RMSE = 0.52 (R2 = 0.82). ETp(meas) and ET0 − Kc(NDVI)
    showed an under estimation compared to the measured data of actual ET with 14%
    and 8%, respectively, whereas ET0 − Kc(day) and ET0 − Kc(FAO) showed a slight
    overestimation with 7% and 1.5%, respectively. The largest differences between
    the approaches appear at the end of the crop cycle as the wheat had reached the
    full ripening stage. A possible explanation for the apparent under estimation
    of ETp when using the (probably) most accurate approach (ETp(meas)) is an over-irrigation
    of the crops, leading to high evapotranspiration loads. Download : Download full-size

    for irrigation efficiency, site (c): Marrakesh and Agafay, Morocco Study test
    site (c) was situated in a semi-arid region of the Tensift-basin, Morocco. Two
    experimental installations were considered: the first one, called ‘R3’, located
    40 km east of Marrakesh city and the second one, ‘Agafay’, about 40 km west on
    the opposite side. The observed crops were wheat and olive with flood irrigation
    at R3, and orange orchard at Agafay with drip irrigation. Half-hourly measurements
    of classical climatic data were collected over olive trees using a standard micro-meteorological
    weather station (see Er-Raki et al., 2008). Moreover, an EC station was installed
    to measure the latent heat and sensible heat fluxes at each field over wheat,
    olive and orange fields. Measurement locations were selected to be representative
    for an adequate large area and instrument''s placement was designed to guaranty
    a sufficient fetch and footprint according to the area of interest and the prevailing
    wind directions. SPOT satellite data covering the region of the Tensift-basin
    were acquired at the following dates: 26th February, 10th March, 25th March, 8th
    April, 23rd April, 5th May, 19th May, and 1st June. Tests were made regarding
    the accuracy of FAO recommended Kc values at the Moroccan site. A time series
    of Kc derived from the ratio of ETa (from the EC station) and the reference value
    ET0 (from standard meteo data) is presented in Fig. 8 for an olive orchard; data

    the average value of Kc derived from FAO-56 tables for the measurement period
    and for the specific conditions of ground coverage and age of the considered olive
    orchard; the measured Kc is generally lower that the corresponding Kc FAO-56,
    except for a few points. Such results have been also found for orange orchards
    at the same site, and they confirm that the usage of standard table of Kc values
    is rather questionable especially in the case of tree crops and it might largely
    affect the estimation of the ETp. These results support the use of physically-based
    one-step approach, using a more realistic description of canopy characteristics
    and dynamics. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. The evolution of the

    carried out, comparing IWRs with the sum of irrigation and rainfall. Fig. 9 presents
    such a comparison over the olive site (similar observation over orange site):
    farmers over-irrigated of about 30%. However, despite this over-irrigation, the
    vegetation suffered from water stress sometimes during the growth cycle due to
    wrong irrigation scheduling (Ezzahar et al., 2007). Download : Download full-size

    application example, site (d): Montijo, Spain Study test site (d) is situated
    in Montijo in the Guadiana river basin, in Spain. A field campaign was carried
    out from May to August 2008, including crop observations mainly on processing
    tomato, under drip irrigation. Meteorological data (global radiation, temperature,
    humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation, etc.) were collected from a
    nearby station (2 km distance). E.O. data acquisitions included a range of Landsat-5
    TM data covering the region of Montijo approximately every 8 days. Ground measurements
    of fCover were collected on processing tomatoes by using photographs taken at
    2 m above the canopy. Ten pictures per week were taken, distributed in two parallel
    axes and centred in the plot, thus forming a 30 m × 30 m grid, similar to the
    spatial resolution of Landsat TM. Images were processed to determine fCover, and
    successively compared with estimates derived from Landsat-TM-5 acquisitions covering
    the region of Montijo and applying Eq. (6). The result on the 13 samples is shown
    in the plot of Fig. 10, evidencing a good performance with R2 = 0.96. Download

    test site (Montijo). Diversely, when the Eq. (19) – positively tested in the case-study
    (a) – has been applied for determining LAI from Landsat-based NDVI, a strong under-estimation
    compared to field measurements has been produced (Fig. 11); in this case, however,
    LAI field data were not directly measured but derived from fCover using the equation
    of Campillo et al. (2008). This example confirms the requirement of site-specific
    calibration of such empirical formula, as well as of Eq. (7) or Eq. (19). Download

    Weekly-average values of hc were linearly related to NDVI from Landsat-TM-5 imagery,
    achieving R2 of 0.95 (Fig. 12). After the maximum of fCover was reached, however,
    the correlation deteriorated due to a decrease in plant height from increasing
    fruit weights. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Linear correlation
    between NDVI from Landsat-TM imagery with crop height from processing tomatoes:
    hc = 0.55 NDVI + 0.076; R2 = 0.95, Spanish test site (Montijo). A comparison of
    different approaches to estimate Kc is shown in Fig. 13. Even though the trend
    of the curves, i.e. the development of the Kc over time, is quite comparable between
    the approaches, differences of up to 50% at maximum levels occur, which will definitely
    influence the final estimation of IWR. Therefore, special care has to be taken
    when applying empirical formulas calibrated over different test sites. Download

    5.5. Operational application example, site (e): Caia, Portugal The study area
    (e) is located within the Caia river watershed (Portugal), which is a sub-basin
    of Guadiana watershed with an area of 571 Km2. Tomatoes and maize were the prevailing
    crop types. The Caia Irrigation district covers an overall area of 9000 ha where
    7240 ha are irrigated. A total of 12 Landsat-TM images have been acquired and
    processed during the irrigation seasons of 2007 and 2008; in the latter case,
    it was possible to acquire a set of 5 consecutive cloud-free Landsat-frames. The
    maps in Fig. 14, derived from this set of images, show the temporal evolution
    of Kc values for the irrigation season 2008, where the highest crop water demand
    has been observed in correspondence of the image of 17th July. Validation and
    transferability of final products to local farmers has also been carried out.

    use of water for food production in water-scarce environments, by using leading-edge
    E.O. technologies. In this framework, a number of methodologies to derive irrigation
    water requirements were defined, applied and tested at several case-studies in
    the project''s pilot zones. The experiences carried out within the PLEIADeS project
    have confirmed that Earth Observation is a mature technology ready to be transferred
    to operational applications in irrigation management. Due to the development of
    fast-access to Web resources, the time lag between satellite acquisition and availability
    of data has sharply decreased, thus allowing real-time delivery of products to
    final users (D’Urso et al., 2009). To this end, the definition of validated methodologies,
    such as those developed in PLEIADeS, is an essential requirement to establish
    robust and fast processing chains. The validations carried out in case-studies
    (a) and (b) have confirmed the suitability of the crop-coefficient estimation
    from NDVI as a speditive mean to estimate crop water requirements; however, the
    availability of E.O. procedures for canopy estimation allow for approaching physically-based
    methods such as the standard FAO-56 procedure, which have shown to produce better
    results. The E.O. methods presented in this paper, both empirically and physically
    based, are highly correlated with the actual crop water use, as determined from
    micro-meteorological measurements. Fast inversion techniques of radiative transfer
    models can be applied to estimate the canopy parameters needed for this application,
    without requiring ancillary calibration data. These methods can accommodate different
    illumination and viewing geometry and they can take full advantage of the spectral
    characteristics of the sensors. Thanks to improvements in the spatial and radiometric
    accuracy of new sensors, such as the ESA-GMES Sentinel-2 mission (Martimort, 2007),
    a full exploitation of this type of applications can be achieved in the near future.

    Mediterranean and American regions. PLEIADeS aimed at improving the performance
    of irrigation schemes by means of a range of measures, made possible through wide
    space-time coverage of Earth observation (E.O.) data and interactive networking
    capabilities of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Algorithms for
    a number of basic products to estimate Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) in
    an operational context are defined. In this study, the pilot zone at the Nurra
    site in Sardinia, Italy, is chosen to test, validate and apply these methodologies.

    Wildlife habitat loss driven by human activities, including conversion of land
    to agriculture, represents a major threat to biodiversity. Agricultural technologies,
    for example, irrigation, mechanization, enhanced seeds, crop protection and nutrition
    products contribute to productivity increases on land already cultivated and,
    therefore, play a role in preventing further land conversion to agriculture. However,
    such technologies must be adapted and employed within the context of locally appropriate
    land management strategies that take an integrated approach to achieving agricultural
    production, rural livelihoods and biodiversity conservation goals. This paper
    was developed for presentation at a workshop on ‘Conservation Technologies for
    Sustainable Agriculture’, held during the 4th International Weed Society Congress,

    tillageEcoagriculture 1. The context The Millennium Development Goals (United
    Nations 2000) to halve poverty and hunger while ensuring environmental sustainability
    by the year 2015 presents the international community with a considerable challenge.
    This will require sustaining current increases in food production per human capita
    and also reversing current trends in natural resource degradation, particularly
    biodiversity. In 2002, the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) took
    place in Johannesburg, South Africa. Five key activity areas to achieve sustainable
    development were highlighted by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan. They are
    known as WEHAB: water, energy, health, agriculture and biodiversity (WEHAB Working
    Group 2002). With regard to agriculture and biodiversity, the Johannesburg Plan
    of Implementation (JPOI, 2002) states that “sustainable increase in agricultural
    productivity requires the adoption of integrated technologies and management practices
    that at the same time conserve land, water and living resources”. The international
    community also agreed at the WSSD to more effectively pursue the objectives of
    the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 1992) and to achieve a significant
    reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 (JPOI, 2002; CBD, 2002).
    The value of biodiversity conservation to issues of economic well-being and social
    development was further reiterated in 2003 during the decennial Vth IUCN World
    Parks Congress in Durban (IUCN (World Conservation Union), 2003a, IUCN (World
    Conservation Union), 2003b), which celebrated the extraordinary achievement of
    almost 12% of the earth''s land surface being covered by protected areas. This
    exceeds the global target of 10% originally set at the IVth World Parks Congress
    (IUCN, 1992). Nonetheless, ecosystems continue to be degraded (Millennium Ecosystem
    Assessment; MEA, 2005) and recent species extinction rates far exceed those typical
    of the planet''s history (IUCN, 2004; Dilys and Hollands, 2004). 2. Sustaining
    agricultural productivity and conserving biodiversity: challenges and opportunities
    Cultivated land, including arable lands and shifting cultivation, covers approximately
    24% of the world''s land area (MEA, 2005). In turn, protected areas amount to
    1.88 billion ha worldwide (Chape et al., 2003), covering approximately 11.7% of
    the terrestrial surface (MEA, 2005). The overlap between land under cultivation
    and land designated as protected areas is considerable. Many of these protected
    areas are explicitly set up to allow sustainable agricultural uses, particularly
    pastoral co-management in wildlife reserves. Furthermore, protected areas do not
    exist in isolation and are often situated within a broader matrix of agricultural
    landscapes (McNeely and Scherr, 2003). Inevitably, such overlap can result in
    pressure to deliver two potentially competing objectives: sustaining or enhancing
    food security and rural incomes versus biodiversity conservation. Drivers to deliver
    multiple objectives from land use strategies include the growing demand for food
    crops. From 1958 to 2002, the global human population more than doubled from 2.8
    to 6.2 billion while during the same period, total arable land area remained almost
    stable at about 1.4–1.5 billion ha (FAO, 1959; FAO, 2003). Changing consumption
    patterns, particularly growing demand for meat, exacerbate demand for cereals
    as feed as well as for direct human consumption, with global demand for cereal
    projected to increase by 41% between 1993 and 2020 (Pinstrup-Andersen et al.,
    1997). The considerable overlaps between wild biodiversity ‘hotspots’ (defined
    as land with especially high levels of biodiversity under threat from natural
    habitat loss (Myers, 1988)), land already under agricultural use and areas experiencing
    rapid rates of population growth (Cincotta and Engelman, 2000) highlights the
    inextricable linkages between food security and biodiversity conservation challenges
    at a global scale. Strategies to conserve ‘wild’ biodiversity cannot just be confined
    to protected areas. Conservation objectives must also be firmly embedded into
    agricultural practices that sustainably enhance productivity and profitability
    (Current et al., 1995). While agriculture, by definition, involves the modification
    of natural ecosystems to provide for people''s needs (McNeely and Scherr, 2003),
    there is growing evidence and awareness that food security, income generation
    and biodiversity conservation goals can be accomplished jointly. The question
    is less whether synergies exist, but how best to achieve them (Lee and Barrett,
    2000). 2.1. Inter-linkages between biodiversity and agricultural production Agricultural
    biodiversity encompasses the variety and variability of animals, plants and micro-organisms
    necessary to sustain key functions of the agro-ecosystem, its structure and processes
    associated with food production and food security (FAO, 1999). Wild biodiversity,
    on the other hand, is the variety and variability of non-domesticated plant and
    animal species (McNeely and Scherr, 2003), and the ecosystems of which these species
    are a part. Benefits and services provided by wild biodiversity to agriculture
    include the pollination activities of insects, birds or bats and their roles as
    natural enemies to insect pests, key in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (Daily,
    1997). Soil organisms, including earthworms, insects and micro-organisms, are
    important for maintaining soil structure, quality and for biological nitrogen
    fixation (Alkorta et al., 2003). In addition biodiversity provides the genetic
    variability needed for breeding new plant varieties and traits, in terms of crop
    vigour, yield and quality improvements as well as drought, stress or salt tolerance.
    Collectively, at a landscape scale, vital ecosystem functions include water filtration
    and flow regulation, nutrient cycling, and soil preservation and stabilization.
    Unfortunately, as highlighted by Kremen et al. (2002), the services and roles
    of biodiversity are often taken for granted and only fully appreciated once resource
    over-exploitation has compromised biodiversity, its service provision and thus
    agricultural production. This paper primarily focuses on strategies aiming to
    integrate wild biodiversity conservation within cropped land. 3. Addressing the
    challenge: the role of a plant science company This paper focuses on three key
    roles a plant science company can play in improving crop productivity on existing
    arable land, while conserving biodiversity as an integral component of agricultural
    production: • Developing plant science technologies that contribute to improving
    agricultural productivity on land already cultivated. • Integrate biodiversity
    conservation objectives in the development of state of the art agricultural technologies.
    • Appropriately adapting agricultural technologies to local conditions and encouraging
    Integrated Crop Management (ICM) practices at a farm level, as one element of
    broader approaches to biodiversity conservation within agricultural landscape.
    3.1. The role of agricultural technologies in biodiversity conservation The use
    of agricultural technologies that increase crop productivity can contribute to
    conserving wildlife habitat by reducing pressure to convert further land to agricultural
    production. By one estimate (Goklany, 1999) crop productivity improvements since
    1961 have forestalled habitat conversion to cropland of some 970 million ha globally.
    This makes up an area almost as large as the total land area of the United States
    (940 million ha). Improved agricultural technologies have enabled increased harvests
    on land already under cultivation, while keeping the total arable land surface
    since 1958 almost stable at about 1.4–1.5 billion ha (FAO (Food and Agricultural
    Organization of the United Nations), 1959, FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization
    of the United Nations), 2003). Agricultural technologies contributing to this
    productivity increase include improved agricultural irrigation and mechanization
    as well as enhanced seeds, crop protection and nutrition. However, the consistent
    total arable land between 1958 and 2002 masks important spatial variations. For
    example, since 1961, land under crops in the developing world has increased by
    20%, whereas in the developed world cropland area has shrunk (Green et al., 2005).
    As land continually moves in and out of agricultural use, wildlife habitat may
    be converted to cropland, or abandoned cropland may revert to wildlife habitat,
    suffer from the effects of desertification or become employed for other purposes.
    Consequently, the overall area under agricultural use is continually shifting,
    making agriculture a major influence on the availability and quality of wildlife
    habitat for biodiversity conservation (Clay, 2004; MEA, 2005). Nonetheless, agricultural
    technologies have played a significant role in improving productivity on existing
    land, reducing the need to further increase the total area of agricultural land
    globally. 3.2. Integrating biodiversity conservation objectives into state of
    the art agricultural technology development. The example of crop protection products
    Conversion of land to agriculture represents a major threat to biodiversity as
    natural landscape features are changed, forests cleared and replaced by an unceasing
    series of constantly occurring interventions in the original nature through agricultural
    activity (Körner, 2002). Many lessons have been learnt regarding the consequences
    of these interventions. These include the effects of agrochemical inputs such
    as pesticides on biodiversity, triggered by product characteristics such as environmental
    persistence (for example, DDT) but also through improper product use, leading
    for instance to run-off into non-agricultural land and water courses. The development
    of new crop protection products today requires up to 10 years of extensive state
    of the art scientific research and development activities to examine safety to
    humans and the environment before a product is placed on the market. Pesticide
    registration is highly regulated under many different national frameworks (EU,
    1991; US FIFRA, 1996; MAFF, 2004) that integrate a more holistic evaluation to
    mitigate potential negative effects of crop protection product use on non-target
    organisms and biodiversity. The testing of environmental parameters includes impacts
    on non-target species within water, soil and air. All are selected to represent
    key species that may be affected by product use, in order to evaluate the safety
    profile of crop protection products. Species examined include water organisms
    such as algae and macrophytes; cold and warm water fish; aquatic invertebrates
    such as water fleas; terrestrial plants; soil micro- and macro-organisms, such
    as earthworms; terrestrial arthropods, such as mites, parasitic wasps and bees;
    ducks and other birds; and certain mammals, such as mice (Bayer Crop Protection,
    1996). Over time, product development has incorporated increasingly complex environmental
    testing and evaluation procedures. In addition to the mono-species tests conducted
    under laboratory conditions, as outlined above, the influence of crop protection
    products on the complex interactions between species and the ecosystem, aquatic
    and terrestrial, and amongst species is evaluated. For example, to investigate
    the safety to aquatic environments, small stagnant water bodies are exposed to
    the test compound at various doses and the dynamics of the aquatic community are
    studied over several months. Monitoring the landscape use patterns of wild vertebrates,
    and thus determining potential impacts of the crop protection product involves
    telemetry (radio tagged animals) and related techniques which integrate geographic
    information via satellite pictures. Geographical information systems and simulation
    models allow results to be extrapolated from small-scale studies to larger-scale
    habitats. All trials and subsequent safety evaluation procedures result in a safety
    profile for each crop protection product. If a risk threshold for any of the species
    tested is exceeded, the whole product may be abandoned unless appropriate risk
    management approaches can be established. 3.3. Integrating biodiversity conservation
    objectives into farm-level management approaches: ICM ICM/IPM strategies have
    evolved in response to the need for increasingly holistic approaches in farming
    (Lewis et al., 1997). ICM encourages increasingly knowledge-intensive agricultural
    practices that take the interactions between agricultural production and biodiversity
    into account. While significant gaps remain in scientific knowledge about these
    complex interactions, understanding is gradually improving. In addition, the management
    of more holistic systems has been greatly informed by rapid advances in bioinformatics,
    particularly the application of satellite data, increasingly complex simulation
    models and decision-support tools (Zander and Kachele, 1999) that integrate multiple
    socio-economic and environmental objectives. Recognized as the agreed approach
    of the plant science industry and its member companies for contributing to sustainable
    agriculture, ICM aims to combine the economic demands placed on agriculture with
    attention to sustainable environmental management (CropLife International, 2003;
    European Crop Protection Association, 1999). The development and implementation
    of locally appropriate ICM strategies can create opportunities to integrate economically
    viable biodiversity conservation strategies into farming systems, regardless of
    geographic location, farm size, socio-economic context, technology options and
    affordability. With respect to biodiversity conservation, ICM encourages the establishment
    of temporary and permanent areas of wildlife habitat. Temporary conservation areas
    include conservation headlands, field margins, beetle banks and set-aside field
    stripes (The Game Conservancy Trust, 2004). By one estimate, the network of such
    temporary conservation areas (3–8 m wide) includes some 2 million km in Germany
    alone (Artenvielfalt in der Landwirtschaft, 2003). ICM also recognizes the value
    of permanent wildlife conservation areas, for example, hedgerows and windbreaks,
    and establishing or conserving natural habitats within farmland (CropLife International,
    2003). Both temporary and permanent areas can contribute to supporting biodiversity,
    particularly populations of beneficial species that, in turn, provide services
    to agroecosystems such as pollination or biological pest control (Bugg et al.,
    1998). While ICM is primarily a farm-based approach, it can also contribute to
    a landscape management framework such as ecoagriculture (McNeely and Scherr, 2003),
    that focuses on integrating biodiversity conservation goals into the management
    of agricultural landscapes. For example, the conservation or creation of networks
    and corridors of native habitats on farms can contribute to preserving and linking
    areas protected for wild biodiversity conservation within agricultural landscapes
    (Lefroy et al., 1992). Modifying crop tillage systems offers additional opportunities
    to influence levels of on-farm biodiversity. Reducing the frequency and intensity
    of soil disturbance can benefit biodiversity as it improves ecosystem stability
    both above and below ground, enhancing habitats for soil micro-organisms that
    in turn benefit crops (Swift, 2001). This can be achieved by integrating minimum
    (conservation or no) tillage strategies into ICM systems, whereby about 70% of
    crop residues are incorporated into the topsoil and 30% remain on the soil surface,
    providing a beneficial environment for soil organisms and many bird species, small
    mammals and reptiles (CropLife International, 2005). In turn, soil organisms such
    as earthworms, fungi and bacteria, contribute to improved soil structure and natural
    fertility. Benefits of retaining crop residues on the soil surface also include
    water retention and reduced soil erosion (Reichert et al., 1999). 4. Integrated
    approaches: pilot initiatives developed by Bayer CropScience and its partners
    Three pilot initiatives were developed by Bayer CropScience in partnership with
    a variety of local stakeholders, to adapt and implement a combination of the roles
    described above within regions of Brazil, Guatemala and the UK. Each pilot initiative
    differs in the emphasis it places on delivering socio-economic and environmental
    outcomes: Within Guatemala, the objective was to adapt and diversify agricultural
    technologies employed to help improve income generation and food security; in
    the UK initiatives aimed to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits
    of on-farm wildlife habitats as a key aspect of ICM; work in Brazil focussed on
    replanting native vegetation around a water catchment area in an attempt to restore
    water flow and other services originally provided by the ecosystem. It is important
    to note the limitations associated with results and conclusions drawn from these
    pilot initiatives. In Brazil and Guatemala especially, the main purpose of the
    pilot initiatives was to address the unsustainability of existing production systems.
    Methodologies employed were not initially designed to include rigorous scientific
    analysis. Despite this, and the broad variability in economic, political and environmental
    contexts between pilot initiatives, each demonstrated that the adoption of sustainable
    agricultural practices can lead to considerable improvement in biodiversity conservation
    and, as importantly, that biodiversity can deliver significant benefits to farming
    systems. 4.1. Increasing productivity on land already cropped through provision
    of adapted agricultural technologies and knowledge Guatemala is one of the many
    countries where land conversion to agriculture has taken place at the expense
    of rare forests and wildlife species. Simultaneously addressing the need to conserve
    biodiversity and sustain agricultural productivity is key, in order to preserve
    the natural resource base upon which rural populations depend. In Guatemala, Bayer
    CropScience worked between 2001 and 2003 in partnership with the German Agency
    for International Cooperation, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit
    (GTZ). A number of local stakeholders joined efforts to improve farmers’ livelihoods
    by increasing agricultural productivity on existing agricultural land in the Las
    Verapaces region. Approximately, 30,000 smallholders and their families benefited
    from the project. They worked on about 30,000 ha of agricultural land, with almost
    60% involved in subsistence farming (UNIDO, 2002). The project''s initiation was
    driven by a number of socio-economic factors that contributed to unsustainable
    land resource exploitation: high poverty levels, due to historic low world coffee
    prices and the subsequent loss of work on coffee plantations; intense demographic
    pressures, with population growth rates amongst the highest in the world; and
    a lack of knowledge and incentives to manage agricultural land sustainably. Low
    productivity has increased demand for new land, inducing high levels of slash
    and burn land clearing and rapid agricultural encroachment into previously untouched
    forests. Estimated rates of tropical forest conversion to agriculture in the El
    Petén region north of the Las Verapaces region lie between 50,000 and 200,000
    ha per year (Bayer CropScience, 2002). As a consequence, soil erosion and nutrient
    depletion were widespread, jeopardizing the region''s unique biodiversity even
    further. To address these problems, agricultural technologies and crop management
    systems were adapted and tailored to local needs through collaboration with farmers
    and local organizations. This was complemented by the development of an integrated,
    participatory training programme. In total, the initiative''s target outreach
    spanned 40 local communities of 3000 subsistence farmers and their families, as
    well as 6000 children, 50 members of partner organizations, 5000 students, 75
    medical personnel, and members of 15 locally based non-governmental organizations.
    The purpose of the initiative was to enhance and diversify crop productivity on
    existing agricultural land, particularly that of tomato and peanut crops already
    under cultivation (Bayer CropScience, 2002). Tomato production, once a predominant
    income generating crop within the region, had been abandoned due to whitefly infestations
    and lack of knowledge of how to address the infestation problem. The development
    of locally appropriate IPM strategies enabled the reinstatement of tomato production
    areas. The use of leguminous trap-crops (beans) and yellow sticky traps for biological
    insect control were integrated with the targeted use of crop protection products
    to manage whitefly populations in the tomato crop. The use of legumes also served
    to improve soil nitrogen levels. In 2003, the costs and benefits of ICM versus
    ‘traditional’ systems were evaluated through interviews with 25 farmer leaders,
    who had adopted the ICM system, and with those who had not adopted ICM (traditional
    farmers). Quantitative parameters calculated included tomato production cost,
    yield and profit per box of tomatoes sold. Initial results indicated an average
    reduction in production costs of 5.7% accompanied by a 25.2% increase in net profit
    margins within ICM production systems, compared with the traditional management
    methods (Bayer CropScience and GTZ unpublished, 2003). In addition, changes in
    qualitative knowledge on crop protection products stewardship aspects were appraised
    by comparing outcomes of interviews conducted with 200 local farmers in 2001 and
    235 in 2003, respectively. Similar benefits were derived from the adoption of
    integrated peanut cultivation techniques. These included the use of a higher yielding
    and healthy seed variety, as well as developing integrated pest and plant nutrition
    measures, employing both organic and mineral fertilizers. Initial results demonstrated
    improved yields from a maximum of 975 kg/ha with traditional seeds to over 3500
    kg/ha with the enhanced seeds. Accompanying net earnings increased, but as importantly
    3.6 times less land was needed to attain the yield level generated by traditional
    agricultural practices. Measurable increases in productivity and income generation
    were complimented by qualitative social and environmental improvements to the
    livelihoods of the subsistence farmers engaged in the project. Strengthened awareness
    and adoption of responsible crop management strategies have enhanced livelihood
    security, including potential nutritional benefits derived from an increase in
    protein-rich peanut production. These results demonstrate how ICM approaches coupled
    with the responsible use of the technologies can enhance productivity on existing
    agricultural land, while simultaneously delivering significant benefit to farmers’
    livelihoods and biodiversity conservation within surrounding areas of unfarmed
    land. It was not feasible to precisely measure areas of forestland conserved by
    enhancing productivity on existing land in this project. Constant fluctuations
    in the area of land cropped per year, coupled with the pilot initiative''s short
    timeframe (2001–03) meant that long-term data on land cropped per year were not
    available. Nonetheless, it could be hypothesized that, based on available data,
    the greater than three-fold increase in agricultural productivity per hectare
    enables a proportionate reduction in land required for agriculture and thus reduce
    rates of further forest conversion. However, the assumption that increases in
    agricultural productivity per hectare translate into improved forest conservation
    prospects will only be substantiated if the introduction of these technologies
    and approaches leads to their long-term adoption. A number of factors will influence
    whether technology adoption is sustained, including production cost reduction
    and the availability of supportive market mechanisms, such as market entry opportunities,
    that create economic incentives for the farmer to diversify production and preserve
    wildlife habitat, rather than further expand agricultural production (Lee and
    Barrett, 2000). In addition, policies that encourage biodiversity conservation
    in farmed and non-farmed (protected) areas need to be in place. To build upon
    the experience gained in the project region of the Las Verapaces, Bayer CropScience
    signed an agreement in August 2004 with two national agricultural institutions,
    with the aim of translating the experience gained in the Las Verapaces region
    to other regions within Guatemala. 4.2. Integrating biodiversity conservation
    into agricultural production systems Within the UK, Bayer CropScience has been
    engaged in a number of collaborative initiatives to further understand the interactions
    between agricultural management practices and biodiversity, and the potential
    economic benefits derived from on-farm biodiversity conservation. The Boarded
    Barns Farm study (Bayer CropScience, 2003) is one example. Initiated in 1988,
    the 10-year programme compared the economic and environmental viability of three
    agricultural systems: integrated, ‘conventional’ (defined in the Boarded Barns
    study as ‘production focused’) and organic farming. While yields were not consistently
    enhanced in ICM relative to conventional systems, organic production was consistently
    lower (about 40% lower than conventional methods in winter wheat production and
    also more variable) (Bayer CropScience, 2003). The efficiency of production was
    improved under ICM by: • Optimising the application of external inputs: GPS technologies
    were used to identify areas requiring attention and continually vary input application
    accordingly. • Creating on-farm temporary habitat niches to enhance levels of
    beneficial insects: In 1998, predatory insect levels within uncut field margins
    were high enough to manage pests without additional control measures. • Integrating
    nitrogen-fixing legumes into crop rotation regimes: Legumes such as beans and
    clover maximized natural soil nitrogen levels, reducing the need for additional
    mineral fertilizer input. The influence of each farming system (organic, conventional,
    integrated) on biodiversity over the 10-year period was evaluated through the
    monitoring of 22 small mammal species and 13 bird species, accompanied by analyses
    of data from insect traps, residues of leached chemicals within soil and water,
    and changes in the composition of soil micro-biota. Overall, none of the three
    farming systems were demonstrated to be significantly more beneficial to the on-farm
    species monitored. The impact of the farming systems on population levels depended
    on the species. For example, trap catch samples were collected to monitor carabid
    beetle populations in each system. Seven carabid beetle species were trapped more
    frequently in the organic system than the conventional system, while eight other
    carabid species were trapped more often in the conventional than in the organic
    system. Overall, major influences on biodiversity levels included crop choice
    and the extent of soil disturbance (tillage), as well as level and types of inputs
    (Bayer CropScience, 2003). With regard to tillage, the potential role of minimum
    till as a strategy for biodiversity conservation also exemplifies the challenge
    of balancing trade-offs between agricultural practices used and their affect on
    biodiversity. While soil biodiversity tends to increase with reduced frequency
    of mechanical tillage, minimum till is often facilitated through herbicide applications
    and thus is often not permissible in organic systems. In all three farming systems,
    70% of the biodiversity measured was found to be located in the field margins.
    This indicates that, regardless of the farming system and crop choice, it is possible
    to make responsible management interventions that favor biodiversity. The extent
    to which such management interventions will be implemented depends on the socio-economic
    context but also on the availability of incentives for farmers to undertake responsible
    land stewardship. In the European Union various national voluntary schemes, for
    example, the UK Entry Level Stewardship Scheme (DEFRA, 2005), are offering farmers
    financial incentives to establish field margins. In Germany alone a similar voluntary
    scheme has fostered the establishment of an estimated 2 million km of field margins,
    as previously cited. In February 2003, Bayer CropScience initiated a follow-up
    five-year Biodiversity Project at both of its UK field stations (Bayer CropScience,
    2004). A baseline survey of bird and plant wildlife on each site has been established.
    They have been complimented by the creation of an additional permanent conservation
    area that, together with temporary areas such as beetle banks and uncut field
    margins, will contribute to establishing a more sustainable on-farm wildlife habitat.
    All serve to demonstrate the valuable role played by on-farm biodiversity in enhancing
    efficiency and thus economic viability. 4.3. Establishing wildlife habitat conservation
    areas on and around farms As indicated above permanent, undisturbed areas of wildlife
    habitat play a key role in supporting ‘wild’ biodiversity and ecosystem stability,
    both in terms of presence and extent. The economic benefits of these conservation
    areas may not be immediately obvious to farmers. Nonetheless, strategies to conserve
    such areas must deliver returns beyond promoting the aesthetic value of landscapes.
    These permanent patches of native habitat on farms and within the surrounding
    landscape play a vital role not only for flora and fauna conservation but also
    in providing ecosystem services, for example, in protecting water catchment areas
    (Rodrigues and Gandolfi, 2000). In 2001, a pilot initiative was developed between
    Bayer CropScience, Sao Paulo University, Brazil and a local citrus farmer. The
    farmer had become increasingly aware that the water flow in the water catchment
    area was drying out. In an attempt to reestablish part of the natural water flow
    system the area around the water body was replenished with native plants. In addition,
    more space was made available around the water body by clearing some of the citrus
    trees that grew directly around it. This approach was in accordance with the Brazilian
    Forest Act (Codigo Florestal, 1989), which prescribes the protection of water
    bodies including water catchment areas, by keeping a defined distance between
    agricultural production areas and water sources. By the end of 2002, about 4000
    native seedlings grown by the university''s Department of Biological Sciences
    had been planted to establish a permanent area of natural vegetation. Sixty-three
    different native tree species were planted, with the total area of the water body
    (approximately 500 m2) and the re-vegetated area covering approximately 2.2 ha
    in total (Rodrigues et al., 2003). The main purpose of this area was to restore
    the ecosystem''s ability to deliver the key service of water provision. However,
    the planted area also provides a protective buffer against soil erosion and input
    run-off, while enriching wildlife habitat and catalyzing further native species
    re-colonization. Measuring the project''s success in restoring the water body
    will be an incremental, long-term process. Nonetheless, the planting of native
    plant species should also attract more wildlife species in both the short- and
    longer-terms. In addition, a study aiming to evaluate the impact of the replanting
    strategy on wild species populations within and around the rehabilitated area
    is being developed. To enable neighbouring farmers to take a more proactive approach
    to creating and preserving areas of wildlife habitat on and around farmland, communication
    tools such as brochures and a video have been developed to help disseminate information
    and strengthen awareness of the benefits that can be derived from preserving wildlife
    habitats. The Sao Paulo pilot project has also been complimented by the initiation
    of a similar river-bank restoration project, initiated in 2004 within the state
    of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (UNISC, 2004). The Brazilian initiative aims to raise
    awareness of the crucial services biodiversity provides to agriculture and the
    need to integrate biodiversity conservation strategies into agricultural production
    and land management systems. Reactive replanting strategies are no substitute
    for taking a proactive approach to biodiversity conservation from the onset. However,
    the approach offers a solution for rehabilitating conservation areas on and around
    farms. It also poignantly highlights the fact that many valuable ecosystem services
    often remain unappreciated until they have been jeopardized. Conserving and integrating
    existing natural habitat areas in farming systems and in a broader landscape context
    is the most effective way to benefit from ecosystem services. This strategic approach
    also contributes to establishing coherent biodiversity conservation area networks
    and to rehabilitating and restoring degraded ecosystems called upon by the international
    community within the framework of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD,
    1992). 5. Discussion and conclusions Sustaining agricultural productivity to meet
    global food demand, while realizing biodiversity conservation objectives necessitates
    a much greater understanding of the interfaces between these two goals. As shown
    in this paper integrating productivity and conservation goals cannot only benefit
    ecosystems but also farmer livelihoods. The three pilot initiatives addressed
    highlight potential approaches that can be taken to integrate sustainable production
    and conservation goals within a variety of socio-economic, political and geographic
    contexts. The three initiatives were primarily undertaken to address the unsustainable
    nature of existing production systems, in response to local environmental or socio-economic
    needs. It is important to recognize a number of limitations in terms of methodologies
    employed, empirical data availability and conclusions that can be drawn. The relatively
    recent development of the pilot initiatives limits data availability. Only the
    Boarded Barns study is supported by a continuous 10 yr dataset. In Guatemala and
    Brazil longer-term monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is needed to substantiate initial
    results with data on longer-term trends and the sustainability of environmental
    and socio-economic outcomes. The Brazilian initiative described highlights this
    requirement. Whether the project succeeds in restoring the water flow through
    its re-vegetation strategy will only become apparent over time. A key challenge
    common to all three pilot initiatives lies in designing and implementing appropriate
    on-farm productivity and conservation strategies. The relationship between agricultural
    and biodiversity is inherently complex, dynamic and site-specific. It is thus
    difficult to replicate successful strategies not only at a local level but even
    more so as socio-economic and environmental circumstances vary. Developing and
    implementing integrated management strategies that appropriately balance production
    and conservation goals is, therefore, time and knowledge intensive. In each case
    working in partnership with local farmers and partners was key not only to understanding
    needs but also to develop programmes that will successfully address productivity
    and conservation objectives in the short- and longer- term. Designing M&E systems
    that comprehensively capture the diverse environmental and socio-economic outcomes
    of a project presents a further challenge. This is exemplified by the Guatemalan
    initiative, where estimates for the amount of rainforest preserved had to be extrapolated
    from available data on productivity improvements within existing agricultural
    land. Within all three pilot initiatives, the importance of clearly demonstrating
    the economic benefits to farmers derived from preserving biodiversity was evident.
    Short-term economic incentives will remain a key driver of farmers’ willingness
    to adopt biodiversity conservation approaches. Incentives include direct improvements
    to the efficiency and sustainability of the agricultural system, through the preservation
    of environmental services and the reduction of external inputs. Further opportunities
    to enhance incentives for responsible land stewardship can be created through
    voluntary incentive schemes and market mechanisms at a national and international
    level. Making the transition towards more holistic, integrated approaches to agricultural
    production and biodiversity conservation requires a much greater degree of co-operation
    and co-ordination between farmers, policy makers, agri-food industries, researchers
    and educators within agriculture, conservation and the rural development sectors.
    Productivity and conservation objectives have been primarily addressed through
    sectoral approaches, particularly since the mid-1900s. Challenged by an increasing
    world population and limitations on the availability of arable land, agriculture
    has been driven by economic needs and market imperatives to improve efficiency
    and increase productivity, often at the expense of wildlife habitat and agro-ecosystem
    sustainability. In turn biodiversity has not been sufficiently recognized or valued
    as a public good beyond the environmental sector, with conservation measures principally
    focused within state owned ‘protected areas’. However, whether on farms or in
    protected areas, individual conservation efforts will deliver limited benefits
    if situated within a broader landscape of uncomplimentary land use activities.
    Within the framework of partnership approaches, a plant science company can add
    value through its research expertise within the areas of natural resource management,
    agronomy and biology, particularly as research on interactions between crop protection
    products and biodiversity is being increasingly integrated into the R&D process.
    It can also contribute to developing locally adapted technologies and services
    that integrate crop productivity and biodiversity conservation objectives, and
    by supporting the implementation of ICM approaches that establish and conserve
    areas of temporary and permanent wildlife habitats on and around cropped land.
    Through its relationships with its customers, the farmers, a company can also
    contribute to raising awareness and improving understanding of the services that
    biodiversity provides to agricultural production, their economic value and the
    need to protect these within farmland. In turn a plant science company has much
    to learn from the experience and perspectives of partners and from working in
    collaboration with stakeholders from diverse schools of thought. Ultimately, partnerships
    will only be sustainable if outcomes benefits all parties involved. As this paper
    aims to highlight, there are no simple answers to balancing agricultural production
    and biodiversity conservation goals. Nonetheless potential solutions, such as
    those outlined within the pilot initiatives, exist and need to be implemented
    more broadly. Reconciling the objectives and visions of diverse stakeholders,
    to establish trust and common ground as a basis for collaboration is, in itself,
    not a simple process. While challenges are ambitious, they are not insurmountable.
    Taking collective responsibility and action will be vital to achieve the Millennium
    Development Goals by 2015 and ultimately sustaining the natural resource base
    upon which both human and ecosystem well-being depend. Acknowledgement Thanks

  description: The project DEMETER (DEMonstration of Earth observation Technologies
    in Routine irrigation advisory services; http://www.demeter-ec.net) has been financed
    by the U.E. within the V Framework Program and it is dedicated to the development
    of techniques for using space remote sensing data (Earth Observation, EO data)
    for improving water management in agriculture. The specific object of the project
    is the setting-up of a pre-operative prototype which integrates satellite data
    and information-technology to improve the performance of irrigation advisory services
    (IAS) at both district and farm levels. The system has been implemented in three
    pilot zones (in Spain, Portugal and Italy). This paper provides the experience
    for the Italian pilot zone and shows the results of the operative demonstration
    campaign during the 2005 irrigation season. The practicality of receiving and
    processing space remote sensing data in near-real-time, the irrigation performance
    improvements due the system adopted and feedbacks from farmers are reported. ©

  description: Some neutral chirurgical soap, a solution of diethylen penta acetic
    acid (DTPA) at 1% and a solution at 25% of monocalcic trisodium salt of DTPA in
    serum have been studied on models of cutaneous contamination. Cesium 137 (137Cs)
    and Plutonium 239 (239Pu) have been used for the contamination. This research
    gives a protocol for external cutaneous decontamination which could be used in
    reception units for radiocontaminated woundeds. Even the radioelement is unknown.
    DTPA at 25% represents a good solution for the treatment of general contamination,
    which is not the case for DTPA at 1%. A soap in which DTPA at 1% has been added
    is adapted for large cutaneous contamination. The treatment of ocular contamination
    is also studied in this article.

    The results show the importance of the real-time demand assignment for the reliability
    of hydraulic models for making real-time operational decisions and the realization
    of digital twins of water infrastructure systems. Introduction Hydraulic simulation
    models of water distribution systems (WDSs) are widely used for making planning
    and management decisions by examining a set of what-if scenarios. To make informed
    decisions, a hydraulic and water quality simulation representing steady-state
    and extended-period conditions are performed. Nodal demands are the most uncertain
    and dynamic variables in WDSs (Kang and Lansey 2009, 2011; Kun et al. 2015). Several
    works have focused on the estimation of end-user demands based on measurements
    collected from flow meters, pressure sensors, and supervisory control and data
    acquisition (SCADA) systems. The demand estimation problem is often challenging
    owing to the dynamic nature, inherent variability, and uncertainty associated
    with end-user demands. Davidson and Bouchart (2006) proposed a direct method to
    adjust nodal demands for real-time hydraulic models constrained by real-time SCADA
    information. An approach combining regression trees with genetic algorithms was
    proposed by Preis et al. (2011) to estimate end-user demands to match observations.
    Kang and Lansey (2009, 2011) proposed an inverse optimization approach to demand
    estimation given sensory measurements. Kun et al. (2015) and Du et al. (2018)
    proposed a direct inversion algorithm for estimating demands. Previous approaches
    were constrained by limited available observations and so relied on aggregated
    demand estimates to reduce the underdetermined problem to an even- or over-determined
    problem (Davidson and Bouchart 2006). Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems
    are relatively new technologies that enable continuous collection of detailed
    measurement from customer sites and frequent transmission of data to a data center
    through a remote communication system (Nguyen et al. 2018; Cominola et al. 2018).
    Therefore, it is clearly plausible to use AMI data for demand estimation for real-time
    hydraulic modeling to provide a better representation of the hydraulic conditions
    in the distribution system (Sanz and Pérez 2015). Using AMI data to dynamically
    assign demand in hydraulic models meets a critical requirement for the application
    of the hydraulic simulation model from a planning tool to an operational decision-making
    tool. With the ubiquity of AMI systems and the maturity of big data analytics
    platforms, dynamic demand assignment (DDA) models have become a viable modeling
    option, where the nodal demands are dynamically assigned using the streaming meter
    data in a real-time and continuous manner. Shafiee et al. (2018) discussed the
    challenges in the integration of big data with computer water models and proposed
    a generic framework for integration. The proposed generic framework uses consumption
    data from an AMI data set in conjunction with a collection of analytical tools
    to ensure the quality of consumption data before being used to enhance hydraulic
    models. Using this generic framework to create a demand-calibrated model eliminates
    some of the key steps in the traditional practice of building hydraulic models.
    Conventional hydraulic solvers, e.g., EPANET (Rossman 2000), were originally developed
    for scenario analysis and are not readily adopted for real-time hydraulic modeling.
    This study explores the feasibility of enhancing EPANET for real-time hydraulic
    modeling to integrate high spatial and temporal demand data as collected by AMIs
    in a real WDS (Shafiee et al. 2018). The Hadoop-based data warehouse for processing
    and analyzing smart meter data is directly linked with modified EPANET code that
    dynamically assigns demand as new data become available. Two DDA scenarios are
    considered: (1) individual demand assignment (IDA), in which for each time step
    demands are assigned individually for each node, and (2) aggregated demand assignment
    (ADA), in which for each time step the nodal demands in the same pressure zone
    are spatially aggregated. The performance of the high-resolution DDA models is
    compared with the performance of a conventional hydraulic model with static demand
    assignment (SDA), in which the nodal demands are assigned with a set of demand
    patterns currently used by the water utility that are calibrated periodically
    using historical data sets, and with data collected from a set of pressure sensors
    deployed in the field. This study is primarily focused on streaming smart meter
    data integration with the current data latency limitations and the consideration
    of other streaming data types such as SCADA and nonrevenue water are beyond the
    scope of this study. Framework for Real-Time Hydraulic Modeling The conventional
    approach to hydraulic modeling with SDA is initiated from a network input text
    file. The input file specifies the layout of the WDS, the connectivity and characteristics
    of network components, including length, diameter, and roughness coefficients
    of pipes, elevation and demand of junctions, head curves and settings for pumps
    and valves, and network operating rules. Once a network model is initialized,
    the hydraulic solver is executed to compute heads and flows for nodes and pipes
    at each time step of the extended period simulation (EPS), which are collected
    for model output. This process is repeated for a predefined duration, and the
    collected results are used for further analysis. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the typical
    workflow of hydraulic modeling with SDA. Fig. 1. General data flow in (a) static
    demand assignment; and (b) dynamic demand assignment hydraulic models. The simulation
    process for the DDA enhances the process of conventional hydraulic modeling using
    actual streaming meter data for every service node during the simulation as new
    information becomes available. This process is a necessary step toward a fully
    calibrated real-time hydraulic model, which (although beyond the scope of this
    work) should additionally include SCADA data related to the operating conditions
    and automated parameter and state estimation. One can think of EPANET-RTX (USEPA
    2015) as an alternative hydraulic simulator for the real-time modeling framework;
    however, EPANET-RTX functionalities and features are customized to easily connect
    the core of EPANET to the SCADA and flow meters for demand adjustment at network
    nodes. As indicated, the objective of this study is, when AMI systems are available,
    to utilize meter data directly for demand assignment in hydraulic models instead
    of processing SCADA for demand calibration. AMI systems in large metropolitan
    areas may include hundreds of thousands of smart meters. Thames Water, for example,
    is installing three million smart water meters in London (Cocking 2017). This
    unprecedented scale of temporal and spatial resolution of water consumption data
    mandates advanced data management technologies for handling these massive amounts
    of data. Two main challenges arise that are addressed in this work: (1) while
    metrology companies use centralized data centers to store measurements, only a
    subset of the metering data is accountable for each utility; and (2) data should
    be updated in a hydraulic model on the fly because they appear in the data center
    without interruption to the ongoing simulation. Meter Database Owing to the size
    of meter data, the Hadoop-based distributed data center (Zikopoulos and Eaton
    2011) is fully coupled with the modified EPANET solver. A set of Hive-based queries
    is used to collect data from the database for the hydraulic model. Hadoop is a
    distributed computing environment that supports the processing and storage of
    large data sets. Hadoop provides a distributed file system and a framework that
    allows the distributed processing of massive data sets across clusters of commodity
    servers using simple programming models. Hadoop uses the MapReduce paradigm (Dean
    and Ghemawat 2008) for distributing data and computations. Computation capacity,
    storage capacity, and input/output bandwidth are scaled by simply adding extra
    servers (Shvachko et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2016). Hive is an application built
    for a Hadoop-based technology to query data that are distributed by Hadoop technology
    (Thusoo et al. 2009). Because Hadoop is a fault-tolerant process, the existence
    of data for every meter is checked, and missing data points are recollected through
    functionalities in the AMI system, such as two-way communication. Once the quality
    of the data is confirmed, a set of Hive-based command lines is used to collect
    meter data. Two databases used in the data center (McGann 2016) handle different
    characteristics of the metrology of water meters. The first one is a metadata
    database, which is related to the static characteristic of meters such as the
    location and the identification key for all meters. Each meter is associated with
    an identification key in databases to uniquely define the meter and its location
    based on geodetic coordinates. The metadata are updated as new meters are installed
    and swapped out with old meters to avoid disruption of services such as billing.
    The second database contains reads related to water meters readings, i.e., the
    volume of water consumed between two time steps and the corresponding time of
    reads, and constantly grows as the new reads are collected. The demand at each
    meter location is calculated by uniformly distributing the consumption between
    the times of the two reads. The meter location and meter reads can also be collected
    on demand through a two-way communication channel to fill in unrecorded data points
    (Sensus 2018). This is performed automatically by the AMI system, and this study
    only benefits from this functionality because the DDA model ensures the existence
    of reads for every meter before ingesting AMI data into the hydraulic run. Fig.
    1(b) illustrates Algorithm 1, summarizing the main steps of the workflow for real-time
    hydraulic modeling with DDA. Algorithm 1. Pseudo-algorithm for real-time DDA hydraulic
    model Input: Start and end times, time step, databases, hydraulic file Result:
    Heads at nodes, flows in pipes, water levels at tanks Initialize: (i) Initialize
    network parameter and characteristics using hydraulic input file (ii) Collect
    meter identification and location from databases (iii) Map meters to service nodes
    Set: simulation time = start time; while meter data available do (i) Collect water
    meter records for simulation time; (ii) Check validity of each data record; (iii)
    Adjust demands for service nodes; (iv) Run hydraulic simulation models using new
    runhyh; (v) Collect and visualize results; simulation time = simulation time +
    time step; if simulation time > end time then Terminate from while loop else Wait
    for new data to become available for simulation time; end (i) Collect meter identification
    and location from databases; (ii) Identify and map new meters to service nodes;
    end Return; Wrapper for Dynamic Demand Assignment To create a DDA model, each
    service node needs to receive a new demand based on the metered data without interruptions
    to the ongoing simulation. The wrapper is a programming code that links the hydraulic
    solver and the meter database to execute the DDA process. The hydraulic model
    is initiated using the .inp input file. Complementarily, the meter identification
    key and geodetic location are collected from the Hadoop database, and each meter
    is associated with a service node in the hydraulic input file using a GIS-based
    mapping algorithm by assigning the nearest water meters to a service node. For
    each time step, the reads for meters are aggregated to compute the demand of the
    associated service node. Once the demands for the current time step are allocated
    among all service nodes in the hydraulic model, an EPANET (Rossman 2000) simulation
    can be executed to estimate water flows and pressures in the WDS. Since straightforward
    application of continuously updated demands through the input file or the programmer’s
    toolkit is not practical, the ENrunH function in the programmer’s toolkit is modified
    to directly assign an array of new demand values to the EPANET solver. The hydraul.c
    file contains the runhyd(long* t) function, which calculates the demand for every
    nodal node for the next time step. The new runhyd(double* demandsArray, long*
    t) function receives the new demand array and passes it to the new demands(double*
    demands) function. In the current version of EPANET, the demands() function computes
    demands at nodes during the current time period based on the base demand and diurnal
    pattern multipliers. In contrast, the new demands(double* demands) function directly
    assigns the array of demands stored in the data center. Listings 1 and 2 show
    the original and modified EPANET demands() function, respectively. Listing 1.
    demands() function in EPANET for (int i = 1 ; i < = Njuncs ; i ++ ){ double sum
    =  0.0; for (Pdemand demand = Node [i]. D; demand != NULL; demand = demand->next){
    int j = demand->Pat; int k = p % (long) Pattern [j]. Length; double djunc = (demand->Base)*Pattern
    [j]. F[k]*Dmult; sum += djunc;} D[i] = sum; } Listing 2. modified demands() function
    for (int i = 1 ; i < = Njuncs ; i ++ ){ D[i] = demandsArray[i]; } In this study,
    the pump, tank, and valve settings and operation rules are set in the hydraulic
    model, and these rules are not changed over the course of a simulation. The simulation
    time is increased by one time step, and the termination criterion is checked.
    If the termination criterion, which is the end time of the simulation, is not
    met, the foregoing steps repeat. At each time step, the metadata are processed
    again and compared with the old metadata to identify new meters. In addition,
    the wrapper takes into account old meters that are swapped with new meters. Swapping
    old meters with new meters is a common practice in utilities. Using this step,
    the algorithm ensures the inclusion of new meters in water demand extraction from
    the network. Generally, the water reads occur at the beginning of every hour,
    and the collected reads are sent to a data center with a 1- to 4-h delay. The
    meter data available step interactively connects the hydraulic model with the
    data center without any human intervention. The end time is a hard-coded time
    to end the DDA process. Further descriptions of the components, architecture,
    and integration of the general framework may be found in Shafiee et al. (2018).
    Application The DDA model is applied to a WDS of a city in the US. The hydraulic
    model of the WDS consists of 1,063 junctions, 1,086 pipes, 3 tanks, 14 pumps,
    and 5 check valves. Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the studied WDS and the location
    of key components that will be discussed later. The WDS is a subnetwork of a larger
    network and serves nearly 3,000 customers. Its nodal elevations vary within 180
    m and pipes vary from 50 to 300 mm in diameter. The AMI system was deployed in
    2014 with a 1-h sampling rate. Data collected from 2,526 smart meters in 2017
    (i.e., 8,760 data points for each meter) is used for this study because this study
    was prepared at the end of 2017. Of the 1,063 junctions, 541 are service nodes,
    each of which is connected to several smart meters based on GIS data. For most
    utilities, the number of service nodes is typically smaller than the number of
    meters because the smaller pipes (i.e., typically less than 50 mm in diameter),
    which connect a service node to a set of meters, are not modeled in hydraulic
    models. Fig. 2. Studied water distribution system. The SDA, IDA, and ADA hydraulic
    modeling approaches were used to compute and compare simulation results. The SDA
    uses the conventional hydraulic modeling approach currently practiced by the water
    utility, in which eight demand patterns are used to represent the temporal variation
    of nodal demands for 24 h. The initial settings for tanks, values, and pumps in
    the SDA model match the settings used by the water utility to run its hydraulic
    model. Simple rules are defined in the SDA model to control the pump and valve
    operations in the model based on the water level in tanks. To characterize demand
    patterns, base demand, subdaily demand multiplier for a diurnal pattern, and the
    general demand multiplier that accounts for seasonal variability are required
    to calculate the extracted water for each node for each given time step during
    the hydraulic simulation. Although not included in the current case study, various,
    more advanced demand calibration and assignment methods, such as those of Davidson
    and Bouchart (2006) and Kang and Lansey (2009, 2011), can greatly improve the
    accuracy of hydraulic models. The DDA modeling approach is used for real-time
    hydraulic modeling, which utilizes all the 2017 meter reads for the hydraulic
    simulation. Each service node receives a demand value based on the meter data
    for that specific time. The demands of a group of meters are aggregated and assigned
    to nodes in the hydraulic model based on the procedure detailed in Algorithm 1.
    The DDA model uses the same control rules that are used for the SDA model. Both
    the SDA and DDA model use the same initial settings for tanks, pumps, and valves.
    Therefore, the SDA model represents the base model, which is currently used by
    the water utility to make planning and management decisions in utilities. The
    DDA model, however, examines the potential improvement to these decisions by enhancing
    the SDA model with existing AMI water meter data. Two proposed DDA scenarios,
    i.e., IDA and ADA, consider time-varying demand assignment but different spatial
    demand allocation. In the individual demand assignment scenario, at each time
    step the demands are assigned individually for each node based on the corresponding
    AMI readings. The ADA modeling approach is similar to that of the IDA and uses
    real-time meter data. The difference is that, instead of assigning the meter data
    directly to each demand node, the nodes are grouped into two zones based on their
    geographical location. For each time step, the average demand within each zone
    is calculated and assigned to nodes within each zone. The IDA and ADA models test
    the effect of spatial aggregation on the flows and pressures computed by the hydraulic
    simulations. Results An hourly time step is considered for SDA and DDA models;
    simulation time is 24 × 365 h , and the pressure and flow values are reported
    at the end of each hour. The demand patterns in the SDA model are defined daily
    at an hourly time step. Data collected from two pressure sensors located at two
    service nodes in the WDS are used to assess and validate the performance of the
    hydraulic models (Pressure Sensors A and B in Fig. 2). Although the location of
    sensors for model validation should be strategically determined (Morosini et al.
    2014; Alves et al. 2014; Sanz and Pérez 2015), the location and number of these
    pressure sensors were determined by the utility to satisfy its objectives. Fig.
    3 shows a comparison of observed and simulated pressure values using the SDA and
    DDA approaches at Nodes A and B, and Table 1 provides summary statistics. These
    nodes are located in two different pressure zones of this network, and the collected
    data from these nodes represent the pressure changes in each pressure zone. In
    general, the SDA model overestimates pressure values for both locations. Comparison
    of the averages, standard deviations, and ranges of simulated pressure values
    with the observed data reveals that the DDA models outperform the SDA model. Fig.

    Max = maximum; and Std = standard deviation. The DDA models outperform the SDA
    model by better mimicking the shape of pressure variability. All models perform
    poorly overall in terms of matching the exact observed pressure values. However,
    the DDA models are able to predict some pressure peaks and valleys with a few
    hours’ time lag with respect to the observed data, indicating that time-varying
    demand assignment contributes to a better predictive outcome of hydraulic models.
    Interestingly, for this WDS, spatial aggregation of demands had a negligible effect
    on the outcome of hydraulic simulations compared with individual demand assignment.
    These outcomes, however, cannot be generalized to other WDSs, and the necessary
    level of spatial and temporal resolution of AMI data to improve the predictive
    accuracy of hydraulic models is case-specific and warrants further investigation.
    Conclusions A real-time demand hydraulic model was developed by integrating AMI
    water meter reads with a water distribution model. An EPANET model is enhanced
    by developing a data and software wrapper to facilitate the integration of streaming
    data with the hydraulic model to streamline real-time simulations. The wrapper
    creates a bridge between a Hadoop-based AMI database and a hydraulic model to
    make DDAs. Two DDA models are compared with a SDA model that is currently being
    used to make planning decisions by a water utility. By comparing the static and
    dynamic models, this study investigates the use of a DDA approach to enhance hydraulic
    modeling for making operational decisions on a real-time basis. The DDA and SDA
    models are applied to a real water network, and the results are validated using
    pressure measurements from pressure monitoring stations that were installed across
    different pressure zones in the network. These sensors are representative of two
    (out of three) pressure zones in the network. Comparison of these models shows
    the importance of using a DDA model for transitioning hydraulic models from a
    planning tool to an operational decision-support tool and represents a step toward
    the creation of digital twins of future urban water infrastructure systems. This
    study primarily focused on the integration of streaming AMI data with real-time
    hydraulic modeling, showcasing the benefits of utilizing existing time-varying
    demand data even with spatially aggregated demands. Future studies should integrate
    SCADA and other relevant streaming data into the model in a similar manner to
    further enhance real-time hydraulic models and reduce the discrepancy between
    observed and simulated pressures. Moreover, the benefits of fully integrated AMI
    data, their corresponding spatial and temporal resolutions, and data latency for
    improving the accuracy of hydraulic predictions will require a thorough investigation.

    Permissions Data center energy usage keeps growing every year and will continue
    to increase with rising demand for ecommerce, scientific research, social networking,

    and an increasing demand for clock speed result in high heat flux systems. By
    adopting direct liquid cooling, the high heat flux and high power demands can

    plates which are mounted directly on to the chips facilitate a lower thermal resistance

    the current study to characterize a commercially available cold plate which uses
    warm water in carrying the heat away from the chip. A mock package mimicking a

    for this study using a copper block heater arrangement. The thermo-hydraulic performance
    of the cold plates was investigated by conducting experiments at varying chip
    power, coolant flow rates, and coolant temperature. The pressure drop (ΔP) and
    the temperature rise (ΔT) across the cold plates were measured, and the results
    were presented as flow resistance and thermal resistance curves. A maximum heat

    infrastructure power usage breakdown shows that the data centers are estimated
    to consume about 10% of power, while personal computing, telecom, and semiconductor
    manufacturing industries constitute the remaining 90% [1]. The energy usage by
    data centers equals to a staggering value of 150 TWh. This is about 1% of the
    world''s total electricity generation. The demand for data centers will continue
    to grow as people become connected socially and economically. With rising demand
    in data centers, there is a need to provide better and more energy efficient cooling
    systems while battling the global energy crisis. The data center power consumption
    breakdown indicates that 50% of the data center power goes toward its cooling
    with much of this energy being consumed by computer room air conditioning or computer
    room air handlers. Liquid cooling provides an energy efficient way to transport
    heat as compared to air cooling using computer room air conditioning, where energy
    is wasted due to the requirement of supplying conditioned air to the entire room.
    Various cooling methods adapted historically from handheld devices to datacenters
    were discussed in length in the articles [2–4]. Ellsworth and Iyengar [5] reported
    that by using air–water hybrid cooling system, the cost toward the facility power
    consumption reduced by 45% compared to complete air-based system. Compared to
    traditional air cooling, the energy savings increases by 50% when 100% of server
    load was transferred directly to chilled water in the racks. In the work done
    by David et al. [6], it was shown that an energy savings of about 25% was achieved
    by adapting a chiller less data center facility with warm water and recirculated
    air cooled servers. It was also reported that liquid cooling the entire data center
    helps in saving the space by 30–40%. In industry terms, “space is money.” Warm
    water cooling not only helps in reducing the expenditures on energy and space
    in a data center operation but also provides a less noisy working environment
    for the data center operators. Liquid cooling inside a data center environment
    is not a new idea. Rack level rear door heat exchangers and computer room air
    handlers units installed in a regular data center consume facility water for its
    functioning. With the advancements in sensor technology and high pressure withstanding
    quick connects, leakage in an intelligent liquid cooled system is not that a bigger
    concern as it was once used to be. In a typical data center server rack which
    uses warm water direct liquid cooling system (DLCS), a heat exchanger dumps the
    heat picked from the server modules to the facility water. The building facility
    water loop and the coolant loop to the server manifolds constitute the heat exchanger''s
    primary and secondary loop, respectively. The heat picked by the facility water
    can be recovered and reused in several ways, for example, using an organic Rankine
    cycle [7–11]. The coolant in the secondary loop flows through manifolds to the
    cold plates which are mounted on to the processor chips in individual servers
    with thermal interface material (TIM) at the interface. Cold plates or the liquid
    cooled heat sinks usually contain microchannels machined in copper or Aluminum.
    The heat transfer coefficient h between the incoming coolant and the channel drives
    the amount of heat that can be picked by coolant flowing through the cold plate.
    At this stage, there is an opportunity for thermal engineers to design a heat
    sink for the intended level of power dissipation with maximum heat transfer coefficient
    or in other words minimal thermal resistance. The idea of liquid cooling a chip
    by forcing coolant through closed channels is not a new technique in electronics
    thermal management. Following the pioneering work of Tuckerman and Pease [12]
    where they forced fed liquid through the channels etched on the back of silicon
    wafer, many works [13–16] were dedicated toward exploring microchannel cooling
    as an effective heat transfer option. The experimental and numerical findings
    from earlier studies reveal that the heat transfer coefficient h in the channels
    varies inversely proportional to the channel width for laminar flow conditions.
    An extensive investigation on experimental and numerical characterization [17]
    of water cooled heat sinks made of Aluminum reported that the TIM which is usually
    unaffected by fluid flow rate provides the maximum hindrance to heat transfer
    compared to convective, caloric, or spreading resistances. A recent rack level
    study conducted by Alkharabsheh et al. [18] reveals that the maximum pressure
    drop in a rack level system occurs at the server module (56%), while the manifold
    and coolant distribution module constitutes the remaining. A further pressure
    breakdown analysis on the server module reveals that the cold plate accounts for
    31% of the pressure drop, while the corrugated hoses and quick connects account
    for the rest. Thus, a properly designed cold plate will not only have high heat
    transfer coefficient but also minimal pressure drop as higher pressure drop results
    in a penalty to the pumping power. An attempt is made in the current work to experimentally
    characterize a cold plate for its flow and thermal performance by testing at varying
    parameters like volumetric flow rate of coolant and inlet temperature of the coolant
    and die (chip) power. A tight assembly procedure was followed so as to avoid any
    interfacial resistances. An effective heat transfer coefficient ( h ) was calculated
    from the measured thermal resistance values adopting a resistance network model.
    Thermal resistance network analysis adopted by Lee et al. [19] and the optimization
    work on microchannel cooling system done by Iyengar and Garimella [20] were made
    use of in this work to estimate different individual resistances contributing
    to the total resistance R th ⁠. Experiments were conducted at different coolant
    temperatures to address the effect of coolant viscosity on the thermo-hydraulic
    performance, and the results were produced as coefficient of performance (COP)
    curves. A conjugate heat transfer numerical model developed using 6sigmaET was
    developed and benchmarked against the experimental measurements. Although the
    overall aim is to improve the overall energy efficiency of warm water cooling
    system (DLCS) for high performance computing in a data center operation, the focus
    of this work is on characterizing, optimizing, and improving the performance of
    just the cold plate/microchannel heat sink. A mock package having a heat transfer
    area of 6.45 cm2 was built for this study without minimal heat loss to the ambience.
    The novelty of this experimental work lies in identifying various elements which
    contributes to or hinders the heat transfer from chip to the coolant. While the
    next generation power thirsty server chassis comes with multiple central processing
    units/graphical processing units in order to accomplish higher compute capability
    intended for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. What the
    above statement could mean is that future rack level system will need to employ
    multiple cold plates to take care of the server heating problem. Hence, a thorough
    knowledge of the cold plate operation at a single chip/component level is needed
    before translating or adopting those results to address a bigger rack level problem.
    Experimental Setup Five parts in this section discuss about the (a) cold plate
    used in characterization, (b) mock package developed, (c) base metal temperature
    measurement, (d) cold plate mounting procedure, and (e) coolant used and the experimental
    test loop containing different data sensing instruments. Cold Plate Description.
    The commercially available cold plate [21] characterized in this study is typically
    deployed in low profile servers or custom chassis. It employs V-groove microchannel
    with a split flow technology facilitating uniform flow through the channels in
    an attempt to improve the thermo-hydraulic performance of the cold plate. Figure
    1 shows the cold plate design and the microscopic image of the channels. The picture
    also exposes the two major components of a cold plate, the base copper part containing
    the microchannel design and the plastic cover part comprising the gasket to ensure
    leak free flow. Various dimensions of the cold plate extracted from the microscopic
    images are listed in Table 1. Fig. 1 View largeDownload slide (a) Cold plate with
    copper microchannels, (b) zoomed up image of microchannels, (c) opened up top

    Thickness of base, t base 1.35 mm  Mock Package. Thermal load board or thermal
    test vehicle is usually used in industries by thermal management engineers to
    mimic a package. Building a thermal test vehicle or thermal load board typically
    takes weeks of design and fabrication, and the available package style may or
    may not meet the actual power requirement. While developing a mock package as
    shown in Fig. 2 using copper block heaters is cost efficient, they are easy to
    customize based on the desired heat flux dissipation requirement. The copper block
    is heated using four cartridge heaters powered by a DC power supply, Sorenson
    DCS-100E. The copper block is 11 cm long with a cross-sectional area of 6.45 cm
    2 ( 1 in × 1 in ) on top. Three resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) were used
    to measure the temperature gradient along the copper block to calculate the input
    power supplied. The thermal conductivity of the copper block used to develop the
    mock package reads 391 W/m K. The mock package arrangement is thoroughly insulated
    on all the sides leaving out the top face such that heat is conducted in one dimension
    (1D) with minimal loss to the surroundings, while maximizing the heat picked by
    the cold plate. The heat loss associated with the system at different operational
    condition is discussed in Fig. 3 in the upcoming section. Fig. 2 View largeDownload

    comparison between input and output power at different flow rates Base Metal Temperature
    Measurement. Three slots with a width of 0.03 in and 0.03 in deep was cut to accommodate
    T-type thermocouples as shown in Fig. 4 in order to measure the cold plate''s
    base metal temperature T b ⁠. A very tight machining tolerance was maintained
    while making the slots. T b is an important parameter to be determined with accuracy
    as the cold plate resistance R th is represented by ratio of difference between
    average base temperature Tb and incoming coolant T in to input power supplied
    or heat picked by the coolant Q ˙ ⁠. Three T-type thermocouples fabricated at
    the facility were calibrated using a precision oven before setting them on the
    grooves. Fig. 4 View largeDownload slide T-type thermocouples installed in the
    back of the cold plate to indicate base temperature measurement T b during thermal
    tests Cold Plate Mounting Procedure. Assembling the cold plate on to the mock
    package is an important step to be addressed with care because uneven assembly
    would lead to the formation of voids at the interface. Interfacial voids not only
    hinder the heat transfer from the die to the cold plate but also affect the base
    metal temperature measurements. The cold plate was carefully assembled on top
    of the heater block following a controlled procedure. The flatness of the mock
    package was ensured at every stage of assembly. While a pattern maker was used
    to lay TIM in a well-ordered fashion such that the thermal grease occupies the
    interface uniformly. Thus, the thickness of the thermal interfacial material was
    controlled between the die and the cold plate. Scanning acoustic microscopy was
    performed on a replica setup to observe interfacial voids observed between controlled
    and not so controlled assembly procedure. By following a well-ordered assembly
    procedure, it was observed that the TIM material occupied the interface uniformly
    with minimal or no voids. Silicone-free super thermal grease from Shin Etsu [22]
    having a thermal conductivity value of 6 W/mK was used as the TIM in this study.
    Testing Circuit and Measuring Instruments. The picture of the assembled experimental
    setup is shown in Fig. 5. Water and propylene glycol [23] in the proportion 90:10
    recommended under ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning
    Engineers) guidelines was used as the coolant in this study owing to its low corrosive
    properties and nontoxicity. The coolant was forced driven using a gear pump operated
    by a DC power supply while a micro flow meter was used to measure the coolant
    flow rate. The temperature of the coolant at the cold plate inlet was controlled
    using an external chiller unit offering a wide range of operating temperatures.
    A liquid-liquid heat exchanger was built to facilitate the heat transfer between
    the coolant and the chiller. The properties of the coolant were obtained at the
    desired coolant temperature from the manufacture''s datasheet. A micro filter
    was used to screen any particles getting into the microchannels. The temperature
    of coolant at the inlet and the outlet of the cold plate was measured using RTDs.
    The pressure drop across the cold plate was measured using a differential pressure
    transducer. NI data acquisition system (DAQ) devices were programmed to record/write
    the temperature and pressure data using LabVIEW. A list of data sensing instruments
    and their associated uncertainties are listed in Table 2. The experimental setup
    was discussed in detail in the article [24] from the authors. Fig. 5 View largeDownload

    Plate Thermal Resistance. Figure 3 shows the energy balance comparison between
    the input power supplied to the copper blocks according to Q input = kA Δ T /
    Δ x and the heat picked by the coolant or otherwise known as the sensible heat
    according to the first law of thermodynamics, Q output ˙ = m ˙ C p ( T out − T
    in ) ⁠. (⁠ Δ T / Δ x ⁠) is calculated by measuring the temperature gradient across
    the copper block using RTDs. The obtained results show the efficacy in the experimental
    setup with minimal heat loss. But in an actual scenario, there would a significant
    amount of the heat loss from the package in the form of the conduction to the
    printed circuit boards or convection facilitated by the server fans. Thus, the
    thermal resistance reported in this article would be slightly higher than what
    would be experienced in a real-time situation. The cold plate thermal resistance
    R cp is typically represented by the ratio of difference in base temperature T
    b and incoming coolant T in to the input power to the dies Q. Few other authors
    define the cold plate resistance based on the outgoing coolant temperature T out
    or the average coolant temperature. The uncertainty in cold plate thermal resistance
    was estimated to be ±8% R cp = T b − T in Q (1) An average heat transfer coefficient
    ( h ) between channels and the incoming coolant was estimated using a resistance
    network model as shown in Fig. 6. The measured cold plate resistance according
    to Eq. (2) encompasses the convective resistance, the resistance from the conduction
    at the cold plate base, and the caloric resistance due to flow. An effective heat
    transfer area, A hs ⁠, of 6.45 cm 2 was used in calculating the effective heat
    transfer coefficient. This article focuses just on the cold plate thermal resistance
    in order to characterize the heat sink for its thermal performance, but remember
    the total resistance from the junction to the coolant includes the percentage
    share from spreading/constriction and TIM R cp = R convection + R conduction ,

    network model used in estimating the average heat transfer coefficient Coefficient
    of Performance. Experiments were conducted at higher coolant temperatures to identify
    the effect of coolant viscosity on the overall performance while emphasizing the
    importance of warm water cooling. Results were presented as COP curves. COP is
    defined as the ratio of heat removed by the cold plate to the pumping power required
    COP = Heat Removed by the heat sink Pumping power required = m ˙ C p ( T out −
    T in ) . Δ P * V (6) where heat removed by the cold plate is the sensible heat
    gained by coolant and the pumping power is identified as ΔP*V, with ΔP and V being
    the measured pressure drop and flow rate, respectively. Thermophysical properties
    [23] of the coolant used in the experimental analysis were estimated at mean fluid
    temperature from the coolant manufacturer''s data sheet. Numerical Simulation
    In order to validate the experimental results, a comprehensive numerical model
    of the whole cold plate including the distributor, base metal part, and the collector
    as shown in Fig. 7 was developed using 6sigmaET. Basic assumptions applied to
    the model are as follows: Fig. 7 View largeDownload slide Exploded schematic of
    the model developed for numerical simulation using 6sigmaET (1) The flow is three-dimensional,
    steady, laminar, and incompressible. (2) The effects of gravity are negligible.
    (3) The thermo-physical properties like conductivity, specific heat, viscosity
    of the coolant, and solid phases are constant. (4) Viscous heating and radiation
    heat transfer are omitted. The governing equation for conjugate (conduction–convection)

    of the figure shows the exploded view indicating three different components which
    constitute the cold plate model developed for this study. The cover on the top
    of the fins has not been shown for clarity. The coolant flow rate and temperature
    were specified at the cold plate inlet, while an electronic element was placed
    at the bottom of the metal part to simulate the constant heat flux generated by
    the real die. The outflow boundary condition was applied to the cold-plate exit.
    All the other surfaces were assumed to be adiabatic. A grid sensitivity analysis
    was performed considering both thermal resistance and pressure drop. A very detailed
    description on the numerical model and various results associated with the optimization
    can be found in Ref. [25]. Results and Discussion This section is discussed in
    two parts. The first section describes the results obtained to characterize the
    flow performance of cold plate at varying flow rates, input power to the dies,
    and coolant inlet temperature. The second section explains the results obtained
    to investigate the thermal performance of the cold plate. Finally, a section quantifies
    the thermo-hydraulic performance of the cold plate by estimating the COP at different
    operating parameters. Data were collected using LabVIEW after the system reaches
    a steady-state. The repeatability of the experiment was ensured for both the flow
    and thermal tests. Flow Resistance Experiments. The change in pressure drop across
    the cold plate with respect to flow rate was measured using the differential pressure
    transducer. The inlet temperature of the coolant was maintained at 24 °C for all
    the tests. Flow resistance experiments were conducted by varying the die power
    from 70 to 210 W while changing the flow rates from 5 to 13 cm3/s. As the trend
    shown in Fig. 8 suggests, the pressure drop rises with the flow rate but are uninfluenced
    by changes to the input power. The pressure drop increases by approximately 150%
    as the flow rate is increased from 5 to 13 cm3/s. This is because the frictional
    resistance due to flow of coolant over the impinging channels increases with flow
    rate. Fig. 8 View largeDownload slide PQ curve for different input powers at constant
    coolant temperature of 24.3 °C The maximum flow rate tested in Fig. 8 is closer
    to what was experienced in a typical rack level system which is about 0.75 lpm
    or 13 cm3/s. These results are especially good when compared with that of cold
    plate which uses two-phase cooling where the pressure drop is dictated by the
    change in input heat flux. Figure 9 shows the comparison between the experimental
    pressure drop measured across the cold plate and numerical simulation obtained
    at a constant coolant temperature of 27 °C. Tests were conducted without powering
    the dies for generating these data. An average difference of 8% was observed between
    the experimental and numerical findings. Fig. 9 View largeDownload slide Comparison
    of experimental pressure drop with numerical simulation In a typical warm water-cooled
    rack level system, the coolant would be entering the cold plates at a higher coolant
    temperature thus eliminating the need for a chiller in a data center environment.
    The excess heat captured from the cold plate can be reused in several ways. Experiments
    were performed for two different flow rates 6 and 12 cm3/s, respectively, at inlet
    temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 45 °C. Change in coolant temperatures has a
    significant impact on the pressure drop across the cold plate as the result suggests
    in Fig. 10. Pressure drop value decreases by 36% and 33% for flow rates 6 and
    12 cm3/s, respectively, as the coolant temperature is increased from 25 °C to
    45 °C. This is a favorable condition as the pressure drop directly influences
    the pumping power. The pumping power is defined as the product of pressure drop
    and flow rate. The drop-in viscosity with the rise in coolant temperature facilitates
    smoother flow through channels thus leading to a lower pressure drop value. These
    results at higher coolant temperature are especially good as they not only show
    the reduction in pumping power required to drive the coolant through the cold
    plates but also emphasize the advantages of adopting “warm water cooling.” Fig.
    10 View largeDownload slide Effect of coolant temperature on the pressure drop
    across the cold plate at different flow rates Thermal Resistance Experiments.
    Thermal resistance tests were conducted to investigate the convective behavior
    of the cold plate. The cold plate thermal resistance R th is represented by the
    ratio of difference in base metal temperature T b and incoming coolant T in to
    the input power to the dies Q. The thermocouples used to measure the base metal
    temperature are partially influenced by TIM at its bottom as Fig. 11 demonstrates.
    A numerical model was developed to back calculate the contribution of TIM to T
    b measurement similar to the method adopted in Refs. [26] and [27]. The cross
    section of the numerical domain associated with its boundary conditions is shown
    in Fig. 11. Three-dimensional conduction heat transfer energy equation with constant
    thermal properties was solved in this domain. The output of the model was the
    measured thermocouple temperature used for calculating R cp ⁠. The two vertical
    boundaries at the left and right sides were considered as the adiabatic walls
    based on the assumption of vertical conduction heat transfer in the base. By assuming
    that there is no heat transfer (conduction) across the thermocouples, adiabatic
    wall boundary condition was applied to the inside walls. By solving the model
    for different values of heat flux and base temperature, a constant value for R
    (⁠ 0.0519 K / W ⁠) was calculated. The new base metal temperature T b was calculated
    according to R = ( T TC − T b ) / Q ˙ before estimating the cold plate thermal
    resistance R cp according to (1). As the results show, the defined thermal resistance
    depends only on the geometry and thermal properties of the TIM. A tight tolerance
    while making the slots and thermocouple beads and a controlled mounting procedure
    can minimize the measurement errors at the interface. Fig. 11 View largeDownload

    power to the heater block was varied between 100 and 210 W by adjusting the DC
    power supply. This variation in input power represents the variation between processor
    types which includes low power consuming central processing units on bottom spectrum
    and power hungry graphical processing units/application specific integrated circuits
    on top. The flow rate was varied from 6 to 13 cm3/s by varying the power to gear
    pump. This variation in flow rate is the average flow rate level observed in a
    data center rack level operation [18]. Data were collected after system reaches
    a steady-state condition and sufficient time was allowed between individual data
    points. As Fig. 12 suggests, the cold plate thermal resistance calculated according
    to (1) drops by 46% as the flow increases from 6 to 13 cm3/s. The heat transfer
    coefficient of the microchannel system increases with the flow rate which is what
    lowering the convective thermal resistance. A detailed analysis on various resistances
    contributing to the total resistance is analyzed in the end of this section. At
    the same time, changing the input power does not have an influence on the cold
    plate thermal resistance. A maximum variation of about 2.7% was observed between
    the resistances values when the input power was varied from 100 W to 210 W. This
    result was expected for single phase microchannel cooling as the resistance values
    of the heat sink should not get influenced by the changes to input power. The
    average base metal temperature T b measured by T-type thermocouples was observed
    to vary linearly with respect to input power supplied. The coolant outlet temperature
    variation for different input power levels and flow rate conditions as shown in
    Fig. 13 demonstrates the improvement in convective efficiency with flow rate.

    Variation of coolant outlet temperature with respect to coolant flow rate and
    input power Comparison of cold plate thermal resistance between the experiments
    and numerical simulations obtained using 6sigmaET is shown in Fig. 14. The assumptions
    considered in the numerical modeling were discussed in Sec. 4. A relative difference
    of 4.5% was observed between the experiments and the model. A very detailed numerical
    analysis was performed for different parameters like coolant temperature, flow
    rate, chip power, and heat sink material. The numerical study also included exploring
    different microchannel designs for efficient flow and thermal performance. A thorough
    optimization study was carried out in the end. The comprehensive study of the
    cold plate designs and results from optimization scheme is reported in an exclusive
    article dedicated for numerical observations from the authors. A validation was
    required to benchmark the experimental results, and the detailed numerical analyses
    are out of scope in the current article. Fig. 14 View largeDownload slide Cold
    plate thermal resistance comparison between experiments and numerical model at
    different flow rates A resistance-based network model analysis was essential in
    identifying the individual elements contributing to the total resistance of the
    cold plate. An average heat transfer coefficient was estimated according to Eq.
    (2) after calculating the contribution from individual resistances. In Fig. 15,
    a maximum heat transfer coefficient value of 25 W/cm2 K was calculated for the
    case when the flow rate is approximately 13 cm3/s. The average heat transfer coefficient
    estimated rises by 52% as the coolant flow rate is increased from 6 to 13 cm3/s
    and are nearing a saturation point in the convective efficiency. Further increase
    in flow rate will result as penalty to the pumping power. It was also observed
    that the caloric resistance shares a significant contribution to the heat sink
    resistance, while the conduction resistance is unaffected by the fluid flow. Caloric
    resistance contribution drops from 76% to 65% as the fluid flow rate is increased
    from 6 to 13 cm3/s according to Eq. (3). Fig. 15 View largeDownload slide Estimating
    average heat transfer coefficient following the resistance network model Experiments
    were conducted to characterize the flow and thermal performance of the cold plate
    by operating at different inlet coolant temperatures. Cold plate thermal resistance
    does not get influenced by change in the coolant temperature. It was observed
    that the average base temperature T b varies linearly with the rise in coolant
    temperature. At the same time, changing the coolant temperature has an effect
    on cold plate pressure drop since the viscosity of the coolant changes with the
    coolant temperature. Though the thermal performance is not affected by the change
    in coolant temperatures, the effect of coolant temperatures on pressure drop makes
    it essential to observe the COP. COP of the cold plate as shown in Fig. 16 was
    calculated according to Eq. (6) by measuring the pumping power and the heat picked
    by the coolant at different inlet coolant temperatures. COP of the cold plates
    are high especially when trying to dissipate larger power inputs at lower volumetric
    flow rates. The pumping power at low volumetric flow rate is what making the COP
    to go higher. At the same time, the rise in coolant temperature results in a drop
    in viscosity. Or in other words, the pressure drop in cold plate drops with the
    rise in coolant temperature. Thus for a constant flow rate condition, high coolant
    temperature results in higher COP. Compared to the air cooled solution, the COP
    obtained using the cold plate is very high which is primarily due to the severe
    reduction in pumping power. Fig. 16 View largeDownload slide COP comparison at
    different coolant temperatures, flow rates, and operating power Conclusions With
    rising resurgence in liquid cooling to facilitate high performance computing in
    data centers, it is necessary to have a detailed understanding of various components
    of a DLCS like the heat exchanger, manifolds, cold plates, and quick connects
    in order to develop an energy efficient system without comprising on the performance.
    Cold plates occupy a crucial share both in determining the flow and thermal behavior
    of the rack level system. A thorough characterization study of a cold plate designed
    to accommodate low profile chassis was carried out by experimentally investigating
    the cold plate for varying parameters like volumetric flow rates, coolant temperature,
    and input power to the dies. A sophisticated bench level setup was developed and
    a controlled experimental procedure was followed in order to perform the characterization.
    A maximum of 31 W / cm 2 was dissipated at a pressure drop of 4.2 kPa across the
    cold plates. The thermal resistance of the cold plate was found to decline from
    0.056 to 0.029 W / ° C as the flow rate increases from 6 to 13 cm 3 / s indicating
    a drop in the convective resistance. A resistance network model was invoked up
    in analyzing different elements contributing to the total resistance of the cold
    plate. A heat transfer coefficient of 25 W / cm 2 K was estimated at the maximum
    flow rate tested. The experimentally measured pressure drop and cold plate thermal
    resistance were compared against a numerical model developed using 6sigmaET. An
    average difference of 8% and 4.5% was observed between the experiments and the
    model for ΔP and R cp measurements, respectively. Experiments were conducted at
    different coolant temperatures to address the effect of coolant viscosity on the
    overall performance of the cold plate. Although the heat sink thermal resistance
    values remain unaffected by changes to coolant temperature, the pressure drop
    value across the cold plates decreases by approximately 35% by varying the coolant
    temperature from 25 °C to 45 °C in the range of flow rates tested. This decrement
    in pressure drop is favorable as less pumping power is required to extract the
    same thermal performance. The thermo-hydraulic performance of the cold plate can
    be improved by properly understanding the underlying physics and then design the
    cold plate for optimal pumping power and maximum heat removal. Improving the efficiency
    at the component level would ultimately enhance the performance of a rack level
    system. Acknowledgment This work is supported by NSF IUCRC Award No. 1134867.

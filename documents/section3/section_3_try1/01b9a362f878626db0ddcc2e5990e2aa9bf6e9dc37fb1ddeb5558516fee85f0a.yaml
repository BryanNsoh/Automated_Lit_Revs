    Abstract: California has unsustainable use of agricultural water and energy, as\
    \ well as problems\nof severe drought, nitrate pollution and groundwater salinity.\
    \ As the leading producer and ex-\nporter of agricultural produce in the United\
    \ States, 5.6 percent of California’s energy is currently\nused for pumping groundwater.\
    \ These problems and new regulatory policies (e.g., Sustainable\nGroundwater Management\
    \ Act, Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program) pressure growers to schedule,\naccount\
    \ and maintain records of water, energy and nutrients needed for crop and soil\
    \ management.\nGrowers require varying levels of decision support to integrate\
    \ different irrigation strategies into\nfarm operations. Decision support can\
    \ come from the public or private sector, where there are\nmany tradeoffs between\
    \ cost, underlying science, user friendliness and overall challenges in farm\n\
    integration. Thus, effective irrigation management requires clear deﬁnitions,\
    \ decision support and\nguidelines for how to incorporate and evaluate the water–nutrient–energy\
    \ nexus beneﬁts of different\npractices and combinations of practices under shifting\
    \ water governance. The California Energy\nCommission-sponsored Energy Product\
    \ Evaluation Hub (Cal-EPE Hub) project has a mission of\nproviding science-based\
    \ evaluation of energy-saving technologies as a direct result of improved water\n\
    management for irrigation in agriculture, including current and future irrigation\
    \ decision support\nsystems in California. This project incorporates end-user\
    \ perceptions into evaluations of existing\ndecision support tools in partnership\
    \ with government, agricultural and private stakeholders. In this\narticle, we\
    \ review the policy context and science underlying the available irrigation decision\
    \ support\nsystems (IDSS), discuss the beneﬁts/tradeoffs and report on their efﬁcacy\
    \ and ease of use for the\nmost prevalent cropping systems in California. Finally,\
    \ we identify research and knowledge-to-action\ngaps for incorporating irrigation\
    \ decision support systems into new incentives and requirements for\nreporting\
    \ water and energy consumption as well as salinity and nitrogen management in\
    \ the state\nof California.\nKeywords: food–water–energy nexus; nitrate leaching;\

    1. Introduction\nAgricultural production in California includes the cultivation\
    \ of approximately 400 crops\naccounting for one-third of vegetable and two-thirds\
    \ of fruit and nut production in the\nUnited States [1]. According to California\
    \ Agricultural Production Statistics (2019), this\nagricultural abundance makes\
    \ California a leading US state accounting for over 13% of the\ncountry’s total\
    \ value in agricultural production. Some of California’s leading crops include\n\
    almonds, grapes, strawberries, pistachios, lettuce, walnuts and processing tomatoes\
    \ [1]. In\norder to produce these crops for export across the country and other\
    \ parts of the world,\ngreat amounts of water, fertilizer and energy are used.\
    \ In California, agricultural water\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12081962\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n2 of 31\nuse represents\
    \ one-ﬁfth of the electricity consumed for water use and four percent of total\n\
    electricity consumption annually [2]. Approximately 75–80% of the total water\
    \ pumped is\nused to irrigate three million hectares throughout the state [3,4].\
    \ The majority of the water\nand energy consumption is during the summer growing\
    \ season (June to August), relying on\ngroundwater that uses between 496 to 1750\
    \ Megajoules per Megaliter of water [5]. Declines\nin aquifer levels, increased\
    \ land subsidence and loss of storage strain growers for energy\nefﬁciency improvements\
    \ in drought years. The ampliﬁed demand for water and energy\nduring drought also\
    \ lowers stream ﬂows and lake levels, which impact the production\nof hydroelectric\
    \ power. In addition, the water table is lowered continually during these\nperiods,\
    \ as growers pump groundwater from deeper wells demanding more power. The\nCalifornia\
    \ drought assessment of 2014 reported a loss of 8.1 million ML of surface water\n\
    with a simultaneous increase of 6.3 million ML in groundwater pumped for an additional\n\
    cost of USD 454 million [6]. Flood and furrow irrigation still account for approximately\n\
    40 percent of the total irrigated area in California, despite the advances and\
    \ investments in\nirrigation systems. The adoption of the drip and micro-sprinkler\
    \ irrigation signiﬁcantly\nincreased in acreage between 1991 (0.52 million hectares)\
    \ and 2010 (16 million hectares) [7].\nFigure 1 identiﬁes the hydrologic regions\
    \ across the state of California and the distribution\nof major crops, irrigation\
    \ methods and levels of salinity in irrigation water.\nCalifornia’s increasing\
    \ severity of droughts not only depletes groundwater but also\nincreases the carbon\
    \ footprint and greenhouse gas emissions from increased burning of\nfossil fuels\
    \ to generate the power for pumping groundwater. After facing several severe\n\
    drought years, state leaders implemented incentives, regulations and policies\
    \ to manage\ngroundwater that require record keeping and reporting of water use,\
    \ nitrogen (N) leaching\nand energy consumption. Simple and scalable irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are\nneeded to facilitate base information for growers\
    \ to manage and maximize irrigation\nwater, energy and N use efﬁciency. On-farm\
    \ water management using irrigation decision\nsupport systems coordinates the\
    \ development and management of water, land and related\nresources aimed toward\
    \ equitable economic welfare and sustainable water use for future\ngenerations\
    \ [8,9]. Irrigation decision support systems (IDSS) are integrated solutions\n\
    combining and interpreting real-time meteorological, soil moisture and/or crop\
    \ water\nstress data using telemetric services to help growers make irrigation\
    \ decisions. Most of\nthe ﬁrst IDSS developed in California ranged from spreadsheets\
    \ to stand-alone software.\nWith recent improvements in public weather-station\
    \ networks, sensor technology, satellite\nand aerial imaging, wireless communications\
    \ and cloud computing, web and smartphone\napplications automating a range of\
    \ complex calculations involved in evapotranspiration-\nbased irrigation scheduling,\
    \ crop and soil nitrogen status IDDS have been developed.\nThe California Energy\
    \ Product Evaluation Hub (or Hub) was proposed by the Califor-\nnia Energy Commission\
    \ to ﬁll an information gap between energy sector manufacturers\nand large commercial\
    \ and institutional customers. The purpose of the Hub is to accelerate\nthe adoption\
    \ of beneﬁcial technologies by informing customers purchasing distributed\nenergy\
    \ resource products through procurement processes. The objectives of the Hub are\
    \ to\nevaluate the selected distributed energy resource products (e.g., IDSS)\
    \ in a rigorous and\ntransparent manner and widely disseminate the evaluation\
    \ results to large commercial and\ninstitutional customers. The evaluations will\
    \ allow comparisons of similar technologies,\nas well as comparisons to existing\
    \ government and industry standards. The evaluations,\nand the data behind them,\
    \ will be distributed through the Hub’s public web platform. The\nHub is a cooperative\
    \ effort among the University of California, Davis, Lawrence Berkeley\nNational\
    \ Laboratory, Energy Solutions and the Center for the Built Environment of the\n\
    University of California, Berkeley.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n3 of 31\nare integrated\
    \ into existing crop irrigation management as part of the ongoing research of\
    \ \nthe California Energy Product Evaluation Hub. Finally, we identify knowledge\
    \ gaps in \nIDSS research and current available tools for integrating energy,\
    \ nitrogen leaching and \nsoil salinity management. \n \nFigure 1. Distribution\

    The overall goal of this narrative review is to identify, compile and assess the\
    \ available\nIDSS in California and how they may serve multiple water, energy\
    \ and nutrient manage-\nment goals. Here, we discuss the different water budget\
    \ components and measurements\nused in crop canopy, soil moisture, aerial reﬂectance\
    \ and satellite-based IDSS. We also\nconsider diverse California cropping and\
    \ irrigation systems and how different IDSS are\nintegrated into existing crop\
    \ irrigation management as part of the ongoing research of\nthe California Energy\
    \ Product Evaluation Hub. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps in\nIDSS research\
    \ and current available tools for integrating energy, nitrogen leaching and soil\n\
    salinity management.\n2. Objective and Review Methodology\nWe identiﬁed all active\
    \ IDSS in California through a comprehensive search of all IDSS\non the search\
    \ engines and in consultation with a California IDSS product advisory group.\n\
    The IDSS product advisory group consisted of growers, certiﬁed crop advisors,\
    \ cooperative\nextension advisors, the California Department of Agriculture, California\
    \ Agricultural\nIrrigation Association and additional government, industry and\
    \ trade organizations. The\nadvisory group helped deﬁne the IDSS needs for the\
    \ California cropping system. This\ninformation was used to identify the commercially\
    \ or freely available technologies and\nexclude the IDSS that have not yet been\
    \ made available for widespread use.\nSection 3 deﬁnes California’s water management\
    \ context and the need for IDSS un-\nder increasing drought, regulation and risk\
    \ management. Section 4 provides a broad\noverview of soil–plant–atmosphere approaches\
    \ for IDSS. Section 5 describes the commer-\ncially available IDSS based on soil\
    \ tension, canopy temperature, stem water potential and\nremote-sensing techniques.\
    \ Section 6 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for\nintegrated irrigation\
    \ and energy management in agricultural systems. Section 7 describes\nthe science,\
    \ policy and role of IDSS for integrated irrigation and nitrogen (N) management\n\
    to control the environmental problems or groundwater contamination due to excessive\n\
    N fertilizer uses. Section 8 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for\
    \ integrated\nirrigation and salinity management. Sections 9 and 10 focus on IDSS\
    \ as a holistic effort\nfor water, nutrient and salinity management and consider\
    \ the innovation, validation and\nadoption strategies.\n3. Context for IDSS in\
    \ California Agriculture\n3.1. Water Scarcity\nOverdrawn aquifers, decline in\
    \ snowpack, frequent droughts and rising evaporative\ndemand are increasing water\
    \ scarcity in California. These water resource concerns have\nled to decreasing\
    \ water availability for irrigation, increasing regulation (e.g., reduced allo-\n\
    cations), increasing energy consumption, difﬁculty in water/fertilization co-management\n\
    and increasing water and energy prices. Because the annual evaporative demand\
    \ exceeds\nprecipitation in the majority of California, irrigation is generally\
    \ considered compulsory.\nWhile most of the precipitation falls in the winter,\
    \ key economic crops have high water\ndemands during the spring–summer–fall season.\
    \ Additionally, there is a spatial disconnect\nbetween precipitation and agricultural\
    \ water demand in California. Most of the surface\nwater used for agriculture\
    \ comes from precipitation in the northern part of the state, while\nthe Central\
    \ Valley and southern parts of the state have the greatest demand for agricultural\n\
    water. These discrepancies in space and time have led to complex water conveyance,\n\
    storage and transfer systems that are important for understanding the potential\
    \ beneﬁts of\nIDSS for California growers [10].\nAlthough California spans a wide\
    \ range of climates, much of the state, including\nsome of the most productive\
    \ farmland, occupies semi-arid regions of the Central and Impe-\nrial Valleys,\
    \ which are characterized by a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers\nand\
    \ mild, wet winters. Statewide, the average water use is roughly 50% environmental,\n\
    40% agricultural and 10% urban [11]. By necessity, California has adopted management\n\
    strategies to deal with water shortages, such as reusing water, long-distance\
    \ water con-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n5 of 31\nveyance and desalination technologies\
    \ to complement local ground and surface water [12].\nUnfortunately, water supply\
    \ diversiﬁcation strategies can also lead to increased energy use\nand, consequently,\
    \ to increased greenhouse gas emissions [13]. California’s water system is\nestimated\
    \ to emit 10% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions [14]. Water–energy nexus\n\
    approaches recognize the close connection between water and energy and the importance\n\
    of considering all aspects of these complex systems [15,16]. As irrigation makes\
    \ up a large\nportion of the water supply system in the state, it is under critical\
    \ consideration by both\ngovernment agencies and agricultural end users. Policy\
    \ makers face the difﬁcult task of\nbalancing the needs of diverse stakeholders,\
    \ protecting the environment and providing\nreliable, sustainable water supplies\
    \ to agricultural, industrial and residential customers [16].\nAt the same time,\
    \ California growers face more frequent and severe drought events, warmer\ntemperatures\
    \ and variable rainfall associated with climate change [17], leading to increasing\n\
    dependence on irrigation [18].\nGrowers also face increasing competition for irrigation\
    \ water and growing concerns\nabout the environmental impacts of irrigation. Growers\
    \ pay for water, energy and infras-\ntructure to irrigate crops. California growers\
    \ pay between USD 12/106 ML−1 water in\ndirect costs and USD 17/151 ML−1 water\
    \ in energy costs [19–21]. While growers are willing\nto adopt new technologies\
    \ to reduce risks during periods of water shortage, the information\nprovided\
    \ by extension services and other educational sources plays an important role\
    \ in\nnew irrigation technology adoption [22].\n3.2. Regulations\nCalifornia growers\
    \ identify the key barriers to water and energy conservation efforts as\n(1) cost,\
    \ (2) a lack of return on investment (3) and uncertainty about the future of available\n\
    water. Cost alone is not enough to increase IDSS adoption or agricultural water\
    \ conserva-\ntion [23]. In semi-arid regions, regulating surface water without\
    \ regulating groundwater (or\nvice versa) increases pressure on the unregulated\
    \ water source instead of increasing the use\nof IDSS [24]. However, approaches\
    \ that involve cooperation across institutional ecosystems\nas well as multi-actor\
    \ governance and participation to jointly regulate groundwater and\nsurface water\
    \ quantity, nutrient/pollutant transport and energy usage may increase IDSS\n\
    adoption [23,25].\nFor the past century, California has been a demonstrative example\
    \ where the reg-\nulation and governance of surface water quantity and quality\
    \ have placed tremendous\nstress on groundwater supply and energy required to\
    \ pump groundwater in years with\nlimited surface water allocation. However, the\
    \ legislation and policies adapted in 2014–2016\nare attempting to jointly regulate\
    \ groundwater and surface water quantity, quality and\ncooperation across institutions.\
    \ In 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater\nManagement Act (SGMA),\
    \ in which two state agencies (Department of Water Resources and\nState Water\
    \ Resources Control Board) mandate and oversee communities self-organizing\ninto\
    \ groundwater sustainability agencies [26]. Each agency created groundwater sustain-\n\
    ability plans to achieve sustainability goals by 2040–2042. Similarly, in 2014,\
    \ the California\nIrrigated Lands Regulatory Program was expanded to regulate\
    \ nitrates in discharge to\nboth surface and groundwater from irrigated agricultural\
    \ lands [27]. California’s 2020\nheat wave and widespread agricultural power outages\
    \ have spurred agricultural trade\norganizations to consider the need for IDSS\
    \ to accommodate off-peak energy usage and\nregulations imposed by utility companies\
    \ [28]. However, there are not yet any direct\nstatewide regulations on the energy\
    \ used for groundwater pumping in California.\n3.3. Loss and Risk Management\n\
    3.3.1. Infrastructure Failures\nIDSS could help growers plan for water usage throughout\
    \ the growing season when\nadjustments may be required to accommodate irrigation\
    \ interruptions to avoid yield losses\nat critical moments. For example, in the\
    \ 2018 Census on Irrigation and Water Management,\n1792 CA growers (29,538 ha)\
    \ reported yield losses because of irrigation interruptions related\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n6 of 31\nto groundwater/surface water shortages, equipment failure,\
    \ energy shortages, high salinity,\nloss of water rights or increase in water\
    \ costs [29]. Having a formal IDSS in place does not\nprevent water, energy or\
    \ infrastructure disruptions but instead could assist in identifying\nequipment\
    \ failures and providing the projected data and calculations needed for difﬁcult\n\
    decisions—how best to prioritize the available water across the farm to the crops\
    \ that will\nhave the highest potential for short- and long-term revenue.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Disease-Based Losses and Water\nGrowers using intuitive, informal irrigation\
    \ practices may err on the side of applying\n‘extra’ water to ensure that crop\
    \ water requirements are met. Additionally, some IDSS may\nalso err on the side\
    \ of overprediction of evapotranspiration and crop water requirements\nto match\
    \ grower management practices. Although this logic may decrease the risk of\n\
    underwatering or water stress, it can increase water logging, nitrate leaching,\
    \ anoxia,\ndenitriﬁcation, salinity, soil erosion and runoff, in addition to the\
    \ wasted energy and water\ncosts [30]. In California perennial crops, overirrigation\
    \ or irrigating too soon can impact\nroot development—especially of shallow, ﬁne\
    \ roots—which can lead to long-term yield\nlosses, especially if the root zone\
    \ oxygen concentration drops below 10% [31]. In both\nannual and perennial crops,\
    \ overirrigation that increases soil and/or canopy moisture can\noften increase\
    \ the survival, growth, infection and dispersal of pathogens, which ultimately\n\
    leads to disease-based yield losses [32]. However, it is important to note that\
    \ not supplying\nenough water to meet crop needs can also trigger many belowground\
    \ diseases [32]. For\na comprehensive review of irrigation–disease interactions,\
    \ please see Swett (2020) [32].\nAlthough IDSS could integrate crop-speciﬁc co-management\
    \ of water and diseases in the\nfuture, to the best of our knowledge, no IDSS\
    \ currently have this function for California\ncropping systems.\n4. Soil–Plant–Atmosphere\
    \ Approaches and Data for IDSS in California\n4.1. Precipitation\nPrecipitation\
    \ is an important component of the hydrologic cycle considered for all\nwater\
    \ budgets. In California, real-time rainfall data can be acquired from different\
    \ sources,\nsuch as the Department of Water Resources California Irrigation Management\
    \ Information\nSystem (CIMIS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s\
    \ California Nevada\nRiver Forecast Center (CNRFC) and United States Climate Data.\
    \ For annual water budget-\ning, monthly precipitation data are often used. Several\
    \ researchers have observed decreases\nin precipitation and increases in autumn\
    \ temperatures since the 1980s [33,34]. In 2018, the\ndelayed start of precipitation\
    \ months resulted in the most destructive wildﬁres of California,\nburning about\
    \ 766,439 hectares of land area [34,35]. This has not only disturbed water\nbudget\
    \ planning and estimation, but it has also impacted the contamination of groundwater\n\
    and other available sources of irrigation by changing the pH due to debris and\
    \ ash [36].\n4.2. Evapotranspiration\nEvapotranspiration depends on weather conditions,\
    \ crop type, canopy density/\ndevelopment, stomatal conductance and regulation,\
    \ irrigation system and management,\nsoil management and soil type. In California,\
    \ the estimates of reference evapotranspiration\n(ETo) come from the 153 active\
    \ CIMIS stations that are sited, maintained and equipped\nby the California Department\
    \ of Water Resources to measure shortwave solar radiation\n(pyranometer), soil\
    \ temperature (thermistor), air temperature (HMP35), relative humidity\n(HMP35),\
    \ wind direction (wind vane), wind speed (anemometer) and precipitation (tipping\n\
    bucket rain gauge). The state is divided into 18 ETo climatic zones based on long-term\n\
    monthly CIMIS averages. Additionally, a spatial CIMIS data product combines the\
    \ network\nof available stations for ground measurement and satellite data in\
    \ order to simulate the\nETo of the whole state. CIMIS estimates hourly ETo for\
    \ cool-season grass with a height\nof 0.10–0.15 m using the CIMIS Penman equation,\
    \ which is modiﬁed from the Penman\nequation [37], with an approach for estimating\
    \ net radiation from shortwave solar radiation,\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n7 of\
    \ 31\ntemperature and relative humidity measurements developed and validated using\
    \ 71 net\nradiometers across California [38]. The CIMIS Penman equation also uses\
    \ different weights\nfor wind speed in the hourly estimation of ETo depending\
    \ on whether it is day or night\ntime and a unique cloud factor obtained from\
    \ each CIMIS station [39].\nIn addition to the CIMIS network, the National Oceanic\
    \ and Atmospheric Administra-\ntion (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental\
    \ Satellite (GOES) satellites have\nbeen used to predict incoming solar radiation\
    \ as the main source energy for evapotran-\nspiration. Satellite-based ETo maps\
    \ are calculated on a two-kilometer grid, which is an\nimportant contribution\
    \ of data for decision making, given that the distance between the\nCIMIS stations\
    \ can be tens of kilometers. These freely available estimates of ETo can be\n\
    paired with crop-speciﬁc coefﬁcients (Kc) to estimate crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) during\nthe growing season. It is important to note that evapotranspiration\
    \ offers decision support\nas to how much water has been used by the crop based\
    \ on meteorological data or will be\nused by the crop based on meteorological\
    \ forecasting [40,41].\n4.3. Irrigation Scheduling Resources\nThe quantity and\
    \ timing of water application to irrigate a crop is a critical part of\nplanning\
    \ a growing season. Crop management activities are mainly dependent on the\nmoisture\
    \ present in the soil and root matrix. Scheduling depends on the combination\n\
    of evaporative demand from the atmosphere, spatial and temporal heterogeneity\
    \ in soil\nproperties and changes in crop canopy during a growing season. California\
    \ IDSS currently\nschedule irrigation by measuring, remotely sensing and/or modeling\
    \ some combination of\nthree different categories: (1) evapotranspiration, (2)\
    \ allowable depletion of soil moisture\nand (3) canopy characteristics [42]. In\
    \ this work, we discuss California IDSS and state\nspeciﬁc data sources that can\
    \ be used to ascertain data from these categories and represent\nthese tools and\
    \ sensors in Figure 2. These categories are used in IDSS throughout the world,\n\
    and we recommend Gu et al. (2020) for an in-depth general review [43].\n4.3.1.\
    \ In Situ Calculation of Crop Coefﬁcient Values\nCrop coefﬁcient (Kc) values can\
    \ be obtained for the entire growing season from his-\ntorical evapotranspiration\
    \ databases for specialty crops (almonds, walnuts, pistachios,\nprocessing tomatoes,\
    \ etc.) developed by the University of California under the drought man-\nagement\
    \ program. There are available databases maintained by the University of Califor-\n\
    nia Agriculture and Natural Resources (https://www.sacvalleyorchards.com/et-reports/\n\
    (accessed on 20 August 2021)) Westlands Water Districts (https://wwd.ca.gov/water-\n\
    management/irrigation-guide/ (accessed on 20 August 2021)) that provide regional\

    \ depletion of soil moisture approach requires some knowledge or a priori\nassumption\
    \ of the effective crop rooting depth, soil textural and hydrological properties\
    \ and\nestimates of either soil volumetric water content or soil water potential.\
    \ These parameters\nare used to estimate the plant available water content (AWC)\
    \ as the difference between ﬁeld\ncapacity and permanent wilting point. The allowable\
    \ depletion is established as a threshold\nbased on a fraction of AWC or speciﬁc\
    \ soil water potential at which water stress will occur\nwithout irrigation. The\
    \ allowable depletion can differ by soil texture, crop type, as well\nas phenological\
    \ stage. In California, the allowable depletion can range from 25% AWC in\nonions\
    \ to 90% AWC in ripening wheat but generally runs in the 45–50% AWC range [69–71].\n\
    Allowable depletion, whether measured or modeled, offers decision support regarding\n\
    how much to irrigate (e.g., reﬁll the soil proﬁle), as well as when to initiate\
    \ irrigation. It\nis important to note that allowable depletion is not a direct\
    \ assessment of plant water\nstress but rather assumes plant water stress based\
    \ on empirical relationships between plant\nphysiological stress (e.g., stem water\
    \ potential, canopy temperature, reduced transpiration)\nand soil volumetric water\
    \ content or soil water potential.\nSoil cohesion and adhesion to water molecules\
    \ determines the soil water potential\n(suction or negative pressure). Plants\
    \ take up water when water potential is between\nthe ﬁeld capacity (−0.33 bar)\
    \ and permanent wilting point (−15 bar). Therefore, irriga-\ntion scheduling is\
    \ performed by maintaining the soil moisture within this range of soil\nwater\
    \ potential. The most commonly used methods for soil moisture or water potential\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n10 of 31\nmonitoring in California are tensiometers,\
    \ electrical resistance block (watermark sensors)\nor capacitance-based sensors\
    \ [72]. Recent developments in telemetric operations allow\nmanufacturers to combine\
    \ the soil moisture sensors with web or mobile applications as\nremote systems.\
    \ Additionally, the user friendliness of remote telemetry and real-time\nmoisture\
    \ data in the ﬁeld are now integrated with automated irrigation systems. Some\n\
    of the common telemetric operators for soil moisture sensors in California are\
    \ Wildeye,\nFarm(X), Hortau, Irriwatch and AquaSpy.\n4.3.3. Scheduling with Crop\
    \ Canopy Characteristics\nRecent advancements in the capture and interpretation\
    \ of remotely sensed vegetative\nindices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index or NDVI) allow growers to empirically\nderive real-time values of crop\
    \ coefﬁcients throughout the growing season [73–75]. Remote\nsensing tools, such\
    \ as directly or remotely piloted aerial vehicles or satellite imagery, aid in\n\
    the use of algorithms to combine remotely sensed vegetative indices and soil reﬂectance\n\
    maps [76–79]. This combination helps growers manage irrigation in orchard cropping\n\
    systems where NDVI and other index values for individual trees can be calculated.\
    \ In\nCalifornia, these services are widely provided by Ceres Imaging Inc. to\
    \ specialty crop grow-\ners. Additionally, CropManage uses satellite-based estimates\
    \ of phenology for irrigation\nscheduling [80–82].\n5. IDSS for Crop Water Management\
    \ in California\nThe use of IDSS has increased in California in the last decade,\
    \ especially for efﬁcient\nwater application preparation for the SGMA regulatory\
    \ standards. The most common\nIDSS in California integrate two major components:\
    \ (1) data input/analysis and (2) user\ninterface. The data input/analytical techniques\
    \ acquire data based on soil, crop and/or\nweather parameters, and the user interface\
    \ is based on telemetry that simpliﬁes the acquired\ndata using statistical interpretation,\
    \ photogrammetry and/or simulation modeling. The\nease of understanding or user\
    \ friendliness of the acquired information depends on the\nuse of graphics, color\
    \ notations and approach to simplify the complex data [83]. The\nIDSS commonly\
    \ used in cultivating specialty crops in California can be classiﬁed into\nthree\
    \ types (Table 2): (1) soil-based IDSS, (2) canopy-based IDSS and (3) remote-sensing\n\
    IDSS. Irrigation strategies, such as deﬁcit irrigation, subsurface drip irrigation,\
    \ overhead\nlinear move sprinkler irrigation, deep root irrigation, pressure-compensated\
    \ drip irrigation,\nautomated surface irrigation, and tail recovery systems may\
    \ enhance water use efﬁciency\nfor high-value crops in California [84].\n5.1.\
    \ Soil-Based IDSS\nIn IDSS, soil moisture is generally reported in inches of water\
    \ per foot of soil or as\na percentage of weight or volume [2,85], while soil\
    \ water potential is usually reported in\nbars or kPa. The California IDSS based\
    \ on soil moisture usually also estimate or infer soil\nhydrologic properties\
    \ (e.g., texture, AWC) to contextualize the recommendations. Therefore,\nthe soil\
    \ sensors used as IDSS can be divided into two types.\nType 1—IDSS based on volumetric\
    \ moisture content. These soil moisture sensors include\ntime domain reﬂectometry,\
    \ capacitance and frequency domain reﬂectometry sensors [80,86].\nType 2—IDSS\
    \ based on soil water potential. These sensors include tensiometers and\ngranular\
    \ matrix sensors [87,88].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n11 of 31\nTable 2. List of\

    \ with their telemet-\nric services to access the data through cloud-based data\
    \ storage applications. The selection\nof these sensors is based on evaluating\
    \ water and energy savings, installation and mainte-\nnance, ease of use and suitability\
    \ for specialty crops and soil type, data interpretation and\nadditional services.\
    \ Vendors have the capability of making recommendations to growers\nby integrating\
    \ and installing in situ weather stations. However, the CIMIS weather stations\n\
    are widely spread throughout the state and provide reliable and validated information\
    \ on\nthe required weather parameters for water budgeting. Some commonly used\
    \ soil moisture\nsensors can be combined with telemetric services provided either\
    \ by the sensor company\nor by a separate IDSS vendor.\nSoil moisture probes are\
    \ widely used to determine the real-time volumetric moisture\ncontent allowing\
    \ user-friendly or site-speciﬁc calibrations. Measurements can be taken\nat the\
    \ desirable depths throughout the soil proﬁle. These sensors also provide additional\n\
    information on soil temperature and salinity. These sensors, based on design,\
    \ can also\nmeasure soil water potential up to −10 bars. The sensors are provided\
    \ to growers as leased\nassets, and real-time irrigation recommendations are made\
    \ through telemetry services.\nExamples include tensiometers that are designed\
    \ to measure soil water potential in heavy\n(0–1 bar) and light soils (0–0.3 bar).\
    \ Watermark sensors are based on electrical resistance in\nsoils and are widely\
    \ useful for measuring soil matric potential up to 2 bars.\n5.2. Canopy-Based\
    \ IDSS\nThe metabolic processes in a plant system are driven by its water content.\
    \ Plant water\nstatus can be estimated by monitoring physiological and metabolic\
    \ processes, such as stem\nor leaf water potential, relative moisture content,\
    \ stomatal conductance, canopy temperature\nand xylem cavitation [2,73,89–92].\
    \ The most commonly measured water stress parameters in\nCalifornia are canopy\
    \ temperature, canopy cover and stem water potential [2]. These plant\nwater status\
    \ indicators are most useful for irrigation timing and can be used to inform when\n\
    irrigation is required, when crops are not receiving enough irrigation, when there\
    \ are problems\nwith irrigation systems (e.g., distribution uniformity), as a\
    \ proxy for soil salinity stress and\nfor applying controlled stress to improve\
    \ crop quality or health. Plant water status indicators\nare less useful for understanding\
    \ how much irrigation is needed, as they do not provide\ninformation about soil\
    \ moisture or evaporative demand. Plant-based IDSS are generally\ncombined with\
    \ meteorological parameters and/or evapotranspiration data.\n5.2.1. Canopy Cover\n\
    Radiation interception and evapotranspiration depend on the canopy cover and sur-\n\
    face area of a crop. Canopy cover serves as an important parameter for several\
    \ remote-\nsensing techniques used as IDSS. As crop canopies change throughout\
    \ the growing season\nin terms of their size, area and reﬂectance properties,\
    \ so do the values of the crop coefﬁcient\n(Kc). The spectral reﬂectance of vegetation\
    \ or crop canopy can help growers understand\nthe variability in the ﬁeld by assessing\
    \ the plant vigor and chlorophyll content [93,94].\nA key component of canopy-based\
    \ IDSS is the crop and growth stage-speciﬁc Kc value.\nThe Kc values are usually\
    \ determined from ﬁeld studies measuring actual evapotranspi-\nration and ETo\
    \ [95,96] but can also be assessed using measurements of leaf area index,\nlight\
    \ interception and percent canopy cover. Some of the commonly used IDSS based\n\
    on evapotranspiration and canopy parameters include Arable Mark 2 sensors and\
    \ Tule\nsensors. These sensors are leased by the respective vendors, and the irrigation\
    \ recom-\nmendations based on canopy parameters are informed through web/mobile\
    \ applications.\nArable Mark 2 sensors are often combined with the soil moisture\
    \ probes to apply the soil\nand canopy parameters to complete the water budget\
    \ equation for irrigation decisions.\n5.2.2. Canopy Temperature\nCanopy temperature\
    \ indirectly measures water deﬁcit when it increases above the\nsurrounding ambient\
    \ temperature [97]. In general, the variability in canopy temperature\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n13 of 31\nis also a result of solar radiation and air temperature.\
    \ Different indices are used for\nirrigation scheduling using canopy temperatures.\
    \ Some examples include the Crop Water\nStress Index, Stress Degree Days, Stomatal\
    \ Conductance Index, Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold and Time Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT) [98–101]. In California, the Crop Water\nStress Index and Degrees Above\
    \ Canopy Threshold have been evaluated for wine grapes,\ncorn, pistachios and\
    \ wheat growers using infrared thermal radiometry [102,103]. The\nCrop Water Stress\
    \ Index is calculated by determining the canopy temperature minus\nthe air temperature\
    \ relative to a well-watered and non-transpiring reference crop [103].\nContrary\
    \ to the Crop Water Stress Index, the Degrees Above Canopy Threshold only\nrequires\
    \ a single canopy temperature measurement for quantifying water stress [103,104].\n\
    For point-based measurements, canopy temperature can be acquired using an infrared\n\
    thermal radiometer [103]. At larger spatial scales, thermal and spectral imagery\
    \ IDSS\n(e.g., Ceres Imaging) using remote-sensing tools can be used for determining\
    \ indices based\non canopy temperature.\n5.2.3. Stem Water Potential\nStem water\
    \ potential is an indicator of how hard a plant is pumping to move water\nfrom\
    \ the soil (−15 to 0 bars) through the xylem (−2 to −60 bars) to the atmosphere\n\
    (−200 to −800 bars) [105]. In California, stem water potential is most commonly\
    \ used\nand recommended for high-value perennial crops, such as grapes, almonds,\
    \ walnuts and\nprunes [106,107]. Stem water potential is most often measured by\
    \ a pressure chamber, which\napplies pressure to a sample leaf until the water\
    \ is pushed out of the stem [90,106,108].\nThere are growing numbers of sensors\
    \ available for measuring the stem water potential.\nThese sensors can function\
    \ as micro-chips or micro-tensiometers or dendrometers for\ninstallation in woody\
    \ vines or trunks [108]. In order to be useful, stem water potential\nmeasurements\
    \ need to be contextualized in relation to the environmental demand, as they\n\
    are sensitive to temperature and vapor pressure deﬁcit [105]. Local tools are\
    \ available for\ngrowers to correct stem water potential readings in reference\
    \ to the evaporative demand and\ncompare the readings to baseline values when\
    \ water is not limited. The use of stem water\npotential measurements is high\
    \ in wine grapes, as growers are interested in maintaining\nspeciﬁc levels of\
    \ stress after veraison in order to maintain the quality (M. Cooper, personal\n\
    communication). Larger California vineyards have ‘pressure bomb teams’ to constantly\
    \ test\nstem water potential throughout the vineyards during the key time periods.\
    \ Although there\nare disease management beneﬁts to maintaining stress at hull\
    \ split, nut growers have still\nbeen slow to adopt the pressure chambers to measure\
    \ stem water potential, with adoption\nrates of under 20% among almond growers\
    \ [109].\n5.3. Remote-Sensing IDSS\nRemote and proximal sensing tools can be used\
    \ either independently or in conjunction\nwith ground measurements to estimate\
    \ actual evapotranspiration, ETc, allowable depletion\nand plant water status.\
    \ Remote sensing can use several modes of data collection, including\nsatellite,\
    \ aerial imaging and scanning towers. Remotely sensed measurements of evapotran-\n\
    spiration typically use thermal imaging as an indicator of canopy radiometric\
    \ temperature,\nwhere higher temperatures indicate relatively lower rates of evapotranspiration\
    \ (relatively\nhigher partitioning to sensible heat ﬂux), and relatively lower\
    \ temperatures indicate higher\nrates of evapotranspiration (relatively higher\
    \ partitioning to latent heat ﬂux). Remotely\nsensed vegetation indices from multispectral\
    \ data, such as NDVI, can be used as analogs for\nthe leaf area index, canopy\
    \ cover and height, which are also required for evapotranspiration\nmapping algorithms.\
    \ All remotely sensed evapotranspiration models solve for sensible\nheat ﬂux,\
    \ soil heat ﬂux and net radiation, which leaves the latent heat ﬂux or the energy\n\
    equivalent of evapotranspiration as the remainder of the energy budget. Some of\
    \ the en-\nergy balance models commonly used in evapotranspiration estimation\
    \ include Two-Source\nEnergy Balance (TSEB), Surface Energy Balance Algorithm\
    \ for Land (SEBAL), Surface En-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n14 of 31\nergy Balance\
    \ System (SEBS), Mapping EvapoTRanspiration using Internalized Calibration\n(METRIC)\
    \ and High-Resolution Mapping of EvapoTranspiration (HRMET) [77,110–115].\nThese\
    \ types of evapotranspiration maps and crop stress indices have been integrated\n\
    into several IDSS that serve California, such as Ceres Imaging (Oakland, CA, USA),\
    \ Ir-\nriwatch (Maurik, The Netherlands) and Open ET (a satellite-based water\
    \ data resource\nlaunched by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\
    \ and United States\nGeological Services (USGS)). However, one potential concern\
    \ or drawback is that detectable\ndifferences in evapotranspiration based on canopy\
    \ radiometric temperature may be re-\nvealed too late for irrigation intervention,\
    \ in that crops exhibiting this level of water stress\nhave already suffered some\
    \ yield loss from decreased photosynthesis [116]. This limitation\nof thermal\
    \ imaging has led to new areas of development for IDSS that may involve combin-\n\
    ing a variety of spectral bands, solar-induced ﬂuorescence and thermal imagery\
    \ to provide\nadditional information relating water status to yields [117,118].\n\
    Proximal sensing of soil apparent electrical conductivity can be a useful tool\
    \ to de-\nvelop high-resolution maps of AWC and other important soil physical\
    \ and hydrological\nproperties [119]. These soil maps can be used in conjunction\
    \ with maps of evapotranspira-\ntion or stem water potential measurements to assess\
    \ plant water status [77,78]. In many\nareas outside of California, commercial\
    \ IDSS have been developed to assign management\nzones based on soil properties,\
    \ especially in regions where center pivot irrigation systems\ndominate and can\
    \ be retroﬁtted or designed with variable rate application technology. New\nopportunities\
    \ for precision irrigation exist in California micro-irrigation systems using\n\
    variable frequency drives to irrigate based on the management zones. However,\
    \ there\nare not yet commercially available IDSS in California that rely primarily\
    \ on soil apparent\nelectrical conductivity mapping to delineate zone-based irrigation\
    \ management.\n6. IDSS for Energy Management in California\n6.1. General Considerations\n\
    The California agricultural sector consumes 75% of total water use in California\n\
    compared to 24% and 1% for municipal and industrial sectors, respectively [4].\
    \ During\nthe most recent megadrought between 2012 and 2016, the groundwater contribution\
    \ to\ntotal water use nearly doubled from 30–40% to 60%, with most of this being\
    \ used for\nagricultural irrigation [120,121]. Agricultural groundwater consumption\
    \ is directly linked\nwith the energy required to pump groundwater from the aquifers.\
    \ In California, 8% of total\nenergy use is for agriculture, and 70% of the agricultural\
    \ energy used is for groundwater\npumping [122]. Agricultural water and energy\
    \ demand surge in dry years and the summer\nmonths—especially in the afternoons\
    \ during peak daily energy demand for water to cool\nboth crops and humans [123].\
    \ Additionally, 60% of daily water-related energy demand is\ndue to pumping irrigation\
    \ water in California from surface and groundwater sources [124].\nMost surface\
    \ irrigation systems have an irrigation efﬁciency of 67.5–70%, while the\ntraditional\
    \ sprinkler system ranges between 70 and 82.5%. Drip and micro-sprinkler\nsystems\
    \ have the highest irrigation efﬁciency compared to sprinkler or surface systems,\n\
    ranging between 87.5 and 90% [125]. Pressurized surface and subsurface drip or\
    \ micro-\nsprinkler irrigation systems improve irrigation efﬁciency but require\
    \ more energy than\nsurface ﬂood or gravity irrigation [121,126]. Because there\
    \ has been a nearly commensurate\nconversion in half of California’s irrigated\
    \ lands from surface ﬂood or gravity systems to\npressurized systems since 1972\
    \ [127], California’s irrigation infrastructure has unfortunately\nincreased its\
    \ overall energy consumption while increasing its overall water use efﬁciency.\n\
    6.2. Science\nThere are opportunities for coupled energy and water conservation\
    \ in agriculture\nthrough improving irrigation system efﬁciency, application efﬁciency,\
    \ as well as crop water\nuse efﬁciency. Agricultural pumping of irrigation water\
    \ uses approximately 10 TWh of\nelectricity per year [128], and at least 1 TWh\
    \ or 10% of this usage could be conserved\nthrough improved control of water with\
    \ better water metering and improved distribution\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n15\
    \ of 31\nuniformity [4]. Additionally, pumping reductions through science-based\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning efforts on farm- or district-wide scales may also reduce\
    \ energy consumption [123].\nAdditional energy savings may be available through\
    \ increasing the pump efﬁciency to\n55–65% and using variable frequency drives\
    \ to facilitate changes in pump speeds when\nsystem pressure demands are not peaking\
    \ [129]. Moreover, on-farm solar generation and\nsolar or hybrid solar pumps can\
    \ also curb peak energy demands that coincide with peak\nwater demands [123].\n\
    Finally, either front loading pumping to on-farm water storage structures in advance\n\
    of peak energy demand [123,130] or applying a larger magnitude of irrigation a\
    \ week in\nadvance of a predicted heat wave could mitigate peak energy usage during\
    \ heat waves [126].\nHowever, scheduling larger irrigation events in advance of\
    \ a heat wave would have to\nensure that soil properties facilitated storage rather\
    \ than drainage of excess water. Similarly,\ndeﬁcit irrigation has been suggested\
    \ for energy conservation; however, this would need to\nensure that there either\
    \ would not be a signiﬁcant yield loss or that the yield losses would be\nlow\
    \ enough to justify an overall proﬁt based on reduced energy and irrigation costs.\
    \ Finally,\nthere is an opportunity for collective and community-based action\
    \ from irrigation districts\nand newly formed groundwater sustainability agencies\
    \ to use and develop district-wide\ntools for common pool energy users to pump\
    \ and store water in advance of peak times, as\nwell as prioritize and optimize\
    \ groundwater pumping based on the crop stage and need\nduring droughts and heat\
    \ waves [131].\n6.3. Policy\nThe above coupled energy and water management measures\
    \ require supportive poli-\ncies and governance for success, in which California\
    \ has made some promising progress. In\nresponse to the groundwater-pumping-related\
    \ energy use and high greenhouse gas emis-\nsions during the megadrought of 2012–2016,\
    \ California enacted the State Water Efﬁciency\nand Enhancement Program (SWEEP)\
    \ in 2014, which is the ﬁrst and largest program of its\nkind in the United States\
    \ to date. The SWEEP program involves a competitive application\nprocess for growers\
    \ to receive grants to make improvements that will reduce water and\nenergy consumption,\
    \ greenhouse gases, as well as improve drought resilience and air\nquality. Agricultural\
    \ operations can receive grants for three project categories: (1) pump\nand motor\
    \ enhancements, which include installing variable frequency drives and replacing\n\
    or improving the efﬁciency of motors or pumps; (2) irrigation system enhancements\
    \ for\nsystems with pumps, which include system pressure reduction measures, soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors, automating irrigation systems and IDSS; (3) fuel conversion\
    \ and renewable energy,\nwhich include changing fuel types to low-carbon fuel,\
    \ as well as the installation of on-site\nrenewable energy sources to offset fuel\
    \ use [132].\nApplicants must quantify the baseline information about current\
    \ energy, infrastruc-\nture efﬁciency and water use. Approximately one-third of\
    \ applicants have been awarded\nSWEEP at a maximum of USD 100,000 for 18 months\
    \ [133]. The awardees must use base-\nline water and energy data, as well as the\
    \ SWEEP Irrigation Water Savings Assessment\nTool and California Air Resources\
    \ Board Greenhouse Gas Calculator tool, to quantify the\nprojected water and energy\
    \ savings. The SWEEP program has invested USD 80 million in\nover 800 projects\
    \ for an annual water saving of 88,496 Megaliters and GHG reduction of\n80,077\
    \ MTCO2e [134]. The program’s challenges include the need for a stable, continuous\n\
    funding source and increased accessibility for small and socially disadvantaged\
    \ grow-\ners [133]. Speciﬁcally, although a third of projects have been located\
    \ in disadvantaged\ncommunities, only 10% of the funds have gone to socially disadvantaged\
    \ growers and\nranchers [133,134]. Although the SWEEP program has incentivized\
    \ and improved the\nirrigation system infrastructure and design for energy optimization,\
    \ there is still a need and\nlarge opportunity for IDSS and training related to\
    \ coupled water and energy management\nin California [133].\nAgronomy 2022, 12,\
    \ 1962\n16 of 31\n6.4. Decision Support for Irrigation and Energy Management\n\
    Although there has been an identiﬁable need for co-management of irrigation and\n\
    energy, there is currently only one decision support tool deployed for this purpose\
    \ in\nCalifornia. The California Energy Commission funded the research and development\
    \ of\nAgMonitor [135]. AgMonitor integrates irrigation schedules based on the\
    \ crop coefﬁcient\napproach and monthly aerial imagery with ﬂow metering and all\
    \ on-farm energy sources\nand sinks. This IDSS provides information on irrigation\
    \ magnitude and timing events\nthat will also optimize energy conservation across\
    \ a farm and has been validated in key\nCalifornian crops, such as processing\
    \ tomato, almond, pistachio and alfalfa. Although\ncommercially available IDSS\
    \ are limited in this area, there are currently research-level\nIDSS in development\
    \ to optimize irrigation applications with photovoltaic power produc-\ntion [136,137].\n\
    7. IDSS for Nitrogen (N) Management in California\n7.1. General Considerations\n\
    California’s intensive irrigated agricultural production has led to the use of\
    \ large\namounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. In contrast, N over-application\
    \ has been associated with\nwater pollution and various human health concerns\
    \ [138]. More than 50 years of tradeoffs\nbetween the use of N fertilizer and\
    \ the health of the environment have been documented in\nCalifornia [139,140].\
    \ Over the past years, the volume of inorganic N fertilizer used in the\nstate\
    \ has expanded dramatically. The annual sales between 1980 and 2001 have exceeded\n\
    600,000 tons of N [141].\nA signiﬁcant increase in the N fertilizer application\
    \ rate was observed in the Sacra-\nmento Valley, San Joaquin Basin and Tulare\
    \ Basin of the Central Valley for the period\n2002–2012 compared to 1991–2001\
    \ [142,143]. Nitrogen loading in the Sacramento Valley,\nSan Joaquin Basin and\
    \ Tulare Basin saw a signiﬁcant increase in 2002–2012 compared to\n1991–2001 [138].\
    \ More than 740,000 tons of N fertilizer was loaded on roughly 2.7 million\nhectares\
    \ of irrigated farmland in California. The excess N fertilizer leaches to groundwater\n\
    and affects the quality of drinking water [144]. Improper management of N fertiliza-\n\
    tion in California has contributed to the unsustainability of agricultural production\
    \ and\nhas threatened the health of Central Valley communities whose drinking\
    \ water relies on\ngroundwater resources.\n7.2. Science\nCrop N needs have been\
    \ investigated to provide growers with tools to determine\nproper fertilizer applications.\
    \ Numerous quantitative and complex decision-making tools\nhave been consistently\
    \ used to achieve improved nutrient management and irrigation.\nOnline spreadsheet\
    \ models and IDSS that process large amounts of information have been\nimplemented\
    \ by the University of California to help growers determine the appropriate\n\
    amounts of N fertilizers to apply (Table 3) [82]. Early season leaf sampling in\
    \ tree crops was\ndeveloped to estimate N status in tree tissues and make adjustments\
    \ in fertilizer timing\nand amount. Brown et al. [145] developed online spreadsheet\
    \ models for managing N\nin almonds and developed the four Rs of N management\
    \ (right rate, right time, right\nplace, right source). The right rate consists\
    \ of applying N in appropriate proportion to tree\ndemand. The right time is the\
    \ N application with the accurate timing with tree uptake,\nwhich starts at 70%\
    \ leaf out and stops soon after harvest. The right place encompasses\nvariable\
    \ rate irrigation and N application to address in-orchard soil and yield variability\n\
    as well as N application to the tree’s active root zone or foliage. The right\
    \ source refers\nto using the type of fertilizer that optimizes other nutrients\
    \ and suits the crop and the\nenvironment [146]. The Soil Nitrate Quick Test (SNQT),\
    \ developed for vegetables, provides\nan estimate of the soil mineral N status\
    \ capable of offsetting a fraction of the total N\nrequired by a crop. Hartz et\
    \ al. [147] developed N requirements for processing tomatoes in\nthe Central Valley.\
    \ Nitrogen application guidelines were later modelized to help growers\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n17 of 31\noptimize N application in processing tomato production\
    \ [148] and across several key\nCalifornia crops [149].\nTable 3. Principal decision\

    \ issues, the State Water Board has evaluated the\nexisting policies to determine\
    \ if existing water regulations are sufﬁcient and have improved\nthe wastewater\
    \ regulations to protect groundwater quality (www.cvsalinity.org (accessed\non\
    \ 20 August 2021)). The dischargers, such as growers, food processors, municipalities\n\
    and ranchers, have to comply with new regulations (e.g., Salt and Nitrate Management\n\
    Plan). Californian growers are under rising regulatory pressure to improve N use\
    \ efﬁciency\nin agricultural production to decrease nitrate leaching. Therefore,\
    \ they need the tools to\naccurately estimate crop N needs and availability to\
    \ conﬁdently adjust the N application\nrates. The federal and state agencies responsible\
    \ for protecting air and water quality have\nbeen assessing the causes, consequences\
    \ and costs of California’s agriculture-wide N use.\nThis concern explains the\
    \ various regulatory initiatives, such as the Central Valley Regional\nWater Quality\
    \ Control Board’s Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program, the Central Coast\nRegional\
    \ Water Quality Control Board’s renewal process for the Irrigated Agricultural\n\
    Lands Waiver, the Climate Action Reserve’s N Fertilizer Reduction Protocol and\
    \ the Central\nValley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s General Order for\
    \ Dairy Waste Dischargers\nand the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-term\
    \ Sustainability (CV-SALTS)\nprogram [150].\nCV-SALTS is a collaborative program\
    \ tasked to develop environmentally and eco-\nnomically sustainable management\
    \ plans for nitrates and salts in the Central Valley. The\nExecutive Committee\
    \ encompasses diverse stakeholder groups, such as agricultural groups,\ncities,\
    \ industry, regulatory agencies and community and environmental justice representa-\n\
    tives. The Salt and Nitrate Management Plan (SNMP) developed by CV-SALTS is built\
    \ on a\nrange of existing water quality management policies. It proposes additional\
    \ policies, mech-\nanisms and tools to provide the Central Valley Water Board\
    \ with the appropriate means for\naddressing the long-term loading of salt and\
    \ nitrates in the different regions of the Central\nValley. CV-SALTS is also tasked\
    \ with developing an all-inclusive regulatory program with\nadequate strategies\
    \ to address the management of salts and nitrates sustainably [151].\n7.4. Decision\
    \ Support for Irrigation and N Management\nNumerous IDSS for irrigation + N have\
    \ been developed by extension services, uni-\nversities and other institutions\
    \ involved in water management for states or regions [152].\nSome IDDS that help\
    \ manage N in CA include CropManage, Food, Agriculture, Resource\nManagement System\
    \ (FARMs) and the N Budget Calculator.\nCropManage can help growers and farm managers\
    \ determine watering and fertilizer\nN schedules on a ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld basis. All\
    \ the required components to determine crop water\nneeds, such as ETo and weather\
    \ data (from CIMIS), estimated Kc, as well as adequate\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on soil properties, are available without the need for in-ﬁeld\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n18 of 31\nsensors. CropManage is publicly available at: https://cropmanage.ucanr.edu/\
    \ (accessed\non 21 August 2021). The software automates all steps required to\
    \ calculate crop water\nrequirements, including N recommendations, based on soil\
    \ crop N uptake models, nitrate\nquick test values and credits for nitrate in\
    \ irrigation water and preceding crop residues.\nCropManage also helps growers\
    \ track irrigation and fertilizer schedules on multiple ﬁelds\nand allows data\
    \ sharing among users from the same farming operations. The web-based\napplication\
    \ record-keeping capability allows growers to review water and N applications\n\
    on each ﬁeld and maintain data required to comply with water quality regulations.\
    \ Crop-\nManage can be integrated with other web applications and data sources\
    \ to improve the\naccuracy of irrigation and fertilizer models [82].\nFARMs is\
    \ a user-friendly geospatial web-based application that simpliﬁes the use of\n\
    the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) model by automating\
    \ pro-\ncesses such as weather, climate and soil input. FARMs was developed using\
    \ DSSAT-CSM\nand open-source GIS software. FARMs allows adaptive management to\
    \ perform in-season\nyield predictions using both weather and climatic data to\
    \ evaluate the potential impacts of\nmanagement decisions on end-of-season yield.\
    \ FARMs uses NASA POWER weather data\nintegrated through an API [153]. FARMs simulates\
    \ nitrogen cycling of the cropping systems\nand quantiﬁes crop N stress based\
    \ on nitrogen uptake versus available nitrogen and is\nexpressed as a range between\
    \ 0 (no stress) to 1 (maximum stress). FARMs also simulates\nthe probability of\
    \ nitrate leaching from a given irrigation and N management strategy.\nThe N Calculator\
    \ is a predictive model that helps growers by advising on the timing\nand the\
    \ appropriate amount of N fertilizer to meet yield-based demand [145]. The N\n\
    Calculator has many functions, including calculating fertilization rates based\
    \ on the newest\nUC N management research, applying the four Rs of nutrient management\
    \ (right source,\nright rate, right timing and right location), enabling efﬁcient\
    \ fertilizer use, calculating N\nsupplies from non-fertilizer sources, such as\
    \ cover crops groundwater and compost, and\ncloning the N budget from one orchard\
    \ to another within and between years.\nFor example, using this tool for almonds\
    \ requires entering a yield estimate for pre-\nand post-bloom and adding early\
    \ season tissue-sampling results. The N Calculator helps\nto meet much of the\
    \ nutrients management required from the Irrigated Lands Regulatory\nProgram.\
    \ The Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program requires keeping an Irrigation and N\n\
    Management Plan (INMP) worksheet onsite and submitting a summary report to one’s\n\
    coalition in post-harvest time.\n8. IDSS for Salinity Management in California\n\
    8.1. General Considerations\nAbout 40% of global irrigated land is located in\
    \ arid/semi-arid zones, and this irriga-\ntion is often associated with salinization\
    \ [154]. With the development of intensive irrigation\npractices, the Central\
    \ Valley of California has become one of the world’s most productive\nfarming\
    \ regions. The continuously increasing levels of crop production are threatened\
    \ due\nto the deteriorating irrigation water quality. Clay layers impeding percolation\
    \ to deeper\ngroundwater regions have led to salt accumulation in drainage water\
    \ in many Central\nValley regions. One of the primary sources of salts is the\
    \ water supply imported from the\nSacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. About 250\
    \ tons of salt a day are imported into the\nSan Joaquin Valley through the state\
    \ and federal water project canals [155]. The soils of the\nCentral Valley’s western\
    \ regions are sedimentary and alluvial from the origin and formed\nin an uplifted\
    \ seabed. The native salts have mineralized and leached to the shallow water\n\
    tables over time due to irrigation and ﬂooding [156]. In the predominantly clay\
    \ and silty\nclay soil textures, as plants extract water from the soil and transpire,\
    \ the salt concentration\nlevel of the drainage water is likely to increase. As\
    \ a result, salts are likely to concentrate in\nthe root zone and accumulate in\
    \ shallow water tables through leaching [157]. Excessive salt\nconcentrations\
    \ affect a plant’s osmotic balance and trigger a reduction in plant water uptake\n\
    and stomata closing, which causes transpiration inhibition to occur [158]. The\
    \ increasing\nsoil salinity slowly and steadily contaminates water supplies and\
    \ reduces crop production.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n19 of 31\nVarious factors,\
    \ such as drought, climate change, water shortages and land-use changes,\ncould\
    \ exacerbate the salinity conditions.\nMore than 1.8 million hectares of irrigated\
    \ cropland in Central Valley (primarily in\nthe San Joaquin Valley) are affected\
    \ either through saline irrigation water or saline soils,\nand tens of thousands\
    \ of hectares of productive agricultural land are at risk (Figure 1) [159].\n\
    Salt accumulation has triggered more than 99957 hectares to be taken out of agricultural\n\
    production, and another 0.6 million hectares are considered damaged by salinity\
    \ [155].\nCurrent management activities address only 15% of the annual salt load\
    \ [150]. The direct\nannual costs from increasing salinity will range from USD\
    \ 1 billion to USD 1.5 billion, and\ntotal annual income impacts to the State\
    \ of California are predicted to range between USD\n1.7 billion and USD 3 billion\
    \ by 2030 [160]. The income reduction in the Central Valley\nwill range between\
    \ USD 1.2 billion and USD 2.2 billion [160]. In 2014, salinity reduced\nCalifornia’s\
    \ agricultural revenues by USD 3.7 billion, amounting to 8.0 million tons of crop\n\
    production lost [161].\n8.2. Science\nThe U.S. Salinity Laboratory (1954) classiﬁed\
    \ ﬁve cases of agricultural soil salinity: non-\nsaline (0–2 dS m−1), slightly\
    \ saline (2–4 dS m−1), moderately saline (4–8 dS m−1), strongly\nsaline (8–16\
    \ dS m−1) and extremely saline (>16 dS m−1) [162]. Although this salinity system\n\
    is the most commonly used, many other classiﬁcation systems of salt-affected soils\
    \ exist\nand are available in the literature [163]. The presence of salt in soil\
    \ water may affect plant\ngrowth either through salt-speciﬁc or osmotic effects.\
    \ The salt-speciﬁc or ion-excess effect\nof salinity occurs when excessive salt\
    \ amounts enter the crop, accumulate and damage the\ntranspiring leaves’ cells\
    \ and trigger plant growth reductions. The osmotic or water deﬁcit\neffect of\
    \ salinity occurs when salt in the soil solution decreases the plant’s water uptake\n\
    ability and leads to a decrease in the crop growth rate [164]. Salinity stress\
    \ affects all the\nmajor plant processes, such as germination, growth, water uptake\
    \ and yield [165].\nSalinity can be classiﬁed as natural or primary salinity and\
    \ second-hand salinity or\nhuman-induced salinity. Primary salinity comes from\
    \ salts accumulation over long periods\nof time via natural soil or groundwater\
    \ processes. Two natural processes contribute to\nprimary salinity. The ﬁrst is\
    \ the weathering process that breaks down rocks and releases\nvarious types of\
    \ soluble salts, including chlorides (of sodium, calcium and magnesium),\nsulfates\
    \ and carbonates. The passive results from oceanic salt that the wind carries\
    \ inland\nare deposited in the soil by rainfall. Passive salinity occurs due to\
    \ human activities, leading\nto the modiﬁcation of the soil’s hydrologic balance\
    \ [165].\n8.3. Policy\nThe increase in salts concentration in the California Central\
    \ Valley due to many factors,\nincluding intensive irrigation, has led to crises\
    \ and political decisions toward remediation.\nHigh concentrations of selenium\
    \ were found in ﬁsh in Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge,\nand vast numbers of\
    \ deformed and dead waterfowl were discovered at the refuge [166].\nIn 2006, the\
    \ Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s Salt and Boron Total\n\
    Maximum Daily Load for the San Joaquin River was approved, and a salinity control\
    \ plan\nentitled ‘Actions to Address the Salinity and Boron Total Maximum Daily\
    \ Load Issues\nfor the Lower San Joaquin River’ was adopted in response to the\
    \ Salinity and Boron\nTotal Maximum Daily Loads [156]. Solutions for addressing\
    \ salinity in the Central Valley\nwater require considering innovative salt management\
    \ strategies for both the short term\nand the long term to reach salt balance\
    \ and restoration of the impacted areas. In 2015,\nthe State Water Resources Control\
    \ Board adopted Resolution No. 2015–0010 to approve\nBasin Plan amendments and\
    \ to include the Salinity Variance Program, which applies to\nsurface water under\
    \ the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Salinity Variance Program follows\nwater quality\
    \ standards that include the following constituents: electrical conductivity,\n\
    total dissolved solids, chloride, sulfate and sodium [155]. Recognizing the challenges\
    \ of\nmanaging salinity in surface and ground waters, the Salt and Nitrate Management\
    \ Plan\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n20 of 31\n(SNMP) was implemented as part of the\
    \ Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term\nSustainability (CV-SALTS).\n\
    The long-term salinity management strategies recommended by the SNMP are divided\n\
    into three different phases, as described below.\n(i)\nPhase I focuses on developing\
    \ a prioritization and optimization study for salinity\nmanagement by using an\
    \ interim salinity approach.\n(ii)\nPhase II is related to environmental permits,\
    \ obtaining funding, engineering\nand design.\n(iii)\nPhase III consists of the\
    \ implementation of physical projects to manage salt in the\nlong term.\nThe interim\
    \ salinity permitting approach is recommended by the SNMP to be set\nin place\
    \ for 15 years. The interim salinity approach requires dischargers to participate\n\
    in the prioritization and optimization study. However, the dischargers opting\
    \ out of\nparticipating in the prioritization and optimization study would not\
    \ be eligible for obtaining\na variance under the Salinity Variance Program (https://www.cvsalinity.org\
    \ (accessed on\n29 August 2021)).\n8.4. Decision Support for Irrigation and Salinity\n\
    Although there are not currently any California IDSS that also factor salinity\
    \ manage-\nment, there are several decision tools available to manage salinity\
    \ in California. One of\nthe water quality regulation tools used throughout the\
    \ U.S. is the EPA-supported Total\nMaximum Daily Load (TMDL). The TMDL is a controlling\
    \ tool for allocating responsibility\nfor contamination in impaired waterbodies\
    \ by assessing the assimilative capacity of the\nwaterbody for the contaminant,\
    \ determining the mass loading from non-point and point\nsources, which contribute\
    \ to the pollution, and developing downstream water quality\nstrategies reducing\
    \ the excess of the pollutants in the waterbody. The implementation of\nthe TMDL\
    \ tool in the Central Valley of California has led to the development of decision\n\
    support system tools, such as the Watershed Management Risk Management Framework\n\
    (WARMF) and the San Joaquin River Real-Time Management (SJRRTM).\nThe Watershed\
    \ Management Risk Management Framework (WARMF) model is a de-\ncision support\
    \ system designed to guide stakeholders towards a comprehensive watershed\nmanagement\
    \ plan. The tool helps speciﬁcally to facilitate TMDL implementation at the\n\
    watershed level. The embedded model uses a mass balance approach for an extensive\
    \ suite\nof potential San Joaquin River pollutants, such as total dissolved solids\
    \ (measured as EC),\nsuspended solids, phosphates and nitrates. Models are also\
    \ used to simulate agricultural\nand wetland drainage return ﬂows and estimate\
    \ the salts buildups from shallow ground-\nwater. Components such as simulation\
    \ models, graphical software and GIS software are\nincorporated into a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) to easily visualize the model ﬂow and\nsalinity information.\
    \ The WARMF model contains hydrologic routing that is capable of\ncalculating\
    \ ﬂow and water quality at roughly one-mile intervals [156,167].\nThe SJRRTM is\
    \ a web-based salinity DSS that combines WARMF and assimilative salt\ncapacity\
    \ forecasts information to increase stakeholder awareness of the unique opportuni-\n\
    ties and measures to improve water quality resource management in the San Joaquin\
    \ River\nBasin. The decision support system was implemented using OpenNRM, an\
    \ open-source\nsoftware that systematically allows users to perform tasks such\
    \ as creating, modifying and\nmanaging data and web content. One of the speciﬁc\
    \ features of the SJRTM web portal has\nbeen the integration of WARMF model-generated\
    \ ﬂow with real-time SJR tributary ﬂow\nand EC data with salt load assimilative\
    \ capacity predictions [156].\nIn addition to decision support systems, various\
    \ models are widely used for salinity\nmanagement studies in the Central Valley.\
    \ Models such as Westside Agricultural Drainage\nEconomics (WADE) [168] and the\
    \ Agricultural Production Salinity Irrigation Drainage\nEconomics (APSIDE) [169]\
    \ are examples of policy models used in the Central Valley. The\nAPSIDE model\
    \ has the speciﬁcity of simulating the agricultural production and projected\n\
    income in response to irrigation water quality and drainage policy constraints\
    \ [169].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n21 of 31\n9. IDSS for Irrigation System Management\n\
    Under increasing water deﬁcit or drought conditions, distribution uniformity plays\
    \ a\ncritical factor in managing the available water efﬁciently while simultaneously\
    \ improving\nand maintaining the yield and quality of specialty crops [170,171].\
    \ Distribution uniformity\ncan be deﬁned as the even distribution or spread of\
    \ applied irrigation to avoid over- or\nunder-watering at speciﬁc locations across\
    \ the ﬁeld. Non-uniform distribution can not only\nreduce the yield, but it affects\
    \ the drainage, increases soil erosion risk through runoff, in-\ncreases nitrate\
    \ leaching and reduces the available nitrate content in the soil [172,173]. Under\n\
    California’s arid conditions, a reduced use of water and energy in the agricultural\
    \ sector is\nlargely dependent on efﬁcient DU. Although it is impossible to attain\
    \ 100% distribution\nuniformity, the goal is to maximize the uniform and efﬁcient\
    \ distribution of the applied\nirrigation water.\nApplication use efﬁciency is\
    \ the ratio of the amount of water lost through evapotran-\nspiration to the amount\
    \ of water applied for crop production [174]. The joint initiative of\nthe California\
    \ Department of Food and Agriculture and Department of Water Resources\nhas a\
    \ goal of decreasing 1200–1220 ML of agricultural water use per year through on-farm\n\
    efﬁciency improvements. The majority of California’s crops are now cultivated\
    \ using micro-\nirrigation systems, such as sprinkler, drip and subsurface drip\
    \ irrigation. The distribution\nuniformity for drip and subsurface drip irrigation\
    \ systems is determined by taking the\nratio of average ﬂow of the lowest quarter\
    \ of emitters to all emitters sampled [130,175].\nDecision support tools offer\
    \ the potential for site-speciﬁc irrigation management,\nwhich optimizes distribution\
    \ uniformity by delineating the ﬁelds into management\nzones [176,177]. The UCANR’s\
    \ Bilingual Emission Uniformity Calculator uses a bilin-\ngual (English and Spanish)\
    \ interface with an Excel spreadsheet model to help growers\ncalculate distribution\
    \ uniformity based on emitter discharge measurements [178]. Using\nwireless sensor\
    \ networks (soil and crop canopy-based), irrigation automation and telemet-\n\
    ric control through mobile or cloud-based applications allows the growers to efﬁciently\n\
    increase the distribution uniformity based on real-time data. Growers can use\
    \ automation\nequipment to avoid over- or under-watering with remote access [179,180].\
    \ In California,\nmany nut growers in the state are using an alternative method\
    \ of determining transpira-\ntion uniformity rather than using distribution uniformity\
    \ [181]. Transpiration uniformity\ndescribes the uniform loss of water from the\
    \ ﬁeld, in contrast to DU, which deﬁnes the\nspread across the ﬁeld. Because transpiration\
    \ is an indicator of plant metabolism, it can\nalso be affected by nutrients,\
    \ pests or soil heterogeneity, which would not be related to the\nuniformity of\
    \ an application. Remote-sensing IDSS are useful in evaluating the distribution\n\
    uniformity based on thermal and NDVI maps generated using multispectral imagery.\
    \ In\nCalifornia, Ceres Imaging is widely used by orchard and vegetable growers\
    \ to identify the\nwater stress due to uneven distribution uniformity based on\
    \ colorized NDVI and thermal\nmaps, as shown in Figure 3. The identiﬁcation of\

    and growers (Figure 4). In the cyclical process of innovation–validation–adoption,\

    \ secure and cohesive\napproach [179]. This user feedback is pivotal for implementing\
    \ and improving new IDSS\ntechnologies [184]. The primary focus of the advisory\
    \ group members is to assist in shaping\nthe process of research that can simplify\
    \ the later steps for adoption [185,186].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n23 of 31\n\

    Ideally, IDSS should be assessed for data accuracy, linearity, precision, response\

    \ and predict the Kc values. Different\ncomplexity may be required for different\

    \ can be assessed by user interview or survey that generally\nfocuses on: (a)\
    \ graphic interface features, (b) graphic interface ease of use, (c) ﬁeld placement\n\

    \ systems (IDSS) may greatly beneﬁt the >400 crops grown\nthroughout the State\
    \ of California to support diverse challenges, including drought, en-\nergy, nitrogen\
    \ and salinity management. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of\nexisting\
    \ IDSS available to California growers, their underlying science, incentive policies\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n24 of 31\nand anticipated outcomes. Effective energy,\
    \ water, nitrogen and salinity management in\nCalifornia under regulatory policies,\
    \ such as the Sustainable Groundwater Management\nAct, require the integration\
    \ of different strategies to improve precision irrigation schedul-\ning, uniform\
    \ water and nutrient application, and the soil–plant–water monitoring. In\naddition\
    \ to water management, these policies also aim to manage groundwater and require\n\
    the record keeping of water use, nitrogen (N) leaching, salinity management and\
    \ energy\nconsumption. Most of the irrigation decision support tools used in California\
    \ are based on\nfewer components of the water budget, and none of the available\
    \ IDSS provide estimation\nof all parameters together. For example, soil-based\
    \ IDSS consider soil water potential or\nvolumetric water content, while crop\
    \ canopy IDSS are based on crop evapotranspiration.\nThese IDSS can potentially\
    \ be used in combination to obtain the overall inﬂow and outﬂow\nof water to and\
    \ from the soil–plant–atmospheric continuum of the crops. However, het-\nerogeneity\
    \ in agronomic and ﬁeld soils can lead to poor management practices at certain\n\
    locations in agricultural ﬁelds. Remote sensing IDSS are useful in determining\
    \ the spatial\nscale information based on spectral data, but the interpretation\
    \ of multispectral/thermal\nimagery is complicated and difﬁcult for growers to\
    \ base decisions for water, nutrient and\nsalinity hotspots. In a nutshell, there\
    \ has been an identiﬁable need for the co-management\nof irrigation decision support,\
    \ nitrogen and salinity management and energy efﬁciency.\nThe integration of IDSS\
    \ for nexus beneﬁts is a cyclical process of innovation by service\nproviders/researchers,\
    \ validation by extension research professionals and adoption by\ngrowers. Therefore,\
    \ for a widescale adoption of these tools, the synergetic evaluation of\npoint-based\
    \ and spatial IDSS needs to be studied and validated on different scales (farm\n\
    to county). Not only is the information presentation and availability important;\
    \ the inte-\ngration within the farm management hierarchy is equally signiﬁcant.\
    \ The recommended\ninformation on water, nitrogen, salts and energy management\
    \ must be clearly and simply\ntransmitted to and from farm managers to individual\
    \ irrigators.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.J., R.S. and M.A.N.;\

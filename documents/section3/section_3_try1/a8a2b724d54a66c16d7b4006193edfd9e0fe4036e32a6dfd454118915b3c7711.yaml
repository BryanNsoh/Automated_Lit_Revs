    Security 1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) enables physical items to
    connect and exchange data with other devices and systems using sensors, software,
    and other technologies over the Internet [1,2]. IoT allows items to sense, think,
    interact, and learn from each other, creating new possibilities for services in
    various domains, such as smart homes [3], smart healthcare systems [4], [5], [6],
    [7], industrial automation [8], intelligent transportation [9], resource management
    [10], energy management [11], smart cities [12], and cybersecurity [13]. Moreover,
    IoT offers numerous services such as storing, computation, and communication that
    leverage emerging technologies [14]. These developments expand the variety and
    volume of data derived from these IoT applications and form a large and complex
    problem space that poses many challenges to handling these data and finding accurate
    solutions in recent years. According to Google Trends, scientists and researchers
    frequently investigate and propose various methods to address IoT challenges and
    deliver effective solutions for different objectives and applications. Fig. 1
    illustrates the popularity of the IoT topic from 2004 to the end of 2023. Fig.
    2(a) shows the worldwide search interests in the IoT topic ranging from grey to
    blue, in which the grey color indicates no data available or interest in IoT.
    The blue color ranges from high to low search interests, with darker shades representing
    higher search interests and lighter shades indicating lower search interests in
    IoT. In addition, Fig. 2(b) shows regions with the most search interests in the
    IoT topic based on data extracted from Google Trends. Download : Download high-res

    the IoT topic. Although IoT networks have become ubiquitous to different extents,
    such as smart cities, healthcare, farming, and manufacturing applications [15],
    [16], [17], they still face significant security challenges that need to protect
    the network of connected devices, such as sensors, cameras, and vehicles, from
    cyberattacks [18,19]. Therefore, security solutions such as implementing strong
    authentication and authorization, encrypting data and communications, and securing
    communications protocols and channels are needed to ensure IoT networks [20],
    [21], [22], [23]. The prevailing research indicates that IoT requires a powerful
    paradigm to explore the complex search space efficiently and extract valuable
    insights for enhancing efficiency, competitiveness, productivity, decision-making,
    and quality of life in IoT-based applications [24,25]. IoT problems pose challenges
    such as large and dynamic search spaces [26], multiple objectives and constraints
    [27], uncertainty and noise [28], high computational complexity [29], and high
    dimensionality [30], [31], [32]. The adaptability and robustness of metaheuristic
    algorithms make them a successful paradigm for coping with such challenges of
    IoT problems and searching for near-optimal solutions in a sensible time [33].
    There are five main groups of metaheuristic algorithms [34]: evolutionary-based,
    which simulates the biological evolution and genetic variation processes [35],
    [36], [37]; mathematical and physic-based, which performs mathematical concepts
    and physical laws [38,39]; human-based, which imitates human intelligence, creativity,
    and social activities [40,41]; and swarm-based, which mimics the collective behavior
    of insects [41], [42], [43], [44], terrestrial animals [45], [46], [47], aquatic
    animals [48,49], and birds [50], [51], [52], [53]. Although these algorithms effectively
    solve optimization problems [41,[54], [55], [56]], they have weaknesses, such
    as low population diversity and imbalance issues [57], [58], [59], [60]. Hence,
    they are often enhanced by hybridizing with other algorithms [61], [62], [63],
    [64], [65], improving their search strategies [66,67], adapting their parameters
    and oerators [66,68,69], and using archive mechanisms [70]. Uniyal et al. [71]
    reviewed and mathematically evaluated the nature-inspired optimization methods
    that developed over time and were inspired by natural phenomena. Moreover, Kumar
    et al. [72] presented a comprehensive overview of the widely used and studied
    metaheuristic optimization methods and nature-inspired algorithms. Among them,
    swarm-based optimization categories are adopted or improved to solve the challenging
    issues in IoT-based applications [24,73,74]. Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) [45] is
    a prominent technique based on swarm intelligence that formulated the social construction
    of grey wolves to search the solution space. The GWO has a simple form and few
    control parameters, making it a candidate for solving various optimization problems
    and has attracted much attention from researchers [75]. GWO is widely applied
    to system reliability optimization [76], especially for nuclear power plant safety
    systems [77] and life support systems in space capsules [78]. Fig. 3 shows the
    distribution of GWO citations per year over time, revealing a remarkable growth
    curve from 144 in 2015 to 3425 in 2023. This exponential increase in citations
    indicates the increasing popularity of the algorithm and its great importance
    in solving various optimization problems. Accordingly, as Fig. 3 shows, in the
    same fashion, applying GWO in different IoT applications [79], [80], [81], [82]
    has increased since its introduction. Download : Download high-res image (154KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The annual citation count of GWO.
    GWO is implemented in the smart home application to optimize the energy consumption
    for thermostats, lighting, and security systems [83]. GWO is successfully used
    for path planning in the smart city application to determine the optimal path
    for unmanned delivery robots by considering the distance, traffic, and obstacles
    [84,85]. Moreover, GWO in IoT healthcare applications used as IoT-enabled healthcare
    monitoring devices to diagnose disease at an early stage [86], [87], [88], IoT-based
    healthcare devices to optimize the design and performance of wearable sensors
    [86,89], and healthcare transformation to improve the efficiency, quality, accessibility,
    and affordability of healthcare service [90]. Sharma et al. [91] investigated
    how artificial intelligence, blockchain, and IoT can improve smart healthcare
    and telemedicine systems. They also address security and privacy issues, electronic
    health record storage, service quality and safety, and intelligent healthcare
    and telemedicine cloud computing platforms. GWO in agriculture IoT applications
    are used for autonomous robot path planning to find optimal paths by considering
    the distance, obstacles, and crop yield [85], smart irrigation to optimize the
    water distribution and fertilizer [92], and crop disease detection to analyze
    the images from drones and IoT-enabled sensors to diagnose crop diseases [93].
    GWO in manufacturing IoT applications applied for task scheduling to schedule
    the tasks by considering the processing time, date, and resource availability
    [94], resource allocation to assign the resources by evaluating the demand, cost,
    and quality [95], and machine control to control the machines by considering the
    energy consumption [96], performance [97], and maintenance [98]. These applications
    reveal that GWO can offer a reasonable convergence rate, accuracy, and robustness
    for IoT problems with large-scale data, high-dimensional features, and complex
    objectives. However, GWO still suffers drawbacks such as poor search strategies,
    low population diversity, and early convergence in these applications [99], [100],
    [101]. These deficiencies motivate researchers to enhance GWO by improving it
    with novel methods or search strategies, hybridizing it with other optimizers,
    and adapting its control parameters [83,[102], [103], [104]]. Some possible ways
    to improve GWO using the most well-known methods such as quantum computing [105],
    [106], [107], chaotic maps [108], [109], [110], Lévy flight [111], [112], [113],
    fuzzy hierarchical operator [114], and opposition-based learning [115], [116],
    [117], [118]. GWO can also be integrated with other optimizers such as particle
    swarm optimization motivated by the collective motion of particles [119], [120],
    [121], ant colony optimization inspired by ants [122,123], genetic algorithm [124,125],
    sine cosine algorithm [126], [127], [128], harmony search algorithm [129,130],
    or invasive weed optimization [131] that can balance its strengths and weaknesses
    and improve its convergence speed and solution diversity [132], [133], [134].
    Moreover, GWO can be affected by its control parameters, such as A, a, r1, r2,
    and C, or the population size that can influence its performance and robustness
    and need proper tuning or adaptation [135], [136], [137]. As shown above, GWOs,
    including the canonical GWO, its variants, and its improvements and hybrids, impact
    growing IoT development which is the main reason to devote this study to systematically
    reviewing applying GWOs in different IoT applications. This systematic paper follows
    the modified PRISMA guidelines [138] for conducting and reporting systematic reviews
    and meta-analyses. It consists of three primary stages: identification, evaluation,
    and reporting. The first phase defines the target search problems based on suitable
    keywords and alternative synonyms, and then 693 papers from January 2014 to the
    end of 2023 are extracted from diverse databases. The evaluation phase employs
    the Rayyan tool [139] and consists of three screening steps to select eligible
    papers. The first step filters out 421 high-quality papers by eliminating duplicates
    and papers from non-scholarly or low-quality journals. The screening phase checks
    the scope of the reputable papers and extracts 101 related papers by reading their
    titles and abstracts. Then, the third screening step extracts 50 eligible papers
    by full-text reading and inclusion criteria defined in this study. Finally, in
    the reporting phase, we carefully study the 50 eligible papers to review and explain
    critical themes related to applying GWOs in different IoT applications. In addition,
    we suggest some future research directions in the conclusion section. 2. The canonical
    grey wolf optimizer (GWO) Wolves typically form groups of 5–12 individuals. They
    are top predators with a rigid social order of alpha, beta, omega, and gamma ranks.
    The alpha makes most of the decisions for the pack, such as hunting, sleeping,
    waking, etc. The beta is the deputy leader and helps the grey wolf alpha make
    decisions and lead the pack activities while overseeing the subordinate wolves.
    The omega is the bottom-ranked wolf and must obey all the other higher-ranking
    wolves. The delta is the lowest level in the order and follows the alphas and
    betas but dominates the omega. This behavior motivated Mirjalili et al. [45] to
    propose a grey wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) to find the best answer for continuous
    and engineering optimization problems. Fig. 4 shows how the wolves’ population
    changes its location. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download : Download

    The best solution is the alpha, which is indicated with α; the following two best
    solutions are beta, which is specified with β and delta δ, and the rest are omega,
    which is marked with ω. The social hierarchy mechanism is based on these ranks.
    2.2. Encircling prey mechanism The encircling prey mechanism of grey wolves during
    their hunting behavior is mathematically modeled in Eq. (1), where is the current
    position and is the next position of the ith grey wolf, the prey position shown
    with , and is the coefficient is computed using Eq. (2) and vector distance is
    calculated using Eq. (3). (1) (2) (3) (4) Vector in Eq. (2) linearly reduces in
    the range 2 to 0, and the vector is a random value from 0 to 1. in Eq. (3) is
    obtained using Eq. (4) and is random values between intervals 0–1. 2.3. Hunting
    mechanism The hunting mechanism modeled grey wolves'' locating and surrounding
    behavior when chasing their target. The alpha often guides the hunt, and the beta
    and delta wolves sometimes participate in the hunt. Thus, the omega wolves are
    forced to change their locations according to the location of the best search
    agents, which are the first three best solutions kept so far. Eq. (5) illustrates
    the hunting mechanism where position vectors and are computed using Eqs. (6)–(8)
    respectively. (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) In Eqs. (6)–(8), , , and denoted the
    three best positions obtained in tth iteration t. Parameters , , and are calculated
    through Eq. (2), and distance vectors , , and are computed using Eqs. (9)–(11).
    , , and denoted in Eqs. (9)–(11) are obtained by Eq. (4). 2.4. Attacking prey
    mechanism (Exploitation strategy) The attacking prey mechanism intensifies the
    exploitation ability by attacking the prey by setting the values of vectors ,
    , and . When |A| is less than one, the wolves are compelled to chase the prey,
    and the wolves'' next location can be anywhere between their present location
    and the prey''s location. 2.5. Searching for prey mechanism (Exploration strategy)
    The wolves separate to rummage around for prey and merge to assault prey, utilizing
    the looking-for-prey component. The values of parameters , , and with greater
    than one or smaller than −1, the wolves scatter away from the prey. When |A| >
    1 powers the wolves to wander from the prey to ideally discover a fitter prey.
    Furthermore, coefficient C generates random numbers for exploration not only in
    the initial emphasis but also in the final cycles. The flowchart of the GWO algorithm
    is shown in Fig. 5, where the grey wolves'' position is reorganized by two main
    steps: initialization and optimization process. The GWO algorithm starts by randomly
    placing N wolves in the look space and calculating their fitness values in the
    initialization step. Then, the optimization process is begun through predefined
    iterations. In each iteration, first, the control parameters'' initial values
    are calculated by Eqs. (2) and (4). Next, the locations of the top three wolves
    (Xα, Xβ, and Xδ) are identified. Then, Eqs. (6)–(8) are used to compute the new
    values for vectors X1 (t), X2 (t), and X3 (t), and Eqs. (9)–(11) are used to compute
    Dα (t), Dβ (t), and Dδ (t). Next, Eq. (5) is used to update the location of each
    wolf X (t), the new wolf positions'' fitness value is calculated, and a new place
    is chosen between the current and the new ones by a greedy selection. The iterations
    continue until the iteration limit is reached. These iterations are repeated until
    the maximum number of iterations is satisfied. Ultimately, the wolf with the highest
    fitness value is the optimal or near-optimal solution the algorithm can find.

    Fig. 5. The flowchart of the GWO. 3. Prior studies on applying metaheuristic algorithms
    in IoT applications The IoT has grown tremendously with the increasing integration
    of interconnected smart devices and sensors across numerous applications. Extensive
    research has been conducted to explore the capabilities and address the challenges
    associated with IoT technology. Given the immense scale and ongoing enhancements
    in IoT advancements, it is critical to systematically review the different techniques
    proposed for solving the various challenges in this domain. Therefore, several
    review studies have been published to assess the state of the art. These review
    studies are vital in identifying trends, applications, research gaps, and guidance
    for future work. Shan and Yaqoob [140] provided a comprehensive IoT overview covering
    protocols, technologies, applications, and related issues. It emphasizes the integration
    of various technologies to enable autonomous applications and discusses the development
    of IoT in terms of Internet, smartphone, and machine-to-machine technologies.
    The paper explores IoT architecture, technical aspects, and its relationship with
    emerging technologies. Laghari et al. [141] explored the utilization of IoT technologies
    in cloud and fog computing, along with their applications and security aspects.
    They focused on the design and development of IoT architecture, incorporating
    sensors in the context of 6G. Additionally, they delve into the existing research,
    propose solutions, and highlight open issues for future investigation in IoT.
    The emergence of diverse applications across various domains has brought forth
    numerous security concerns, including protecting devices and networks, addressing
    security threats in IoT networks, and efficiently managing resource-limited IoT
    networks. Several security solutions, such as web application protectors and intrusion
    detection systems (IDS), have been proposed to address the IoT scalability and
    security challenges. Thakkar and Lohiya [142] conducted a survey of IDS for IoT,
    covering the literature from 2015 to 2019. They examined different strategies
    for placing IDS within the IoT architecture and analyzed various intrusion detection
    techniques, including deep learning algorithms and machine learning. Additionally,
    their paper addresses security concerns and challenges specific to IoT networks.
    Furthermore, the integration of metaheuristic algorithms in IoT has gained significant
    attention. Metaheuristic algorithms offer powerful optimization techniques for
    solving complex problems in IoT applications. These algorithms have shown remarkable
    capabilities in addressing challenges such as network optimization, resource allocation,
    energy efficiency, and routing in IoT systems. As a result, numerous review papers
    have explored the integration of metaheuristic algorithms in the IoT domain. These
    papers focus on applying metaheuristic algorithms to tackle the unique challenges
    posed by IoT, providing comprehensive analyses of their effectiveness and limitations.
    By highlighting the advancements and methodologies employed in these studies,
    these review papers offer invaluable insights into the prospective advantages
    and upcoming trajectories of leveraging metaheuristic algorithms in the IoT landscape.
    Zedadra et al. [143] investigated the technical components of swarm intelligence
    algorithms (SI) and their potential application in IoT-based systems. It begins
    by examining existing SI algorithms and their primary applications. Subsequently,
    it investigates IoT-based systems that utilize SI algorithms. Finally, the study
    discusses emerging trends that bridge the gap between SI and IoT-based systems.
    Sun et al. [144] presented a comprehensive review of SI algorithms and their applications
    in the IoT. It explored SI-enabled applications in wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    and discussed research challenges in that domain. Additionally, the paper explored
    SI applications in other areas of the IoT, such as UAV-aided wireless networks.
    It compared various SI-based algorithms for selecting cluster head routing protocols
    in WSN applications, summarizing their validation platforms, parameter selection,
    advantages, and limitations. They also surveyed other state-of-the-art SI algorithms
    in IoT applications and provided insights into potential future development directions.
    Sharma et al. [24] systematically reviewed metaheuristic algorithms employed in
    IoT applications. It classified existing metaheuristic algorithms and highlighted
    their applications in IoT systems. Their paper also presented current research
    questions to inspire further exploration and discussed emerging trends in IoT,
    offering potential future directions. Abualigah et al. [145] conducted a thorough
    review of SI algorithms and their use in solving the main problems of the IoT.
    SI algorithms, which emulate the hunting behavior of agent communities, demonstrate
    desirable qualities such as flexibility, resilience, dissemination, and scalability,
    making them well-suited for IoT requirements. Their paper provided an overview
    of SI-based algorithms employed in the IoT domain to tackle its key challenges.
    The methods are classified based on the specific SI algorithm used, namely bee
    colony optimization (ABC), ant colony optimization (ACO), and particle swarm optimization
    (PSO). These algorithms were examined about three primary concerns within the
    IoT landscape: routing protocols and selection of cluster heads, power management,
    and data management. 4. Methodology of systematic review We explain in this section
    the methodology of our systematic review to select the eligible papers in which
    GWOs, including the canonical GWO, its variants, improvements, and hybrids, were
    applied in different IoT applications. We follow the adopted PRISMA methodology
    [138] for systematic reviews and meta-analyses to choose an eligible set of papers
    for full-text reading within three main phases: identification, evaluation, and
    reporting. The systematic review''s methodology and details are presented in Table
    1. Table 1. The adapted methodology and its details used in the systematic review.
    4.1. Identification phase This phase has two steps. First, we define the final
    search problems based on suitable queries, and next, we extract the related documents
    from different databases. The target search problems are determined based on keywords
    and alternative synonyms, including \" GWO and IoT, GWO and Internet of things,
    Grey Wolf and IoT, Grey Wolf and Internet of things.\" From 2014, the introduction
    of GWO, to the end of 2023, these keywords were used to search the Google Scholar
    database, resulting in 693 documents. Fig. 6 shows the variety and distribution
    of documents identified in this phase based on different publications, such as
    journals, books, and dissertations. Most of the publications are journal articles
    (421 papers, 60 %), followed by conference and symposium papers (106 papers, 15
    %) and disreputable documents (151 papers, 22 %). Only a few publications are
    books and book chapters (11 papers, 2 %) and dissertations (four papers, about
    1 %). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. The variety of identified documents. 4.2. Evaluation phase This
    phase consists of three screening steps. First, duplicates and non-academic documents
    published by conferences, non-Scopus indexed journals, books, and dissertations
    are removed from the 693 papers, leaving 421 reputable papers. Second, the title
    and abstract of these reputable papers are scanned to investigate their scope
    and select only those that have applied GWOs in different IoT applications, resulting
    in 101 related papers. The third step is to examine and study the full text of
    these 101 related papers, and those that meet the following inclusion criteria
    are selected for analysis, resulting in 46 papers. C1. Papers published from 2014
    to the end of 2023. C2. Papers written in English languages C3. Papers from credible
    journals. C4. Papers are attentive to applying GWOs in IoT applications as the
    study scope. Finally, the references of 46 papers are investigated based on inclusion
    criteria to find more eligible articles, resulting in a final set of 50 GWOs in
    IoT applications. 4.3. Reporting phase In this phase, we use Rayyan to select
    50 papers that meet the criteria [139] and are first classified by seven publishers:
    Elsevier (15), Springer (13), WILEY (5), Taylor & Francis (2), IEEE (11), MDPI
    (3), and Hindawi (1). Then, the eligible papers are qualitatively analyzed and
    reviewed into four main categories: IoT development, commercial IoT, consumer
    IoT, and industrial IoT. 5. Different types of the Internet of Things The IoT
    describes a vast network of physical devices equipped with sensors, software,
    and internet connectivity [146]. The IoT development class includes contributions
    such as reducing power consumption, optimal positioning, finding the optimal path,
    enhancing load balancing, and resource allocation. Considering the generic IoT
    architecture shown in Fig. 7 [147], IoT development extends and makes IoT more
    applicable, mostly in sensing, network, and data processing layers. Commercial
    IoT, consumer IoT, and industrial IoT classes are applied in the application layer.
    The commercial IoT class includes usages in the healthcare and transport industries,
    such as smart pacemakers and monitoring systems. The consumer IoT class uses every
    day such as home appliances, voice assistance, and light fixtures. Commercial
    IoT mainly supports industrial applications in manufacturing and energy, such
    as digital control systems, smart agriculture, and industrial big data [146,148].

    benefits, it also poses challenges that must be tackled to achieve optimal performance.
    Evaluating IoT platforms with multiple considerations can be formulated as a multi-criteria
    decision-making problem [149]; since it has various preferences and criteria,
    different techniques exist to evaluate IoT platforms [150]. The commercial IoT
    class has challenges such as improving data transmission, diagnosing IoT wearable
    medical devices, and monitoring patients. Key challenges in the consumer IoT class
    include energy consumption reduction, smart device scheduling, and service quality
    enhancement. Industrial IoT networks face issues like optimal sensor placement,
    efficient data analytics, and minimizing network latency [148]. Furthermore, several
    problems arise in developing IoT networks, such as finding optimal routing paths,
    clustering devices, placing sensors, and allocating resources [151,152]. Traditional
    optimization techniques are often insufficient to handle the complexity and scale
    of large IoT networks, and metaheuristic algorithms have proven that they are
    powerful in searching for global optima in complex systems [153]. These algorithms
    can provide significant advantages over traditional optimization algorithms, particularly
    in cases where the search space is high-dimensional or non-linear. By applying
    metaheuristic algorithms, IoT networks can be optimized to function more efficiently
    and effectively. This adaptation can result in significant cost savings, improved
    performance, and increased network reliability. As such, the use of metaheuristic
    algorithms in IoT networks is rapidly gaining popularity, and these techniques
    will likely continue to play a critical role in developing next-generation IoT
    systems [33]. Metaheuristic algorithms with effective mechanisms can enable them
    to find near-optimal solutions for complex and large-scale problems in a reasonable
    time [154], [155], [156], [157]. They can effortlessly adapt to problems with
    low computational complexity [158], [159], [160], [161]. They are valuable for
    IoT applications such as routing, clustering, and data analysis. They optimize
    the data transmission paths among IoT devices, considering factors like energy
    consumption, latency, reliability, and security. They improve the network''s scalability,
    efficiency, and performance by clustering IoT devices based on proximity, similarity,
    or functionality. Metaheuristic algorithms can process and analyze the massive
    amount of data generated by IoT devices, such as sensor readings, images, or videos,
    using techniques like feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, or classification.
    The grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a prominent metaheuristic algorithm with high
    performance and robustness in solving various optimization problems. GWO is a
    simple and powerful metaheuristic algorithm for solving IoT optimization problems,
    such as resource allocation, energy efficiency, network routing, sensor placement,
    security, and fault detection [96,99]. GWO offers a powerful tool to improve the
    security of IoT, contributing to the reliability and resilience of smart cities
    and other IoT-enabled applications [97,162]. The GWO can detect and mitigate potential
    vulnerabilities, identify anomalous behavior, and proactively respond to emerging
    threats within IoT networks. Fig. 9 visualizes the key challenges faced in the
    realm of IoT. The GWO is a viable solution for addressing these challenges. By
    leveraging GWO, IoT applications can optimize resource allocation, enhance energy
    efficiency, improve network routing and traffic flow, optimize sensor placement,
    strengthen security measures, and facilitate fault detection. The following sections

    gravitational GWO, sending data through multiple paths in IoT applications. The
    fractional gravitational search algorithm selects the cluster heads, and the FGGWO
    algorithm creates many directions from the origin to the end. The experimental
    results indicate that the fractional gravitational search algorithm and FGGWO
    perform better than some contender algorithms. Aziz et al. [164] put forward a
    highly effective multi-hop cluster-based aggregation scheme, which employs hybrid
    compressive sensing (EMCA-CS) to carry out data gathering in IoT-based heterogeneous
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The introduction of EMCA-CS significantly prolongs
    the network''s lifespan and diminishes the reconstruction error by integrating
    compressive sensing and routing protocols. EMCA-CS leverages the GWO algorithm
    to approximate the most optimal route for the cluster head and base station. Furthermore,
    the paper proposes utilizing the GWO algorithm for compressive sensing matrix
    optimization to find the matrix with the minimum error. Haddadpajouh et al. [100]
    announced a multi-kernel support vector machine employing the GWO to detect malware
    in IoT cloud-edge gateways. The GWO algorithm identifies the most suitable characteristics
    distinguishing malicious and benign applications, subsequently assessing these
    extracted features through a multi-kernel SVM classifier. The performance of the
    multi-kernel SVM classifier surpassed that of the compared classifiers in terms
    of accuracy and computational expense. Davahli et al. [165] employed a fusion
    of genetic algorithm and grey wolf optimizer (GA–GWO) to fabricate a sophisticated
    and efficient intrusion detection system tailored explicitly for wireless networks
    in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. The GA–GWO algorithm selects informative
    traffic features to reduce the dimensionality of the extensive wireless network
    traffic by choosing traffic features that provide valuable information. Shorman
    et al. [97] presented an unsupervised evolutionary technique for detecting IoT
    botnet attacks from compromised IoT devices. This approach implements a GWO to
    fine-tune the hyperparameters of the one-class support vector machine and identify
    the most compelling features for characterizing the IoT botnet issue. Chouhan
    et al. [166] suggested TSGWO, a tunicate swarm GWO, for multi-path routing in
    WSNs with IoT support. TSGWO performs the multi-path routing process, where the
    shortest path is chosen as the best one. Jeniffer et al. [167] suggested OHGHE,
    an optimal homomorphic scheme with hybrid heat transfer search and GWO. OHGHE
    chooses an optimal key with the largest key-breaking size to encrypt sensitive
    data and fix the existing flaws. The OHGHE scheme uses an adaptive convolutional
    kernel-based artificial neural network with Aquila algorithm optimization to sort
    IoT data into sensitive and non-sensitive. The results indicate that OHGHE can
    achieve longer key-breaking time, faster encryption/decryption time, and less
    memory for encryption and decryption. Ojha et al. [168] suggested an intelligent
    data routing method for WSNs with multi-objective GWO to avoid early network failure
    and improve lifetime performance. This mechanism divides the entire network into
    clusters of the most suitable sizes and subsequently determines the most optimal
    rendezvous points. The mobile sink effectively acquires data from sensor nodes
    through the ideal route to each rendezvous point. This mechanism could improve
    the network performance and prevent premature death than the compared algorithms.
    Dev et al. [169] introduced an overtaker-assisted wolf update (OA-WU) as a clustering
    technique by hybridizing a rider optimization algorithm and GWO to enhance lifetime
    in IoT by selecting the optimal radius for the cluster head. The findings of their
    study reveal that the implementation of OA-WU resulted in notable improvements
    in energy preservation and convergence rate within a short period. Pingale et
    al. [170] introduced a routing protocol for IoT networks based on a hybrid optimization
    algorithm called SFG, which combines sunflower and grey wolf optimization techniques.
    The protocol starts by simulating the IoT network and creating multiple paths
    for routing. Then, it uses the SFG algorithm to choose the optimal way, considering
    various criteria such as delay, energy, throughput, and network lifetime. The
    experimental results demonstrated that the SFG algorithm performed better than
    some existing methods on these metrics. Jena et al. [171] formulated a synchronized
    cyber-physical assault within an IoT-enabled intelligent power network, accounting
    for the constraints on intruder reachability. This predicament was subsequently
    addressed by employing a binary GWO algorithm. The findings presented in this
    study, pertain to the IEEE 14, 30, and 57 bus benchmark power systems demonstrate
    the efficacy of disrupting the state estimation process by optimizing attack cost.
    Keserwani et al. [83] introduced a well-balanced model for intrusion detection,
    namely the GWO-PSO-RF IDS model, which serves as an intelligent algorithm for
    identifying different attacks in IoT networks through the utilization of GWO,
    particle swarm optimization, and a random forest model. The balanced GWO-PSO-RF
    IDS model incorporates a hybrid approach involving GWO and PSO to extract pertinent
    features from IoT networks. Then, the RF model classifies the extracted features
    to detect attacks. According to the experimental results, this model outperformed
    the other algorithms in solving the biasing problem and enhancing the detection
    of less frequent types of attacks. Xu et al. [172] developed a new method for
    estimating the outage probability of IoT networks on mobile devices using a hybrid
    technique called IGWO-Elman. This technique combines an enhanced version of the
    grey wolf optimizer with an Elman neural network. The IGWO employs a modified
    strategy to generate and diversify the initial population of wolves. Then, IGWO
    optimizes the hyperparameters of the Elman neural network. Jaiswal et al. [173]
    applied the GWO algorithm to the node deployment problem to achieve high-quality
    service metrics, such as coverage, connectivity, and network cost. The GWO algorithm
    finds the best locations for sensor nodes in different scenarios, satisfying the
    required coverage and connectivity. Salimian et al. [174] introduced an autonomousIoT
    service placement methodology utilizing the GWO algorithm for deploying IoT applications
    on fog nodes. The findings indicate that this algorithm surpasses competing algorithms
    in achieving a near-optimal deployment of applications on fog nodes. Sarma [175]
    proposed the FAE–GWO–DBN algorithm to identify and detect attacks within the Internet
    of Things context. The FAE–GWO–DBN algorithm optimized the deep belief network''s
    (DBN) hyperparameters by combining Firefly algorithm and GWO to attain satisfactory
    performance when determining the presence of attacks. Agrawal et al. [176] developed
    a new security-enhancing technique for IoT sensor nodes using a hybrid optimization
    algorithm called PSO-GWO, which combines binary particle swarm optimization and
    GWO. The algorithm uses random forest to initialize the population of particles
    and wolves intelligently. Besides, they introduced a new fitness function and
    performance metric. Liu et al. [177] developed a novel clustering method for industrial
    WSNs based on a hybrid optimization technique called QEGWO, which combines quantum
    and GWO. The process enhances the clustering quality of IWSNs by finding the optimal
    cluster configuration, as shown in Fig. 10 [177]. It also uses a new evaluation
    function considering the node energy, cluster distance, and base station distance.
    The method employs a new quantum elite operator to increase the global search
    ability. This operator keeps a quantum probability matrix for each individual
    and updates it with quantum gates during the evolutionary process of the algorithm.

    Fig. 10. Schematic diagram of the QEGWO [177]. Alazab [178] developed a method
    for detecting IoT botnet attacks using a discrete time-varying grey wolf hybrid
    technique. This technique uses a time-dependent function to transform continuous
    spaces into discrete ones. Gupta et al. [179] proposed an enhanced deep reinforcement
    learning model, GMFA-DRL, to improve fog-IoT load-balancing. GMFA-DRL applies
    the GWO and modified moth flame optimization to boost the effectiveness of deep
    reinforcement learning. According to the experimental results, the GMFA-DRL model
    improved the load-balancing performance of the fog-IoT system, achieving better
    Throughput, energy consumption, Latency, and Makespan than other methods. Xu et
    al. [180] proposed a method for reducing energy consumption in IoT networks on
    mobile devices using a hybrid technique called transmit antenna selection and
    amplify-and-forward relaying. In this schema, the exact expressions are first
    derived, and the performance of physical layer security is analyzed. The improved
    grey wolf optimizer (IGWO) algorithm extracts the allocation parameter. Reported
    results indicate that the IGWO obtains better optimization performance than compared
    algorithms regarding precision and convergence speed. Bedi et al. [181] developed
    a method for cluster head selection in wireless body area networks using a hybrid
    technique called MGWOQL, which combines a modified version of the GWO and Q learning.
    The method aims to reduce the energy consumption of clusters by finding the best
    cluster head node. The results show that the MGWOQL can successfully deploy the
    wireless body area networks, resulting in better residual energy, network longevity,
    and path damage. Tong et al. [182] developed a network architecture that combines
    mobile edge computing and satellite-terrestrial integration to support IoT devices
    in performing computation tasks. The paper also presented a novel scheme for inter-satellite
    cooperation, which optimizes task offloading and resource allocation decisions.
    This scheme involves a resource allocation algorithm that uses the Lagrange multiplier
    technique and a task-offloading decision method that uses the GWO. Verma et al.
    [183] developed a clustering method for IoT applications based on a hybrid technique
    called GWO and fuzzy logic, improving wireless sensor networks'' energy efficiency.
    The algorithm uses the GWO to form clusters and a fuzzy inference system to choose
    the cluster heads. The experimental results demonstrated that the protocol significantly
    improved energy efficiency and network lifetime. Seyyedabbasi et al. [184] proposed
    energy-efficient routing methods based on expanded and incremental GWO to find
    optimal paths and data transmission with a minimum cost between the nodes. The
    methods find the best paths and data transfer between nodes, reducing costs. They
    also improve the network quality and lifetime by calculating the best coefficients
    for different factors, such as energy, traffic, distance, buffer, and hop. Dey
    et al. [185] developed a new method for identifying and preventing cyberattacks
    in IoT networks using an intelligent framework for threat detection. This framework
    uses grey wolf optimizer and binary gravitational search algorithms to find the
    best features and apply the decision tree, AdaBoost, and random forests to classify
    threats. Manokaran et al. [186] presented an improved anomaly detection model
    for IoT edge scenarios using the optimized stacked ensemble learning algorithm.
    The paper uses the improved version of GWO to tune the parameters of the ensemble
    learning algorithms. The paper evaluated the model on different datasets and showed
    that it achieved high detection accuracy and generalizability. The paper also
    performed a chi-square statistical test to assess the suitability. To achieve
    efficient resource utilization in IoT networks, the key factors affecting the
    quality of service (QoS) must be determined [187]. By extracting QoS parameters
    from different directions, including cost, response time, energy consumption,
    and resource utilization, Rostami and Bidgholi [187] developed a load-balancing
    method using a multi-objective GWO, optimizing resource allocation to workflows.
    The method uses a framework for task allocation, as shown in Fig. 11 [187]. The
    method assigns tasks to resources based on the multi-objective GWO algorithm,
    which has low complexity, high accuracy, and fast convergence. The method also
    uses a controller to direct traffic to the best resource for user demand while
    maximizing the satisfaction of service providers and infrastructure. Download

    algorithms in IoMT. Bharathi et al. [189] proposed a model named EEPSOC that uses
    particle swarm optimization to improve energy efficiency among IoT devices in
    e-healthcare applications. EEPSOC selects optimal cluster heads that forward sensed
    healthcare data to fog devices and the cloud, reducing energy consumption in data
    transmission. Moreover, the EEPSOC model applies an artificial neural network
    (ANN) in the cloud to classify healthcare data and identify disease severity levels.
    The EEPSOC-ANN model outperformed the other models on the student healthcare dataset.
    Hasnony et al. [188] introduced a fog-based model that combined an adaptive neuro-fuzzy
    inference system (ANFIS) with the hybrid PSO and grey wolf optimizer (PSOGWO)
    algorithm for predicting Parkinson''s disease. The PSOGWO algorithm tunes the
    ANFIS parameters that the leveraged model uses. Moreover, this model uses a chaotic
    tent map to initialize the optimizations and fog computing to collect and analyze
    data at the edge of gateways. The results showed that this model outperforms optimization
    algorithms. Fig. 12 [188] shows the proposed three-layer architecture for IoT-based
    processing and prediction of Parkinson''s disease. The IoT layer collects and
    analyzes data from wearable sensors in real-time. The fog layer stores data locally
    and provides an expert system for user queries and emergency alerts. In IoMT,
    there are various apprehensions regarding security and privacy, including but
    not limited to replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation attacks,
    privileged-insider attacks, remote hijacking, password guessing, denial of service
    (DoS) attacks, and malware attacks pose significant risks. Utilizing machine learning
    algorithms, the IDS detects and classifies attacks; however, the unpredictable
    and ever-changing nature of malevolent assaults poses difficulties when formulating
    scalable remedies. Rm et al. [190] presented a deep neural network (DNN) based
    IDS for the IoMT environment, optimizing and tuning network parameters through
    hyperparameter selection methods. This approach enhanced the promptness of alert
    responses and mitigated the subsequent consequences of unauthorized access to
    confidential cloud-based data storage. The outcomes underscored the model''s efficacy
    in identifying and predicting unforeseen cyberattacks, contributing to the ongoing
    development of IoMT security. Ghorpade et al. [99] introduced a multi-objective
    GWO to strategically locate wireless sensor nodes enabled with IoT technology
    within a parking area. This optimization method incorporates two distinct objective
    functions, one for measuring distance and the other for assessing geometric topology
    constraints. The results show that a multi-objective grey optimizer could minimize
    a localization error compared to the compared algorithms. Ghorpade et al. [191]
    proposed HOFTELM, an IoT-based localization method for smart city applications,
    by combining an extreme learning machine, a fuzzy system, and a modified swarm
    intelligence. Particle swarm grey wolf optimizer was used to identify the moving
    sensor node direction. A fuzzy-weighted centroid optimized the irregular movement
    of nodes. This method outperformed existing algorithms regarding localization
    accuracy, number of localized nodes, and runtime. Human activity recognition (HAR)
    is essential in various applications, including elderly care, assisted living,
    smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. However, the high dimensionality of collected
    data impacts the quality of HAR models. Therefore, Helmi et al. [192] proposed
    a lightweight feature selection method to improve classification. The GBOGWO method
    leveraged gradient-based optimization and GWO to select features. Then, support
    vector machines classified the activities. Experiments showed that GBOGWO achieved
    the most optimal outcomes compared to various optimization algorithms on UCI-HAR
    and WISDM datasets. Kumar et al. [102] proposed a system that uses a deep-learning
    classifier to automatically detects arrhythmia from IoT-based electrocardiogram
    (ECG) signals data. The system processed the ECG signals to generate features
    for classification. A deep convolutional neural network (deep CNN) classifier,
    based on the coyote GWO (Coy-GWO) algorithm, was developed to detect anomalies
    in the ECG signals. The Coy-GWO algorithm combined canines'' social hierarchy
    and hunting experience to update classifier parameters effectively. This Coy-GWO-based
    deep CNN achieved 95 % accuracy, outperforming the compared techniques. Munagala
    et al. [193] proposed a fuzzy-LSTM model for a heart disease monitoring system.
    The fuzzy-LSTM model employs a Harris Hawks optimization to identify the most
    optimal characteristics, which maximize intra-class and minimize inter-class correlation.
    The simulation results showed this model enhance the efficiency of healthcare
    on heart disease and diminish mortality rates. Hashimi et al. [90] hybridized
    GWO and the genetic algorithm (GA) to build an electronic health system that enables
    remote monitoring, diagnosis, and data storage by optimizing and analyzing the
    sensor data for electronic healthcare monitoring. The GWO''s spiral search path
    ensures diversity, while the GA encourages convergence. Support vector machine
    (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers were used to extract and analyze critical information
    from the heart sensor data. The findings demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm
    produces more accurate mining models than canonical GWO and GA for data mining.
    The IoT wearable devices collect heart disease-related data from publicly available
    benchmark sites. Vellameeran and Brindha [86] hybridized a PSO with the GWO (PS-GWO)
    algorithm that obtains features collected from heart disease diagnosis using the
    IoT wearable medical devices. Moreover, the PS-GWO algorithm optimizes the hyperparameters
    of the deep belief network (DBN). The DBN analyzes the selected features to categorize
    and monitor the patients accurately. Mojjada et al. [194] proposed the hybrid
    whale GWO approach to select cluster heads for IoT healthcare devices. This approach
    uses the deep classification model, which identifies patient conditions using
    the data transmitted to the cluster heads. The results reveal that this approach
    could achieve significant accuracy and specificity compared to the techniques.
    Irshad et al. [195] presented a healthcare monitoring platform that utilizes the
    IoT and a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model based on an enhanced GWO
    (IGWO). First, the pertinent features for lung nodule diagnosis was extracted
    using the Tasmanian Devil Optimization algorithm. Then, a DCNN model based on
    IGWO was trained on the optimal features obtained from the IoT platform, and the
    outcomes were stored in the cloud for medical professionals to evaluate. The accuracy
    and efficiency of their model were assessed against state-of-the-art lung cancer
    detection models. 8. Applying GWOs in consumer IoT applications In this section,
    four papers from the final set are reviewed. These papers investigate the use
    of GWOs in IoT applications for everyday use, such as home appliances, voice assistance,
    lightning devices, etc. Table 4 summarizes GWOs applied in Consumer IoT Applications.

    applications of consumer IoT [196]. The power scheduling problem in smart homes
    (PSPSH) is a challenging scheduling problem that falls under the category of NP-hard
    problems. It possesses a search space that is both deep and rugged, mainly due
    to the presence of numerous constraints and objectives. The primary aim of PSPSH
    is to optimize electricity bills, power consumption during peak periods, as well
    as the comfort levels of users. Various optimization techniques have been employed
    to tackle PSPSH, with metaheuristics emerging as the most widely used approach.
    However, it has been observed that metaheuristics exhibit limited effectiveness
    when dealing with large-scale search spaces, so hybridization approaches are used
    to improve their performance. Makhadmeh et al. [25] hybridized a multi-verse optimizer
    (MVO) and GWO to tackle PSPSH efficiently. The proposed method showed high performance
    compared with other methods. Forestiero [197] proposed a heuristic approach to
    constructing a recommender engine within the IoT setting by employing swarm intelligence
    techniques. Vectors derived from the Doc2Vec model, are utilized to represent
    smart objects, and mobile agents associated with these vectors move in a 2D space
    using a bio-inspired flocking model. A rule of similarity, which is founded upon
    vectors, empowers agents to discern akin entities and assemble them collectively.
    This intelligent positioning allows for fast and effective selection operations.
    Rajesh et al. [198] proposed a hybrid method, self-feedback optimization adaptive
    neuro-fuzzy inference system (SFOANFIS), for managing the energy system in smart
    homes using the IoT. The SFOANFIS approach led to the efficient management of
    power and resources in the distribution system by connecting household appliances
    with cloud IoT and collecting demand response data. The results were compared
    with other existing algorithms, provided optimal use of resources, and satisfied
    the overall supply and energy demand. Yin et al. [199] introduced an optimization
    algorithm for power allocation in consumer IoT with decode-and-forward (DF) relaying.
    The algorithm uses a grey wolf optimizer to reduce the outage probability. The
    paper derives mathematical expressions for the outage probability and compares
    the algorithm with others. The paper proves the algorithm can achieve a lower
    outage probability and a faster running time than the different algorithms. 9.
    Applying GWOs in industrial IoT applications This section reviews six eligible
    industrial IoT papers that apply GWOs in different industrial applications, such
    as energy sectors, digital control systems, and intelligent agriculture. Table
    5 summarizes GWOs applied in industrial IoT Applications. Table 5. GWOs applied

    for the mobile sink WSN-based IoT Rathinam et al. [93] presented a Taylor-WWO-based
    GAN (generative adversarial network) approach to detect diseases in the agricultural
    industry. In this method, IoT nodes sense plant leaves and send the data collected
    using fractional gravitational GWO to find the optimal path for data transmission.
    The Taylor-WWO-based GAN approach exhibited enhanced performance in terms of maximum
    accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to previous methodologies. Safaei
    et al. [200] focused on creating optimal value through smart awareness in enterprise
    business service composition for IIoT manufacturing. An integer linear optimization
    model for enterprise service composition (ESC) was proposed using a hybrid multi-objective
    GWO (HGO). The model was evaluated based on four factors and compared with other
    multi-objective optimizations. The proposed model''s Pareto front converged better
    than the others. The results showed that HGO had better convergence and enhanced
    the optimality rate in IIoT manufacturing. Bhookya et al. [201] proposed a system
    for monitoring and controlling the liquid level in a single tank in real time
    using an IoT framework that utilizes a Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID)
    controller with parameters set by an enhanced GWO (mGWO) algorithm. The mGWO algorithm
    optimized the PID controller parameters, and the microcontroller programming and
    interface for the Android application were created using the Arduino integrated
    development environment (IDE). The results showed that the mGWO-based control
    system outperformed Ziegler-Nichols and simple internal model control (SIMC) tuning
    approaches, and the IoT application-based user interface improved the plant''s
    ability to control and monitor its operations with added flexibility. The system
    contributes to the ongoing development of industrial automation. Fog computing
    is becoming a popular model for IoT applications, working alongside cloud computing.
    Nethaji et al. [202] utilized a differential evolution-based GWO algorithm for
    optimal resource management. It incorporated a model for optimal resource allocation
    that combined a stochastic gradient and deep reinforcement learning-based approach.
    This method achieves quality of service (QoS) for end-users by effectively reducing
    energy consumption and managing cache resources. Jagadeesh et al. [203] proposed
    a group key management system based on deep augmented adversarial wolf learning
    named MDROWL-GKM. The goal of this system is to effectively monitor data acquired
    in the IoT, which ensures that network traffic and computational overhead are
    not maximized when a group member joins or leaves. By incorporating an opposition-based
    learning GWO algorithm, the modified deep boosting method overcomes the overload
    problem and improves performance. The efficiency of MDROWL-GKM system was evaluated
    using various criteria, including computation overhead, storage overhead, space
    complexity, access response time, policy setting accuracy, re-evaluation time,
    and communication overhead. The results proved that the MDROWL-GKM model is better
    than other state-of-the-art algorithms. Rajagopal et al. [204] introduced a data
    collection algorithm for WSN in precision agriculture. The algorithm assigned
    rendezvous points and a mobile sink to acquire data from sensor nodes. The algorithm
    also applied a hybrid method based on a metaheuristic algorithm to discover the
    shortest path for the mobile sink. The paper evaluated the algorithm on network
    lifetime, energy consumption, and latency. The paper confirms that the algorithm
    is effective and reliable. 10. Discussion, statistical analyses, and limitations
    This systematic review investigated the research using metaheuristic algorithms
    in IoT, especially the GWO algorithm. This study has provided a comprehensive
    overview of applying GWOs in different IoT applications, including IoT development,
    commercial IoT, consumer IoT, and industrial IoT. We used an adapted PRISMA methodology
    [138] for reviewing, screening, and evaluating the papers published from the introduction
    of GWO in 2014 to the end of 2023, in which GWO has been employed in various IoT
    applications to select the most eligible papers. The adapted methodology encompasses
    three main phases: identification, evaluation, and reporting. First, in the identification
    phase, a thorough search utilizing specified keywords in the Google Scholar database
    yielded 693 papers. Fig. 14 illustrates the dispersion of scholarly papers published
    from 2014 to the end of 2023. Among the 693 papers published during the specified
    period, a notable majority of research efforts, totaling 254 papers published
    in 2023, have been done in applying GWOs in different IoT applications. Download

    used three screening steps and implemented rigorous inclusion criteria during
    the evaluation phase to select the most eligible papers from reputable journals
    published between 2014 and the end of 2023. Out of the initial pool of 693 documents,
    the evaluation phase identified 50 papers as the final set. The first screening
    step removed ten duplicate papers and 262 publications from non-academic sources,
    leaving 421 reputable papers for further analysis. Fig. 15 illustrates the dispersion
    of the reputable papers chosen in the first screening across respectable publishers,
    including Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, MDPI, Hindawi, WILEY, and Taylor & Francis.
    Among these 421 papers, Springer and Elsevier publishers emerge, contributing

    apply GWOs, including the canonical GWO, existing variants, improvements and hybrids
    for different IoT applications. The second screening left 101 related papers for
    full-text reviewing. Fig. 17 shows the distribution of selected associated articles
    in various IoT applications, including IoT development, commercial IoT, consumer

    advantages. First, it allows for a comprehensive and rigorous review of the available
    evidence by systematically searching multiple databases. This broad search strategy
    minimizes the risk of publication bias and ensures a comprehensive literature
    representation. Second, by applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria,
    we aimed to ensure that the selected eligible papers were relevant to the main
    objective of this study. In addition, the approach used in the systematic review
    enabled us to perform a meta-analysis and provide a quantitative summary of the
    available data, increasing the statistical power of our study. Despite its strengths,
    this systematic review has the following limitations. First, this study relies
    solely on literature published in peer-reviewed journals and does not consider
    unpublished studies, such as preprinted papers, that may include potential sources.
    Second, language restrictions were applied, and studies published in languages
    other than English were not included, which could lead to language bias. In addition,
    the quality and limitations of the included studies varied, which may affect the
    strength of the overall conclusions. Moreover, the authors'' subjective decisions
    determined the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction, and quality
    evaluations. 11. Conclusion and future works This systematic review explored the
    eligible papers published by reputable journals in which the author(s) have applied
    GWOs, including the canonical GWO, its existing developed variants, and improvements
    and hybridizations of GWO for tackling optimization problems in different IoT
    applications. The study followed an adapted PRISMA methodology [138] with three
    main phases: identification, evaluation, and reporting. In the identification
    phase, an initial search was performed using appropriate keywords and queries
    to retrieve potentially 693 documents from various databases and sources. In the
    evaluation phase, a three-step screening process was applied to the initial search
    results to identify the eligible final set of papers for analysis and review.
    Strict inclusion criteria were utilized to ensure that only related papers published
    in reputable journals were considered in which GWOs have been applied in different
    IoT applications. The evaluation process reduced the initial pool of over 693
    papers to 50 eligible papers. In the reporting phase, the eligible papers were
    carefully subjected and synthesized to identify key themes related to applying
    GWOs in IoT applications such as IoT development, commercial IoT, consumer IoT,
    and industrial IoT. The review results revealed that GWOs hold significant promise
    in addressing optimization challenges in the IoT domain. Among the 693 papers
    identified on this topic from 2014 to the end of December 2023, a remarkable majority
    of the research efforts, 254 papers, were conducted in 2023. However, 2022 has
    published 15 eligible papers, more than 2023. Springer and Elsevier were prominent
    publishers that have published the most eligible papers. The results showed that
    GWO is a simple yet effective algorithm for addressing optimization problems in
    various IoT domains, including smart cities, healthcare, smart homes, manufacturing,
    agriculture, etc. Researchers have developed numerous GWO variants for IoT applications.
    Key techniques for developing GWO to apply in IoT applications include hybridizing
    with other algorithms, adapting parameter control, and improving search strategy.
    In addition, the review results showed that applying GWOs in IoT has expanded
    mainly IoT development with 28 eligible papers compared to other IoT applications.
    Indian researchers, with 30 eligible papers, have applied GWOs more than other
    researchers worldwide in IoT. We present a thorough and current analysis of how
    different GWO variants and parameters affect IoT problems, such as task scheduling,
    routing, clustering, security, privacy, energy management, load balancing, and
    fault tolerance. We also review hybrid and adaptive GWO methods that can adapt
    to IoT networks'' dynamic and uncertain features, such as network topology, task
    distribution, resource availability, and user demand. We reveal that the GWO algorithm
    can achieve better accuracy, stability, convergence, and diversity outcomes. These
    results suggest that GWO is a promising technique for solving optimization problems
    in IoT networks and can be further enhanced and expanded. This study suggests
    the following direction for future research. - Applying GWO to other problems
    in IoT networks, such as data aggregation, data fusion, data compression, data
    mining, IoT security applications, and data analytics. - Developing effective
    GWO variants by optimizing its parameters to adapt to different optimization problems''
    characteristics in IoT. - Assessing GWO''s scalability and interoperability for
    various IoT architectures, protocols, and applications. - Critical analysis of
    optimization problems in IoT applications to comprehend their features and requirements.
    - Enhancing the GWO''s search capability to efficiently address the search space
    challenges in IoT applications'' problems. - Enhancing the GWO''s search capability
    to efficiently address the search space challenges in IoT applications'' problems.
    - Hybridizing GWO and other advanced algorithms to solve challenging optimization
    issues in IoT applications and developments. - Developing GWO and its variants
    for tackling multi-objective optimization challenges in IoT applications to trade-off
    between optimization metrics, such as energy consumption, latency, reliability,
    and cost. - Analyzing and reviewing other advanced algorithms that can solve optimization

  description: The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has risen as a revolutionary
    innovation, establishing a connection between the physical and digital worlds
    and significantly impacting various aspects of daily life. In the healthcare field,
    it has unlocked the potential of connected medical devices, enhancing care through
    real-time patient monitoring and the effective management of chronic diseases.
    Within the industry, IoT facilitates predictive maintenance, optimizes manufacturing
    processes, oversees the supply chain, and monitors assets. Smart cities utilize
    IoT to elevate infrastructure management, enhance security, and promote sustainability.
    In agriculture, IoT sensors bring about a transformation in precision farming,
    optimizing resource utilization, and increasing yields. Smart homes integrate
    IoT for home automation solutions, empowering homeowners to remotely control devices
    and systems. Finally, in the transportation, IoT is at the forefront of revolutionizing
    connected and autonomous vehicles, providing advanced features in safety, navigation,
    and onboard entertainment. The integration of (IoT) and (AI) yields considerable
    benefits across various sectors by enhancing operational efficiency, facilitating
    informed decision-making, and fostering the creation of smarter, interconnected
    environments. In this article, we conducted a bibliometric study focused on industrial
    sectors related to the Internet of Things (IoT) from 2018 to 2023. Our analysis
    centers on comparing the most frequently explored domains, highlighting their
    popularity and performance. Furthermore, we examined currently predominant and
    beneficial technologies, particularly those aimed at optimizing operations, improving
    efficiency, and reducing costs.

  description: Smart agriculture (SA) based on the framework of precision agriculture
    (PA) is a vital component of sustainable and efficient food production, with nitrogen
    (N) management playing a pivotal role. However, existing agricultural practices
    often suffer from low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), posing a challenge to SA.
    To tackle this issue, real-time N sensing technologies offer farmers precise and
    timely information about soil N levels, enabling precise N fertilizer application.
    Integrating these technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) can further augment
    their capabilities, creating a seamless platform for data collection, analysis,
    and decision-making for great opportunities to improve NUE. Nevertheless, the
    adoption of real-time N sensing and IoT integration also presents several challenges,
    including selecting appropriate sensing technologies, effective data mining and
    management, and acquiring specialized knowledge and training. This review paper
    provides a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and challenges associated
    with real-time N sensing technologies and IoT integration in smart farming. By
    showcasing best practices and innovative solutions, the paper aims to foster widespread
    adoption of SA practices, ultimately elevating the sustainability and productivity
    of agricultural systems.

    author information Abstract Smart agriculture (SA) based on the framework of precision
    agriculture (PA) is a vital component of sustainable and efficient food production,
    with nitrogen (N) management playing a pivotal role. However, existing agricultural
    practices often suffer from low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), posing a challenge
    to SA. To tackle this issue, real-time N sensing technologies offer farmers precise
    and timely information about soil N levels, enabling precise N fertilizer application.
    Integrating these technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) can further augment
    their capabilities, creating a seamless platform for data collection, analysis,
    and decision-making for great opportunities to improve NUE. Nevertheless, the
    adoption of real-time N sensing and IoT integration also presents several challenges,
    including selecting appropriate sensing technologies, effective data mining and
    management, and acquiring specialized knowledge and training. This review paper
    provides a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and challenges associated
    with real-time N sensing technologies and IoT integration in smart farming. By
    showcasing best practices and innovative solutions, the paper aims to foster widespread
    adoption of SA practices, ultimately elevating the sustainability and productivity
    of agricultural systems. Export citation and abstract BibTeX RIS Previous article
    in issue Next article in issue Agriculture is one of the largest and most important
    sources of food, materials, and energy to feed the world. Modern precision agriculture
    (PA) aims to efficiently manage agricultural production systems to achieve optimal
    outputs with the highest productivity by controlling the inputs through the 4
    R stewardship: right source, right rate, right time, and right place. The fundament
    of PA is based on obtaining and applying accurate information on biotic and abiotic
    stresses during crop plant growth, such as soil fertility, various pathogens and
    insects, weeds, radiation, salinity, floods, drought, extremes in temperature,
    and so on, to guide farmers making good decisions to use right tools at right
    locations with right intensity at the right time for optimization of agricultural
    production during an overall growth season. PA integrated computer and information
    technologies (CITs) with automatic irrigation systems, robots, remote sensing,
    Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Geographical Information System (GIS),
    Global Positioning System (GPS), yield monitoring, sensors, machine vision, etc
    to timely collect the biotic and abiotic stresses'' information and then digitize
    it to perform data analysis and image processing, making the information readable
    or useable for farmers or other end-users. The geographic three dimensions (3D)
    of the biotic and abiotic stresses can be located by GIS and GPS. This 3D information
    combines with the digitalized images of biotic and abiotic stresses to precisely
    map the stresses'' variations in the fields, providing \"prescription\" maps of
    agricultural practices for implementations of watering, fertilization, spraying
    herbicides and insecticides, harvesting, etc using variable rate technology (VRT).
    These PA prescription maps have been demonstrated to greatly help farmers manage
    crop plant growth; control farming automation systems; improve production efficiency;
    and greatly reduce waste generation and environmental pollution. PA deeply relies
    on information accuracy, reliability, and timing. However, agricultural systems
    are highly complex, dynamic, and vulnerable due to the variability of crop plant
    growth and their biotic and abiotic stresses changing over time as well as the
    differences among different crop species, fields, and regions, particularly, under
    global climate change context. PA may be unable to timely respond to the dynamic
    changes of biotic and abiotic stresses during crop plant growth due to the limited
    accuracy and reliability of the 3D information at the field sites. When any stress
    occurs on the sites, the farmers have to repeatedly rely on heavy machinery systems
    and laborers to achieve the 4 R stewardship during a growing season. High capital
    costs must be invested to initial, perform, and maintain the PA works and equipment.
    PA may significantly reduce the total consumption of water, fertilizers, herbicides,
    and/or insecticides in large fields by applying VRT, but high machinery and labor
    costs may decrease the production profitability while harming the sustainability
    due to soil compaction and unprecise management practices, causing noteworthy
    water evaporation, nutrients loss, and contaminations of herbicides and insecticides
    on the sites. Another limitation of PA is the information accessibility. Because
    of the limited capability and accuracy of GNSS, GPS, remote sensing, image processing,
    data mining, etc, it is still challenging to timely obtain precise information
    on crop growth and field variability, which derives from variations in soil properties
    and topography, either naturally occurring or induced by human management (e.g.,
    compaction, erosion, organic matter depletion) that in turn regulate soil water
    holding capacity, soil, and terrain hydrologic properties, and nutrient availability.
    These issues raise questions about PA development and application. It is necessary
    to explore not only simpler but also cost-effective solutions to improve PA technologies.
    Along with the ongoing computer and information technology (CIT) revolution, a
    new era of agriculture digitalization (also named agriculture 4.0) was emerging
    on the horizon at the beginning of the 21st century. The PA technologies were
    leveraged to a new stage of agriculture 4.0: smart agriculture (SA), which is
    also named smart farming. SA was based on the PA framework to integrate a variety
    of new CITs and smart devices, such as sensors, machine vision, drones, unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAV), machine learning (ML), internet of things (IoT), artificial
    intelligence (AI), big data, cloud computing, and so on, to build up effective
    and reliable networks to collect and process data and information at real-time
    for optimization of agricultural inputs and outputs to further improve agricultural
    production not only efficiency and cost-effectiveness but also profitability and
    sustainability. The core of SA is to safely obtain and utilize accurate information
    about plants and/or animals and their environments to precisely manage the agricultural
    production systems to maximize their productivity, profitability, and sustainability.
    Nitrogen is one of the most essential nutrients for plant growth. Nitrogen nutrients
    may remain in the forms of ammonia (NH3), ammonium (NH₄⁺), nitrate (NO₃⁻), and
    nitrite (NO2⁻), but the Nitrogen nutrients (simply named N) in soil exist in three
    general forms: organic N compounds, NH₄⁺ ions, and NO₃⁻ ions for maintaining the
    soil fertility and being uptake by most crop plants. Generally, natural N in soil
    is insufficient to meet the demands of plant growth, typically, a limited factor
    for increasing crop yield. Current crop productions are heavily relied on additional
    N fertilizers. Many farmers must apply multiple sources and/or multiple times
    of N fertilizers in a growth season to achieve their yield goals. The N fertilizer
    sources may include livestock manures, biomass wastes'' composts, synthetic chemical
    N fertilizers like Urea, Ammonium Nitrate, Ammonium Sulfate, etc. Approximately
    13 million tons of N fertilizers are annually consumed in crop production in the
    U.S. 1 The global N fertilizer market is projected to be about $140 billion by
    2026. 2 Unfortunately, the N use efficiency (NUE) is less than 50% of the applied
    N. Because of the low NUE, overuse of N fertilizers is very common and has resulted
    in higher production costs and severe environmental concerns. About 50% of applied
    N fertilizers were wasted due to surface runoff and underground leaching into
    water systems, and volatilization into air. Half of the lakes are eutrophic and
    65% of estuaries and coastal water are severely degraded in the U.S. due to excessive
    N and other nutrients escaping from agricultural production. 3–7 The resulting
    algae blooming, water hypoxia, fish death, soil degradation, and ecosystem changes
    have raised questions about the sustainability of current crop production systems
    and practices. There is an eager need to find effective solutions to detect N
    availability, monitor N application, and N uptake by crop plants in real time
    to improve NUE in crop production. Many efforts were made on N sensing and mapping
    to reduce the use of N fertilizers and improve NUE to increase crop yields while
    minimizing environmental impacts in the past PA. 8,9 The Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) of the United Nations reported that PA technologies may increase
    crop yields by up to 30% while reducing water usage by 67%. 10 USDA-ARS also reported
    that PA can reduce the net N leaching losses by 74%. 11 The integration of IoT
    and PA technologies can further enhance agricultural efficiency in modern SA.
    Ahmed et al. 12 found that it is feasible to effectively monitor N in crop growth
    on sites in real-time using IoT and wireless networks. Singh et al. 13 stated
    that IoT technologies may promote the sustainability of agricultural production.
    Different N sensing technologies such as optical and electrochemical sensors were
    developed, but some limitations still remain. IoT platforms have evolved rapidly
    to provide new opportunities for real-time N data collection and decision-making
    in developing agriculture 4.0. New opportunities for integration of N sensing
    in real time and IoT are coming while challenges also remain. These challenges
    include sensor accuracy and reliability, data integration and analysis, and user
    acceptance and adoption. Therefore, this review paper aims to overview the state
    of the art for different types of existing N sensors; analyze their advantages
    and limitations; and explore the potential to integrate with IoT in smart farming
    for N sensing in real time for crop management and decision-making. Meanwhile,
    the key challenges and opportunities of integrating N sensing with IoT were also
    investigated for future research and development. Review Methods In this literature
    review, a systematic approach is adopted to explore the integration of N sensing
    with IoT systems, involving three main steps: sensor, electronic system, and IoT
    network. The review begins with an examination of N sensors to understand the
    foundation of this integration process. The principles and technologies underlying
    N sensors are reviewed, laying the groundwork for comprehending their significance
    in various applications. This initial section enables readers to grasp the strengths
    and limitations of different N sensor models available in the literature, empowering
    them to make informed decisions in choosing the most suitable sensor for specific
    IoT-based N sensing applications. Subsequently, the electronic system designed
    to interface with N sensors and facilitate seamless integration into IoT networks
    is explored. Understanding the role of electronic systems in the N sensing process
    is paramount to harnessing the full potential of N sensors within an IoT ecosystem.
    Various circuit design approaches and computing technologies are examined to shed
    light on the critical factors that can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of
    N sensing systems. Moving forward, available IoT network options tailored for
    N sensing are investigated. The evaluation of different communication protocols,
    such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
    (MQTT), enables discerning the most appropriate network architecture for deploying
    N sensors across diverse scenarios. This comprehensive analysis empowers researchers,
    engineers, and environmentalists alike to make informed decisions when integrating
    N sensing into IoT applications. Table I. Optical sensors. Sensor Sensor types

    the IoT network review, the challenges, and opportunities inherent in N sensing
    and IoT integration are addressed. Potential roadblocks and areas for improvement
    are identified, paving the way for future advancements in this domain. Finally,
    the review is concluded by summarizing the key findings and insights obtained
    throughout the study, reinforcing the significance of the integrated N sensing
    and IoT paradigm in addressing environmental and agricultural challenges. N Sensing
    Principles and Technologies There are several types of N sensing technologies
    that can be used for SA, including optical sensors and electrochemical sensors.
    Each of these technologies has its own strengths and limitations and may be more
    suitable for different applications depending on factors such as cost, accuracy,
    and ease of use. Optical sensor Optical sensors are one of the most widely used
    N sensing technologies in SA. These sensors use light to measure the reflectance
    or absorbance of leaves or soil, which can provide information on chlorophyll
    content, N content, and other plant parameters. Optical sensors are relatively
    inexpensive and easy to use and can provide rapid and non-destructive measurements.
    However, they may be affected by environmental factors such as lighting conditions
    and leaf moisture and may not be as accurate as other types of sensors. As shown
    in Fig. 2, Optical sensors can be categorized into three types: chlorophyll sensors,
    reflectance sensors, and fluorescence sensors. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size

    image Chlorophyll sensor A chlorophyll sensor for N is a proximal sensing technology
    that can detect the N needs of crops based on chlorophyll content. Chlorophyll
    is an essential element in photosynthetic protein synthesis and is related to
    the N content of crops. 14 A chlorophyll sensor can be used to assess crop N status
    and optimize N fertilization in various crops, including wheat, maize, and rice.
    15 To measure the chlorophyll content in plant leaves, a chlorophyll meter is
    commonly used. The chlorophyll meters estimate the relative leaf chlorophyll content
    by measuring the absorbance and transmittance of red and near-infrared (NIR) radiation
    by the leaf. 16,17 Transmittance-based chlorophyll meters measure a dimensionless
    value that strongly correlates with actual chlorophyll content, while fluorescence-based
    chlorophyll meters measure the chlorophyll fluorescence emission ratio of red
    and far-red radiation. 18–20 However, there are several commercially available
    chlorophyll meters that differ in their measuring principle, wavelengths used,
    measurement units, and calibration equations, which makes the comparison difficult.
    21–23 Nonetheless, numerous studies have reported strong relationships between
    chlorophyll meter measurements and extractable chlorophyll concentration in the
    form of curvilinear relationships, with a degree of saturation of measurements
    at high chlorophyll contents. 24,25 Standard chlorophyll content versus chlorophyll
    meter relationships have been reported for several different species. 21,23 Figure
    3 demonstrates the working of a transmittance-based chlorophyll sensor. This system
    employs a LED emitting red and near-infrared (NIR) light from the top, which passes
    through the leaf, and a light detector (photo diode) placed below the leaf to
    absorb the transmitted light. Both the LED and photo diode are connected to an
    electronic circuit, which is then integrated with a display system. The figure
    showcases the components and flow of data in the chlorophyll sensor system, enabling
    real-time monitoring and data analysis for precise N assessment in crops. Zoom

    sensor system. Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image In practical
    agricultural settings, chlorophyll sensors have proven to be highly beneficial.
    For instance, in corn cultivation, farmers use chlorophyll meters to make informed
    decisions about nitrogen application. These devices offer a quick and reliable
    method to assess the nitrogen content of plants, allowing for precise nitrogen
    management. This not only optimizes crop health and yield but also reduces the
    environmental impact by preventing over-fertilization. 26 By incorporating these
    sensors, farmers can significantly cut down on nitrogen application costs, making
    the practice both economically and environmentally sustainable. Figure 4 demonstrates
    a chlorophyll meter being employed in a corn field, a tool pivotal in making accurate
    in-season nitrogen recommendations. This image illustrates the practical use of
    the device, highlighting its role in guiding nitrogen application to ensure optimal
    plant growth and minimize waste. The chlorophyll meter''s ability to provide real-time,
    actionable data exemplifies the advancements in precision agriculture, aiding
    farmers in making informed decisions that benefit both their yields and the environment.

    image Reflectance sensor Over the past two decades, proximal reflectance sensors
    have been extensively studied to aid in crop N management. 17,27,28 These sensors
    determine crop N status by measuring specific wavelengths of radiation absorbed
    and reflected by the crop foliage. 29–31 Reflectance sensors are categorized as
    passive or active depending on whether they have their own light source. Passive
    sensors have two sets of photodetectors to measure incident and reflected radiation
    while active sensors have their own light source and can distinguish reflected
    radiation from their own source from that of ambient radiation. 32 The wavelengths
    chosen for N assessment correspond to four narrow bands in the visible and NIR
    portions of the spectrum that are sensitive to changes in chlorophyll status,
    foliage density, and biomass that accompany N deficiency. The Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used spectral vegetation index that combines
    reflectance from multiple wavelengths. 33 Reflectance sensors can be used in different
    irradiance conditions and are often mounted on tractors and connected to GPS systems
    for field mapping, making them well-suited for automatic variable rate application
    of mineral fertilizer. 34 Figure 5 presents a comparative demonstration of active
    and passive reflectance sensor systems. In Fig. 4a, the active system utilizes
    a light source to emit radiation onto the plant canopy, and the reflected radiation
    is captured by a light detector. Both the light source and light detector are
    connected to an electronic circuit, which computes the vegetation index by analyzing
    the transmitted and reflected radiation. On the other hand, Fig. 4b illustrates
    the passive sensor system, employing two light detectors - one to capture incident
    radiation and the other to measure reflected radiation. The electronic circuit,
    linked to the detectors, computes the vegetation index based on the differentiation
    of the two captured radiations. The calculated index is then displayed on a display
    system and can be further processed for real-time monitoring and data analysis,
    enabling precise N assessment in crops. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure

    sensors have made significant strides in agricultural applications, as evidenced
    by a study conducted by Arshad Ashraf et al. 35 at the National Agricultural Research
    Centre (NARC) in the Pothwar region. The study utilized Green Seeker technology
    to monitor the growth of main crops like wheat, rice, and oats. The Green Seeker,
    an active reflectance sensor, was employed to acquire NDVI and Red-NIR ratios
    of crops at various growth stages. This technology provided crucial insights into
    the crop''s health and vigor, enabling precise monitoring and assessment of crop
    physiological status. The NDVI values recorded for wheat ranged between 0.1 −
    0.88, illustrating the technology''s capability to capture the dynamic nature
    of crop growth and health. The study underscores the potential of reflectance
    sensors like the Green Seeker in enhancing crop yield forecasts and establishing
    a repository for future satellite-based crop monitoring. 35 Figure 6 depicts the
    Green Seeker technology in action, capturing the NDVI and Red-NIR ratios of the
    crop cover. The figure illustrates the practical use of the handheld Green Seeker
    instrument in the field, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time monitoring
    of crop health and vigor. This image showcases the innovative approach to precision
    agriculture, highlighting the instrumental role of reflectance sensors in informed
    decision-making and sustainable farming practices. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image

    image Fluorescence sensor Fluorescence sensors are a type of sensor that detects
    and measures the intensity of fluorescent light emitted by a sample when excited
    by a particular wavelength of light. They use a fluorescent probe or a fluorescently
    labeled molecule that selectively binds to or interacts with the analyte of interest,
    resulting in changes in the fluorescence intensity that can be correlated with
    the analyte concentration. This fluorescence is closely associated with plant
    photosynthetic activity and can be used to monitor crop N status, even in the
    early growth stages. 36–38 These sensors have numerous applications, including
    the measurement of flavonol content in plants and other biological samples. Flavonols
    are a group of plant secondary metabolites that play important roles in plant
    development and defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. A Fluorescence based
    flavonols method to proximally monitor crop N status is based on estimating relative
    flavonol content from fluorescence measurements. 18 Flavonols are a type of secondary
    metabolite whose content in leaves increases under lower N supply, and the content
    is estimated using the chlorophyll fluorescence screening method by flavonol meters.
    39 Two fluorescence-based flavonol meters are commonly used: the DUALEX, a leaf-clip
    instrument that measures fluorescence on a small diameter section of the leaf,
    and the MULTIPLEX, a handheld proximal sensor that measures at 10 cm from the
    leaf and a surface area of 4 to 8 cm in diameter. 20 The meters measure a dimensionless
    value strongly related to the actual amount of flavonols. The Fig. 7 illustrates
    the functioning of a fluorescence sensor system. This system is comprised of a
    light source and a fluorescence detector. The light source emits light onto the
    leaf''s surface, and the fluorescence detector captures the intensity of the fluorescence
    emitted from the leaf upon the excitation of light. The captured fluorescence
    intensity is then processed by the electronic circuit connected to the detector,
    which quantifies the flavonol content present in the leaf. Subsequently, the calculated
    flavonol content is displayed on the display system, providing a clear representation
    of the leaf''s flavonol levels. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 7. Illustration

    image Fluorescence sensors, especially those measuring flavonol content, have
    been instrumental in nondestructive diagnostics of crop nitrogen status, enhancing
    precision agriculture. A notable application is the use of Dualex leaf-clip measurements
    in vineyards to assess the nitrogen nutrition of grapevines. This method, which
    involves measuring chlorophyll and epidermal flavonols, allows for a quantitative
    optical estimation of leaf nitrogen content, offering a substantial leap towards
    precision crop management. The nitrogen balance index (NBI), the ratio of chlorophyll
    to epidermal flavonols, has been identified as an excellent estimator of leaf
    nitrogen content, providing a robust and nondestructive approach to determining
    the optimal nitrogen levels necessary for grapevine health and productivity. 40
    Fig. 8 demonstrates the application of the Dualex leaf-clip sensor on grapevine
    leaves. This image illustrates the practical use of the sensor in a vineyard,
    highlighting its role in assessing the nitrogen content of grapevine leaves nondestructively.
    The ability of the Dualex sensor to provide accurate measurements of chlorophyll
    and flavonol content exemplifies its utility in precision viticulture, aiding
    in the optimization of nitrogen management for enhanced grape quality and yield.

    Standard image High-resolution image Table I provides a comprehensive overview
    of various optical sensors, highlighting their sensor types, measuring ranges,
    sensitivity, and applications in nutrient management. Electrochemical sensors
    Electrochemical sensors are valuable N sensing technology utilized in SA. These
    sensors measure the electrical conductivity of soil or plant tissue, serving as
    a proxy for N content. Offering the advantages of being relatively inexpensive
    and easy to use, electrochemical sensors provide real-time measurements of N levels.
    However, their accuracy may be influenced by environmental factors such as soil
    moisture and temperature, requiring regular calibration. Electrochemical nitrate
    detection employs various sensing methods, including potentiometric, amperometric,
    voltammetric, and impedimetric techniques. These methods convert nitrate ions
    into measurable signals such as impedance, potential difference, or current. Nitrate
    detection can be performed using diverse electrodes like copper, silver, platinum,
    and others, with sensitivity contingent on the material and sensing method. While
    conventional electrochemical cells are widely used for their simplicity, sensitivity,
    and low power consumption, they lack portability. In response, miniature electrochemical
    cells have been developed to continuously monitor nitrate levels in aqueous media,
    60–62 requiring high miniaturization, sensitivity, and reusability. Fig. 9 delineates
    the types of electrochemical sensors, illustrating their classification into different
    categories. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 9. Types of Electrochemical
    Sensor. Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image Most electrochemical
    sensors consist of a working electrode, a reference electrode, and a counter electrode,
    which are used to measure the chemical or biological analyte of interest. The
    working electrode is a crucial component of electrochemical sensors, constructed
    from a material suitable for the specific electrochemical reaction being measured.
    It is often modified to enhance the sensor''s sensitivity and selectivity. 63–68
    The reference electrode serves as a stable reference point for measuring the potential,
    current, or impedance in the electrochemical system. 63,64,67,69–74 It is made
    of a material, such as Ag/AgCl 72,75 or a saturated calomel electrode, that maintains
    a stable potential and is separated from the working electrode by an electrolyte
    solution. The counter electrode enables the application of an input potential
    to the working electrode to complete the circuit and facilitate charge flow. It
    should be made of an inert material like carbon or platinum and be significantly
    larger than the working electrode to avoid current limitations. 63,76 The design
    and construction of the counter electrode are pivotal in ensuring the accuracy
    and reliability of the electrochemical sensor. The counter electrode is designed
    in such a way that it does not participate in the specific chemical reactions
    of interest, but rather acts as an electron sink or source to maintain electrical
    neutrality in the system. Fig. 10 showcases a variety of electrochemical sensors
    as reported in the literature. 85,87,110,114 Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size

    image Planar electromagnetic sensors 77–87 come in three types: mesh, meander,
    and interdigital. The mesh and meander sensors consist of an exciting electrode
    and a sensing electrode, using alternating current to generate a high-frequency
    electromagnetic field, which is detected by the sensing electrode. 77–80 Interdigital
    sensors 78,88,89 function as parallel plate capacitors with positive and negative
    electrodes, and their performance is influenced by the material dielectric properties
    and the electrode and material geometry. Further details on different electrochemical
    detection methods are discussed in the following sub-sections. Potentiometric
    detection Potentiometric systems are used for ion concentration detection by measuring
    potential difference between two half-cells connected by a salt bridge. Researchers
    have improved the selectivity and detection limits of nitrate detection by integrating
    ion-selective electrodes (ISE), which directly determines free-ion concentration
    in water. 90,91 Different materials, including nanobiocomposites, 91 polymeric
    membranes, 92 doped polypyrrole, 90 and trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride
    (THTDPIC) 93 have been used to create ISE. An artificial neural network 94 has
    been used to determine nitrate contamination levels, and micro-fabricated polymeric
    sensors have been introduced to reduce the bulkiness of potentiometric sensors.
    84,95 These sensors are small, easy to design, cost-effective, and can be mass-produced.
    Fig. 11 demonstrates the working of potentiometric detection in an electrochemical
    sensor. In potentiometric sensors, 63,64 the working electrode responds to the
    analyte''s activity and accumulates a charge potential relative to the reference
    electrode, generating an electrical signal proportional to the analyte''s concentration.
    The reference electrode, also in potentiometric sensors, 63,64,69 maintains a
    constant potential and measures the potential generated by the working electrode.
    The potential difference between the working and reference electrodes can be determined
    using a voltmeter. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 11. Potentiometric

    image Amperometric detection Amperometry is an electrochemical method that measures
    the current generated from oxidation/reduction reactions at a constant potential
    applied to a sensing electrode. It has been available since 1987 96 as a conventional
    benchtop and boasts high sensitivity, detecting nitrate concentrations ranging
    from 0.1 − 1 mM with minimal interference from similar ions. 97 Researchers have
    also reported on Polypyrrole (PPy)-nanowire modified electrodes, which can detect
    nitrate with a detection limit of 1.52 μM and a sensitivity of 336.28 mA/Mcm2.
    98 It is necessary to design sensing electrode to increase the detection method''s
    sensitivity. Fig. 12 demonstrates the operation of amperometric and voltammetric
    detection in an electrochemical sensor setup. In amperometric sensors, 65,66 the
    working electrode detects the current generated by an electrochemical reaction
    between the analyte and a redox chemical or enzyme. The reference electrode 70–72
    maintains a stable potential, which is utilized to measure the current produced
    by the working electrode. The counter electrode completes the electrical circuit
    during the electrochemical reaction occurring at the working electrode. 63 When
    the target analyte interacts with the working electrode, a redox reaction takes
    place, leading to the transfer of electrons and resulting in a flow of current
    between the working electrode and the counter electrode. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset

    sensor setup. Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image Voltammetric
    detection Voltammetry is a widely used electrochemical detection method that measures
    the current generated from oxidation/reduction reaction as a function of the controlled
    potential. Researchers have reported various voltammetric methods to detect nitrate
    in water samples. Bodini et al. 99 used a pyrolytic graphite electrode with electrochemically
    deposited copper and cadmium to detect nitrate with a linear range of 1 μM to
    1 mM. Krista et al. 100 used a system of silver, graphite powder, and methacrylate
    resin electrodes to detect nitrate with a range of up to 31 mg l−1, while Shariar
    et al. 101 used an in-situ copper-based electrode with a low detection limit for
    simultaneous nitrate detection in river water using differential pulse voltammetry
    (DPV). Neuhold et al. 102 and Mareček et al. 103 used a carbon-paste electrode
    with a detection limit of 0.5–60 μg ml−1 to detect nitrate in drinking water,
    and a differential pulse voltammetric method has been reported with a detection
    limit of 2.8 μM for nitrate in natural water. Jang et al. 104 reported a new electrochemical
    sensing platform with self-assembly nanobeads-packed (nBP) hetero-columns. The
    operation of voltammetric detection is depicted in Fig. 8. Voltammetric sensors
    involve the working electrode 65 detecting the current while varying a controlled
    potential. In this setup, the reference electrode 74 maintains a constant potential
    and measures the potential difference between the working electrode and the analyte.
    The counter electrode plays a crucial role in completing the electrical circuit
    during the electrochemical reaction taking place at the working electrode. 63
    Impedimetric detection An impedimetric electrochemical sensor is a type of sensor
    that uses the change in electrical impedance of an electrode to detect the presence
    of an analyte. The impedance of an electrode is a measure of its resistance to
    the flow of an electric current. When an analyte is present, it can interact with
    the electrode and change its impedance. 105,106 The sensor consists of a working
    electrode, a reference electrode, and an auxiliary electrode. The working electrode
    is the electrode that is in contact with the analyte, and the reference electrode
    is the electrode that is used to establish a reference potential. The auxiliary
    electrode is used to complete the electrical circuit. It is one of the most widely
    used method to determine amount of N from the various sensing technologies such
    as modified glassy carbon electrode, 107 Ion-Imprinted sensor based on Copper
    Nanoparticles-Polyniline Matrix, 108 Modified Screen-printed Carbon electrode,
    109 Flexible laser-induced graphene electrodes functionalized by CNT decorated
    by Au nanoparticles, 110 Laser-pyrolyzed paper sensors, 111 and IoT-enabled portable
    sensing system. 112 Fig. 13 illustrates the working of impedimetric detection
    in an electrochemical sensor. Impedance-based sensors, 67,68 involve the working
    electrode measuring the electrical impedance of the analyte. The reference electrode
    67,73 is utilized to compare the electrical impedance of the analyte to that of
    the working electrode. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 13. Impedimetric

    image Planar electromagnetic sensor Planar Electromagnetic Sensor can be Mesh/Meander
    or Interdigital used to measure physical properties such as conductivity, dielectric
    properties, and permeability. 79–82,85 PESA can be of Mesh or Meander type and
    is a sensor array that measures physical properties in terms of impedance and
    is highly reliable, with fast response and low cost. Yunus et al. 79 found that
    a series connection provided better performance for nitrate detection than a parallel
    connection, and using gold electrodes and a high-dielectric substrate improved
    the sensitivity of the sensor. Nor et al. 85 designed a PESA with a thin substrate
    on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to measure nitrate in water, and Wang et al.
    83 found that increasing the distance between electrodes and decreasing their
    area improved the sensor''s sensitivity. PIS works like a parallel plate capacitor,
    with electrodes providing a single measurement to the material under test (MUT).
    Impedance measurements taken through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
    provide information about the physical properties of the MUT. Alahi et al. 113
    developed a smart sensor for nitrate detection with a detection limit of 0.01–0.5
    mg l−1, and Alahi et al. 114 used an imprinting polymer technique to develop a
    material with a detection range of 1–10 mg l−1 to coat the interdigital sensor.
    Graphene-based electrodes were used by researchers to detect nitrate in water,
    where the detection limit was 1–70 mg l−1. 87 An interdigital sensor based on
    FR4 was used to measure nitrate in water in real-time using the Internet of Things
    (IoT). 115 The system was effective in measuring water from creeks, streams, and
    lakes and could obtain data remotely from the sampling location. The sensitivity
    of both PESA and PIS sensors can be improved by optimizing the design and configuration
    of the sensor, including the pitch gaps and dimensions of the sensing surface.
    Figure. 14 illustrates the geometrical configurations of three types of electromagnetic
    sensors: meander, mesh, and interdigital planar sensors. In the mesh and meander
    sensors, an exciting electrode carries alternating current, generating a high-frequency
    electromagnetic field that permeates the system under test. This induced electromagnetic
    field, in turn, gives rise to eddy currents on conducting or magnetic materials,
    leading to modifications in the generated field. The resulting field alterations
    are then detected by the sensing electrode. 77–80 On the other hand, interdigital
    sensors 78,88,89 function similarly to parallel plate capacitors. The material
    under test (MUT) allows the electric field to pass through it, affecting the capacitance
    and conductance between the positive and negative electrodes. These changes are
    influenced by the dielectric properties of the material and the geometry of the
    electrodes and MUT. Unfortunately, the coplanar electrodes of interdigital sensors
    may result in a low signal-to-noise ratio for measured capacitance. To address
    this, the electrode pattern can be replicated multiple times, forming an interdigital
    structure where one set of electrodes is driven by an AC voltage source while
    the other set is connected to ground. By employing this configuration, an electric
    field is generated between the driven and ground electrodes, with the depth of
    penetration varying according to different wavelengths of the sensor. This approach
    allows for obtaining a stronger signal, enhancing the performance and sensitivity
    of the interdigital sensor. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 14. Planar

    sensors, detailing their techniques, limits of detection, linear ranges, materials,
    and applications. Advantages and limitations of existing N sensing technologies
    Optical N sensors utilize the spectral reflectance properties of plants to estimate
    the N content of leaves. They are non-invasive and can be used on living plants.
    Optical sensors have the advantage of being fast, inexpensive, and highly accurate
    in the hands of experienced users. However, they can be affected by environmental
    factors such as light conditions and plant species and require specific calibration
    for different crops and growth stages. For precise chlorophyll meter measurements,
    it is advisable to take multiple readings per field on well-illuminated healthy
    leaves. The diverse leaf anatomy of vegetable plants can present challenges for
    measurement with chlorophyll meters. 28,133,134 In the case of reflectance sensors,
    consistency in sensor angle and height to the targe foliage are required to optimize
    sensor performance. 135–137 To utilize fluorescence sensors effectively, measurements
    should be taken at the leaf level and should be replicated to address potential
    inconsistencies in individual leaf measurements. Furthermore, measurements should
    be taken on the fully expanded and clear leaf of the plants. 138,139 Electrochemical
    N sensors measure the concentration of N in soil by detecting changes in its electrical
    properties. They are often used in fertigation systems and provide continuous
    measurements. These sensors are highly sensitive and can detect low concentrations
    of N, making them ideal for SA. In a study by Amali et al. 140 The authors investigated
    the potential of various nanostructured materials to improve the performance of
    electrochemical nitrate sensors. They found that using intelligent nanomaterials
    significantly improved the analytical performance of nitrate sensors, resulting
    in low operating potential, low detection limits, wide linear analytical ranges,
    and insignificant interferences. The successful application of nanomaterial-based
    electrochemical sensors to analyze nitrate in various matrices, including food,
    water, soil, and PM2.5 samples, demonstrates their reliability as portable on-site
    analytical sensors. However, the study notes that further research is needed to
    improve the stability and reproducibility of electrochemical nitrate sensors in
    complex real-world environments. Other studies, such as those by Patella et al.
    141 Inam et al. 86 Joly et al. 142 and Kim et al. 143 have explored various factors
    that can affect the performance of electrochemical sensors, including the effects
    of ions, temperature, moisture levels, and types of soil. Although Inam et al.
    86 researched a way to reduce interference from other ions and temperature, they
    did not consider the effects of moisture levels and types of soil, highlighting
    a research gap that warrants further investigation. In summary, while electrochemical-based
    N sensors have shown great potential for field applications, they require careful
    calibration due to their susceptibility to interference from other soil and water
    properties, as well as environmental factors such as temperature and humidity,
    and variations in moisture level and soil type. Comparison Table for Nitrogen

    N Sensor The integration of sensors with an IoT network relies on a critical component:
    the electronic circuit. This circuit plays a vital role by powering the sensor,
    capturing its signal, and processing and conditioning the data before digitizing
    and transmitting it to the IoT network. Fig. 15 illustrates the generalized block
    diagram of the electronic system, encompassing both optical and electrochemical-based
    N sensors. The electronic circuit comprises two key parts: the actuator circuit
    and the sensor circuit. The actuator circuit is responsible for activating the
    N sensor. For optical sensors, 15–17,23,144–149 it provides the light source,
    while for electrochemical sensors, 150–153 it supplies a constant DC voltage or
    voltage waveform to activate the sensor. On the other hand, the sensor circuit
    captures the sensor''s signal, amplifies, filters, and conditions it to ensure
    it is ready for digitization and transmission to the IoT network. 57,154–156 Zoom

    figure: Standard image High-resolution image Additionally, the computing system,
    functioning as a System-on-Chip (SoC), plays a pivotal role. It not only facilitates
    sensor actuation if required but also processes data from the sensor circuit,
    prepares data for the IoT network, and establishes communication with a wireless
    modem to create the IoT network. 87,112,113,115,157–171 In the following subsections,
    the specifics of the electronic circuit for both optical and electrochemical sensors
    will be explored, followed by a detailed examination of the computing system.
    This comprehensive approach aims to provide a complete understanding of the electronic
    system''s functionalities for integrating N sensors into the IoT network. Electronic
    circuit for optical sensor The electronic circuit for optical sensors comprises
    two crucial stages: the actuation stage, responsible for providing the necessary
    light source, and the sensor circuit, which includes the detection, amplification,
    and signal conditioning stage. Optical sensors, such as chlorophyll sensors, fluorescence
    sensors, and optical reflectance sensors, all require an actuation stage where
    a specific light source is employed. For chlorophyll sensors, 16,17,172 a light-emitting
    diode (LED) emitting light of a particular wavelength (375 nm − 940 nm) is commonly
    used. This wavelength is absorbed by chlorophyll in the focused sample. Similarly,
    fluorescence sensors 18,38,41,43 employ an LED emitting light at a specific wavelength
    (218 nm − 735 nm) matching the excitation peak of the fluorophore. 173,174 A constant
    current source drives the LED to ensure a stable light output. On the other hand,
    optical reflectance sensors 15,144–149 utilize an LED or a laser diode, chosen
    based on the desired wavelength, intensity, and beam size. The sensor circuit,
    a critical part of optical sensors, includes the detection stage, which typically
    employs a photodiode or phototransistor. For chlorophyll sensors, 175–178 the
    photodiode or phototransistor converts transmitted light into a small current
    or voltage signal, proportional to the chlorophyll content. In fluorescence sensors,
    179–181 a photodiode or photomultiplier tube (PMT) detects weak fluorescence emission,
    biased to operate in the linear range and placed in a dark enclosure to eliminate
    background noise. Optical reflectance sensors 182–185 use the photodiode or phototransistor
    to convert reflected light into a current or voltage signal proportional to surface
    reflectance. The detection stage must be carefully designed to detect weak signals
    while eliminating background noise effectively. The amplification stage for optical
    sensors 57,154–156 typically involves a transimpedance amplifier, a high-gain
    amplifier that converts small changes in light intensity into a voltage signal.
    This signal can be further amplified and filtered. The filtering stage includes
    low-pass and high-pass filters, designed to remove high-frequency noise and low-frequency
    noise (e.g., DC offset), respectively. Careful design and implementation of the
    filtering stage optimize the output signal for accuracy and reliability. After
    filtering, the signal is digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) before
    analysis, processing, and transmission to the IoT network. Electronic circuit
    for electrochemical sensor The electronic circuit design for an electrochemical
    sensor is highly dependent on the specific type of sensor being utilized, as different
    sensor types may demand distinct configurations. For instance, there are amperometric,
    voltammetric, impedimetric, and potentiometric sensors, each employing varying
    electrode configurations. As a result, diverse electronic circuits are tailored
    to ensure optimal functionality for different sensor types. These electronic circuits
    can be broadly classified into two main stages: the actuator circuit and the sensor
    circuit. Amperometric sensors consist of two crucial circuits: the actuator circuit,
    responsible for controlling the potential difference between the working electrode
    (WE) and the reference electrode (RE), and the sensor circuit, which measures
    the current flowing between the WE and the counter electrode (CE). 150–153 The
    electronic circuit used in amperometry comprises three main components: a power
    supply, a potentiostat, and a current amplifier. 186 The power supply provides
    the necessary voltage to drive the electrochemical cell, while the potentiostat
    precisely regulates the potential of the working electrode (WE). Simultaneously,
    the current amplifier amplifies the current signal measured between the working
    electrode (WE) and the counter electrode (CE). For current measurement, various
    configurations are available, such as transimpedance amplifiers, instrumentation
    amplifiers, current conveyors, and resistor insertion techniques. Although the
    transimpedance amplifier has been the most popular approach for current measurement,
    it does have limitations, including sensitivity to noise, instability, and single-supply-voltage
    issues. In recent years, significant advancements have been made with the introduction
    of potentiostat integrated circuits (IC). These ICs come equipped with built-in
    amplifiers to accurately maintain the potential between the working electrode
    (WE) and the reference electrode (RE). Additionally, they feature integrated transimpedance
    amplifiers to precisely measure the current between the working electrode (WE)
    and the counter electrode (CE). 187–189 By utilizing such integrated circuits,
    amperometric sensor circuits experience reduced noise levels and improved overall
    stability. On the other hand, the electronic circuit for voltammetry shares similarities
    with the circuit for amperometry, but it incorporates an additional function generator
    in the actuator circuit. 190,191 This function generator allows the potential
    of the working electrode to be swept, enabling the study of electrochemical processes
    over a range of potentials. Similarly, the electronic circuit for an impedimetric
    sensor consists of two main circuits: the actuator circuit and the sensor circuit.
    105,106,192 The actuator circuit includes the power supply, which provides the
    voltage necessary to drive the electrochemical cell. It supplies the AC voltage
    used for impedance measurements in the sensor. The sensor circuit comprises the
    impedance analyzer, responsible for measuring the impedance of the sensor. It
    applies the AC voltage from the power supply to the sensor and measures the resulting
    current to determine the impedance. Optionally, a lock-in amplifier circuit can
    be integrated into the sensor circuit to enhance the impedance measurements. 193,194
    The lock-in amplifier amplifies small impedance changes resulting from interactions
    between the analyte and the sensing layer of the sensor. By utilizing a reference
    signal, it demodulates the sensor''s output signal, significantly improving the
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and overall sensitivity of the output signal. Furthermore,
    in potentiometric electrochemical sensors, the electronic circuit consists of
    two distinct circuits: the actuator circuit and the sensor circuit. The actuator
    circuit incorporates the potentiostat, which plays a crucial role in maintaining
    a constant potential difference between the working electrode and the reference
    electrode. By precisely controlling the voltage applied to the working electrode,
    the potentiostat ensures a stable electrochemical environment during measurements.
    On the other hand, the sensor circuit includes the amplifier, a vital component
    that amplifies the small electrical signal generated by the potentiometric sensor.
    This amplification significantly enhances the sensitivity of the sensor, allowing
    for accurate and reliable measurement of the potentiometric response. 195–197
    Finally, after the electronic circuitry generates the output signal, it is digitized
    using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and subsequently processed by the computing
    system. Once processed, the signal can be transmitted to the IoT network, enabling
    convenient remote access and monitoring. Computing system for integration of n
    sensing systems with IoT The computing system plays a vital role in integrating
    the N sensing system into the IoT network, and it comprises System-on-Chips (SoCs)
    like microcontrollers, microprocessors, or FPGA-based microcontrollers. These
    SoCs facilitate the control of N sensors and enable various tasks such as signal
    processing, waveform generation, data collection, IoT network establishment, and
    wireless communication. Table III provides a comprehensive summary of the diverse
    computing system utilized by researchers to interface with N sensors. Their applications
    range from computing N concentrations to establishing IoT networks, demonstrating
    the system''s potential to seamlessly integrate N sensing with IoT capabilities.
    The analysis of the above table reveals that researchers have effectively harnessed
    the capabilities of SoCs for signal processing tasks, encompassing amplification,
    filtering, and digitization, which are essential for extracting pertinent information
    from sensor data. This meticulous processing ensures the accuracy and suitability
    of the acquired data for subsequent analysis. Moreover, researchers have successfully
    utilized SoCs to calculate N concentration from samples, proficiently controlling
    sensors by actuating them with various waveforms and capturing desired signals.
    Additionally, SoCs have been instrumental in facilitating the establishment of
    IoT networks, enabling seamless communication between sensors and other IoT devices.
    This connectivity empowers real-time data transmission and remote monitoring,
    thereby bolstering the efficiency of N sensing systems. However, there are still
    research area that needs to be explored such as: Advanced Data Processing: SoCs
    can be further leveraged to implement advanced data processing algorithms, enabling
    more sophisticated analysis and interpretation of the sensor data. This can include
    machine learning techniques to improve accuracy and reliability. Smart Data Aggregation:
    SoCs can be programmed to aggregate data from multiple sensors, allowing for comprehensive
    monitoring of N levels in large-scale agricultural fields or water bodies. This
    data aggregation can provide valuable insights for better decision-making. Energy-Efficient
    Operation: SoCs can be optimized for energy-efficient operation to prolong the
    battery life of the sensors. Implementing power management techniques and low-power
    modes can ensure sustainable and long-term sensor deployment. Real-Time Alerts:
    SoCs can be designed to trigger real-time alerts or notifications when N levels
    exceed certain thresholds, indicating potential environmental issues or agricultural
    needs. These alerts can be sent to farmers, researchers, or relevant authorities
    for prompt action. Enhanced Communication Protocols: SoCs can explore more robust
    and secure communication protocols, ensuring the integrity and privacy of the
    sensor data during transmission. This is particularly important in sensitive environmental
    monitoring and SA applications. Miniaturization and Integration: SoCs can be further
    miniaturized and integrated with sensors to create compact and portable N sensing
    devices. Such devices can be deployed in remote or hard-to-reach locations, expanding
    the scope of environmental monitoring. IoT for N Sensing The \"Internet of Things\"
    (IoT) are the physical items or \"things\" that are connected to the internet
    and equipped with sensors, software, and connections. These devices might be anything
    from home appliances like smart refrigerators and thermostats to complex industrial
    machinery and autonomous vehicles. To increase automation, efficiency, and productivity,
    IoT connects these objects and makes it possible for them to interact with one
    another as well as with other systems and services. 198,199 By leveraging data
    collected from connected devices, businesses and organizations can make more informed
    decisions for their applications. IoT has a lot of potential applications in SA.
    SA involves using data and technology to optimize crop yields, reduce waste, and
    improve sustainability. IoT can play a key role in this by enabling farmers to
    collect and analyze data from various sources in real-time, allowing them to make
    more informed decisions about their crops and operations. Some of the ways IoT
    is used in SA include: Environmental monitoring: Environmental monitoring: IoT
    sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental
    factors in real-time, allowing farmers to optimize irrigation and fertilizer application.
    For example, a study published in the journal Sensors found that using IoT sensors
    to monitor soil moisture, nutrient levels in soil, and temperature and humidity
    of soil and air in a citrus orchard in the Three Gorges reservoir area resulted
    in a 20% reduction in water and fertilizer usage. 200 Crop health monitoring:
    Sensors and cameras connected to an IoT-based platform can be used to monitor
    crop health and detect issues such as nutrient deficiencies or pest damage. For
    example, a study published in the journal Sensors demonstrated the feasibility
    of an IoT-based platform for collecting and analyzing agricultural environment
    information. This platform was then used to predict infections in Strawberry crops
    based on environmental factors. 201 Livestock monitoring: IoT sensors can be used
    to monitor the health and behavior of livestock, allowing farmers to detect issues
    early and make informed decisions to improve animal welfare. For example, a study
    published in the journal Software: Practice and Experience found that using IoT
    sensors to monitor the behavior of dairy cows provided data on movement pattern,
    activity levels, and social interactions. This data enabled farmers to identify
    potential health issues and adjust herd management practices, ultimately improving
    the well-being of the cows. 202 Equipment monitoring: ''IoT devices can be used
    to monitor the performance and maintenance needs of farm equipment, reducing downtime
    and optimizing operations. For example, research by Tan et al. demonstrated the
    feasibility of combining an IoT platform with a harvester and yield monitoring
    system to monitor the system in real-time with a latency of around 250 s. The
    use of this approach allowed farmers to remotely monitor their fields without
    physically visiting them, resulting in significant savings of both time and money.
    203 Supply chain management: IoT technology can be used to track and monitor crops
    throughout the supply chain, improving traceability and reducing waste. According
    to a review paper in the International Journal of Production, using IoT in supply
    chain management can increase revenue and customer satisfaction, while reducing
    costs and lead times. This is achieved by leveraging real-time data on crop status,
    quality, and location to optimize transportation, storage, and processing. By
    using IoT to enhance supply chain visibility and efficiency, businesses can reduce
    the risk of food safety incidents, respond more quickly to market demands, and
    ultimately improve their bottom line. 204 Overall, IoT has the potential to revolutionize
    SA by enabling farmers to collect and analyze data in real-time, optimizing their
    operations, and improving sustainability. The usage of IoT is increasing exponentially
    in recent years in the field of SA. However, with this growth comes the challenge
    of ensuring that these devices can communicate with each other seamlessly, regardless
    of the underlying technology. This is where IoT network standards come in. IoT
    network standards define the rules and protocols that devices use to communicate
    with each other and with other systems over the internet. By following these standards,
    IoT devices can communicate with each other and with other systems seamlessly,
    regardless of their underlying technology. IoT network standard includes IoT protocol
    and IoT network. An IoT protocol is a set of rules and standards that govern the
    way IoT devices and systems communicate with each other. These protocols define
    the format, content, and timing of messages exchanged between IoT devices and
    servers, as well as the protocols used to transmit these messages over the network.
    IoT protocols can be designed for various layers of the IoT stack, including the
    physical layer, transport layer, application layer, and security layer. Some common
    IoT protocols include MQTT, HTTP, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Advanced
    Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Extensible Messaging Presence Protocol (XMPP)
    and Data Distribution Service (DDS), each with its own strengths and weaknesses
    depending on the specific use case. The choice of protocol depends on factors
    such as the nature of the IoT application, the type of devices being used, the
    network topology, and the required performance and reliability characteristics.
    Table IV compares common IoT protocols based on key parameters such as communication
    type, transport layer, message size, header size, QoS support, security, and memory
    requirement. The selection of the appropriate protocol depends on factors like
    the nature of the IoT application, device types, network topology, and desired
    performance and security levels. Table IV. IoT protocol comparison. Protocol Communication

    Bluetooth enables peer-to-peer communication within a 10-meter range, while Wi-Fi
    operates as a local area network with high data speeds up to 7 Gbps and a range
    of 100 meters. Zigbee provides a low-power, short-range, mesh network suitable
    for interconnected devices within a 75-meter range. LoRaWAN is designed for long-range
    communication, reaching up to 15 kilometers, with low power consumption. Cellular
    networks offer flexible options for long-distance communication, accommodating
    varying data speeds and ranges. Understanding these wireless options is crucial
    for making informed decisions when implementing IoT solutions, considering factors
    such as coverage area, data speed requirements, and power constraints. Table V.

    Network Long-distance communication Varies Varies In recent years, there has been
    growing interest in using IoT technology to monitor N levels in water and soil.
    One promising approach is the use of low-cost, IoT-based sensor networks equipped
    with nitrate-selective electrodes to measure nitrate concentrations in real-time.
    A study published in the journal IEEE Transaction on Industrial Electronics demonstrated
    the potential of this approach for nitrate detection in stream water. 113 Another
    study successfully developed a smart nitrate sensing system and monitored N content
    in a creek near Macquarie University in real-time. 115 Akhtar et al. developed
    a low-cost and low-power nitrate sensor that was integrated with an IoT system
    to monitor water with different N concentrations in real-time. 112 Sheikh et al.
    developed a low-priced IoT-based system that used light emitting diodes and photodiodes
    to detect N content in the soil. 180 Lavanya et al. successfully developed an
    IoT system that used light dependent resistors and light emitting diodes with
    fuzzy logic to detect N content in soil. 224 Jiang et al. used a flexible nitrate
    sensor in an IoT sensor network to collect real-time field data. 225 Finally,
    Alahi et al. developed a graphene sensor for nitrate that was integrated with
    an IoT system and compensated for temperature effects to reduce measurement errors.
    87 These studies demonstrate the potential of IoT technology for monitoring N
    levels in water and soil, which can have important implications for environmental
    and agricultural monitoring. The practical applications of IoT in N sensing, as
    demonstrated in these studies, are summarized in Table VI. This table highlights
    the diverse IoT protocols and networks employed across different types of sensors
    and their specific uses in monitoring N levels in various environments. Table

    implementing IoT devices, it is crucial to consider environmental factors due
    to their significant impact on wireless communication. Researchers such as Luomala
    et al., Yi Lim et al., and Gabriele et al. 228–230 have conducted studies on the
    effects of various environmental factors across different frequency ranges. Luomala
    et al. and Yi Lim et al. 229,230 focused on the frequency range of 100 MHz to
    2.5 GHz, whereas Gabriele et al. 228 examined the range of 853–870 MHz. Based
    on these studies, environmental factors like temperature, humidity, vibration,
    and gas exposure exhibit varied impacts on wireless communication: 1.   Temperature:
    The studies by Gabriele et al., Luomala et al., and Yi Lim et al. 228–230 consistently
    show that temperature influences radio signal strength. Gabriele et al. and Luomala
    et al. 228,229 observe a negative correlation, where higher temperatures lead
    to weaker signals. However, Yi Lim et al. 230 suggest that higher temperatures
    might actually enhance signal strength. This variation implies that temperature''s
    effect may depend on specific conditions and frequencies. 2.   Humidity: Findings
    on humidity''s impact on signal strength are complex and somewhat inconsistent.
    Gabriele et al. and Luomala et al. 228,229 generally report that high humidity
    weakens signal strength due to the absorption and scattering of radio waves by
    water vapor. Conversely, Yi Lim et al. 230 highlight conflicting research results,
    with some studies indicating that higher humidity could strengthen the signal.
    This necessitates further research for a clearer understanding. 3.   Vibration:
    Gabriele et al. 228 note that vibration, particularly relevant in industrial IoT
    contexts, can reduce transmission performance. Nonetheless, technologies like
    LoRaWAN show resilience to vibration, especially with higher spreading factors.
    4.   Gas Exposure: As explored by Gabriele et al., 228 exposure to gases such
    as CO, NO, and NO2 in industrial settings appears to minimally affect LoRaWAN
    transmission capabilities, demonstrating the robustness of this technology in
    such environments. In conclusion, environmental factors undeniably impact wireless
    communication, yet the specific influences of temperature, humidity, vibration,
    and gas exposure vary significantly based on context, frequency, and technology.
    This emphasizes the need to consider these environmental factors in designing
    and deploying wireless communication systems, particularly in challenging or fluctuating
    environments. Challenges and Opportunities of Integrating N Sensing with IoT N
    sensing technology combined with IoT holds tremendous promise for SA, but several
    limitations must be acknowledged and addressed. Environmental factors such as
    temperature, humidity, vibration, and interference from other electronic devices
    can impact sensor performance, necessitating careful consideration during deployment
    and data interpretation. One significant limitation is the high initial cost of
    setting up an IoT-based N monitoring system, which includes expenses for wireless
    communication and remote server maintenance. Despite the availability of low-cost
    N sensors, the overall system cost can remain relatively high. Moreover, variations
    in sensor accuracy and reliability underscore the importance of proper calibration
    and maintenance to minimize errors. Handling and analyzing large volumes of data
    from IoT-based N sensors can be daunting, requiring specialized skills and software.
    Ensuring data privacy and security is also paramount. Integrating IoT and N sensing
    technology with existing farming or water management systems can prove challenging,
    demanding infrastructure investments and changes to workflows and data management
    practices. Additionally, these devices may require regular maintenance, particularly
    in areas with limited technical support, adding to the need for additional resources
    and expertise. To overcome these limitations, further research is warranted in
    several areas. First, the development of more accurate and reliable sensors capable
    of withstanding environmental variations and interference is essential for continuous
    monitoring. Machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques
    are critical for calibrating, analyzing, and processing sensor data, delivering
    real-time actionable insights. Research in developing selective electrodes targeting
    nitrate ions and minimizing cross-reactivity with other ions is also crucial.
    Implementing standard IoT protocols, such as MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, AMQP, or DDC, ensures
    reliable and secure data transmission over the network. Similarly, adopting robust
    wireless communication protocols like Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRaWAN, or Bluetooth can
    enable data transmission over longer distances and in challenging environments.
    Leveraging machine learning algorithms for analyzing large volumes of sensor data
    can unveil patterns, anomalies, and trends, providing actionable insights to farmers
    and stakeholders in the agriculture industry. Fig. 16 illustrates a range of IoT
    protocols and wireless networks suitable for integration into smart agricultural
    systems, highlighting their potential applications and interoperability. Zoom

    edge devices for advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms enable
    data-driven insights and pattern recognition, leading to a deeper understanding
    of N dynamics and more accurate predictions. Another opportunity lies in combining
    data from multiple N sensors to gain a comprehensive view of N levels in water
    and soil, enhancing measurement accuracy and reliability. By addressing these
    limitations and conducting further research in these areas, SA can become more
    efficient and sustainable, potentially boosting crop yield while reducing environmental
    impact. Continued advancements in N sensing technology and IoT integration hold
    promise for revolutionizing modern farming practices. Fig. 17 presents a conceptual

    photosynthesis optimization. CO2 sensors can significantly enhance crop yields
    in these controlled environments. 242,243 (8)   Atmospheric Conditions: Sensors
    that monitor ambient temperature, humidity, and light intensity are integral to
    precision agriculture, enabling tailored crop management and enhancing growth
    conditions. 244 (9)   Pesticide and Herbicide Residues: With a growing focus on
    sustainable farming, technologies capable of detecting chemical residues in soil
    are crucial for environmental protection and ensuring food safety. 245–248 (10)   Micronutrient
    Levels: Monitoring trace elements like zinc, iron, manganese, and copper is essential
    for plant health. Advanced sensors for these micronutrients can provide detailed
    insights into soil nutrient dynamics. 249,250 Additional Considerations: Data
    Integration and Analysis: It is crucial to integrate data from these diverse sensors
    to create a comprehensive agricultural monitoring system. This integration allows
    for a more nuanced understanding of the agricultural ecosystem, facilitating informed
    decision-making. Technological Challenges and Future Research: The successful
    integration of these varied sensors into a cohesive IoT framework presents technological
    challenges, including sensor compatibility, data synchronization, and network
    reliability. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring
    advanced data analytics and AI integration for predictive insights. User-Friendly
    Interfaces: Developing user-friendly interfaces for farmers and agronomists is
    essential for the effective utilization of complex sensor data. These interfaces
    should facilitate easy access to real-time data, trend analysis, and actionable
    insights, enabling users to make informed decisions swiftly. Environmental Sustainability
    and Stewardship: By expanding the monitoring spectrum beyond nitrogen, we contribute
    significantly to sustainable agricultural practices. This approach aligns with
    environmental stewardship goals, promoting responsible resource management and
    ecosystem health. By broadening the scope of IoT-based monitoring in agriculture
    to include these additional parameters, we can achieve a more nuanced and effective
    management of crops and soil health, paving the way for more sustainable, efficient,
    and productive agricultural practices. Discussion Material Characteristics and
    Their Impact on Sensor Performance: The efficacy of nitrogen sensors in smart
    agriculture is largely dictated by the material properties of the sensors. Recent
    advancements in nanotechnology have led to the development of nanostructured electrodes,
    which have significantly improved the sensitivity and selectivity of electrochemical
    nitrogen sensors. For instance, the use of graphene-based materials has been shown
    to enhance electron transfer, offering higher sensitivity in detecting nitrogen
    levels. However, the interaction between these nanomaterials and environmental
    factors such as humidity and soil acidity poses a challenge, potentially affecting
    sensor longevity and reliability. Therefore, a key area for future research is
    the development of materials that maintain high performance while withstanding
    environmental variabilities. Advancements in IoT Integration and Data Management:
    The integration of nitrogen sensors with IoT networks introduces a new dimension
    to material considerations. The data accuracy and transmission reliability of
    IoT systems are contingent on the stability and robustness of sensor materials
    under varying environmental conditions. Research should focus on materials that
    not only excel in sensor performance but are also conducive to seamless IoT integration.
    This includes ensuring consistent data transmission even in adverse environmental
    conditions, which is crucial for real-time monitoring in smart agriculture. Sustainability
    and Environmental Impact of Sensor Materials: Sustainability is becoming increasingly
    important in the selection of materials for nitrogen sensors. Biodegradable or
    eco-friendly materials are gaining attention, offering a way to minimize the environmental
    impact of sensor deployment in agriculture. Future sensor designs should consider
    not only performance but also the lifecycle and biodegradability of materials,
    aiming to reduce the overall environmental footprint of smart agricultural practices.
    Addressing Scalability and Deployment Challenges: The scalability of nitrogen
    sensors in agriculture hinges on the cost-effectiveness and maintenance requirements
    of the sensor materials. Materials that offer a balance between cost, durability,
    and performance are ideal for large-scale deployment. Practical challenges such
    as the ruggedness of materials in diverse agricultural environments and ease of
    sensor installation also warrant further investigation. Future Design Considerations
    for Nitrogen Sensors: Looking ahead, the development of smart materials with self-calibrating
    or self-cleaning properties could revolutionize nitrogen sensing in agriculture.
    The integration of multi-functional sensors capable of detecting various soil
    parameters, including moisture and pH, alongside nitrogen, could provide a more
    comprehensive soil health assessment. Such advancements would enhance the precision
    and efficiency of agricultural practices, paving the way for more sustainable
    farming methods. Standardization and Interoperability in IoT Systems: The integration
    of nitrogen sensors into IoT systems necessitates the standardization of communication
    protocols and sensor interfaces. This standardization is essential for ensuring
    interoperability among sensors from different manufacturers. Material choices
    can influence the design and functionality of sensors, impacting their compatibility
    within IoT networks. As such, future developments in sensor materials should align
    with the emerging standards in IoT technology to ensure seamless integration and
    functionality. Conclusions The integration of real-time N sensing with IoT technologies
    holds great promise for leverage of nutrient management in SA to SA. However,
    this approach also faces significant challenges that must be addressed. Environmental
    factors such as temperature, humidity, vibration, and interference from other
    electronic devices can affect sensor performance and must be considered during
    deployment. High initial costs for setting up an IoT-based N monitoring system,
    as well as the need for proper sensor calibration and maintenance, are additional
    challenges that must be overcome. Data management and integration also pose challenges,
    including collecting, delivering, and analyzing large amounts of data, ensuring
    data privacy and security, and integrating IoT and N sensing technology with existing
    farming or water management systems. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities
    for further research and development of sensors with high selectivity and sensitivity,
    capable of wireless communication through standardizing IoT protocols. Machine
    learning algorithms and advanced sensing technologies for data collecting and
    mining can help to overcome these challenges. Overall, real-time N sensing and
    IoT integration can provide farmers with valuable insights into crop health and
    nutrient management, leading to improved crop yields and reduced environmental
    impact. The full potential of this approach can be realized with continued research

    with their characteristics, pros and cons. Accordingly, it taxonomizes relevant
    solutions based on their achieved security requirements. Furthermore, the potential
    benefits and challenges of each of the four mechanisms are discussed. Similar

    Article 10 May 2021 1 Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a significant
    industrial revolution that involves a network of various “things” or embedded
    devices connected via sensors and communication protocols [1, 2]. These devices
    are designed to collect, exchange, examine, and monitor data. This interconnectivity
    enables seamless communication between things and people, things and environment,
    and between things themselves [3]. IoT collects information for the physical world
    utilization through smart systems with computational and communication ability
    [4]. Due to its widespread recognition, it is predicted that the number of IoT
    devices in use will reach 75 billion by 2025 [5] and is expected to grow to 125
    billion by 2030 [6]. The potential of IoT lies in its significant impact on different
    areas of daily life. Users can benefit from the smartness that IoT provides in
    both their professional and personal lives [3]. Some popular IoT applications
    are smart homes, smart cities, healthcare, smart industry, agriculture, smart
    grid, and autonomous vehicles. 1.1 Motivation and paper contributions IoT applications
    have the potential to reduce human intervention, improve data collection, and
    streamline analysis. However, the increasing number of devices and connections
    in use poses a significant challenge to the security of these systems [7]. Many
    academics are working to meet IoT security requirements and prevent specific threats.
    Therefore, existing security solutions are being adapted for IoT, such as classical
    and quantum cryptography [5, 8], besides the employment of emerging technologies
    like blockchain [9] and artificial intelligence [10]. The aim of these initiatives
    is to address further security challenges and establish a more secure environment
    for IoT. We have conducted a thorough analysis of review papers and numerous research
    papers related to IoT applications and the corresponding security solutions. The
    aim of this paper is to expose security perspectives in IoT and to perform a comprehensive
    study of potential solutions to enhance IoT security measures. There are many
    reviews in the literature about IoT security, but the main motivation of this
    paper is to consolidate the study of IoT security solutions based on blockchain,
    machine learning, cryptography, and quantum computing in one article to simplify
    the access of pertinent information. This guideline will be a useful and a timesaving
    resource for both new and established researchers in the field, as it will enable
    them to have the necessary concepts, to understand the effectiveness of each mechanism
    and its challenges. We summarize the contributions of this review as follows:
    We overview recent related review papers, and discuss and compare them in terms
    of defined criteria. We organize the IoT security solutions into four categories
    according to the used mechanism. We review, analyze, discuss, and compare the
    research approaches for each category. We apply a specific taxonomy for solutions
    within each category. We answer the research question we formulated regarding
    the global taxonomy that covers solutions from the four categories. We answer
    the research questions we formulated about the benefits and challenges of each
    category of IoT security mechanisms. The paper addresses the following research
    question: RQ1: What global taxonomy can we apply to the IoT solutions of the four
    categories? Additionally, the paper investigates the following two research questions
    for each “Mechanism i” out of the four defined categories: \\(RQA_i\\): What are
    the potential benefits of using “Mechanism i” in securing IoT ? \\(RQB_i\\): What
    are the challenges of applying “Mechanism i” in securing IoT? 1.2 Research methodology

    in securing IoT is in increase from 2019 to 2023. Besides, researchers in this
    field are consistently interested in applying cryptographic methods through time
    and they start to consider the use of quantum computing. The general inclusion

    solutions organized in four categories. The answer to the first research question
    is presented in Sect. 6. The answers to the following research questions are presented

    Full size image 2 IoT security perspectives IoT security perspectives refer to
    requirements and risks associated with the security of connected devices and their
    data. It is essential to address these security issues to protect the privacy
    and security of IoT users and prevent malicious activities. In this section, we
    define some of the most well-known IoT security requirements and attacks (Fig.
    3). 2.1 Security requirements Security approaches in IoT must consider specific
    requirements to ensure the secure deployment of IoT systems. The literature presents
    numerous security requirements related to IoT. In this subsection, we highlight
    the most well-known ones that will be utilized in our study within this paper.
    Authentication: Authentication is a fundamental security requirement in IoT systems.
    It involves verifying the identity of devices, users, or entities. It refers to
    the method by which one participant in communication gains confidence in the identity
    of another participant involved in the interaction [11]. By implementing authentication,
    IoT systems ensure that only legitimate entities can interact with the network,
    reducing the risk of malicious activities. Access control/Authorization: define
    authorizations to the network entities, in order to limit their access to specific
    actions, resources, or data within the network. Thus, it involves specifying the
    access privileges of entities, allowing them to engage exclusively with what is
    relevant to them [12]. It is important as it shields against unauthorized access
    to sensitive data. Failing to implement proper access control can lead to significant
    consequences, including serious outcomes such as data breaches, manipulation of
    devices, and compromised privacy [13]. Securely Transmitted Data: -Confidentiality:
    Given that IoT data traverses various points within a network, a robust encryption
    mechanism becomes essential to safeguard data confidentiality [14]. This ensures
    that only corresponding entities possess the ability to decipher the data [15].
    -Integrity: It refers to the assurance that the data generated and transmitted
    remains accurate, unaltered, and consistent. It ensures that data is not tampered
    with or modified by unauthorized parties [13]. Failing to prioritize these two
    aspects can lead to severe consequences. Breaches in confidentiality may lead
    to privacy violations and data leaks, while compromised data integrity could result
    in incorrect decisions, device malfunctions, and a loss of user trust [16]. Secure
    Data Storage: Regarding the sensitive and valuable nature of the information generated
    and processed by IoT devices, securing data storage is an important requirement
    [17]. Implementing strong encryption can secure the stored data. IoT systems produce
    vast amounts of data, often containing personal, financial, and operational details.
    Without robust data storage security, unauthorized access, tampering, or breaches
    could lead to privacy violations, financial fraud, and operational disruptions
    [17, 18]. Data Immutability: Data immutability refers to the state in which information
    is unable to be altered or modified after it has been recorded [19]. It ensures
    that once data is documented, it remains tamper-resistant, ensuring its accuracy
    and credibility over time. This property is significant in contexts where maintaining
    the fidelity of information is crucial for trust and reliability. Failure to ensure
    data immutability can result in tampered records and compromised trust, potentially
    leading to decisions made based on inaccurate or manipulated information [20,
    21]. Key Exchange: A secret key is defined and agreed upon between two network
    entities that want to initiate communication with each other. This key is used
    to secure this communication and the exchanged data [22, 23]. Attack/Threat Detection:
    Attack or threat detection in IoT security involves the monitoring and identification
    of malicious activities, unauthorized access, or abnormal behavior within an IoT
    ecosystem. It is crucial as it enables the timely detection and response to potential
    cyber-attacks/threats [24]. Lightweight Scheme: A security lightweight scheme
    refers to a set of security measures designed to provide effective protection
    for networks, while minimizing their impact on computational resources and performance.
    These schemes are important for resource-constrained environments like IoT devices,
    where limited processing power, memory, and energy availability prevent the use
    of more resource-intensive security approaches [23, 25]. Intelligent Mechanism:
    Intelligent mechanisms, driven by artificial intelligence, are essential in IoT
    security approaches, due to the dynamic and intricate nature of IoT ecosystems
    [26, 27]. Their usage and significance will be further elaborated in the subsequent
    sections. Quantum Attack Resilience: Quantum attack resilience is essential due
    to the potential threat posed by quantum computers to classical cryptographic
    methods [28]. Its usage and significance will be further elaborated in the subsequent
    sections. Fig. 3 IoT Security Perspectives Full size image 2.2 Attacks Various
    types of attacks are usually associated with IoT. In the following, some of the
    most well-known attacks, including those mentioned later in this paper, will be
    outlined. Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack: an attacker listens to a communication
    between two IoT devices and can manipulate the information exchanged [29]. This
    can lead to data theft or to false data injection [30]. Denial-of-service (DoS)
    attack: floods a target machine with traffic in order to overwhelm it and make
    it inaccessible to legitimate users [31, 32]. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
    attack: is a category of DoS attacks. It involves multiple connected devices that
    are used to overwhelm a target server with fake traffic [31]. Botnet attack: An
    IoT Botnet is essentially a group of infected IoT devices like routers, wearables,
    and embedded technologies. This malicious software enables attackers to control
    these devices and, subsequently, the entire network [29]. Eavesdropping attack:
    involves intercepting and recording communication between IoT devices to steal
    sensitive information [29]. Replay attack: entails intercepting and recording
    data from an IoT device’s communication and replaying it to gain unauthorized
    access [29]. Impersonation attack: The attacker utilizes the identity of an authenticated
    end user or end node to gain access to the network and exploit any security vulnerabilities
    [32]. Physical attack: implies physically accessing the IoT device and manipulating
    it to gain control. This can be done by hacking into a device’s firmware or using
    physical tools to tamper with the device [33]. Side-channel attack: exploits vulnerabilities
    in a device’s hardware to gain unauthorized access or steal data. The attacker
    exploits side channel data emitted by encryption devices, containing details like
    power usage, operation time, and fault frequency. This data helps the attacker
    uncover the encryption key [33]. It exploits information leaked by the device
    during its operation without the need to physically access the device like in
    a physical attack. Brute force attack: refers to a technique used to acquire unauthorized
    access, in which the attacker systematically guesses various possible combinations
    of a specific password. This process continues until the correct password is successfully
    identified. The time it takes and the number of combinations attempted depend
    on factors such as the length and complexity of the password [29]. Webshell attack:
    A webshell attack involves inserting a malicious script into a web server, allowing
    an illicit bypass of sensitive data and unauthorized remote access to the server
    [34]. 3 Background 3.1 Blockchain Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed digital
    ledger that safely and openly records transactions. Instead of being administered
    by a single entity, it is managed by a network of computers. Every entity of the
    network keeps a copy of the database, and all updates are logged in real-time
    and are available to everyone on the network [35]. The security of the blockchain
    derives from the way it is constructed. Each block in the chronological chain
    contains a distinct encrypted hash that links it to the previous one [36]. By
    using this method, an unbroken chain of records is created, making it very impossible
    to alter or delete any previously recorded transaction. Consensus protocols are
    an essential component of blockchain technology. They enable a distributed network
    of nodes to agree on the state of the blockchain without the need for a central
    authority or intermediary. Consensus protocols ensure that all nodes in the network
    have a consistent copy of the blockchain and prevent malicious actors from tampering
    with the data. There are several consensus protocols used in blockchain, including
    Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
    [37]. When combined together, IoT and blockchain technologies become able to ensure
    secure and transparent data sharing and can help overcome some of the challenges
    of IoT systems. IoT data can be stored, using the blockchain technology, in a
    decentralized, tamper-proof manner that is accessible to authorized parties. This
    can improve data transparency and trust by reducing data alteration or unwanted
    access [38]. Blockchain can additionally offer a way for IoT devices to securely
    exchange data and payments without the need for other intermediaries. Blockchain
    and IoT are being explored for usage in a number of applications, including smart
    contracts, supply chain management, and energy management. Blockchain can be used,
    for instance, in supply chain management to track the flow of goods from the producer
    to the consumer, ensuring that they are authentic and unaltered [39]. Blockchain
    in energy management can enable peer-to-peer energy trading, allowing people and
    companies to buy and sell extra renewable energy [40]. 3.2 Machine learning Artificial
    intelligence (AI) is a broad field that encompasses a range of technologies that
    enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such
    as perception, reasoning, and learning. Machine learning is a subset of AI that
    involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions
    based on that data [41]. Machine learning algorithms can be used for a variety
    of tasks, including the detection and prevention of security threats in real-time.
    There are a variety of machine learning techniques that can be applied to IoT
    security, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement
    learning [42]. Supervised learning algorithms can be trained to identify known
    security threats based on labeled data, while unsupervised learning algorithms
    can be used to identify unknown threats based on patterns in the data. Reinforcement
    learning algorithms can be used to optimize security protocols and response strategies
    based on real-world feedback [43]. Deep learning is a type of machine learning
    that involves using artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems.
    These networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that can learn to
    recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns [44].
    AI, machine learning, and deep learning are being used to automate and optimize
    a variety of tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy in areas such as security
    in IoT. 3.3 Cryptography Cryptography is the practice of securing communications
    and data through the use of mathematical algorithms and protocols. It has been
    used for thousands of years to protect sensitive information. The basic principles
    of cryptography involve using complex mathematical algorithms to encode messages
    or data in a way that makes them unreadable to anyone without the proper key or
    password. There are two main types of cryptography: symmetric key cryptography
    and public key cryptography [45]. Symmetric key cryptography, also known as secret
    key cryptography, uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption.
    The advanced encryption standard (AES) is a widely used symmetric key encryption
    algorithm. Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric key cryptography,
    uses a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
    The most widely used public key encryption algorithm is the RSA algorithm, which
    is based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers. Public key cryptography
    is often used in secure online transactions and digital signatures. Elliptic curve
    cryptography (ECC) is also a public key cryptographic method. It is based on the
    mathematical properties of elliptic curves. ECC is considered to be more efficient
    than traditional public key cryptography methods, such as RSA, as it uses shorter
    key lengths and requires fewer computational resources [46]. ECC is used in a
    wide range of applications, including secure online communication and digital
    signatures. Hash functions are another cryptographic method used to ensure the
    integrity of data. A hash function takes a message or data input and produces
    a fixed-length output, or hash, that is unique to that input. Even a small change
    to the input data will produce a completely different hash output, making it virtually
    impossible to modify the data without being detected [47]. The secure hash algorithm
    (SHA) is a commonly used hash function that is used to verify the authenticity
    of digital signatures and other forms of data. 3.4 Quantum computing Quantum computing
    is a type of computing that uses the ideas of quantum physics in order to process
    information. Traditionally, data is represented by bits, which are either 0 or
    1 [48]. Contrarily, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can be
    both 0 and 1 at the same time. This phenomenon is called superposition. Entanglement,
    another technique used in quantum computing, enables the connection of qubits
    in such a way that the state of one affects the state of another even when they
    are separated by a great distance [49]. Due to the special characteristics of
    quantum computing, some types of calculations can be completed more quickly than
    using traditional computers. In particular, quantum computers excel at simulating
    quantum systems, cryptography, and optimization issues [50]. In the context of
    IoT, quantum computing has important implications for security. It provides a
    new paradigm for cryptography which enhances the security of IoT devices and networks.
    Traditional cryptography techniques encrypt data by relying on the complexity
    of certain mathematical problems. Nevertheless, these techniques are easily broken
    by quantum computers since the latter can solve such mathematical problems exponentially
    more quickly than classical computers [51]. For instance, quantum key distribution
    (QKD) is an alternative approach offered by quantum cryptography, which takes
    advantage of the characteristics of quantum physics to allow two parties to share
    a secret key [52]. 4 Related surveys The rising impact of IoT security has motivated
    researchers to conduct surveys aimed at improving this technology’s usefulness
    to humanity. Therefore, in this section, we review recent survey papers on IoT
    security. Williams et al. [53] examined security threats in IoT from three angles:
    hardware, software, and data in transit. They illustrated how existing security
    solutions deal with the hardware limitations of IoT devices. Furthermore, the
    authors presented how cryptography, blockchain, and machine learning can be applied
    to IoT security. Then, they analyzed the security risks of blockchain and machine
    learning technologies. In [54], Corallo et al. presented a systematic literature
    review (SLR) in order to examine how the current state of the art presents the
    issue of cybersecurity awareness in the industrial IoT. Shirvani et al. [55] conducted
    a subjective survey study on trust management in IoT security. To design the survey,
    they considered the commonalities and differences of the state-of-the-art literature.
    They classified the studied state-of-the-art schemes and compared the published
    papers on these trust-based schemes. Swessi and Idoudi [56] offered a comprehensive
    categorization of the primary security concerns that stem from the IoT architecture,
    attack implications, and application fields. Then, the authors organized and illustrated
    various countermeasures adopted to mitigate these risks while taking into consideration
    the latest advancements in security methodologies. Sadhu et al. [29] are primarily
    interested in IoT attacks and vulnerabilities by classifying them based on distinct
    properties. Then, specific countermeasures for each type of attack are provided.
    Security solutions are presented based on secret key-based cryptography (KBC),
    physical unclonable functions (PUF), and blockchain. Alzoubi et al. [57] conducted
    a thorough examination of the challenges associated with integrating blockchain
    and IoT. Through a comprehensive analysis of relevant literature reviews and survey
    papers, this study aims to offer a comprehensive survey of these challenges and
    suggest strategies for mitigating their impact without discussing related research
    approaches. Additionally, this paper discusses forthcoming developments in the
    field of blockchain-IoT integration. In [58], privacy and security concerns in
    the current deployment of IoT in the industrial environment are defined and explored.
    Additionally, the critical implementation challenges of blockchain-enabled industrial
    IoT are analyzed through a review of relevant literature. Shah et al. [6] carried
    out a survey on blockchain-based solutions to mitigate DDoS attacks in IoT. The
    article discusses the vulnerability of IoT networks to DDoS attacks, the potential
    use of blockchain technology to address DDoS attacks in IoT, and their brought
    challenges. Various existing blockchain-based solutions to mitigate DDoS attacks
    in IoT are categorized and discussed. Savithri et al. [59] presented a brief overview
    of IoT security. The paper categorizes the solutions based on blockchain technology
    into eight distinct issues. In [60], the objective was to conduct a comprehensive
    analysis of various intrusion detection systems (IDS) especially those based on
    deep learning techniques. The study thoroughly examines publicly available network-based
    datasets of IDS. Besides, it evaluates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques
    using different performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, false
    alarm rate, F1 score, and detection rate. Additionally, the research discusses
    the current challenges and potential solutions for enhancing network security
    and privacy. In [10], a comprehensive survey is conducted to examine the latest
    machine learning algorithms employed for the identification of malware in business
    information systems that operate using IoT technology. The review encompasses
    existing research that has been conducted in the field of malware detection, comprising
    static, dynamic, promoted, and hybrid methods of malware detection. Sarker et
    al. [61] provided a comprehensive review of IoT security intelligence. They presented
    various machine learning techniques, deep learning architectures, and techniques
    for creating intelligent security models to address security challenges in the
    IoT environment. They also identified and discussed the research issues and potential
    future directions related to the scope of their study. Raimundo et al. [62] presented
    a review of type Systematic Review of Bibliometric Literature (LRSB) about cybersecurity
    in the IoT in Industrial Management (IIoT). The main focus of this review article
    was to analyze the literature trends related to the opportunities and threats
    in cybersecurity for IIoT. To achieve this, the authors provided a presentation
    of the current debate surrounding the topic of IIoT based on existing related
    literature reviews without analyzing related research papers. Khan et al. [63]
    aimed to comprehensively review current security issues, requirements, and standards
    in IoT, by presenting attacks in each IoT layer. Besides studying techniques for
    securing IoT as blockchain, machine learning, fog, and edge computing without
    giving the details of proposed approaches based on these techniques. In [64],
    Heidari and Jamali provided an SLR overview of the state-of-the-art techniques
    for IDS in IoT. The paper categorizes several important techniques of IDS into:
    signature-based, anomaly-based, specification-based, and hybrid. Then, it identifies
    key areas for future improvement in the discussed methods. Issa et al. [65] explored
    the integration of federated learning, blockchain, and IoT systems to enhance
    decision making and data analytics security. The survey emphasizes the importance
    of combining these technologies and provides an extensive review of blockchain-based
    federated learning solutions for IoT applications. Furthermore, the article also
    discusses the possible challenges of this integration. Kumari et al. [5] assessed
    different post-quantum cryptographic methods that are designed to withstand quantum
    attacks in resource-limited IoT environments. They explored the significance of
    these methods and the challenges that they pose. Omolara et al. [4] shed light
    on possible solutions to address the diverse security challenges faced by IoT.
    Their review covers topics such as the challenges of blockchain technology, as
    well as the increase in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks linked to
    the COVID-19 pandemic. Kumar et al. [66] reviewed multiple facets of quantum computing
    that may offer advantages to the current healthcare industry. Besides, they mentioned
    the possibility of combining this technology with blockchain without discussing
    existing related solutions. Jahangeer et al. [67] presented a comprehensive analysis
    of IoT network security from the standpoint of the network layer, while giving
    special attention to RPL (Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks).
    The study delves into internal attacks at the network layer, with a specific focus
    on tackling sinkhole attacks through both detection and prevention measures. The
    review encompasses recent research developments and it delves into the realm of
    machine learning-driven algorithms and strategies, exploring their potential to
    fortify the security of the RPL protocol against internal attacks. Taherdoost’s
    study [68] examines IoT security research, addressing topics such as authentication,
    wireless networks, use cases, challenges, and prospects. Additionally, it categorizes
    the examined research according to the context of data security. In the systematic
    literature research of [69], the authors looked at how AI-driven cyber-attacks
    are changing threats in Industry 4.0. They explored different cyber-attacks, defenses,
    and how AI can help. They also discussed the gap between research and real strategies.
    The purpose of the review is to plan for the future and make security better for
    Industry 4.0. In the article of [70], Mangla et al. conducted a comprehensive
    review of prevalent challenges within emerging technologies and 5G networks. The
    goal was to address these issues in preparation for secure 6G networks. Then,
    the authors outlined current quantum-based solutions for security concerns, aiming
    to establish a robust and secure 6G network environment. Mathur et al. [9] explored
    the capabilities of blockchain technology and studied its potential to address
    challenges in emerging IoT applications. The authors covered the role of blockchain
    in diverse IoT areas such as healthcare, smart homes, supply chain, smart city,
    and more. They explored important technical aspects related to blockchain-enabled
    IoT applications and examined challenges while discussing proposed solutions.
    Thabit et al. [8] presented an analysis of various cryptographic algorithms and
    their practical implementations for IoT security. They provided a comparison of
    security algorithms based on their performance and robustness, taking into account
    the computational complexity of cryptographic techniques. Additionally, the authors
    discussed the challenges of IoT security, providing insights into techniques for
    mitigation. In Table 1, we summarize the findings of these recent review papers
    and highlight the different perspectives of our review paper in comparison with
    others. Table 1 Comparative analysis of related surveys (BC: Blockchain, ML: Machine
    learning, Crypto: Cryptographic techniques, QC: Quantum computing, Comp: detailed
    comparison of related research approaches) Full size table 5 IoT security solutions
    In this section, we review and summarize the key findings of relevant approaches
    in IoT security, organized into four categories based on the used mechanism. We
    provide a comparative analysis of these approaches in terms of defined criteria
    such as used techniques, IoT application, network architecture, main purpose,
    verification tools, evaluation metrics, pros and cons. Then, a specific taxonomy
    for each category is provided. 5.1 Blockchain-based solutions Blockchain technology
    has emerged as a potential solution to the security challenges faced by IoT devices,
    with its secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof platform. Thus, in this subsection,
    we will provide an overview of the blockchain-based solutions proposed for enhancing
    IoT security. In [71], the authors proposed a blockchain-based architecture for
    securing and ensuring trustworthy operations in the industrial Internet of Things
    (IIoT). The idea is that IIoT poses significant security challenges due to its
    distributed nature, diverse technologies, and large-scale operations. The authors
    suggested using blockchain technology to establish a decentralized, tamper-proof,
    and transparent architecture for IIoT security because conventional security mechanisms
    are insufficient to meet these issues. The proposed architecture consists of three
    layers: the data layer, the blockchain layer, and the application layer. The data
    layer includes the devices and sensors that generate IIoT data. The blockchain
    layer uses a permissioned blockchain to manage and store IIoT data securely. The
    application layer includes the applications and services that use the IIoT data
    for various purposes. The proposed architecture was implemented using X-CUBE-CRYPTOLIB
    library, which has been certified for industrial use by the NIST Cryptographic
    Algorithm Validation Program. The implementation results show that the proposed
    architecture can provide secure and trustworthy operations in the IIoT by ensuring
    data integrity, authentication, and confidentiality while improving resource utilization,
    energy efficiency, and execution time. Nevertheless, the execution time of the
    proposed architecture increases rapidly with the increase in the number of devices
    in the network. Wadhwa et al. [72] proposed a blockchain-based approach for securing
    the Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) using federated learning (FL) and homomorphic
    encryption. Due to its distributed and heterogeneous nature, the CIoT poses significant
    security challenges. The authors suggested applying blockchain technology to address
    these challenges. To enable remote, distributed, and collaborative machine learning
    while maintaining data privacy, the proposed approach uses a federated learning
    framework. Homomorphic encryption is used to enable secure computation on encrypted
    data, without the need for data decryption. The proposed approach was implemented
    using the Amazon AWS platform with 1000 nodes of different types. The nodes were
    configured using Linux Virtual Machine. The obtained results showed that the proposed
    approach can provide secure and trustworthy machine learning in the CIoT by ensuring
    data privacy and security. The idea in [73] is to propose a blockchain-based data
    security storage system for IIoT; more specifically in the context of Industry
    5.0. The IIoT poses significant security challenges due to its large-scale and
    heterogeneous nature that can be solved by using blockchain technology. The proposed
    mechanism uses a permissioned blockchain to manage the IIoT data securely and
    transparently. The blockchain is used to verify the authenticity of data and prevent
    unauthorized access or tampering. The mechanism also uses a distributed file system
    to store and manage the large-scale data generated by the IIoT. The efficiency
    of the proposed mechanism was proved formally and the results have shown that
    it reduces the proof size and the communication consumption. The approach also
    reduced the storage pressure of nodes by storing a single commitment instead of
    the entire qualification list. However, by lowering the storage pressure on nodes,
    the proof size has been decreased from its original data scheme to 15%. Agyekum
    et al. [74] proposed a blockchain-based data-sharing mechanism using proxy re-encryption
    (PRE) to enhance the security of data sharing in edge/cloud architectures. Traditional
    data-sharing mechanisms in the IoT lack security and privacy protections, making
    them vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access. To address this, the
    paper proposed a mechanism that uses PRE, a cryptographic technique that enables
    data owners to delegate access to their data to others while maintaining data
    confidentiality and integrity. The mechanism also uses blockchain smart contracts
    to manage access control policies and permissions for data sharing. The proposed
    approach was first verified formally and then implemented using Windows operating
    system desktop computer and the jPBC library [75], which is a pairing-based cryptography
    library for Java. The results prove the efficiency of the approach in terms of
    data confidentiality, computation cost, and execution time. Nevertheless, once
    the data is stored in the blockchain, it is immutable and consumes more processing
    power which is not practical. In [76], the authors proposed a framework that leverages
    blockchain technology to provide secure and efficient access control in IoT systems.
    The framework, called BHE-AC, employs a hierarchical access control mechanism
    that enables different levels of access privileges for different entities in the
    IoT network. BHE-AC uses smart contracts to manage access control policies and
    enforce them in a decentralized manner. The authors also introduced a consensus
    algorithm called Proof of Access (PoA), which was designed to be more efficient
    than traditional consensus algorithms used in blockchain systems. PoA uses the
    access history of nodes in the network as a measure of their trustworthiness and
    determines the order of block validation based on this metric. The performance
    of the BHE-AC framework was evaluated using simulations and demonstrated that
    it can provide high efficiency and scalability while maintaining strong security
    guarantees. They suggest that BHE-AC can be a promising solution for access control
    in large-scale IoT systems. However, generating and distributing tokens in such
    networks can be time-consuming. Rizzardi et al. [77] proposed a permissioned blockchain-based
    approach for securing access control policies in IoT environments. The authors
    identified the challenges faced by traditional access control mechanisms in IoT,
    such as lack of scalability, flexibility, and reliability. They proposed the use
    of permissioned blockchain as a solution to these challenges, since it allows
    for decentralized, secure, and tamper-proof storage of access control policies.
    The proposed approach involves the deployment of a permissioned blockchain network
    that stores the access control policies, which can be accessed by authorized IoT
    devices. The blockchain network is managed by a set of trusted nodes, and each
    policy update is validated through a consensus mechanism. The proposed approach
    was evaluated through a case study using 4 Raspberry Pi, a variable number of
    PCs representing data sources, and an MQTT broker. The approach was evaluated
    in terms of latency, the time required for storage depletion, and CPU load. The
    results showed that the proposed approach enables to manage the data provided
    by heterogeneous sources in a distributed manner. However, the results also showed
    large packet sizes and much information exchange between the nodes. The authors
    in [78] proposed a blockchain-based security mechanism to enhance the security
    and privacy of medical data in IoT environments. The authors spotted the challenges
    of securing medical data in IoT environments, which include the need for confidentiality,
    integrity, availability of data, and the need for access control and accountability.
    They proposed the use of blockchain technology as a solution to these challenges.
    The proposed approach involves a fog computing architecture, which enables data
    processing and storage at the edge of the network, closer to the source of the
    data. The medical data is stored in a distributed ledger, and access to the data
    is controlled by smart contracts. Smart contracts enforce access control policies
    and enable the auditability of data access. The proposed approach was evaluated
    through a real experiment on a medical edge/fog/cloud system, and the results
    showed that the blockchain-based security mechanism can effectively enhance the
    security and privacy of medical data in IoT environments. However, the authors
    noted that the proposed approach is computationally intensive and may require
    further optimization. Chaganti et al. [79] discussed the integration of blockchain,
    cloud computing, and IoT to monitor security in smart agriculture. It highlighted
    the importance of ensuring security in agricultural processes and suggested that
    the proposed system can help address challenges such as data privacy and transparency.
    The work provided a detailed description of the proposed system architecture,
    which involves the use of blockchain technology to secure the IoT devices, cloud
    computing to process and store the data, and smart contracts to automate the process
    of monitoring security. The proposed architecture was implemented and tested using
    Arduino Sensor Kit, ESP32, and AWS cloud and the processing time was considered
    as an evaluation metric. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it stores
    malicious information to prevent future attacks for a smart-farm security monitoring
    framework. However, this framework is implemented to work with only one consensus
    algorithm which is the Ethereum Proof of Work (POW). The paper [80] discussed
    the security challenges associated with IoT and proposed a multilayer blockchain-based
    security architecture to address these challenges. The proposed architecture involves
    the use of multiple layers of security, including a blockchain-based secure communication
    layer, a blockchain-based secure storage layer, and a blockchain-based secure
    processing layer. This architecture was implemented and tested using MATLAB 2018a
    and evaluated through the transaction latency. The provided results showed that
    the architecture facilitates the lightweight authentication and authorization
    of IoT networked devices. However, limitations related to IoT devices were not
    taken into consideration such as energy consumption, small memory size, and low
    processing capabilities. In [81], the authors proposed an advanced security model
    for multimedia data sharing in IoT systems. They highlighted the challenges associated
    with securing multimedia data in the IoT, including the need to ensure data confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability. The proposed security model involves the use of multiple
    security mechanisms, including cryptography, watermarking, and access control,
    to secure multimedia data in the IoT. The implementation and testing of the proposed
    security model were provided using IPFS [82]. IPFS is a decentralized system used
    for storing and sharing multimedia files. Through the results, the authors demonstrated
    that their approach can provide high levels of security and can be applied in
    a variety of IoT applications. However, some interoperability problems are still
    unsolved in this context. The authors in [83] addressed the inherent challenges
    associated with traditional electronic voting (e-voting) methods, such as vulnerability
    to hacking, lack of transparency, and potential privacy breaches. They discussed
    the application of blockchain technology to enhance the security and privacy of
    e-voting systems by developing secure, trusted and democratized smart city services.
    The proposed e-voting system is implemented on the Ethereum platform and is made
    up of three core parts. The first part is an Ethereum wallet which handles users’
    authentication by creating encryption keys (public and private keys). The second
    part is the smart contracts which implement the core logic of the user voting
    process and counting the votes of users. The third part is the Ethereum blockchain
    which is the engine of the proposed e-voting system. The proposed system ensures
    that voters are legitimate, and the contract transactions are distributed and
    decentralized. The authors in [84] proposed an architecture for E-healthcare data
    security using a blockchain-distributed ledger technology named BHIIoT. In this
    work, a consortium hyperledger network is designed and deployed with two communication
    channels for node-to-node interconnectivity and data sharing. The proposed BHIIoT
    uses the NuCypher threshold re-encryption mechanism for data encryption and protects
    shared resources in the form of blocks preserved in a blockchain immutable storage.
    The BHIIoT distributed application is able to tackle data security issues, such
    as ransomware attacks, insider attacks, and data-sharing vulnerabilities in mobile
    medical applications and telemedical services. The proposed architecture achieves
    a reduction in the consumption of resources, such as computational energy, network
    bandwidth, and cost of data preservation, and increases productivity in terms
    of handling the generation of day-to-day data. Table 2 illustrates the comparative
    analysis of solutions based on the blockchain mechanism. Table 2 Comparative analysis
    of blockchain-based solutions Full size table According to this study, we classify
    BC-based approaches into three categories: permissionless blockchain, permissioned
    blockchain, and hybrid, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Blockchain-based approaches
    Full size image 5.2 Machine learning-based solutions The aim of analyzing and
    exchanging data among the various sensors is to enable an efficient decision making
    of how the systems should operate. Decisions are made based on artificial intelligence
    algorithms, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms specifically.
    To clarify, ML and DL algorithms are playing a key role in the field of cybersecurity
    as an alternative security solution for IoT-based applications, and by designing
    and implementing secure systems for IoT environment to protect the IoT devices
    from any authorized access and threats. Mihoub et al. [85] designed and implemented
    new architecture based on machine learning techniques that allow both detecting
    and mitigating the denial-of-service “DOS” as well as distributed denial-of-service
    “DDOS” attacks in IoT. The proposed architecture consists of two main components:
    DOS/DDOS detection component and DOS/DDOS mitigation component. The first component
    serves to identify the type of attack “DOS or DDOS” and the type of packets: UDP,
    TCP, and HTTP. This component uses conventional ML methods such as decision trees
    and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to more advanced DL methods including the multilayer
    perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the type of the
    attack. The second component mitigates the attack based on the result of the first
    component, and more precisely, the packets are denied from one IP address. The
    proposed architecture was evaluated based on two popular metrics such as accuracy
    and F1 measure using the Bot-IoT dataset. In addition, the work was compared with
    basic classifiers (machine learning algorithms). The classifiers are used to detect
    threats, which could include security breaches, malware, or other types of cyber-attacks.
    To this end, the evaluation shows highly promising accuracy results for the detection
    and mitigation of attacks that achieve an accuracy of 99.81%. However, IoT devices
    have limited resources such as memory and computing capabilities, which make it
    difficult to implement complex machine learning algorithms on the device itself.
    Thus, using cloud services to offload the computation may introduce other security
    concerns. Furthermore, the machine learning algorithms may provide false attack
    detection “false positive behavior” and lead to unnecessary disruption of normal
    device functioning. In contrast, the researchers need to test their proposed architecture
    on other IoT datasets. Yazdinejad et al. [86] proposed multiple deep learning
    models to identify cyber threats and improve the accuracy of attack detection
    in the industrial IoT environment. The idea behind the proposed work is to combine
    various machine and deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) and
    auto-encoder (AE) to detect abnormal attacks in the IoT environment. The combination
    of these models aims to create a powerful deep learning model and improve threat
    detection, additionally offering more detailed network traffic analysis, resulting
    in more precise and efficient cyber threat detection and mitigation. The proposed
    model was evaluated using two real datasets named secure water treatment (SWaT)
    and gas pipeline (GP). The evaluation results show a higher accuracy rate of 99.7%
    when compared with other machine learning classifiers even when with advanced
    existing models. However, the proposed model does not provide the exact location
    of anomalies in the system and its accuracy needs to be optimized and compared
    with other proposed advanced solutions Alkahtani et al. [87] proposed a robust
    framework based on deep learning for intrusion detection in IoT environment. The
    proposed work used three deep learning algorithms to classify the malicious activities:
    a long short-term memory (LSTM), a convolution neural network (CNN), and a hybrid
    convolution neural network with the long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model. Moreover,
    to improve the classification algorithms, the particle swarm optimization method
    (PSO) was applied in the preprocessing stage. An attack dataset named IoTID20
    was used to test the proposed framework. The experimental results have shown that
    the proposed framework can reduce attacks and enhance security in IoT environments,
    whereas the accuracy achieved was 96.60% and 99.82%, for CNN and LSTM, respectively,
    and 98.80% for CNN-LSTM combined. Thus, the framework proves that it can effectively
    detect real-world attacks. An intrusion detection system (IDS) based on deep reinforcement
    learning (DRL) algorithm was proposed by Tharewal et al. [88] to detect malicious
    activities and authorized access to industrial systems. In recent years, DRL has
    gained popularity among researchers due to its ability to learn how to deal with
    complicated issues via experimentation and failure and then improve its performance
    over time using a reward-based system. The system proposed is trained to detect
    patterns in data that are related to different kinds of malicious behavior, which
    help recognize possible risks on the industrial IoT. To clarify more, the combination
    IDS-based DRL provides various advantages compared to traditional IDS systems
    where it can both detect new and unknown intrusion, and it takes actions on incomplete
    or noisy data: typically in an industrial environment where devices “sensor and
    other” might not constantly provide accurate or complete data. The proposed system
    was evaluated using the real dataset of the industrial IoT publicly released by
    the US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The experiments have
    shown that IDS-based DRL is a powerful tool for protecting against several types
    of network threats on the industrial IoT. Thus, it gave better results compared
    with existing IDS based on deep learning in terms of accuracy, precision, recall
    rate, and F1 score. However, the proposed system does not provide intrusion detection
    in a distributed architecture which makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
    Moreover, it needs high computational resources, which affects real-time performance.
    A framework based forensics analysis was presented by Mazhar et al. [89] to detect
    attacks in IoT devices. Forensic analysis involves the identification, extraction,
    and assessment to what degree have the devices been damaged by the various attacks.
    The forensic analysis is carried out on the “logs” of the IoT devices, where logs
    refer to activities that have occurred on the device, like user actions, network
    activity or system events. The logs contribute significantly to investigating
    and identifying cyber-attacks on the device. The method used to detect cyber-attacks
    on IoT devices entails analyzing the device’s logs to identify signs of a cyber
    attack, such as unusual network activity or suspicious user behavior. This research
    uses various machine learning model for the test, whereas forensic logging server
    named security onion generate the dataset from the logs. The models’ performance
    is assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Based on the results
    obtained, the decision tree algorithm outperforms the other algorithms and demonstrates
    the best performance. The goal of Javeed et al. [90] research paper is to provide
    a hybrid deep learning mechanism to protect the communication between various
    devices in IoT. The mechanism is a combination of deep learning and software defined
    network (SDN) for securing communication in IoT. The attackers can compromise
    the exchange of the large amount of data among the IoT devices. In this research,
    the deep learning enhance the security and determine the potential anomalies and
    threats in IoT data, while SDN prevents and mitigate these anomalies by implementing
    secure policies. The classifiers used in this research for threat detection are
    Cuda-deep neural network, gated recurrent unit (Cu-DNNGRU), and Cuda-bidirectional
    long short-term memory (Cu-BLSTM). These are considered a type of deep neural
    network that is often used for natural language processing and speech recognition
    tasks. The mechanism’s evaluation achieves high performance in terms of accuracy,
    F1 score, precision, speed efficiency, and other evaluation metrics. The accuracy
    of the proposed mechanism achieved 99.87%. However, it is costly in terms of hardware
    and infrastructure implementation. Liu et al. [91] addressed how DRL is potentially
    utilized to protect industrial IoT systems. They started by developing a DRL-based
    controller to manage a specific process in an industrial setting (for example,
    manufacturing assembly). The DRL-based controller is installed on an edge computing
    server to enable automated control in an IIoT context. Secondly, the authors examined
    two types of attacks: function-based attacks and performance-based attacks. Function-based
    attacks are attacks that occurred before the training phase, which can be performed
    when the controller is learning how to carry out an assigned work or controlling
    an industrial process or system. On the other hand, performance-based attacks
    are attacks that happened after the training phase which provide either poor decision
    making or failure to adapt to changing conditions. They investigated these attacks
    to understand the potential sorts of threats that exist and develop strategies
    to mitigate them. Thus, in the evaluation of the impacts of the two investigated
    attacks, the researchers discovered that the success of the attacks increased
    as the accuracy of the control model increased. This emphasizes the importance
    of developing strong defenses against DRL-based controller attacks, especially
    as these controllers become more precise and complicated. However, the proposed
    work focused only on two types of attacks—many other attacks can occur against
    DRL-based controllers. Furthermore, it provided a simplified simulation environment—not
    accurate in real-world IIoT systems. Saba et al. [92] presented an intrusion detection
    framework based on advanced machine learning algorithms for IoT environment. In
    this solution, two fundamental methods were proposed. The first method is the
    genetic algorithm (GA) which was applied to choose the suitable features to enhance
    the accuracy of threat detection. The second method was dedicated to employing
    various advanced ML such as support vector machine (SVM), ensemble classifier,
    and decision tree. The evaluation results have shown that the accuracy achieved
    99.8% using a multi-class NSL-KDD dataset (dataset commonly used in the field
    of intrusion detection to evaluate the performance of ML and DL algorithms) and
    10-fold cross-validation. The model is capable of correctly classifying the various
    classes in the dataset. However, it is essential to point out that accuracy solely
    could not be the most effective metric to assess a classification model’s performance.
    Sahu et al. [93] proposed a new attack detection framework based on deep learning
    model to protect the IoT from malicious devices. Convolution neural network (CNN)
    is a type of neural network that is used to extract and analyze accurate data
    features. Furthermore, long short-term memory (LSTM) was combined with CNN to
    detect a wide range of attacks. Compared to other existing works, this research
    was evaluated using an up-to-date dataset that contains a bigger number of attack
    samples named IoT-23. The evaluation has shown that the hybrid proposed model
    can be an effective approach to detect a wide range of attacks and protect sensitive
    data in IoT environment. Additionally, the proposed model achieved an accuracy
    of 96%, which is a high percentage of malicious devices detection. However, the
    framework’s computational overhead was extremely high. Hasan et al. [94] examined
    the security challenges of the IIoT, especially the Botnet attacks. They proposed
    a hybrid DL approach to secure the IIoT from this kind of attack. Botnet attacks
    are a type of attack that compromises the network via computers to steal sensitive
    data, spamming, DDOS attacks or malware. To overcome this threat, a novel combination
    of long short-term memory-Deep Neural Network (LSTM-DNN) was proposed to identify
    attacks. To classify the various attacks, the N BaIoT dataset (the latest available
    dataset) was applied. The model proposed was compared with the existing hybrid
    detection model and it showed that can achieve a 99.94% of detection rate. However,
    their solution needs to be tested against other IoT attacks. Yong et al. [34]
    presented a solution based on an ensemble of machine learning models to detect
    the webshell’s threat in IoT environment. The webshell attack is a kind of malicious
    script that is injected inside a web server to perform an illegal bypass to the
    sensitive data and gain unauthorized remote access to the server. The solution
    used various traditional machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF),
    extremely randomized trees (ET), and voting. The experiments were conducted on
    these models to measure the validity of webshell intrusion. The experiments found
    that RF and ET were effective in detecting webshell intrusion in lightweight IoT
    devices, which means they are suitable for devices with limited resources. On
    the other hand, voting is effective for devices that have unlimited resources
    in IoT environment. However, The proposed model only tested for webshell threats
    on PHP scripts whereas IoT servers could be implemented with other programming
    languages. Jothi et al. [95] proposed a novel intrusion detection system (IDS)
    designed for IoT networks. The techniques used involve DL-based LSTM and a modified
    version called “whale integrated LSTM” (WILS) networks. The proposed system consists
    of three fundamental components: 1) The data collection component which collects
    the performance data of connected IoT devices, and 2) Device Recognition: when
    an attack is taking place, it recognizes devices that are performing maliciously,
    3) The attack type prediction: The system forecasts the kinds of attacks that
    have been launched in the IoT network. Real-time simulations of IoT networks under
    various attack scenarios are created using an API called OMENT-python to assess
    the proposed IDS. Furthermore, the performance of the suggested model is also
    compared to other well-known datasets including CIDDS-001, UNSWNB15, and KDD.
    WILS models have proven to perform better than other intelligent models that are
    already in use. They demonstrate greater accuracy, precision, and recall, proving
    they are suitable for protecting IoT networks. Musleh et al. [96] investigated
    the use of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems in IoT. The study
    primarily examined how feature extraction methods can boost intrusion detection’s
    accuracy. The study compared several feature extraction methods and machine learning
    models. The relevant data is extracted by feature extraction algorithms from the
    raw data gathered by IoT devices. These algorithms significantly affect the IDS’s
    overall performance and detection accuracy. Moreover, the study investigated methods
    for feature extraction, including image filters and transfer learning models (such
    VGG-16 and DenseNet). Several machine learning techniques are also evaluated,
    including SVM, K-nearest neighbors, and random forest. The study also investigated
    how well-stacked models combinations of several ML models perform. The integrated
    models’ performance is assessed using the IEEE Dataport dataset. According to
    the study’s findings, the VGG-16 (a particular neural network architecture) and
    stacking technique produced the best accuracy of 98.3%. This shows that the suggested
    methodology was successful in precisely identifying intrusions in the Internet
    of Things environment. Xu et al. [97] presented a novel approach for addressing
    cyber-attacks and network intrusion in (IoT) applications. The proposed work investigated
    machine learning-based intrusion detection techniques. But these algorithms frequently
    have issues with classification accuracy and their capacity to deal with multi-class
    classification problems. The research introduces a combination of a data-driven
    approach and automated machine learning (AutoML) for intrusion and anomaly detection.
    AutoML is employed to select the most appropriate algorithm with optimized hyperparameters
    for classifying the data. Thus, an algorithm that solves a multi-class classification
    problem possibly referring to categorizing various forms of attacks or anomalies
    is the result of this research. The algorithm’s outstanding 99.7% accuracy is
    achieved. This degree of accuracy far exceeds that of existing algorithms, demonstrating
    the accuracy of the suggested approach. The comparative analysis of solutions
    based on machine learning is presented in Table 3. Table 3 Comparative analysis
    of machine learning-based solutions Full size table According to this study, various
    approaches have been proposed for IoT security using ML. We can classify them
    into three main categories: 1) traditional ML-based approaches [34, 89, 92, 96,
    97], 2) DL-based approaches [88, 90, 91], and 3) hybrid approaches [85,86,87,
    93,94,95], a solution that combines the first two ones. For ML-based approaches,
    the approches used were: supervised and unsupervised approaches. For DL-based
    approaches, the approaches used were: deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Software
    Defined Network (SDN). For hybrid approaches, the exisiting works combine LSTM
    with ML methods. Figure 5 shows the taxonomy proposed for ML-based relevant solutions.
    Fig. 5 ML-based approaches Full size image 5.3 Cryptography-based solutions Cryptography
    includes all the processes aimed to encrypt information to ensure its security
    between the connected objects. Technically, the capacities of IoT are so limited
    that we cannot implement classic cryptography. In order to guarantee the authentication,
    integrity, and confidentiality of the data, it is necessary to design appropriate
    cryptographic mechanisms. Those cryptography mechanisms aim to respond to this,
    by building optimized solutions for these resource-constrained devices without
    compromising their level of protection. In [98], M. Khalifa et al. discussed a
    lightweight cryptography framework to secure memory heap in IoT. This solution
    deals with the problem of security loophole generated by the garbage collection
    used by object programming languages. This security vulnerability can be seen
    in the Next Memory Address Occupation (NMAO) attack, the memory replay attack,
    and the Learning Tasks Behaviors (LTB) attack. The aim of this study is to protect
    the system operation of the IoT environment from memory heap penetration and address
    modification attack, caused by the NMAO attack, which is capable of using the
    garbage in the heap attack through the LTB process. The authors used two steps
    to solve this problem: the first step is to execute a protection process from
    the user address using a trusted platform module, and to prevent the malicious
    operations which consist of usurping the identity of a third party, this step
    is called hardware authentication step. The second step consists of using a cryptographic
    hash function in order to make access violation more difficult for garbage collection
    in the object being executed. To secure the memory heap, authors used the garbage
    collection encryption based on cryptographic hash function, one-time key, and
    L-function-based elliptic curve cryptography. The hash function is used because
    it provides a large key space, that is why it has higher security. The IoT prototyping,
    the proposed frameworks, AES with SHA-1 and RSA with SHA-1 algorithms, have been
    simulated and implemented using Java NetBeans. The analysis of encryption and
    decryption computational times for the three algorithms shows that the proposed
    ECC-based hash and OTK has the lowest encryption and decryption times compared
    to AES and RSA with SHA-1. In [99], Liu et al. proposed a Multiple Application
    Secure Data Aggregation (MASDA) mechanism to ensure data confidentiality without
    losing the integrity of data transmission. The idea of this mechanism is based
    on cluster network topology. Each cluster member encrypts the data to send using
    the privacy homomorphic encryption algorithm based on the elliptic curve encryption
    algorithm, after encrypting the data, the same cluster member creates a shared
    key with the cluster head; this key will be used to generate a message authentication
    code that will be sent with the ciphertext to the cluster head. When the latter
    receives the message, it checks if the message authentication code of the ciphertext
    is valid. If so, the cluster head aggregates and transmits the ciphertext to the
    base station. Then, this aggregated ciphertext will be decrypted. The use of the
    homomorphic encryption algorithm is essential because even if someone knows the
    data, he could not calculate the message authentication code. The authors used
    a mechanism that includes the signature, the aggregation, and the verification
    algorithms; this mechanism is called iHMAC, which is an improved homomorphic message
    authentication code. The iHMAC can verify the integrity of the data and prevent
    the injection of false data by an attacker. The elliptic curve encryption scheme
    can reduce the communication overhead and the computation complexity by encrypting
    different application data that will be aggregated later at the cluster head in
    the ciphertext. Using this algorithm, the proposed mechanism provides confidentiality
    in the presence of a probabilistic polynomial time adversary; therefore, MASDA
    can defend against both active and passive attacks. OMNET++ is used as the simulation
    platform. The authors compared the simulation results of MASDA with those of EC-OU
    and EC-EG mechanisms. In terms of computation overhead, EC-EG is better than EC-OU
    and MASDA, but it has weaker encryption strength. As the base station has unlimited
    resources, the big computation overhead of MASDA in decryption does not affect
    the lifetime of WSNs. The second evaluation metric is communication cost; this
    metric is related to the length of the ciphertext. Results show that the length
    of ciphertext in EC-EG is smaller than the length of ciphertext in MASDA, and
    the ciphertext length of MASDA is also gradually smaller than EC-OU. Therefore,
    the decrease in communication cost is a challenge for future studies. The authors
    also compared the aggregation accuracy of the three mechanisms, and from the results,
    we can see that MASDA is the best one. Despite that, the impact of packet loss
    rates on aggregation accuracy should be verified. A Certificate-Based Signature
    Scheme for IIoT based on hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC) was presented
    by Ullah et al. in [100], in order to improve the security while using a small
    key size. This proposed system network is composed of five parts: the certificate
    authority that act as trusted third party, the cloud server that could be used
    to store the generated data from the IIoT devices, the IIoT objects and devices
    responsible for generating data and send it to the edge using the Bluetooth Low
    Energy technology, the fourth entity is the edge node, after receiving the certificate
    from the certificate authority, it creates the key pair and produce the certificate-based
    signature. This certificate-based signature is validated by the fifth entity,
    data users, after receiving it from IIoT devices. Both IIoT devices and data users
    transmit the data to a cloud server using a 5G wireless link. The authors used
    hyperelliptic curve cryptography that is similar to ECC but with a smaller key
    size, which is suitable for this type of network. A formal security analysis was
    performed using the Random Oracle Model and the hyperelliptic curve discrete logarithm
    problem (HECDLP), to ensure the security of the proposed scheme against two types
    of adversaries. After performing a comparison study about computational cost of
    the proposed scheme compared to other approaches, using exponential operation
    EPL, hyperelliptic curve divisor multiplications, and bilinear pairing. Results
    show an improvement in the computational cost of the proposed scheme, which means
    it consumes less time. Same as computational cost, results of communication cost
    show an improvement in computational communication overhead compared to the same
    other approaches. Khan et al. [101] developed a methodology with cosine function
    hybrid chaotic map encryption to deal with the huge data theft and privacy leak
    of patients’ data security and confidentiality in smart healthcare systems and
    industrial IIoT. Authors proposed an architectural adjustment to control the healthcare
    and IIoT system in a smart way. First, they presented the concept of extracting
    keyframes from images and visual information by installing visual sensors, they
    employed a keyframe extraction methodology with energy and bandwidth constraints
    in order to diminish data redundancy, and this lightweight extraction methodology
    used the improved YOLOv3 algorithm. The main focus of this methodology is to extract
    the proper keyframe from the summarized visual information (video), which comes
    from installed wireless multimedia objects in the smart healthcare system. Secondly,
    they used a lightweight cosine encryption function based on chaotic hybrid map,
    the idea is to generate a pseudorandom number sequence from the cosine function
    of chaotic sequence with the incorporation of a secret key into the keyframe images,
    and then, it performed confusion and diffusion operation into the keyframe image.
    This approach has a strong security against any type of adversary. This methodology
    could be applied to, not only, YOLOv3 algorithm, but to many other hybrid technologies
    such as Python and TensorFlow. Simulation of this approach has been done by MATLAB,
    and the security analysis has been made with the help of test images from the
    USC-SIPI database of digital images. This analysis shows an efficient security
    in terms of encryption speed compared to eight other methods with different keyframe
    sizes. The second metric is the histogram analysis, which is an illustration of
    the graphical representation of the pixel rate distribution in the keyframe images.
    This analysis shows that the proposed approach has avoided statistical and numerical
    attacks, and also has ensured integrity and consistency during transmission. Numerous
    other security analysis results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology.
    This approach has also minimized the storage cost, the bandwidth and the communication
    and transmission cost. The weak aspect in this work is the use of public keys
    for encryption. Jerbi et al. [102] investigated the security issues that threatened
    IoT networks. They developed a lightweight cryptographic technique based on ECC.
    The proposed scheme is called CoopECC that requires distributed and cooperative
    tasks between the network nodes to alleviate the ECC computations, specifically,
    the scalar multiplication point. The authors considered a cluster-based architecture
    where the cluster head (CH) is responsible for collecting, encrypting, and forwarding
    the data to the IoT gateway. The CH memory is shared between its cluster members
    and contains all exchanged data. To accelerate the ECC point multiplication, the
    scalar bits are divided into several parts equal to the number of cluster members.
    Each member performs the multiplication and returns the output to the CH that
    combines all received results. The CoopECC provides better time consumption compared
    to the baseline ECC. However, it is not secure against malicious cluster members.
    Chanal et al. [103] proposed a hybrid encryption scheme that leverages the advantages
    of message digest algorithm (MD5), advanced encryption standard (AES), and ECC
    to secure IoT communications. It involves three phases: generation of plaintext’s
    hash value at the source node using MD5, key generation using ECC, and encryption
    of the digest using AES. The ciphertext is added with the public key and a geotag
    (i.e., the receiver location information shared with the sender) and then sent
    to the destination node. The proposed scheme achieves an improved encryption time,
    low end-to-end delay, and high throughput compared to AES algorithm. Nevertheless,
    it is vulnerable to collision attacks since it is based on MD5 algorithm. Unal
    et al. [104] proposed the SCSS, a secure cloud storage system for cloud-based
    storage environment without the need for complex certificate management, with
    secure and efficient Type-3 pairings, supporting Encryption-as-a-Service (EaaS)
    and multiple Public Key Generators (PKGs), based on SAKKE-IBE scheme. The first
    fundamental concept of the SCSS-SAKKE-IBE scheme is EaaS, the role of EaaS is
    to avoid implementing an encryption application on the user’s device, encryption
    can therefore be provided by this service; therefore, it makes it possible to
    reduce the difficulty of encryption and key management tasks without losing data
    confidentiality. The second fundamental concept is identity-based cryptography
    (IBC) and its most important application: identity-based encryption (IBE). In
    IBE, the unique information about the identity of a user is his public key, as
    it is a type of asymmetric encryption, the encryption is performed using the public
    key and the decryption using the private key, if the user keeps its private key
    safe, EaaS will never be able to decrypt the data. The problem of EaaS service
    provider is the lack of trust, and the key generation method in the identity-based
    cryptography is based on escrow mechanism that requires trust, the solution of
    this problem is the distribution of trust by using the PKG method. To improve
    system security and distribute trust to the encryption service, the authors used
    an additional Trusted Third Party (TTP). The main components of the proposed scheme
    are the user client or end users, service controller where the services are listed,
    key management service responsible for generating the public keys, encryption
    service ensures all encryption processes, and storage service that performs file
    storage on local or cloud storage. Analytical and experimental results show that
    the proposed SCSS-SAKKE-IBE scheme gave better results compared to other IBE-based
    cloud security solutions such as HIBE and ABE, first it managed to reduce the
    encryption and decryption time. Scalability also has been improved, especially
    for the decryption process, which increases the level of security and performs
    well in IoT-based environments where the number of users is large. The improvement
    of decryption operation is necessary since it is needed for forensic analysis.
    Liu et al. [105] a multi-keyword encryption and searchable scheme based on attributes
    supporting privacy and integrity concepts of health data to ensure the application
    functions of the medical IoT (mIoT). The proposed scheme relies on two main properties,
    anonymous key generation, and access validity. First property was used because
    the private key must be generated anonymously based on blind signature, the main
    idea here is that the Trusted Center Authority generates private keys but cannot
    decrypt the ciphertext. To ensure the access validity of the shared data, authors
    presented a time division mechanism with a hash function. The main framework is
    composed of seven phases: System Setup, User Registration where the anonymous
    key generation algorithm is called between the Center Authority and the system
    user, Ciphertext Uploading to encrypt data, Trapdoor Generation, Authorization,
    Ciphertext Retrieval, and Ciphertext Decryption. A theoretical performance evaluation
    and comparison was made between the proposed work and several related works in
    terms of functions and computational complexities of the proposed schemes, and
    a series of experimental performance evaluation shows the efficiency and feasibility
    of this scheme. Results show that this scheme has better functionality compared
    to ABKS schemes in terms of access validity, integrity verifiability, and key
    escrow. The proposed work provides an anonymous key generation mechanism which
    is suitable for cloud storage and practical applications in mIoT. Results of computation
    overhead show also that this scheme has less amount of computation in encryption,
    index generation, trapdoor generation, search and decryption compared to other
    schemes. Simulation results show that the computation costs of the proposed scheme
    are efficient in application compared to the other ABKS schemes. Therefore, it
    can be used to resource-constrained devices. Sahmi et al. [106] discussed a new
    approach that secures the MQTT IoT application protocol, this approach consists
    of using AugPAKE Algorithm and PRESENT lightweight encryption on the PUBLISH messages.
    The main idea is based on Aug-MQTT solution by bringing more lightness and security
    to the MQTT communication between publisher and subscriber. The difference between
    Aug-MQTT and the proposed approach is that authors in Aug-MQTT used AES as a secure
    symmetric key encryption, which is too heavy for IoT environment also they only
    used encryption in client to broker way. In the proposed scheme, authors used
    an end-to-end encryption using PRESENT algorithm, and AugPAKE algorithm to establish
    a secure key session. The solution supported some security properties: authentication
    between the broker and their clients, confidentiality because the message is protected
    using the secure session generated by AugPAKE and encrypted using the PRESENT
    encryption. Also, the solution ensures Integrity and non-repudiation properties
    by maintaining end-to-end security in the communication. The proposed contribution
    has some advantages compared with other works like mutual authentication, confidentiality,
    privacy, and integrity. It also shows robustness against Man-in-the-middle attack,
    the offline password guessing attack, and replay attack. But the comparison of
    the estimated cost time between the proposed solution and Aug-MQTT and Auth-MQTT
    approaches does not show advantages of the proposed scheme. This approach needs
    to be simulated on an appropriate architecture in order to see its robustness
    against attacks. Gong et al. [107] addressed the lack of security caused by resource-limited
    in IoT environments, they presented an efficient certificateless hybrid signcryption
    scheme. The purpose behind this scheme is to ensure security and efficiency of
    data transmission in IoT. The advantage of the certificateless cryptography system
    is that it solves the problem of public key authentication and key escrow in IoT
    by forming a public key using the public information of the connected object;
    moreover, it uses the Key Generation Center to generate the private 2key. But
    it still has some problems in securing the transmission, because it is not easy
    to simultaneously ensure the different IoT security concepts such as semi-public
    verifiability, forward security, and known session-specific temporary information
    security with the existing systems, and also, the problem of resource-constrained
    devices created by the big amount of resources consumed by bilinear operation.
    The proposed solution to this last problem is to put the bilinear calculation
    process in the initialization phase to guarantee security in the communication
    process, and to replace the communication process with an exponential computation.
    Authors used Random Oracle Model, Computational Diffie-Hellman, and Decisional
    Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) problem assumptions to prove the security of the
    proposed scheme. The efficiency of the proposed scheme has been compared to existing
    certificateless hybrid signcryption schemes using computing overhead and communication
    cost. Results show that the proposed scheme improves computational efficiency
    and has higher security. Mousavi et al. [108] addressed the security of data transmission
    in IoT-based smart irrigation systems. They proposed an encryption scheme based
    on ECC, secure hash algorithm (SHA-256), and artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC).
    This latter is employed to optimally generate the private key in ECC that is used
    for the decryption process. The SHA-256 guarantees data integrity in all types
    of communications. Furthermore, bit-wise and left-shift operations were applied
    after ECC encryption to strengthen data confidentiality. The proposed scheme is
    assessed in terms of encryption/decryption times and throughput. It outperforms
    three cryptographic models including RSA-AES, 3DES-ECC-SHA-256, and RC4-ECC-SHA-256.
    In addition, it tackles relevant security attacks orchestrated by malicious adversaries,
    such as man-in-the-middle and brute force attacks. Bettoumi et al. [109] proposed
    LC-DEX: a secure and efficient energy solution to deal with the challenges of
    IoT environments such as requirements of high-level security and limited capabilities
    of its connected devices. Authors used a suitable protocol for constrained devices:
    the Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange (HIP DEX) because it is resistant to
    some types of attacks like denial-of-service and man-in-the-middle attacks. The
    solution is based on the compression of 6LoWPAN header, using CoAP and RPL protocols.
    To reduce the energy costs, authors used four essential HIP signaling packets
    (UPDATE, NOTIFY, CLOSE, and CLOSE_ACK), but proposed to remove the NOTIFY packet
    for security consideration, and as another possible optimization is to remove
    the CLOSE_ACK packet and terminate immediately the connection after sending the
    CLOSE packet. To optimize the communication overhead of HIP DEX packets, HIT_I
    and HIT_R header fields have been omitted and DNS has been introduced in the HIP
    DEX opportunistic mode to minimize the computation cost. The evaluation of the
    proposed scheme was conducted on a real experimental platform called FIT IoT-LAB
    using CoAP as an application protocol, TCP protocol in transport layer, and 6LowPAN-RPL
    as a network protocol. HIP DEX code has been modified to enable handshakes in
    6LoWPAN. The performance of HIP DEX packet header compression shows an excellent
    minimization in HIP DEX handshake packets’ sizes, end-to-end transmission and
    propagation delay, and processing overhead. The evaluation of the energy consumption
    during the HIP DEX handshake execution shows improvement in multi-hop energy communication
    cost in comparison of some existing solutions. The proposed distribution model
    contributes to secure communication over the IoT-based-WSN architectures with
    minimal energy. In [110], Kumari et al. proposed a secure data transmission model
    for e-health applications, using the two principal encryption algorithms RSA and
    AES, and two steganography techniques. The suggested scheme is made up of four
    processes, in the first step, data is encrypted using AES’s secret key and RSA’s
    secret public key. The RSA’s private key will also be encrypted using the AES
    key. In step two embedding procedure, the steganographic approach Haar-DWT is
    implemented. The 2D-DWT-2L method is used in the third step to extract the secret
    message. And in the last step RSA’s private key is used to decrypt the encrypted
    data. The numerical simulation tests show that the proposed model results better
    peak signal-to-noise ratio (PNSR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM),
    and mean squared error (MSE) compared to DWT and DWT-DCT works. It also shows
    better resilience to attacks on the filter, and noise. Al-Zubaidie [111] presented
    a new key exchange model based on lightweight and high-security techniques for
    e-health applications. Two algorithms were used in this scheme; Elliptic curve
    Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) protocol which is a lightweight version of Standard Diffie-Hellman
    (DH) used to reduce the large keys size of DH. The second algorithm used in this
    protocol is the lightweight QUARK hash function (QH). The proposed model contains
    five steps; first, in the pre-deploiment phase, the network devices are loaded
    to the Base Station with default settings. In the second step, the sensors complete
    the registration process, the Quark algorithm is used in this step. Keys update
    phase is the third phase which ensures that keys are new and safe using ECDH protocol.
    The next phase is session key distribution. And final step is the session protection
    phase where the keys are stored on a protected device. The proposed protocol has
    been simulated using the Scyther tool and results showed that it was safe against
    attacks and threats, and also it balanced security and performance results. Table
    4 presents the comparative analysis of solutions based on cryptography. Table
    4 Comparative analysis of Cryptography-based Solutions Full size table According
    to this study, we classify Crypto-based approaches into three categories: Traditional
    cryptography, Modern cryptography and Lightweight cryptography, as illustrated
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Crypto-based approaches Full size image 5.4 Quantum Computing-based
    Solutions The emergence of quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize
    various fields, including the security of IoT. Researchers have proposed quantum
    computing-based solutions to enhance the security and privacy of IoT devices.
    In [112], the authors proposed a quantum computing-based optimization technique
    for the IoT platform using a modified deep residual approach. The IoT platform
    generates a vast amount of data, which requires efficient processing and optimization
    techniques. The proposed approach combines quantum computing with deep learning
    techniques to optimize the performance of the IoT platform. The idea of the proposed
    approach is to first convert the classical deep residual network into a quantum
    circuit using a quantum circuit library. Then, the quantum circuit is trained
    on a quantum simulator or quantum computer using a quantum neural network. Finally,
    the trained quantum circuit is converted back into a classical deep residual network.
    This method leverages a quantum hash function to enhance the security of information
    transmission. It also uncovers potential threats within an RNN and CNN architecture
    and facilitates the analysis of threats and the exploration of intricate network
    patterns in noisy data, in order to establish robust security measures for IoT
    data. It is also designed to reduce the training time and to improve the accuracy
    of the IoT platform. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach
    outperforms traditional techniques in terms of accuracy and training time. Shahid
    et al. [113] proposed a new approach to secure the IoT using a distributed ledger
    that is resistant to attacks from quantum computers since the current security
    measures used in IoT are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. The idea is
    to use a post-quantum distributed ledger that is based on a lattice-based cryptosystem.
    The latter is known to be resistant to attacks from quantum computers due to the
    difficulty of solving certain mathematical problems in this system. Each IoT device
    participating in the ledger keeps a copy of the ledger and contributes to the
    consensus process by validating transactions and verifying the integrity of the
    ledger. Blocks containing transactions are added to the ledger in a decentralized
    and secure way. The ledger also makes use of a consensus method to guarantee that
    everyone agrees on the ledger’s current status. To ensure that the proposed approach
    is lightweight, energy-efficient, and suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices,
    the authors proposed the use of a proof of storage mechanism, which eliminates
    the need for participants to perform computationally demanding proof of work (PoW)
    or proof of stake (PoS) calculations in favor of storing a small amount of data.
    The proposed approach also included a security analysis which proves that the
    system is resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers. Moreover,
    the performance results showed that the system is efficient and suitable for use
    in resource-constrained IoT devices. However, the use of a lattice-based cryptosystem,
    which is the backbone of the proposed approach, may require additional computational
    resources, especially for devices with limited processing power. This may limit
    the adoption of the proposed method in some IoT applications. In [114], the authors
    proposed a new approach to improve the security of the internet of vehicles (IoV).
    The approach uses a post-quantum signature and is based on a new technique to
    perform division operations in the lattice-based cryptosystem, called systolic
    divisions, which improves the system’s efficiency. The main idea is to use digital
    signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of messages exchanged between
    IoV devices. This provides enhanced security compared to traditional cryptographic
    algorithms. On the one hand, the lattice-based cryptosystem is based on the mathematical
    concept of lattices, which are complex mathematical structures that can be used
    to encode information in a way that is difficult to decipher. On the other hand,
    the use of systolic divisions improves the efficiency of the signature generation
    and verification process, making it suitable for use in resource-constrained IoV
    devices. Systolic divisions are based on a hardware-efficient approach that allows
    the efficient implementation of division operations in hardware. A security analysis
    of the proposed approach was used to prove its efficiency. It showed that it is
    resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers. Qu et al. [115]
    proposed a new secure quantum fog computing model based on blind quantum computation
    (BQC). The proposed model combines quantum computing and fog computing in order
    to provide a more secure and efficient approach to data processing in a distributed
    computing environment. The proposed architecture consists of three layers: the
    cloud layer, the fog layer, and the device layer. The cloud layer provides high-level
    services. The fog layer provides local services to devices in proximity. The device
    layer consists of the edge devices that collect and process data. The authors
    also proposed a new quantum fog computing protocol based on BQC, which enables
    secure data processing in a distributed environment. The protocol uses homomorphic
    encryption to encrypt the input data, and BQC to perform the computation on the
    encrypted data. The computation result is then decrypted using a private key,
    ensuring that the data is processed in a secure and private manner. The authors
    proved the efficiency of the proposed architecture and the proposed approach by
    analyzing different attacks on one fog node. However, the use of homomorphic encryption
    can add computational overhead, which may impact the performance of the system.
    In [116], a new scheme based on continuous-wave (CW) technology was proposed.
    The idea is that CW is more compatible with existing fiber-optic communication
    networks than previous pulse-based quantum cryptography schemes. The approach
    was designed to be adaptable, allowing for various security levels and network
    condition changes. Additionally, it has zero-trust security, which means that
    it does not rely on a central authority or key distribution. In the proposed scheme,
    the sender (IoT device) creates a stream of single-photon pulses using a continuous-wave
    laser, which are subsequently sent via the fiber-optic network. The single-photon
    detectors used by the IoT devices that are receiving the pulses measure the photons’
    states to identify the communication’s encryption key. The scheme incorporates
    various security measures to prevent attacks, such as eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle
    attacks. It also includes mechanisms for error correction and privacy amplification
    to ensure that the transmitted data is accurate and private. The performance of
    the proposed idea was demonstrated formally and the results showed its ability
    to provide secure communication for IoT devices. Even though the proposed scheme
    is flexible, allowing for different levels of security and adaptability to changing
    network conditions, its transmission distance may be limited by factors such as
    photon loss and noise in the fiber-optic network. It also may not be scalable
    to large-scale IoT networks. A post-quantum signature strategy based on the MQ
    (Matsumoto-Imai) cryptosystem was proposed in [117]. The MQ cryptosystem is a
    family of public key cryptosystems based on multivariate polynomials over finite
    fields. It is suitable for securing IoT devices against attacks by quantum computers.
    As the suggested scheme was designed to be efficient and scalable, large-scale
    IoT networks can use it effectively. The idea is to use a one-way function a trapdoor
    function in order to generate a secret key and a public key. The one-way function
    is a mathematical function that is easy to compute in one direction but difficult
    to compute in the opposite direction, making it suitable for generating a secret
    key that cannot be easily reversed. The trapdoor function is a variant of the
    one-way function that includes a secret parameter, known as the trapdoor, which
    allows the function to be easily reversed when the secret parameter is known.
    The secret key is used to sign messages, while the public key is used to verify
    the signature. The authors also proposed a parallel implementation of the signature
    scheme, which utilizes the multi-core architecture of modern processors to improve
    efficiency and reduce computation time. The parallel implementation is adaptable
    to different hardware configurations, making it practical for use in a wide range
    of IoT devices. The proposed scheme was implemented on a GPU device and proved
    its efficiency and scalability. However, the idea requires significant computational
    resources. Chikouche et al. [118] proposed a privacy-preserving code-based authentication
    protocol for IoT devices that assures secure communication between devices and
    prevents unauthorized access. The idea of the proposed approach is to use the
    McEliece cryptosystem which is a code-based encryption algorithm that is resistant
    to attacks by quantum computers. The protocol consists of three phases: key generation,
    authentication, and session key establishment. Using the McEliece cryptosystem,
    a private key and a public key are formed during the key generation stage. While
    the device owner keeps the private key a secret, other devices can access the
    public key. During the authentication phase, the device sends a request to the
    server including its public key and a random challenge. The server responds with
    an encrypted challenge, which the device decrypts using its private key. The device
    then sends the server the decrypted challenge in order to validate its authenticity.
    In the session key establishment phase, The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol
    is used by the server and the device to create a shared session key. All subsequent
    messages sent between the device and the server are then encrypted and decrypted
    using this key. Even though the efficiency of the proposed idea was proved formally,
    it requires significant computational resources to be implemented. In [119], a
    secure data encryption scheme for the 5G IoT scenario based on quantum walks was
    proposed. It uses the properties of quantum walks to encrypt data and ensure its
    security during transmission. The idea is to encode the data into quantum states
    that are then put through quantum walks. A quantum walk operator modifies the
    quantum states based on the encryption key after generating the encryption key
    by a quantum random number generator. The receiver receives the encrypted data
    and uses the same encryption key to decrypt it. The authors proved the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach and showed that their idea is resistant to common attacks
    such as brute force. They also showed that the approach has low computational
    overhead and can be efficiently implemented in resource-constrained IoT devices.
    Yet, the proposed approach has limited scalability. L. Chen et al. [120] proposed
    a dynamic on-demand key allocation scheme for securing the communication between
    IoT devices in a quantum network. The proposed approach is based on quantum key
    distribution (QKD) technology in order to establish secure keys between IoT devices,
    and dynamically allocates keys based on the communication requirements of the
    devices. The approach is designed to be scalable and efficient and can be adapted
    to different network topologies. The approach is mainly composed of two phases:
    initialization and key allocation. During the first phase, a central authority
    generates a unique identifier for each QIoT device. The private keys are safely
    kept on the devices while the public keys are made accessible on a public key
    server. In the second phase, a device can request a new key from the central authority
    anytime it needs to establish a secure communication with another device. The
    central authority assigns a new key to the requesting device via the Dynamic Distributed
    Key Allocation (DDKA) technique. The proposed approach was evaluated through simulation
    using MATLAB R2020b and the obtained results showed its efficiency. However, the
    approach suffers from the key distribution overhead. In [121], the authors proposed
    a location-based lattice cryptography scheme for IoT systems. The proposed scheme
    uses a combination of lattice-based cryptography and location information to establish
    secure communication channels between IoT devices. It has two main components:
    a key distribution protocol and a data encryption/decryption protocol. The key
    distribution protocol implicates generating a shared secret key between two devices
    based on their location information and a pre-shared secret key. The shared secret
    key is created using the location-based lattice cryptography method and is resistant
    to quantum attacks. The shared secret key is used in the data encryption/decryption
    protocol to encrypt and decode data sent between the two devices. The proposed
    approach was evaluated using the open-source NB-IoT D2D simulation. The obtained
    results showed that the approach is resistant to many attacks but its dependency
    on the location information is one of its main limits. Shamshad et al. [122] proposed
    an enhanced architecture to resolve public key cryptographic issues in IoT by
    employing quantum computing supremacy. This proposed architecture seeks to address
    the security flaws of widely utilized classical public key cryptography algorithms
    in IoT by using more secure quantum-based alternatives. The proposed architecture
    consists of three main components: a quantum key distribution (QKD) system, a
    quantum random number generator (QRNG), and a quantum digital signature scheme.
    The QKD system is used to establish a secure communication channel between IoT
    devices by transmitting quantum states between a sender and a receiver which guarantees
    that any attempt to eavesdrop on or intercept the transmission will be quickly
    discovered. The QRNG is used to generate random numbers that are used in the encryption
    process which makes the latter much more secure. The quantum digital signature
    scheme is used to sign and verify messages exchanged between IoT devices. It is
    based on using one-way functions that are easy to compute in one direction but
    hard to reverse. The proposed approach was simulated using SimuloQron for quantum
    key distribution (QKD) and the obtained results showed its efficiency and flexibility.
    Nevertheless, the proposed approach is limited to certain types of IoT systems.
    Authors in [123] proposed a nested hash access system with post-quantum encryption
    to solve the issue of secure ultrareliable low-latency communication in mission-critical
    Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed system performs random repetition coding
    and nested hash coding on multidomain physical-layer resources to encode and decode
    preambles precisely and resiliently. The idea is to use an encryption mechanism
    based on quasi-cyclic (QC)-moderate-density parity-check (MDPC) code between repetition
    and hashing operations to avoid passive eavesdropping during the preamble encoding
    process. The authors have presented the security analysis by developing several
    optimization problems and the proposed approach was proved to be secure against
    active attacks with a tolerable loss of decoding errors. However, the proposed
    approach showed some computational requirements. Table 5 illustrates the comparative
    analysis of solutions based on quantum computing. Table 5 Comparative analysis
    of quantum computing-based solutions Full size table According to this study,
    we classify QC-based approaches into two categories: Quantum/post-quantum and
    QC requirements, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Quantum Computing-based approaches
    Full size image 6 RQ1: global taxonomy of security solutions Based on the study
    provided in Sect. 5, we construct a taxonomy that encompasses solutions from the
    four categories. We classify IoT solutions according to their main purposes, specifically
    addressing the achieved security requirements (defined in Sect.2.1). Thus, the
    pertinent purposes we have selected are: authentication, access control, securely
    transmitted data (Confidentiality/integrity), secure data storage, data immutability,
    key exchange, attack/threat detection, lightweight scheme, intelligent mechanism
    and quantum attack resilience. Table 6 illustrates this taxonomy applied to related
    solutions for each mechanism. Table 6 Global taxonomy of IoT security solutions
    Full size table 6.1 Discussion According to Table 6, we observe that blockchain-based
    approaches share the primary purpose of achieving immutability of data, ensuring
    that data cannot be altered once recorded. These approaches can also enhance other
    security factors when combined with cryptographic functions, such as authentication
    [71, 73, 76, 80, 83, 84] and the secure transmission of data [71, 74, 81, 84].
    Moreover, blockchain smart contracts can serve into multiple functions, including
    threat detection and mitigation of attacks, as seen in [79]. Furthermore, they
    can be employed to control access by defining authorizations for users [73, 74,
    76,77,78, 80, 81, 83]. Additionally, blockchain can be integrated with intelligent
    mechanisms like federated learning in [72]. Machine learning-based approaches
    are part of intelligent mechanisms. The majority of these methods in IoT security
    share the primary purpose of intelligent threat and attack detection. Moreover,
    they can achieve additional functionalities in the security field, such as access
    control by detecting malicious behavior [88], identifying function and performance-based
    attacks [91], or detecting web shell threats [34]. Furthermore, they contribute
    to securing transmitted data by implementing secure policies [90] or by focusing
    on detecting botnet attacks that steal sensitive data [94]. When considering cryptographic-based
    approaches and quantum computing-based approaches in IoT security, it becomes
    evident that many of them prioritize and fulfill specific requirements. These
    requirements encompass ensuring the secure transmission of data and the exchange
    of keys. Users initiate key exchange processes to establish secure communication
    channels between them. It is important to note that achieving the criteria for
    secure key exchange often implies achieving the criteria for secure data transmission,
    in classical [99, 104,105,106,107] and in quantum [116, 118,119,120,121,122].
    However, the reverse is not always applicable, which is due to the availability
    of alternative cryptographic techniques, such as asymmetric cryptography, or other
    operations, which can also serve this purpose, in classical [101,102,103, 108,
    109] and in quantum [112, 115]. However, the major distinguishing requirement
    between these two approaches is that quantum computing-based approaches in IoT
    security are designed to prevent quantum attacks. A significant portion of cryptographic-based
    approaches is designed to be lightweight and adaptable for IoT devices with constrained
    resources [98, 100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107, 109]. Another significant aspect
    of these approaches is their ability to fulfill the authentication security factor
    [98,99,100, 104,105,106]. They can also be employed to achieve controlled access
    [98, 105] or secure stored data [98]. Furthermore, they can be combined with intelligent
    mechanisms, such as the artificial bee colony algorithm, for generating private
    keys, as demonstrated in [108]. A good portion of quantum computing-based approaches
    in IoT security focuses on achieving the authentication requirement [114, 117,
    118, 122]. Furthermore, these approaches can be integrated with emerging technologies
    such as blockchain to ensure data immutability [113], as well as with intelligent
    mechanisms like deep residual learning for analyzing data [112]. Additionally,
    they can be designed to be lightweight [119]. 7 Benefits and challenges of IoT
    security mechanisms 7.1 \\(RQA_1\\) Potential benefits of using blockchain in
    securing IoT The distribution nature and the decentralized architecture are the
    most valuable features of blockchain, which allow blockchain-based solutions to
    be more resistant against some attacks as DDoS. Besides, they offer efficient
    data immutability and elimination of the single point of failure [6]. Devices
    can perform direct communications without necessarily having to go through intermediaries.
    The tamper-proof nature of blockchain is also a primary feature, which increases
    its security [124]. Blockchain uses cryptographic functions as ECC and hash functions
    to offer integrity and authenticity. These functions are also used to sign transactions,
    which prove the legitimacy of the senders [71]. Moreover, blockchain offers validated
    and transparent record, which increase trust in IoT network and reduce the risk
    of malicious activities [6], such as adding malicious blocks with faulty data.
    Furthermore, smart contracts offer automated execution of defined rules, which
    increase trust, minimize delays and reduce the need for human intervention [125].
    Permission-less: offer a high level of decentralization, and their openness enables
    transparency, which can improve trust in certain scenarios [126]. Some of these
    approaches involve utilizing Ethereum, which allows them to create smart contracts
    [79, 83]. Permissioned: allow authorized entities to work as consensus nodes and
    access data in the blockchain. This access control makes it easier to ensure privacy
    in permissioned blockchain compared to permissionless blockchain [126]. On the
    other side, federated learning blockchain is able to train a global model from
    local data available on heterogeneous IoT devices [72]. Some approaches used consortium
    blockchain [84], to control the limited set of pre-selected nodes involving in
    consensus process, while involving multiple entities in its governance [127].
    Hybrid: combining features of both permissioned and permissionless systems allows
    organizations to customize security, transparency, and decentralization according
    to their requirements [78]. It allows, for example, to regulate access to particular
    data stored within the blockchain and determine which data will be made accessible
    to the public [128]. 7.2 \\(RQB_1\\) Challenges of applying blockchain in securing
    IoT The high processing time required to validate and add blocks to the blockchain
    is not adequate to IoT devices with limited processing power [129]. Thus, it is
    a challenge task for researchers to envision and contribute to lightweight blockchain-based
    solutions [80]. Besides, the excessive generation of data transactions in a blockchain
    IoT system results in high bandwidth consumption, which leads to time latency
    issues for real-time applications [6, 80]. Additionally, some of the consensus
    algorithms, such as Proof of Work, requires a significant amount of computational
    power and energy consumption [130]. On the other hand, a smart contract that has
    vulnerabilities in its source code will put in risk all the parties using it as
    it can be used for malicious purposes [131]. Besides, once a smart contract is
    created with bugs in its code, it becomes complicated to fix. Furthermore, IoT
    security mechanisms based on blockchain faces the attacks of blockchain, such
    as 51% attack [6], where a single entity or a group control 51% of the network
    which allow them to manipulate data transactions to be validated. Besides, malware
    attacks that can be used to gain access to a user’s private key and then use it
    for malicious activities [14]. Permission-less: the openness of permissionless
    blockchains can lead to privacy concerns in scenarios where transactions may contain
    sensitive information of users, as all transactions are visible to everyone on
    the network [126, 130]. Permissioned: they require a higher level of trust between
    participants, as access to the network is restricted to a select group of users.
    This can reduce the potential benefits of blockchain technology, such as decentralization.
    Additionally, permissioned blockchains may require more resources to maintain,
    as they often require a higher level of governance and oversight [130]. On the
    other side, many studies in the literature that explore blockchain-based federated
    learning for IoT applications often do not consider the requirement for a more
    lightweight implementation. Moreover, heterogeneous resources of IoT devices hinder
    synchronous transmission of trained models, potentially causing failures [65].
    Regarding consortium blockchain like in [84], the potential inclusion of a new
    consortium member, who is a competitor of another powerless member, through a
    majority decision by governing nodes, poses a risk to the system’s sustainability
    [127]. Hybrid: the implementation and maintenance of a hybrid blockchain in an
    IoT environment is more complex and thus more costly [37]. 7.3 \\(RQA_2\\) Potential
    benefits of using machine learning in securing IoT The evolution of IoT results
    in the continuous emergence of new threats and attacks. Thus, the traditional
    security measures used in IoT are insufficient to address the current security
    issues. The use of machine learning, deep learning or other artificial intelligence
    techniques is beneficial for developing an advanced and an up-to-date security
    mechanism for an IoT system that is constantly evolving. The main reason is that
    AI algorithms can continuously learn from data, allowing them to adapt to new
    threats and improve their accuracy over time. Through the collection and analysis
    of input data across various components of the IoT system, ML techniques can discern
    typical interaction patterns and detect malicious intent in the initial phases
    [132]. Thus, ML-based techniques help to identify and detect anomalies and threats
    in IoT [133]. An ML model analyzes data from different sources and learn how to
    diagnose abnormal behavior patterns that indicate a possible attack such as a
    sudden increase in network traffic, which may indicate a DDoS attack. An ML model
    can also detect anomalies as changes in device behavior or performance, which
    may indicate device malfunction or tampering [134]. ML can automate tasks that
    require human intervention [134], which can save time and cost while enhancing
    security. Traditional ML: Some of the ML-based solutions in IoT use traditional
    ML models [34, 89, 92]. These types of models are often simpler and computationally
    less intensive compared to DL methods. They require less data for training and
    can be trained quickly, making them suitable for real-time or near-real-time decision
    making in IoT security scenarios. DL: Other solutions are based on DL [88, 90,
    91], which can be more suitable for IoT environments as IoT devices produce a
    substantial volume of data, and DL can perform well with large datasets [135].
    DL excels in automatically learning features from raw data, eliminating the need
    for precisely designed features or manual feature engineering [135]. This can
    be particularly useful in IoT security, where the data can be complex and unstructured
    [136]. DL models can be adapted over time to learn from new security threats and
    adjust their responses accordingly. ML-DL: Combining ML and DL techniques [85,86,87,
    93, 94] can leverage the strengths of both approaches. For example, using DL for
    feature extraction and ML for decision making, or using ML for simpler scenarios
    and switching to DL for more intricate challenges. 7.4 \\(RQB_2\\) Challenges
    of applying machine learning in securing IoT In ML systems for IoT security, there
    are two main and important factors, which are data and learning methods. Data
    is collected and preprocessed to be chosen as a dataset for learning algorithms.
    It has to be of high quality to have an effective training. This can be a challenging
    task, as when collecting data in IoT environments, sensors may collect unnecessary,
    incomplete or inaccurate data. IoT devices also generate heterogeneous data with
    wide range of styles, which complicate the task of preprocessing for ML models.
    Additionally, ML models can be complex and difficult to interpret, making it challenging
    to understand how they arrive at their decisions [134]. Besides, the security
    and privacy of dataset is essential, as some attacks aim to poison data by manipulating
    or adding malicious data to the dataset [137]. Bad data as unnecessary, irrelevant
    or malicious lead to garbage processing and incorrect decisions to be made by
    the ML model. Therefore, mechanisms to deeply analyze the collected data and to
    secure the dataset are paramount. In processing, training and making predictions,
    ML models that consume considerable resources are not adaptable to IoT devices
    with limited computational power, memory and energy [138]. Thus, it is challenging
    to implement an ML model that is both sophisticated and lightweight. Besides,
    in IoT security, many applications need to rapidly detect and respond to security
    threats. Thus, ML models also need to consider making predictions in real-time.
    Traditional ML: ML models may have reliability and accuracy issues, such as false
    positives and true negatives, which can affect the precision of predictions. Therefore,
    ML models may require amendment and proper guidance for making precise predictions
    [133]. DL: DL models can be computationally intensive than ML, requiring significant
    hardware resources for training and deployment [88, 90, 134]. Furthermore, the
    training duration can significantly extend as the training dataset size expands
    [138]. ML-DL: The required computational resources can be also high in Hybrid
    ML-DL approaches [93]. 7.5 \\(RQA_3\\) Potential benefits of using cryptography
    in securing IoT Cryptographic methods have been in practice for centuries and
    they still useful and present several benefits in securing IoT. They are used
    to respond to security requirements as confidentiality, integrity, authentication,
    etc [99, 104,105,106]. This safety is thoroughly tested during all these years
    of using cryptographic methods. For example, hash functions can ensure data integrity
    through generating unique hash values for input data, among its functions, SHA-256
    [108] is considered more secure than MD5 [103]. Moreover, cryptography is known
    by its interoperability, as it can be standardized and supported by a wide range
    of devices and systems. Thus, it makes it easier to secure communication between
    heterogonous IoT devices with different software and hardware specifications [139,
    140]. Lightweight: a big part of cryptography solutions for IoT security are destined
    to be lightweight [98, 100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107, 109]. Lightweight cryptographic
    protocols can be more efficient than other emerging solutions in terms of suitability
    and adaptability to IoT devices with constrained memory, computational power and
    battery life. Specifically, a lightweight protocol is a protocol that is designed
    to minimize computational time, memory complexity, transmitted data and energy
    consumption [25, 141]. Therefore, researchers have been and continue to be interested
    in developing IoT secure protocols based on cryptography. Asymmetric Cryptography:
    it enables secure exchange of data and key establishment without requiring a prior
    shared secret. Provides digital signature to verify the authenticity. It is used
    in a big part of crypto-based solutions for IoT, such as RSA [110] and especially
    ECC [98, 99, 102, 103, 108, 109]. Symmetric Cryptography: It is generally faster
    and more efficient for encrypting and decrypting large amounts of data compared
    to asymmetric algorithms. When it is combined with asymmetric, they can offer
    better security [103]. AES is a type of symmetric cryptography that is used for
    securing IoT [103, 110]. 7.6 \\(RQB_3\\) Challenges of applying cryptography in
    securing IoT Cryptographic protocols employing classical methods that do not consider
    making these methods lighter cannot be feasibly applied to IoT devices with limited
    capacities. Additionally, some attacks cannot be prevented by methods based only
    on classical encryption, such as side channel and physical attacks where the attacker
    can access the device to steal sensitive parameters used in the cryptographic
    method. Thus, although researchers continue to evolve cryptographic methods, it
    still challenging to adapt them to keep pace with ever-evolving attacks [142].
    Efficient protocols based on classical cryptography are hard to break using classical
    computers. However, when quantum computers become a reality, they will be able
    to solve mathematical problems in a snap; thus, it will become possible to break
    classical cryptographic solutions within a short time [5, 143]. In other words,
    they will be vulnerable to QC attacks. Lightweight: lightness is an important
    factor to take into consideration in this field [25, 141]. It is a challenging
    task for researchers to find a cryptographic protocol that is both lightweight
    and provides adequate security [23]. Asymmetric: can be computationally more intensive
    than symmetric algorithms [25]. Besides, longer key lengths, as for approaches
    using RSA [110], can lead to performance slowdowns. Thus, they are required for
    comparable security to symmetric algorithms. Symmetric: Securely sharing secret
    keys among parties is a complex task, particularly in distributed systems like
    IoT [103, 110]. If a key is exposed, it jeopardizes all past and future communications
    encrypted with it. Moreover, as the number of parties involved in communication
    expands, the need for keys grows exponentially, causing scalability problems.
    Additionally, symmetric ciphers use reduced key length compared to the asymmetric
    algorithm. Hence, they are vulnerable to security attacks because of their less
    complex nature [25]. 7.7 \\(RQA_4\\) Potential benefits of using quantum computing
    in securing IoT The main benefit of QC in securing IoT is the quantum cryptography
    that can create unbreakable encryption keys [120]. This is because quantum computers,
    which can make calculations faster than classical computers, can break traditional
    cryptographic keys [143]. Quantum cryptography is based on the rules of quantum
    mechanics. It provides safe transmission of data, such as the attacker cannot
    read or tamper with transmitted data without being detected [5]. Quantum key distribution:
    eavesdropping attack can be detected in contrast to classical cryptographic algorithms
    [52]. Post-quantum cryptography: the benefit of post-quantum cryptography is to
    develop cryptographic techniques that can be resistant to QC attacks unlike classical
    techniques [115, 117, 123]. Lattice-based cryptography is one of the most promising
    techniques of post-quantum cryptography, as it is based on hard mathematical problems
    that can provide robustness against attacks launched by classical or quantum computers
    [114]. Moreover, lattice-based techniques offer encryption/decryption algorithms
    that are suitable for IoT devices with constrained resources [113, 121]. Quantum
    cryptography: some of QC techniques that can be used to ensure security in IoT
    are quantum circuit [112], continious wave technology [116], quantum walks [119],
    etc. Hybrid: refers to approaches that combine different methods of quantum cryptography
    [114, 121, 122] or combine them with other technologies like blockchain [113]
    or deep learning [112], thus providing an adaptable way to leverage the strengths
    of multiple techniques. Quantum random number generation: QC can be used to generate
    random numbers employed to calculate a classical cryptographic key [122]. Traditional
    generators of random numbers are based on deterministic algorithms and thus the
    attacker can predict the result. In contrast, QC based on quantum mechanics can
    generate large and unique random numbers that are unpredictable [144]. Authentication:
    QC-based approaches in IoT security can be used in authenticating legitimate entities
    [114, 117, 118, 122]. 7.8 \\(RQB_4\\) Challenges of applying quantum computing
    in securing IoT One of the challenges of applying quantum cryptography in IoT
    devices is the need for quantum hardware that can ensure generation and transmission
    of quantum states such as quantum key distribution (QKD) [145]. Thus, researchers
    are interested by finding lightweight and effective solutions to implement quantum
    cryptography in IoT [146]. Besides, QKD can establish a secret key between only
    two entities [147]; hence, it is challenging to apply it between more than two
    of IoT devices that want to share a secret key. Some post-quantum cryptographic
    algorithms are designed to be lightweight, implementing this type may still present
    challenges as they consume more resources than classical algorithms. Moreover,
    post-quantum algorithms necessitate significantly larger key sizes, making it
    essential to thoroughly analyze key size, security levels, network performance,
    and scalability when integrating IoT networks with these cryptographic methods
    [146]. Furthermore, the migration to post-quantum cryptography requires considerable
    changes to existing protocols and systems, which can be expensive in terms of
    time and cost [148]. 8 Conclusion Despite all the research that has been done
    so far, security in IoT is still an open issue, especially with the growth of
    IoT applications, the evolution of technologies combined with IoT and the continuous
    evolution of attacks and threats. In this paper, we addressed the most used mechanisms
    in this field, which are blockchain, machine learning, cryptography, and quantum
    computing. According to these mechanisms, we organized the relevant approaches
    into four categories. Consequently, we conducted a comprehensive discussion and
    comparative analysis of these approaches in each specified category, according
    to some defined criteria. We presented a specific taxonomy for solutions within
    each category. Thereafter, we provided a global taxonomy of solutions based on
    their achieved security requirements. This survey aims to provide a thorough understanding
    of the current state of research in IoT security by analyzing the strengths and
    limitations of the four relevant mechanisms in one paper. The provided taxonomy
    can assist researchers in selecting suitable mechanisms according to the desired
    security outcomes. Thus, this paper is intended to serve as a useful and a timesaving
    guideline to interested researchers. Availability of data and materials No datasets

    Publisher: TUP Funding Agency: SECTION 1 Introduction The spectrum of applications
    for Internet of Things (IoT) technology in production and life has grown as the
    technology has matured. Using the IoT technology to intelligently monitor and
    scientifically manage the agricultural environment has become an unavoidable trend
    and a critical component of current agricultural development[1]. Agricultural
    IoT technology is a new type of agriculture that combines the IoT with agricultural
    production, and is a new trend in global agricultural development[2], [3]. The
    purpose of an intelligent orchard is to keep track of environmental temperature
    and humidity, light intensity, soil humidity, and other factors that affect fruit
    tree growth, and to realize the monitoring, collection, transmission, and regulation
    of data. The fruit business contributes significantly to economic growth. Today,
    people pay special attention to quality of life, and the demand for fruit is a
    remarkable manifestation. Each season, the market demand for fruit increases continuously,
    which requires fruit farmers to increase the production of orchards and expand
    the scale of orchards. At the same time, the problems are gradually exposed. According
    to the traditional management mode, large-scale orchards need a lot of labor and
    financial resources[4]. Only when all factors (meteorological factors, geographical
    factors, and human factors) are kept normal can we ensure the output and income
    of the orchard. However, if there is no early prevention and control of sudden
    weather information such as continuous rainstorms and droughts and other meteorological
    factors, there is a great chance that the orchard will reduce production, increase
    the loss of fruit farmers, and fail to meet the demand for fruits[5]. China''s
    agricultural IoT started later and developed slowly, and it has been in a backward
    state due to unbalanced industrial development and other factors. However, Chinese
    scientists have not stopped researching related aspects, and some of them are
    of outstanding significance, which can be recorded and have good enlightenment
    and leading role. In the late 1990s, Mao et al.[6] developed the first generation
    of automatic irrigation system on Intel 8031, the originator of 51 single chip
    microcomputer. This system not only realizes the function of regular irrigation,
    but also has the function of measuring soil moisture. High-quality fruits have
    many benefits for people. Only by grasping the growing environment of fruits at
    any time can we cultivate high-quality fruits. For orchard managers, it is most
    effective to provide solutions with low cost, low maintenance, and low power consumption[7].
    Based on Long Range (LoRa) technology, fog computing and other means, this paper
    uses advanced energy efficiency and IoT wireless sensor network to monitor the
    orchard environment, which puts forward a technical framework to meet these requirements
    and can improve the overall performance of the ecosystem[8], [9]. LoRa is a low
    power long-distance communication technology that belongs to the Low Power Wide
    Area Network (LPWAN)[10]. LoRa is widely used in medical treatment, environment,
    military affairs, precision agriculture, etc., and its application fields are
    constantly expanded by research and technological progress[11]. Meanwhile, orchard
    is a multi-parameter environment, and the main environmental parameters include
    air temperature and humidity, light illumination, soil temperature and humidity,
    and meteorological parameters. Therefore, the orchard IoT needs multi-class sensors
    to collect the above parameters as the data basis for realizing smart orchard.
    Fog computing cloud services are being extended to the edge. They aim to improve
    low latency, mobility, network bandwidth, security, and privacy by bringing computation,
    communication, and storage closer to edge devices and end users[12]. Another layer,
    called the fog layer, is introduced between the fog computing cloud and terminal
    equipment. Terminal devices, also known as IoT nodes, are located at the endpoint
    layer. According to the definition, IoT nodes must be connected to the network,
    and they usually contain various sensors or actuators that interact with the physical
    world[13]. Specifically, in the fog computing of orchard environmental monitoring,
    IoT nodes can be connected to the gateway device of orchard management, which
    provides cloud services. Practice has proved that applying LoRa technology and
    fog computing to orchard monitoring system can effectively guide fruit farmers
    to manage orchards scientifically and improve yield and quality. SECTION 2 Material
    and Method The monitoring system of IoT introduced in this paper, although specially
    tested in peach garden, can be applied to any kind of fruit tree or nut tree park
    for monitoring application. Therefore, this section briefly introduces the monitoring
    factors needed by peach garden and the growing environment conditions of peach
    trees, which prepares for choosing which components to arrange later, and deeply
    studies all the sensors and methods mostly used for each hardware component. The
    overall structure of the orchard IoT-based surveillance system is shown in Fig.
    1. 2.1 Peach Garden Environment In this section, some details of peach garden
    are introduced. There are many factors that affect orchard growth including light
    intensity, temperature, humidity, soil temperature and humidity, soil pH, etc.,
    which will affect the growth of fruit trees and fruit development. Among them,
    temperature is an extremely important energy factor for peach tree growth and
    development. It directly affects the photosynthesis, transpiration, and respiration
    of fruit trees. Peach tree is a warm-loving tree species, which prefers dry and
    cool climate during its development. Peach trees have a wide temperature adaptation
    range and strong cold tolerance, but winter temperatures below −25–−23 °C are
    prone to freezing damage, Therefore, peach grows best in cool and mild climate,
    with 10–17 °C for southern varieties and 4–8 °C for northern varieties[14]. The
    cold tolerance of peach buds belongs to the weak category in temperate fruit trees.
    In winter, the tolerance of buds gradually increases with decreasing temperature
    during natural dormancy. The peach blossom buds can withstand the low temperature
    of −18–−16 °C during the dormancy period, and the freezing temperature of the
    buds after germination is from −1°C to 2 °C during the discoloration period. After
    the natural dormancy of flower buds ends, the short-term high temperature suddenly
    leads to a significant decrease in tolerance to cold. When the temperature drops
    again, even if it does not reach the critical temperature for freezing, it is
    extremely vulnerable to freezing damage. The relationship between root growth
    and temperature is also very close. The soil temperature at the beginning of the
    growth of the roots of peach trees is 4–12 °C, and the optimal soil temperature
    is 18°C[15]. The cold tolerance of peach root system is weak. It can resist −11–−10
    °C in dormant period, but it can withstand low temperature above −9°C in active
    period. After the root system of peach suffers from freezing damage, it will soon
    wither in spring. It will die after a few years of mild freezing, or in the year
    of severe freezing. Furthermore, peaches trees are more suitable for weakly acidic
    soil, and the pH of suitable soil for peach trees is 6.0–6.5[16]. Peaches trees
    grow well in slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soil. If planted in alkaline
    soil, yellow leaf disease is more likely to occur. When the salt content of the
    soil reaches more than 0.28%, it will hinder the growth of peach trees, and even
    lead to dead plants[17], [18]. Sensor technology, wireless communication technology,
    and other forms of technology are all being used in new ways, and other related
    technologies in the field of IoT to orchard management will greatly address the
    above problems. The first thing to study is the effort of labor and energy. At
    the same time, it also solves the problems of traditional environmental monitoring
    methods, such as difficult collection, low monitoring data efficiency, difficult
    data processing, and high maintenance and management costs. Fig. 1 Overall structure
    of the orchard monitoring system. Show All 2.2 Multi-Sensor''s Modules Taking
    into account the automation of the orchard monitoring system and the fact that
    the environment in which the orchard is located is different from the greenhouse
    environment, where many factors are beyond human control and are affected by weather,
    such as rainstorm, light, wind erosion, etc., the equipment selection in the orchard
    should consider this influence and should pay attention to some corrosion-resistant
    devices or shells to protect the components[19]. When building a transmission
    network, because there are many branches in the orchard, it is not easy to conduct
    wiring by conventional wired transmission. If leaves and fruits fall off without
    timely treatment, the soil will become acidic, which has a great influence on
    wired transmission, not only shortening service life, but also increasing the
    frequency of device replacement frequency, thus increasing labor input and cost.
    The orchard IoT system can transmit the collected environmental factors and meteorological
    factors such as temperature, air humidity, light intensity, soil humidity, and
    soil pH to the host computer through wireless network communication and display
    them to users[20]. Wireless communication can be carried out between the collecting
    node and the uploading node. At this time, the wireless transmission mode between
    nodes is required to have the characteristics of long communication distance,
    low power consumption, high security, and stable signal. The information collected
    can cross the distance barrier and be collected from the upper computer in a lossless
    and real-time way. At present, there are many types of Supply Chain Management
    (SCM) on the market, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in function.
    The STM32 series SCM is not only small and low in cost, but also has many I/O
    ports, comprehensive internal modules, and flexible and simple operation. In this
    design, STM32F103C8T6 is the primary control chip of the orchard IoT system. 2.2.1
    Temperature and Humidity Sensor Through the analysis and research of the existing
    sensors, this sensor is designed to monitor the internal and external parameters
    of peach trees in peach garden, i.e., the growth environment parameters of peach
    trees, and at the same time, it analyzes the most suitable method for supplying
    power to the intelligent sensing devices efficiently. Two temperature and humidity
    sensors are selected, because the environment and the temperature inside the trees,
    as well as the air and soil humidity have different effects on fruit trees. The
    DHT11 sensor composed of the Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor
    and humidity sensor is used to monitor atmospheric temperature and humidity. A
    sensor with an NTC thermistor and a hygrometer sensor are selected for internal
    temperature measurement and soil moisture monitoring, respectively. The above
    sensors are easy to arrange in orchards, and their power consumption is very low,
    thus achieving low power consumption. The working standard of the thermistor consists
    of a temperature sensitive resistor, which is inversely proportional to temperature.
    The hygrometer sensor detects the change of soil moisture according to the principle
    of electrical conductivity[21]. Figure 2 shows the physical drawing of DHT11.
    It is a sensor that combines temperature and humidity to measure. The circuit
    diagram is shown in Fig. 3. The description of DHT11 pin is shown in Table 1.
    The two types of optical fiber temperature sensors are type 1 in which the optical
    fiber only serves to transmit light, and other sensitive elements must be installed
    on the end face of the optical fiber to form the new sensor''s transmission sensor;
    and type 2 in which the sensitive function of the optical fiber itself is used
    to make the optical fiber measure the temperature, which belongs to the functional
    type, and the optical fiber not only serves to transmit light but also to measure
    the temperature. Figure 4 depicts the fundamental system structure of an optical
    fiber temperature sensor. Fig. 2 Temperature and humidity sensor DHT11. Show All
    Fig. 3 Circuit diagram of DHT11. Show All Fig. 4 Basic system structure. Show
    All Table 1 Description of DHT11 pin. Optical fiber sensors are classified as
    functional optical fiber sensors or non-functional optical fiber sensors based
    on their sensing principles. The transmission equation in an optical fiber is
    Eq. (1). E= E 0 cos(wt+φ) (1) View Source where E 0 is the initial amplitude,
    w is the optical frequency, φ is the initial phase of the incident light, and
    E 0 , ω , and φ are the characteristic parameters of optical transmission in the
    optical fiber. The power supply voltage for DHT11 is 3.5-5 V. For decoupling and
    filtering, a 100 nF capacitor can be inserted between the power supply pins (VCC,
    GND). To improve the signal''s anti-interference capacity, a pull-up resistor
    of more than 5 kΩ is connected in parallel to the DATA pin. Wait 1 second after
    the sensor is turned on to get out of the unstable state, during which no instructions
    should be sent. Figure 5 shows how the circuit is commonly used. 2.2.2 Illumination
    Sensor In this design, GY-30 is selected as the illumination sensor module, and
    the internal integration of the module utilizes BH1750FVI illumination sensor.
    The internal photosensitive diode of BH1750 is responsible for light sensitivity.
    The operational amplifier is used to obtain analog value for weak current change,
    and the digital signal is obtained through the AD converter. The internal crystal
    oscillator is also selected to provide the reference frequency. The description
    diagram, physical diagram, and circuit diagram of the GY-30 module are shown in
    Figs. 6–8. Fig. 5 DHT11 in the circuit. Show All The photodiode, operational amplifier,
    ADC acquisition, crystal oscillator, and other components of BH1750 are depicted
    in Fig. 9. The photovoltaic effect converts the input optical signal into an electrical
    signal, which is amplified by the operational amplifier circuit, collected by
    the ADC, and then converted into a 16-bit binary number by the logic circuit and
    stored in the internal register. Note that the stronger the light entering the
    optical window, the larger the photocurrent, the larger the voltage, so the magnitude
    of illumination can be judged by the voltage instead of the photocurrent, but
    from BH1750, the clock and data lines are led out. The Microcontroller Unit (MCU)
    may use the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol to connect with the BH1750
    module, select the BH1750''s working mode, and collect the BH1750 register''s
    illumination data. The definitions of each pin can be found in Table 2. Fig. 6

    In the design, it is necessary to ensure the timing relationship between DVI and
    VCC. Generally, there are two schemes that can be realized: MCU controls DVI signal,
    as shown in Fig. 10. Implementation of an embedded RC circuit between VCC and
    DVI, as shown in Fig. 11. 2.2.3 Soil Moisture Sensor The soil moisture sensor
    is made up of two parts. One is the waterproof probe that has been treated with
    waterproof and the other part is the probe that has been treated with rust prevention
    probe. It can be widely laid in orchard soil, and it can measure the moisture
    and humidity of shallow soil and deep soil. The soil moisture sensor is shown
    in Fig. 12, and the circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 13. Fig. 10 MCU controlling
    DVI signal. Show All Fig. 11 RC circuit between VCC and DVI. Show All Fig. 12
    Soil moisture sensor Show All Fig. 13 Circuit diagram of the soil moisture sensor.
    Show All Table 2 Definition of each pin. Through the work and data monitoring
    of soil temperature and humidity sensors in the surface and deep layers of soil,
    we can obtain the latest soil temperature and humidity data in real time, which
    is convenient for us to monitor the soil environment in orchards, so that orchard
    managers can observe in time, improve the soil quality in orchards, and increase
    the output. At this time, there is a variety of soil moisture measuring methods
    available both at home and abroad, as well as a variety of soil moisture sensors.
    Soil moisture measuring methods includes Time Domain Reflection (TDR), gypsum
    method, infrared remote sensing method, Frequency Domain Reflection/Frequency
    Domain method (FDR/FD method), titration method, capacitance method, resistance
    method, microwave method, neutron method, Karl Fischer method, nuclear magnetic
    resonance method, and so on. 2.3 LoRa Technology His design adopts from LoRa point-to-point
    communication[22], [23]. For orchard production, a low-power, low-cost long-distance
    transmission scheme is the key consideration. It is of great significance to arrange
    all kinds of information collection sensors in the orchard to increase output
    and reduce resource consumption. These sensors will upload data regularly and
    send the data wirelessly to the remote user center to realize remote real-time
    data acquisition. There are numerous new network protocols and gadgets, according
    to the information. Many of them, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and 2G/3G/4G
    cellular networks, are commonly used in daily life, but there are some new emerging
    network alternatives, such as Narrow Band (NB)-IoT, LoRa, and Sigfox. The best
    communication choices are chosen based on the scope of the application, the data
    requirements, the safety, and the battery life. The primary communication protocols
    in the IoT technology are summarized in Table 3. Large-scale planting in orchards,
    due to the lush branches and leaves of fruit trees, has a certain influence on
    signal transmission, and it is extremely cumbersome and difficult to pull the
    power lines. Therefore, when selecting communication modules, the characteristics
    of low power consumption and long-distance transmission should be met at the same
    time[24], i.e., LPWAN needs to be built. The main purpose of LPWAN is the long-distance
    communication between power supply devices through low bit rate transmission.
    Choosing LPWAN can reduce labor investment, equipment investment, line construction
    investment, and power consumption, and meet the environmental protection requirements
    of low cost and low power consumption. Table 3 Main communication protocols in
    IoT technology. The LoRa technology is a superior option for monitoring the orchard
    environment. LoRa is a physical layer technology that uses commercial proprietary
    spread spectrum technology to modulate industries below gigahertz and provides
    two-way communication via special linear frequency modulation spread spectrum
    technology that expands narrowband input signals to a wider channel bandwidth[25].
    The resulting signal has noise-like qualities, making detection and blocking more
    challenging. With a maximum payload length of 256 bytes, the processing gain can
    improve the capacity to resist interference and noise while also providing an
    adaptable data rate function. LoRa''s communication frequencies are primarily
    within unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) radio frequency band,
    while it can work at any frequency below 1 GHz[26]. This is the main factor behind
    low-cost worldwide deployment and interoperability. The modernization process
    of orchards makes modern orchards have the characteristics of large area, complex
    geographical factors, long fruit cultivation period, etc., which results in the
    requirements of orchard IoT, such as many detection factors, long monitoring period,
    deployment of monitoring points, and so on. LoRa technology is suitable for such
    application scenarios. LoRa technology considers the balance between long-distance
    transmission and transmission power consumption, and has the advantages of low
    cost, low power consumption, and long-distance transmission[27], [28]. The ATK-LORA-01
    wireless serial port module selected in this system is a LoRa wireless serial
    port module introduced by ALIENTEK. It has the characteristics of small size,
    low power consumption, high performance, and long communication distance. The
    physical drawing of ATK-LORA-01 is shown in Fig. 14. Fig. 14 ATK-LORA-01 wireless
    serial port module. Show All Using simplified interface for connecting to this
    module, all functions can be completed with only 4 I/O, and it is simple and convenient
    to use 1×6 rows of needles to connect with the outside. When the module is electrically
    connected to MCU/ARM equipment, attention should be paid: The wireless serial
    port module is TTL level (high level >2.4 V; low level <0.4 V). The pin level
    of the module is 3.3 V, and the level conversion adaptation is needed to communicate
    with the 5 V MCU. The MD0 and AUX pins are low when suspended. The Received Signal
    Strength Indicate (RSSI) algorithm can divided into two categories, propagation
    model modeling method and fingerprint database matching method. Here the RSSI
    propagation model is used. RSSI propagation model estimation method first calculates
    the signal propagation loss by using the received signal strength, then converts
    the transmission loss into distance by using theoretical and empirical models,
    and then calculates the location of nodes. The traditional RSSI estimation method
    usually carries out many measurement experiments on the positioning environment,
    obtains the relationship between the signal propagation distance and the path
    loss in this environment, and establishes the “distance-loss” model, which is
    generally as follows: P= P r0 +10nlg( d d 0 )+ξ (2) View Source where d 0 is the
    distance between the reference point and the signal source, P r0 is the RSSI of
    the received signal source when the distance is d 0 , d is the real distance,
    ξ∼N(0,  δ 2 ) is the masking factor, P is the RSSI of the signal source received
    by the point under test, and n is path loss coefficient. When the path loss system
    is known, the propagation distance of the signal can be calculated according to
    the received signal strength. The RSSI positioning algorithm is based on distance[29],
    and the accuracy of distance estimation directly affects the accuracy of the final
    positioning. After estimating the distance between the terminal equipment and
    the three anchor nodes, the location of the target can be estimated by the trilateral
    positioning model shown in Fig. 15. There is always an error in the distance estimation
    value obtained by RSSI, so that the three circles in Fig. 15 do not intersect
    at one point, but form an area. 2.4 Software Architecture The overall functional
    flow framework is shown in Fig. 16. This system consists of four parts, information
    collection, information transmission, PC interaction, and downlink command execution,
    and these four parts can be classified into terminal node, gateway terminal, and
    PC terminal. Information transmission is an essential carrier for all other functions.
    If the information transmission function is compared to the body, then the information
    collection function and the down command execution are two hands, one for getting
    data and the other for doing things. Simply put, it is one body with two wings,
    and the upper computer is the brain. In this design, the terminal module is divided
    into two parts. The first part is to collect the environmental information from
    the orchards at regular intervals through sensors. The sensor relates to the acquisition
    module through the I/O interface, and is mainly responsible for monitoring the
    environment of the park within a set time (500 ms) and collecting primary data.
    Fig. 15 Trilateral positioning model. Show All Fig. 16 Overall functional flow
    chart. Show All The working flow of the entire terminal node is shown in Fig.
    17. On the other hand, the serial port 2 (USART2) of the STM32 microprocessor
    is connected to the LoRa module to receive the downlink command. If the command
    from the upper computer is received, the judgment is made by the IF statement
    to open/close the water pump relay. 2.5 Decision on Irrigation The main purpose
    of irrigation decision is to calculate the irrigation time, i.e., the time of
    each irrigation activity[30]. In each period, intelligent irrigation calculates
    the irrigation time for each region according to the measured soil humidity and
    temperature. Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) is an intelligent algorithm for dealing
    with uncertain information. FLC mainly consists of four parts, fuzzification interface,
    knowledge base, jamming engine, and defuzzification interface. The fuzzy interface
    converts the input quantity into a fuzzy set. The knowledge base is the main system
    of FSC, which stores fuzzy rules. In the interference engine, fuzzy rules are
    evaluated according to the input variables of the membership function. The defuzzification
    interface is to forward the fuzzy set to the output.s Fig. 17 Workflow of the
    whole terminal node. Show All The system model of Fuzzy logic Input-based Decision
    Algorithm for Irrigation Time (FI-DAIT) algorithm is shown in Fig. 18. The change
    rate of soil temperature and soil humidity is taken as the input of fuzzy logic
    controller, and the output is irrigation time. First, take the soil moisture decrease
    rate ΔM(k) as the input of the fuzzy logic system, and its definition is shown
    in Eq. (3). ΔM(k)=M(k)−M(k−1) (3) View Source where M(k) is the current soil humidity,
    M(k−1) is the soil humidity at the last moment, Δt=t(k)−t(k−1) represents the
    time interval between two consecutive sampling values. Another input is the soil
    temperature T(k). ΔM(k) and T(k) are two inputs to the system inputs, and the
    output P(k) represents the irrigation time. Fig. 18 FI-DAIT algorithm model based
    on FLC. Show All By inputting the acquired data parameters into the model, we
    can get the irrigation time required by the soil in this area and set the value
    of P(k) to judge, and the system will need to complete irrigation at the corresponding
    time. The arrangement of automatic irrigation pipes is shown in Fig. 19. The arrangement
    of water pipes in the whole orchard is linearly distributed, which not only saves
    the cost, but also allows peach trees to be irrigated scientifically. SECTION
    3 Result and Discussion Through monitoring and summarizing the data, the reliability
    of LoRa''s network transmission is tested, and the results are shown in Table
    4. After the orchard IoT system''s software and hardware have been configured,
    it is placed in the orchard IoT model for actual testing. As indicated in Table
    5, three time points of morning, noon, and night are chosen for this study, and
    three sets of temperature and humidity data are chosen for each time point. The
    temperature and humidity data collected by the sensors are essentially the same
    as those measured manually, according to the experimental data, and the system
    fits the predicted design requirements. Fig. 19 Layout of automatic irrigation
    pipeline. Show All Table 4 Test results of network communication reliability.
    Table 5 Experimental data of orchard. Make the measured data change into a line
    chart as shown in Fig. 20. Through image analysis, it is concluded that the temperature
    change of the orchard soil is relatively stable in one day, and regular irrigation
    is needed to maintain sufficient soil moisture, so that peach trees can grow normally.
    Fig. 20 Chart of temperature and humidity change. Show All In the process of system
    debugging and testing, the following considerations are considered. First, it
    should be checked whether the design principle of the hardware circuit is correct,
    whether the desired results can be achieved in advance, and whether the implementation
    method is too complicated. Second, the model of the device should be calculated
    and selected. If selection is not reasonable enough, it will weaken the efficacy
    of the system and fail to achieve the expected effect, or it will damage the device
    and cause the system to fail to operate. Third, after the hardware welding is
    finished, it is necessary to carefully check whether the circuit welding is accurate
    and whether there is any open circuit or short circuit. During the test, there
    is a problem that the soil moisture field of the upper computer does not have
    an indication. After the test of changing the location, it is confirmed that the
    orchard is exposed for a long time, lacking effective management, and the system
    integration and program design are working normally due to the drought of the
    soil. According to the actual test results, this system can realize the task of
    remote environment monitoring and water pump controlling in orchard IoT, which
    meets the original design requirements. SECTION 4 Conclusion In this document,
    we discuss the use of IoT technology in orchard monitoring, which includes data
    collection of environmental temperature, humidity, soil temperature, and humidity,
    and orchard irrigation decisions. The main communication protocol of the system
    is LoRa technology, which has characteristics of long range, low power consumption,
    and reliable transmission. It is used to continuously monitor the temperature
    readings of different spots in the needed area. Users can see parameters related
    to network operation in addition to temperature, monitor the growth environment
    parameters of peach garden by intelligent equipment and the surrounding environment
    by video monitoring equipment, and make scientific decisions in orchard irrigation.
    On the one hand, it can reduce manual management and cost; on the other hand,
    it can improve the yield and fruit quality through scientific irrigation and planting.

    Keywords: Internet of Everything; Internet of Things; cloud computing; security;
    privacy; smart systems 1. Introduction The digital transformation of the 21st
    century has ushered in a new era of connectivity, where everyday objects, devices,
    and systems are becoming increasingly interconnected, intelligent, and data-driven.
    As a result of the exponential emergence of the Internet in interconnected networks,
    most technology must adhere to more rigorous standards. This transformative phenomenon
    is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) [1,2]. However, beyond
    the IoT lies a more comprehensive and expansive concept known as the Internet
    of Everything (IoE), which expands the boundaries of network connectivity with
    intelligent devices and is forecasted to see even more rapid advancement in the
    future [3]. The IoE is an ecosystem where devices and things are connected to
    the Internet, and where people, processes, and data are seamlessly integrated,
    creating a web of interconnectedness that transcends traditional boundaries [4].
    The Internet of Everything (IoE), as delineated by Cisco Systems Inc., encompasses
    an intricate network of interconnections involving individuals, processes, data,
    and IoT devices. According to Cisco’s estimations, the forthcoming 15 years are
    poised to yield substantial advantages from IoE implementation in the global public
    sector, amounting to an impressive USD 4.6 trillion. Simultaneously, the private
    sector is expected to generate a remarkable USD 14.4 trillion in economic value
    during this period [5]. In this digital realm, objects can communicate with each
    other, make autonomous decisions, and interact with humans in ways that were once
    the stuff of science fiction. The IoE concept not only encompasses smart devices
    and sensors but also leverages data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud
    computing, and advanced networking technologies to create a symbiotic relationship
    between the digital and physical worlds. It promises to revolutionize industries,
    enhance the quality of life, and address some of the most pressing global challenges,
    from healthcare and transportation to energy efficiency and sustainability. This
    introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the IoE ecosystem, its
    key components and challenges, and the transformative impact it is poised to have
    on various domains of human activity. In the following sections, we will delve
    into the fundamental concepts, technologies, applications, and emerging trends
    of the Internet of Everything. In this paper, we have divided the structure into
    sections and subsections. In the introduction part, we introduced the concept
    of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and its transformative potential, setting
    the stage for our journey. In the section on related works, we examine existing
    research and innovation efforts, highlighting the progress made thus far. The
    materials and methods section delves into the critical components of the IoE,
    emphasizing the convergence of the IoE that underpins this revolutionary concept.
    Our discussion of the results underscores the dynamic and multifaceted nature
    of IoE innovation. Ultima, the promise of IoE technologies and innovation is substantial,
    offering boundless opportunities for a brighter and more connected future. The
    motivation to explore IoE technologies is driven by its capacity to solve complex
    challenges. The IoE has the potential to address global issues such as the integration
    of physical and digital realms, creating a landscape where devices, systems, and
    individuals converge, interoperate, and share data in real time. In conclusion,
    this exploration of IoE technologies and innovation sets the stage for a compelling
    journey into the interconnected world of the future. By understanding and leveraging
    IoE, we can pave the way for a more efficient, sustainable, and connected society
    that unlocks opportunities for growth and transformation across all sectors. 2.
    Related Works The evolution of the Internet of Everything (IoE) has been a subject
    of profound interest and investigation in recent years. Researchers and scholars
    alike have delved into various facets of the IoE, seeking to unravel its intricate
    web of connections between people, processes, data, and objects. A significant
    body of related works has emerged, shedding light on the transformative potential
    of the IoE in diverse domains, including industry IoT (IIoT) and cognitive IoT
    (CIoT), as shown in Figure 1. These studies have elucidated the critical role
    of the IoE in enhancing efficiency, enabling data-driven decision making, and
    ushering in the new era of connectivity. Figure 1. The Internet of Everything
    (IoE). The IoE plays a pivotal role in enabling the creation of innovative services,
    based on the Internet of Things (IoT), fog, and cloud computing paradigms. IoT-based
    sensors are poised to enhance data transmission for analysis, thus contributing
    to improved decision making and an overall increase in the quality of citizens’
    lives [6]. The IoE is anticipated to receive significant amounts of attention
    in the coming years, especially with the emergence of new, exciting technologies
    in the sectors of networking, software, hardware, and luxury-oriented services
    for humans [5]. Several researchers have made significant contributions, with
    diverse objectives that collectively enhance the capabilities of the IoE. Antonios
    et al. conducted a systematic literature review on semantic technologies in smart
    cities, with objectives centered on identifying trends and challenges in adopting
    semantic interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient urban
    environments [7]. In the context of the Internet of Everything (IoE) environment,
    the incorporation of infrared communication into the smart home system emerges
    as a noteworthy development. Researchers [8] have effectively addressed the longstanding
    challenge wherein a significant portion of infrared-communication-based household
    appliances faced limitations in their integration into the smart home network.
    This innovative effort not only resolves this problem but also helps to lower
    the implementation costs of such a smart home system, making it more affordable
    and useful in the everyday lives of the general population. Another study attempted
    to replicate a multitude of pragmatic Internet of Everything (IoE) scenarios,
    mirroring real-world applications. In this pursuit, this paper adeptly harnesses
    the capabilities of the Cisco Packet Tracer, an instrumental tool employed in
    the experimental setup [9]. This comprehensive exploration necessitates the interconnection
    of a substantial array of sensors and devices, effectively emulating the complexities
    that are inherent to IoE ecosystems. Moreover, this investigative work encompasses
    the deployment of a diverse range of network components, including routers, switches,
    and servers, with IoT devices thus culminating in the establishment of a fully
    operational network infrastructure, like the contributions such as [10]. Numerous
    researchers are eagerly contributing to holistic performance enhancement by adopting
    heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms that are used extensively for time–cost
    optimization in cloud computing [11]. Equally, in [12], the study focuses on elevating
    various performance aspects of quality management (QM) and bolstering consumer
    confidence within the Internet of Everything (IoE) framework. The study introduces
    a QM platform designed to prioritize swift responses and minimize latency in acquiring
    sensor data, while also ensuring authentication, data consistency, and transparency
    in the context of cold supply chain logistics. Additionally, an innovative adaptive
    data smoothing and compression (ADSC) mechanism is proposed to efficiently reduce
    the size of IoE data. This facilitates storage within edge gateways, even when
    they have limited computational and storage capacities. This research contributes
    significantly to optimizing cold supply chain logistics by harnessing IoE and
    blockchain technologies to enhance quality management and transparency in supply
    chain operations. 3. Materials and Methods Systematic mapping or scoping studies
    aim to offer a comprehensive perspective on a specific research field by categorizing
    and organizing existing research. These studies primarily delve into the body
    of available research to assess the breadth of various subjects, publication frequency,
    emerging research patterns, and the sources where relevant studies have been disseminated.
    In this particular study, the systematic mapping process adheres to the recommendations
    outlined by Petersen et al. [13]. In accordance with the systematic mapping study
    guidelines, the key procedural stages encompass defining research inquiries, scouring
    for pertinent academic papers, screening these papers, annotating abstracts with
    relevant keywords, extracting data, and creating a visual representation, as illustrated
    in Figure 2. Each of these steps yields specific outcomes, and the ultimate product
    of this entire undertaking is a systematic map, which is further elucidated in
    [13,14]. Figure 2. Systematic mapping [13]. Definition of Research Questions (Research
    Scope)—The principal objective of a systematic mapping study is to establish a
    comprehensive view of a specific research domain, determining the extent and nature
    of the research and findings available in that domain. Conducting the Search for
    Primary Studies (All Papers)—The identification of primary studies was accomplished
    by employing search terms within scientific databases or by manually perusing
    relevant conference proceedings and journal publications. Screening of Papers
    for Inclusion and Exclusion (Relevant Papers)—Inclusion and exclusion criteria
    were applied to sift through studies that were pertinent to addressing the research
    inquiries, discarding those that did not meet the criteria. Keywording of Abstracts
    (Classification Scheme)—Keywording served as a method to expedite the development
    of the classification scheme and ensure that it took into account existing studies,
    thereby reducing the time required. Data Extraction and Mapping of Studies (Systematic
    Map)—Once the classification scheme had been established, the relevant articles
    were organized within it, signifying the practical phase of data extraction. 3.1.
    Research Questions The primary research question (RQ) of this systematic mapping
    study was: “What innovations are derived from IoE technology?” This primary question
    was divided into seven RQs. Table 1 lists the formulated RQs along with the rationale
    behind each RQ. Table 1. Research questions. 3.2. Data Sources We examined twelve
    electronic databases as our main sources for potentially relevant studies. Google
    Scholar was omitted from the selection due to its lower precision in delivering
    results and the significant overlap with results from other data sources. The
    electronic databases utilized during the search process are detailed in Table
    2. Table 2. Electronic databases. 3.3. Search Terms To ensure a thorough search
    of pertinent studies, it is crucial to identify the appropriate search terms.
    Kitchenham et al. [15] introduced the population, intervention, comparison, and
    outcome (PICO) perspective as a valuable framework for this purpose. This perspective
    has been widely adopted in numerous systematic literature reviews (SLRs). Below,
    the relevant PICO terms are listed: Population: primary studies on the Internet
    of Things; Intervention: IoE innovations; Comparison: problems, innovation, advantages,
    limitation performance metrics, and future directions; Outcome: innovation, advantages,
    and limitations of IoE technology. (‘‘Internet of Things” OR “Internet of Everything’’
    OR “Internet of Everything Technologies’’ OR “Internet of Everything Trends” OR
    “Internet of Everything Limitation” OR “Internet of Everything Innovations’’)
    AND (‘‘Artificial Intelligence’’ OR ‘‘Smart Environment’’ OR “Smart Systems’’
    OR ‘‘Cloud Computing” OR ‘‘Security Privacy’’ OR “Network Technologies”) 3.4.
    Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria In this systematic mapping study, inclusion and
    exclusion criteria were used to select and excludestudies from the data sources
    to answer the RQs. These criteria were applied to all studies retrieved during
    the different phases of the study selection procedure (see Table 3). Early cited
    articles were also included, provided the full text was available. Table 3. Inclusion
    and exclusion criteria. 4. Results and Discussion In this section, all the RQs
    are answered by analyzing the results extracted from the collection of primary
    studies. In the course of our discussions, each primary study is referenced using
    a unique Paper Identification (PID), and these PIDs correspond to the research
    works summarized in Appendix A. 4.1. RQ1: To Which Domains Has the IoE Been Heavily
    Applied? This research question aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the
    collective endeavors of researchers who have dedicated their studies to similar
    domains, thereby fostering a broader understanding and development of IoE applications.
    The following domains and their respective researchers have demonstrated shared
    objectives within their distinct domains. The Healthcare Domain: Researchers [16,17,18]
    have contributed 6% of the total noteworthy contributions to IoE-driven innovations,
    and their studies all fall within the healthcare domain compared with other domains.
    These shared objectives underscore the unwavering commitment of these researchers
    to enhancing healthcare services, promoting seamless information integration,
    and ultimately benefitting patients, healthcare providers, and various stakeholders.
    Smart Cities and Urban Environments: In the domain of smart cities and urban environments,
    complementary efforts from [7,19,20,21,22] have contributed 13% of IoE applications,
    with influential contributions to this domain. Their shared goals revolve around
    optimizing urban resource allocation, reducing latency, and nurturing sustainable,
    green, and resilient urban environments through the integration of IoE technologies.
    Researchers [8,23] have focused on advancing IoE applications within smart homes.
    Their research initiatives collectively contribute to the convenience and energy
    efficiency of smart home environments. Cloud Computing, Fog, and Edge Collaboration:
    Several researchers, including [20,24,25,26,27,28], have made significant contributions
    to advancing IoE integration in the field of cloud computing and collaboration.
    These initiatives collectively highlight the crucial role that cloud computing
    plays in the Internet of Everything (IoE) and its potential to offer useful services
    to end users. IoE skills in fog and cloud situations have been improved by researchers,
    including [19,29,30,31]. Researchers are working together to maximize the potential
    of cloud and fog technologies to enhance Internet of Everything (IoE) applications.
    In IoE research, refs. [31,32,33,34] have all advanced the field of edge computing.
    By emphasizing effective job scheduling and resource allocation, together, these
    research projects tap into the potential of edge computing in Internet of Everything
    applications. In the domain of cloud computing, fog, and edge collaboration, approximately
    25% of the researchers included in this study have dedicated their efforts, marking
    it as the most prominent domain for IoE application within existing research endeavors.
    The Security Domain: Researchers [35,36,37,38,39,40,41], have made significant

    Researchers [47,48,49,50,51] have extended IoE research into the realm of business
    strategies. Together these, research initiatives explore the transformative potential
    of the IoE in various business contexts. The business domain makes a substantial
    contribution, accounting for approximately 9% of the overall IoE applications
    compared with other domains. The Education Domain: In the field of education,
    6% of IoE research is applied to this domain. Researchers [52,53,54] are focused
    on unlocking the revolutionary possibilities offered by the Internet of Everything
    (IoE). These research initiatives, taken together, aim to improve educational
    experiences and reinforce security by incorporating IoE platforms. The Smart Systems
    Domain: Within the domain of smart systems, researchers [37,44,55,56] share common

    Domain: In the domain of agriculture, researchers [27,57] have made significant
    contributions, with IoE technologies representing 8% of their collective efforts
    to enhance agricultural best practices. In summary, a total of 11 diverse domains
    within the Internet of Everything (IoE) landscape have benefited from the collaborative
    efforts of researchers who share common objectives, which are described in this
    study. As depicted in Figure 3, the cloud computing, fog, and edge collaboration
    domain represents 25%, signifying its substantial prevalence in the IoE landscape
    compared with other domains. This prominence can be attributed to its central
    role in enabling IoE services, minimizing latency, and streamlining data processing
    and analysis. This domain effectively caters to the fundamental infrastructure
    and connectivity demands of IoE, rendering it a primary focal point for researchers
    and practitioners in this field. Figure 3. IoE technology in various domains.
    Collectively, these researchers have contributed to the advancement of similar
    domains, addressing critical challenges and fostering innovation through their
    IoE expertise. Therefore, there are also interconnections between researchers’
    work in various domains. This interdisciplinary collaboration leads to innovations
    that leverage IoT technologies to address complex challenges across diverse domains.
    Table 4 offers a structured summary of the number of studies within the IoE field,
    illustrating the interconnections among studies in different domains and their
    contributions to diverse IoT applications. Furthermore, as addressed in RQ1 discussions,
    Figure 3 presents the percentages of research undertaken in various domains, enhancing
    the comprehensibility of the analysis. Table 4. Number of studies and interconnections
    in IoT applications. 4.2. RQ2: What Types of Problems Exist in IoE Innovations?
    The Internet of Everything (IoE) encompasses a wide range of innovations and technologies
    that aim to connect not onlydevices and people, but also data, processes, and
    things in a more comprehensive and integrated manner. As a result, IoE innovations
    can address a diverse set of problems and challenges across various domains. Based
    on the analysis of this study, we identify the current problems in IoE innovations.
    Below are some common types of problems in IoE innovation. 4.2.1. Healthcare As
    healthcare becomes more patient-centric, it needs a multilayer architecture to
    manage the enormous amount of data generated by the system, such as to control
    COVID epidemics/pandemics while maintaining privacy and addressing protection
    issues in healthcare [16,17]. The proliferation of the e-commerce market has posed
    challenges to staff safety, product quality, and operational efficiency, especially
    for cold-chain logistics (CCL). Recently, the logistics of vaccine supply under
    the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has re-aroused public attention and led to calls
    for innovative solutions to tackle the challenges remaining in CCL [18]. 4.2.2.
    Smart Environments Due to the unprecedented increase in the use of IoE technology
    and the volume of data it generates, there is a need to develop a state-of-the-art
    architecture to support a wide range of applications to manage smart city resources
    efficiently and intelligently [19,47]. The main challenge in realizing the smart
    city vision is providing seamless interoperability between the IoE entities [7].
    This is due to most of the systems nowadays working in a silo-based manner and
    not being able to be connected or communicate with other systems [8,20,23]. Security
    has become a hot subject of particular concern, with issues of complicated technology
    and a massive volume of data [37]. The IoE also poses considerable challenges
    to firms, including the development of interoperability between systems, coping
    with entrenched industry partners that do not collaborate with the new developments,
    path-dependent legacy processes and transactions, contractual and liability issues,
    security challenges, loss of control, as well as privacy concerns related to the
    explosion of data collected and used by businesses and their smart things [41,44,48,58].
    4.2.3. Power Systems, Virtualization, Distributed Systems, and Automation The
    IoT evolves into the IoE by incorporating the concept of things. A further step
    towards a Tactile Internet requires significantly reduced latency [3]. The coordination
    and management of the IoE in different equipment is challenging, and the energy
    consumption efficiency could be much higher, which is the bottleneck of battery-operated
    IoT equipment [46]. To meet the growing demands for IoE devices, the current power
    supply system needs improvement in both system and unit-level energy storage and
    management [55]. Challenging environments include environments where the medium
    is inhomogeneous, or the signal propagation is subject to high scattering and
    multipath effects. In addition, peer-to-peer networking of small devices and smart
    sensors will attract even more attention, with increased integration of participator
    sensing within the Internet of Things [29]. The disaster area is a constantly
    changing environment, making it challenging to distribute supplies effectively.
    The lack of credibility of IoE devices’ data operations, trust evaluation, and
    accurate information about the required goods and potential bottlenecks in the
    distribution process can be detrimental [42,43]. The IoE is expected to reinvent
    the business and the automation wheel altogether. From operational models to business
    and manufacturing frameworks, everything is likely to change with the change in
    data available and the smart connectivity between people and machines for critical
    decision making [59]. For several IoT applications, a long range, low cost, and
    low power consumption are the main connectivity constraints to meet, making many
    network technologies impractical [60]. 4.2.4. Cloud, Fog, and Edge Sensory infrastructure
    deployment and sensing technique development across different domains may share
    common challenges and specificities, which should be considered when designing
    an architecture. That is, sensors or sensory infrastructures belonging to one
    domain should be transmitted to and used by another domain when needed [24,26].
    One main challenge is moving these data from the underlying IoT to the cloud;
    architecture must support resource sharing across other domains [26,28]. Malicious
    attack detection and mitigation are essential issues for the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) [29]. Massive devices will lead to explosive traffic growth, which in turn
    will cause a significant burden for data transmission and content delivery [25,33].
    The distributed environment used for the IoE’s generation of big data (BD) has
    the potential to lead to data storage and processing problems. Inherent problems
    are the reason for the inefficient working of the applications in the cloud environment
    [21,22,34]. Several challenges include the significant fluctuation of user devices’
    requests at the edge side, the lack of collaboration among edge nodes, service
    delays, resource exploitation in multidevice fog-cloud architecture, and problems
    associated with time-sensitive applications [19,30,31,32]. 4.2.5. Digital Marketing
    and Blockchain Ongoing challenges persist in maintaining security within this
    context, while also adapting to evolving legal privacy requirements, many of which
    demand further technical clarification [60]. In the age of the Internet of Everything
    (IoE), intricate patterns of connectivity emerge among individuals, processes,
    data, and devices. When evaluating the assessment of companies operating within
    the IoE industry, the predominant issue revolves around substantial uncertainty
    [51]. Critical concerns in the IoE domain include user consent and data security,
    encompassing mobile devices and diverse service providers [27,58]. In the IoE
    ecosystem, the majority of “things” consist of low-power, low-performance devices.
    Several device attributes, such as security, privacy, power consumption, and computational
    capabilities, pose challenges when integrating a blockchain environment into the
    IoE [35]. 4.2.6. Data Security and Deep Learning With the increasing ubiquity
    and sophistication of facial recognition technology, a potential security and
    privacy concern regarding the exposure of facial data linked to sensitive personal
    information within the expansive Internet of Everything application platform arises
    [40]. Across various domains, the Internet of Everything generates copious data,
    encompassing domains like healthcare systems, traffic management, smart city surveillance,
    educational platforms, social networks, and government entities, among others.
    Scouring through this extensive dataset and locating specific data or keys presents
    a formidable challenge [56]. To safeguard the integrity of data, multiple security
    protocols operate in tandem with confidential keys, aiming to furnish security
    services. The primary hurdle lies in securely exchanging or distributing keys
    between two parties operating over an inherently insecure network [39]. Most existing
    anomaly detection solutions within the Internet of Everything are characterized
    by time-consuming processes and exhibit suboptimal accuracy levels [61]. 4.2.7.
    Agriculture The combined forces of climate change and a swiftly growing global
    population have significantly burdened agriculture. This, in turn, has created
    a ripple effect on the Earth’s water resources, a critical component of sustainable
    development. The imperative to transition away from fossil fuels for powering
    irrigation systems, prompted by climate change, necessitates striking a delicate
    balance [57]. Addressing the challenges within this sector is pivotal in order
    to reinvigorate it and propel it towards enhanced progress [27]. 4.2.8. Education
    Teaching has evolved beyond the mere transmission of content knowledge; it now
    emphasizes the development of the practical “how, when, and why” aspects of applying
    this knowledge in real-world contexts [53]. The complexity in designing and implementing
    IoE-based educational systems arises from the need to create multiple intelligent
    agents that infuse intelligence into every facet of the teaching–learning experience.
    The absence of intelligence within IoE-related systems can impede the management
    of the vast volume of information generated by individuals and devices within
    these systems [52]. To establish a smart campus, a range of systems is essential,
    including those for detection, monitoring, and analysis [54]. Based on the discussion,
    Table 5 has outlined the common challenges encountered in IoE innovation across
    diverse domains. Meanwhile, Figure 4 showcases the specific number of problems
    that researchers have focused on within their respective domains in the IoE landscape.
    Figure 4. Number of IoE problems focused on. Table 5. Common problems in IoE innovation.
    4.3. RQ3: What Is the Contribution of the IoE to Each Innovation? Researchers
    from different fields have strived to harness the IoE’s potential for addressing
    domain-specific challenges. This subsection synthesizes their efforts, highlighting
    common themes in research contributions. 4.3.1. Healthcare An exceptionally spectacular
    usage of the IoE was while the whole world suffered with the COVID-19 pandemic.
    The healthcare domain has witnessed significant IoE-driven improvements, and one
    of them is aimed at tracking and containing pandemics such as COVID-19 [16]. Leveraging
    accurate tracking technologies, cloud computing, and interoperable devices, researchers
    have focused on screening and identifying infected individuals during their daily
    routines. Other research endeavors [17,18] have proposed a multilayer architecture
    and a cyber-physical platform framework that applied the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) and digital twin (DT) technologies, respectively, to promote information
    integration and provide smart services for different stakeholders in the healthcare
    area. 4.3.2. Smart Cities and Urban Environments Smart cities have been at the
    forefront of IoE research, with a focus on resource allocation and job offloading
    architectures using intelligence-enriched 6G architectures [19]. The concept of
    EdgeOSH [20] has been introduced, revolutionizing home automation through edge
    computing. Researchers [21,22] have adopted fog aims to enhance data processing
    through the blockchain–fog architecture network (BFAN) whereas others [22] have
    introduced fog nodes (FN) within fog computing (FC) to facilitate IoT applications
    in urban environments, satisfying mobility support, low latency, and geo-distribution
    requirements. As a part of smart cities, [8] specifically focused on smart homes
    through introducing convenience and energy efficiency to daily life within smart
    homes. 4.3.3. Cloud, Fog, and Edge Collaborations Mutual objectives shared by
    several researchers [24,25,26,27,28] were achieved through adopting cloud, fog,
    and edge environments in IoE. Researchers have proposed a cloud-based architecture
    for resource sharing (CARS) and the energy-efficient cloud-based Internet of Everything
    (EECloudIoE) [25]. These architectures introduce geographically distributed platforms
    connecting sensors and various IoE components, providing valuable services to
    end-users. Dhaya and Khantavel contribute to this landscape by focusing on algorithmic
    efficiency within multi-data-center environments, further optimizing resource
    management in cloud-based IoE platforms [28]. Moreover, the paper [26] underscores
    the importance of integration by outlining a research agenda for the integration
    of IoT and cloud computing across various application fields. The peer-to-peer
    central-registry-biased Internet of Everything protocol (P2PRioEP) [27] formalizes
    provisions for hybrid peer-to-peer IoT networks, promoting efficient collaboration
    and data exchange within IoE ecosystems. Xu et al. introduce adaptive mechanisms
    for dynamically collaborative computing power and task scheduling (ADCS) [32].
    This approach enhances the efficiency of edge computing by dynamically allocating
    resources and tasks, aligning to optimize edge computing in IoE scenarios. Yi
    et al. reimagine IoE as an end–edge–cloud collaborative system that promotes the
    development of digital twin-based methods within edge computing [33]. Jain et
    al. highlight the importance of cyber twins in network frameworks by introducing
    a metaheuristic with blockchain-based resource allocation techniques [34]. Sachdev
    navigates key security and privacy issues related to edge AI in IoT/IoE digital
    marketing environments [56]. Bera et al. focus on enhancing security by introducing
    an artificial-intelligence-based blockchain-envisioned access control framework.
    This framework addresses the critical need for robust security measures within
    fog and cloud environments [29]. Velasquez et al. identify key challenges in developing
    a fog orchestrator to support IoE, particularly its impact on fog service orchestration
    tasks [30]. This research objective aims to streamline the orchestration of services
    within fog environments, ensuring efficient and reliable IoE operations. The objective
    of [31] is to introduce a conceptual model for mixed reality (MR) applications
    within fog and cloud environments. By enhancing user experiences through IoT/IoE
    models, this research contributes to the evolving landscape of mixed reality applications,
    which is increasingly relevant in the context of IoE. 4.3.4. Advancements in AI
    The authors of [59,61] both leveraged artificial intelligence in the IoE to enhance
    anomaly detection. The authors of [61] propose a novel deep learning framework
    that combines decomposition methods, deep neural networks, and evolutionary computation.
    Furthermore, innovations in force and tactile sensors, along with AR sensors,
    drive advancements in industrial robotics and manufacturing [59]. 4.3.5. Security
    in the IoE Security remains a paramount concern in IoE research. Innovations include
    novel blockchains such as “PUFChain” [35], which is designed for resource-constrained
    IoT environments. Various authentication schemes have been proposed for 6G IoE-based
    vehicular communication environments [36], emphasizing privacy preservation and
    security. Security and privacy challenges posed by personal smart devices used
    within enterprise settings were explored by [41]. Zhan et al., in their study,
    introduced the Internet of Everything smart logistic network (IoE-SLN) to improve
    smart logistics [37]. Various transportation system applications were integrated
    to enhance logistics parameters, supported by mathematical analysis. IoE research
    on distributed systems focuses on disaster management [42]. Researchers propose
    the integration of blockchain, the IoT, and the IoE to streamline disaster responses,
    reduce response times, and ensure the secure distribution of goods. Furthermore,
    content-based intelligent trust evaluation (CITE) schemes have been introduced
    for collecting trustworthy data in large-scale sensor-cloud systems [43]. 4.3.6.
    Optimization of Network Technologies with IoE The virtualization of networking
    services is explored, with a focus on customized and on-the-fly interconnectivity
    [29]. Other research emphasizes connecting terrestrial IoT network segments to
    satellite backends via satellite broadband [62]. Further, Iannacci aims to build
    an inclusive vision of the IoT, IoE, Tactile Internet, and 5G by leveraging MEMS
    technology, with a focus on energy harvesters (EH-MEMS) and radio frequency passives
    (RF-MEMS) [3]. A data manipulation method proposed by [46] aims to reduce energy
    consumption and network traffic in IoT networks, with an enhancement from software-defined
    networking (SDN). 4.3.7. Enhancing Business Strategies via the IoE IoE research
    extends to the realm of business strategies. Researchers explore how the IoE impacts
    business models and value creation [48]. Additionally, studies evaluate the implications
    of the IoE on marketing analytics [49], new product development, and management
    [50]. Approaches for determining objective and subjective weights in decision
    making are also introduced [51]. Demirkan et al. explored the impact of emerging
    big data and smart analytics on transforming connected products into “smart service”
    businesses [47]. This described a paradigm shift in value chains towards continuous
    data flow through complex business systems. 4.3.8. The IoE in Education Looking
    at an education perspective, the IoE has a transformative potential in improvising
    the field of learning. Ref. [52] focuses on developing system of systems (SoS)
    architectures to support educational contexts, fostering novel educational applications
    and dynamic interactions. Secure and agile architectures for IoE-based educational
    models and learning analytics systems (LAS) are proposed [53]. Furthermore, campus
    security management and notification systems are designed to enhance security
    and monitoring [54]. Researchers have similar objectives in terms of providing
    advancement in education services in the IoE environment. 4.3.9. IoE Research
    for Smart Systems The authors of [44,55] are both engaged in the area of smart
    systems in IoE research. Specifically, their research underlines the significance
    of efficient power supply systems with a high-output performance and extended
    lifetime, placing a strong emphasis on self-power capability in order to guarantee
    the long-term viability and maintenance-free operation of IoE networks. Additionally,
    these researchers expand their focus to include the design of architectural models
    for managing tourism information effectively, introducing the concept of smart
    tourism [44]. Fan et al., in their paper, describe that their objectives revolve
    around enhancing power supply systems and architectural models for the IoE while
    incorporating tourism management strategies [55]. Next, in their research, Pedro
    et al. introduced a cognition module for gathering information from smart systems
    to create knowledge for intelligent services [58]. The goal was to develop a generic
    framework for various smart systems, enabling horizontal integration. Similarly,
    research by Vaya and Hadpawat aimed to provide efficient keys or data-searching
    mechanisms for clients to explore big data within a database [56]. The respective
    studies share common objectives in the realm of IoE in terms of contributing to
    various smart system enhancements. Adenugba et al. demonstrated how smart irrigation
    systems powered by renewable energy sources (RES) could substantially improve
    crop yield and agricultural profitability [57]. They emphasized control and monitoring
    using sensors and environmental data from the Internet of Everything (IoE). Kumar
    et al. aimed to attain a standard quality in crops, focusing on duration, measure,
    hygiene, and blooming stem. They proposed an advanced prototype to enable continuous
    tracking and informed decision making for farmers, using data mining principles
    [27]. Researchers have proposed smart operating systems to streamline IoE system
    management for practitioners [23]. Further, the emerging areas in Internet of
    Everything (IoE) research were examined, revealing several key domains where researchers
    have made notable contributions. Figure 5 illustrates this and includes smart
    cities (23.08%), marked by urban applications and resource allocation; smart systems
    (30.77%), focusing on efficient power supply and architectural models; cloud/fog/edge
    (15.38%), involving collaborations between the IoE and cloud technologies; disaster
    management (15.38%), integrating blockchain and the IoT for logistics and disaster
    response; network technologies (7.69%), emphasizing networking virtualization;
    and education (7.69%), aiming to enhance educational systems. Smart systems garnered
    the most attention from researchers, with smart cities being the second most explored
    domain. This analysis showcases the multifaceted nature of IoE research, spanning
    various domains and applications. Figure 5. Contributions in Emerging Areas. The
    research contributions summarized in this article emphasize the IoE’s versatility
    and transformative potential. They highlight the diverse ways in which IoE technologies
    can address domain-specific challenges and inspire interdisciplinary collaboration.
    As the IoE continues to evolve, researchers from various domains are poised to
    contribute to its growth and maturity [63]. 4.4. RQ4: What Are the Most Frequently
    Used Evaluation Metrics? Evaluation metrics play a vital role in gauging the quality
    of the IoE. Various evaluation metrics are at our disposal for assessing IoE innovation,
    as illustrated in Figure 6. The lines and circles in Figure 6. represent the evaluation
    metrics and the total number of primary studies associated with the enhancement
    of each specific performance metrics. The employment of multiple evaluation metrics
    is of paramount importance, since an innovation may excel under one metric but
    underperform when assessed with another [64]. Therefore, selecting the right evaluation
    metrics is crucial for ensuring the proper and optimal development of IoE innovation.
    Quantitative evaluation, a methodology that relies on numerical indices derived
    primarily from objective data collection methods, systematic and controlled observation,
    and a well-defined research design, comes into play. Specifically, it is imperative
    to specify the evaluation metric. Within the realm of IoE innovations, the researchers
    in this study primarily considered accuracy, energy consumption, power consumption,
    completion time, and cost as the most significant dimensions for evaluation, as
    illustrated in Table 6. Figure 6. Visualization of performance metrics used in
    IoE. Table 6. Performance metrics in primary studies. 4.5. RQ5: What Are the Limitations
    in Each IoE Innovation? In the realm of Internet of Everything (IoE) research,
    several research works across various domains have made significant contributions,
    but they are not without their limitations. These limitations, when analyzed collectively,
    provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by researchers in harnessing
    the potential of the IoE. The limitations identified in most of the research works
    are summarized below. 4.5.1. Storage Challenges Several research works, such as
    [16], highlight the challenge of high storage usage when collecting data in IoE
    applications. The sheer volume of data generated by IoE devices can lead to storage
    constraints, impacting the scalability and long-term feasibility of solutions.
    Limited storage capacity, as observed in [17], can result in extended data transfer
    times to the cloud. This limitation hampers the timely availability of critical
    information, potentially impacting decision making processes. 4.5.2. Computation
    Overhead Computation-intensive tasks, driven by multiple scheduling algorithms,
    as can be seen in [19,33], can lead to a high computational overhead. This limit
    affects the efficiency and real-time performance of IoE systems, especially in
    resource-constrained environments. In IoE systems, especially those involving
    financial transactions, drawbacks related to latency, as identified in [42], can
    impact the overall user experience. Transaction processing delays may deter users
    from adopting IoE solutions. 4.5.3. Power Supply Assessment The research work
    [55] emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive assessment of power supply systems
    in IoE. Neglecting to evaluate the continuity and quality of power supplies can
    lead to disruptions in IoE applications, particularly in scenarios where uninterrupted
    power is crucial. 4.5.4. Lack of Assessment Some research, including [20], has
    limitations in terms of assessment. Failure to evaluate factors such as user experience,
    cost, and delay can result in incomplete insights into the overall performance
    and feasibility of IoE solutions. 4.5.5. Data Size Effect The impact of the data
    size on performance [34], as mentioned in [37], can be a significant disadvantage.
    The researcher overlooked and underestimated the need for efficient data handling
    and processing techniques in IoE applications. 4.5.6. Cost-Intensive Technologies
    High costs associated with infrastructure, such as core cloud connectivity via
    high-speed optical links pose a limitation in terms of the scalability and affordability
    of IoE deployments, as in [34]. Nevertheless, Ref. [29] used blockchain technology,
    known for its cost-intensive nature. Hence, implementing such technologies, as
    [29,34] do, can lead to high expenses, making scalability and cost-effectiveness
    challenging. 4.5.7. Technical Feasibility The research work [48] focuses on business
    model management but may not be directly applicable at the technical infrastructure
    level. This constraint highlights the need for aligning business models with technical
    feasibility. 4.5.8. Response Time Oversights Response time oversights, as noted
    in [19], can be resulted from extensive routing packets in networks. Equally,
    Ref. [27] focused on passing messages safely; however, the response time was not
    measured as well as in [39]. Failure to consider response times can impact the
    usability and efficiency of IoE environments. 4.5.9. Data Privacy, Accuracy, and
    Integration Ensuring data accuracy and fostering inter-agency collaboration are
    essential for data-driven decision making in the IoE. Research works in [22] overlooked
    the limitations associated with data accuracy and integration between different
    government agencies. Elsewhere, accuracy discussions, as omitted in [53], are
    critical, especially in applications where precision is paramount. Data privacy
    in [31] needs to be addressed comprehensively to ensure the trustworthiness of
    IoE systems. This research is closely linked to security concerns, as discussed
    in [65], where data integrity emerges as a prominent issue in various cloud computing
    scenarios, necessitating the implementation of robust security strategies to tackle
    this challenge. 4.5.10. Extensive Network Network elements, such as the case discussed
    in [39], disregarded the heavy utilization of the network, while the research
    work in [46] describes the omission of the packet loss adversely affected the
    network’s heavy usage in their research contributions. 4.5.11. Adaptability Dhaya
    and Kanthavel focused on the requirement for adaptive adaptability to a variety
    of platforms and contexts, neglecting the limitations of pre-defined approaches
    in multi-data-center systems [28]. 4.5.12. Limited Data Ingestion Conversely,
    studies conducted by [27,43,57] exhibit limitations related to restricted data
    acquisition, primarily centered on indoor data obtained from sensing devices.
    Broadening the scope of data sources has the potential to enrich the range of
    applications within the Internet of Everything (IoE) [66]. Below is a summary
    in Table 7, and Figure 7 presents limitations of individual research works. The

    Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that provides ubiquitous and massive connectivity.
    It promises an unlimited possibility in improving the quality of life (e.g., smart
    homes, intelligent diagnostics systems, autonomous driving vehicles, smart irrigation,
    smart cities, and many more) of end-user [1]. The IoT device is vast and encompasses
    numerous features at different layers, which can be challenging to understand
    the significance of different devices from different layers based on the type
    of problem it addresses. These problems are broadly classified as social, environmental,
    and economic development to transform an existing physical infrastructure into
    cyber–physical infrastructure. IoT has much potential to gather resources and
    assist individuals by offering efficient services with smart cyber–physical solutions.
    Smart healthcare, smart grid, smart water supply management, and smart city are
    IoT-based solutions that influence social factors. In connection to healthcare,
    lately, the Internet of Medical Things has emerged as a pioneering platform. [2].
    The authors of [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] investigated the smart healthcare
    framework to monitor the physical and mental health of the patients, and human
    activity recognition. This technology performs timely detection of an anomaly
    in an individual by collecting data using different types of sensors. To improve
    quality of life, we need to design an IoT network that facilitates access to essential
    services, transportation, and better environmental conditions. Thus a smart city
    application emerged by employing a network of smart devices. Examples of such
    applications include parking, waste management, sanitation, lighting, traffic,
    buildings, and the energy sector. Similarly, the smart energy industries solve
    the problem of generation, distribution, consumption, and demand analysis by integrating
    IoT devices. A few examples are smart wind turbines, smart hydro-power systems,
    smart grids, etc. In general, IoT also helps to enhance energy efficiency (EE)
    in electrical devices. Moreover, we use highways and roads to move consumable
    goods from one place to another. Therefore, the existing road infrastructure can
    be made smart by creating warning messages regarding weather conditions, road
    congestion, impending accidents, etc. Several emerging technologies empower smart
    applications like vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), vehicle-to-everything
    (V2X) data exchange service, device-to-device (D2D) connectivity [9]. These applications
    can be leveraged to solve the problem of fast and hassle-free parking and efficient
    traffic management through optimal routing mechanisms using different IoT sensors.
    Such sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.
    The literature in [10], [11], [12], [13] enables smart transportation in future
    cities by ensuring the safety of the driver and reducing traffic congestion. It
    is achieved by using the Mood-Fatigue Analyzer (MFA) and camera-based eye detection
    method that uses the viola-jones algorithm to ensure the safety of the driver
    and traveler in the car. In today’s era, the business prerequisites of the industry
    are automation, interconnection, and real-time data collection. Industrial IoT
    (IIoT) [14], [15] is the driving force of Industry 4.0. The enormous data generated
    by smart tracking systems [16], smart factories [17], and smart asset management
    [18] are exploited to achieve an optimized performance of the supply chain. These
    networks include embedded systems, microcontrollers, sensors and actuator networks
    (SANET), communication modules, etc. In [19], the authors have reviewed the motivation
    to apply IoT for big data analysis and the technological and social challenges
    associated with it. This type of application requires a continuous flow of information.
    Hence, the devices require more power compared to other applications. IoT-based
    cellular, non-terrestrial, and wide-area network connections are predicted to
    approach 5.9 billion by 2026 [20]. These wide-area network connections include
    sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and a communication interface that require
    batteries to run their sensing, processing, and transmission interfaces. These
    batteries have a finite capacity. Frequently recharging/changing these batteries
    results in change-over downtime and incurs huge operational costs. Moreover, at
    the current rate of carbon dioxide emissions, global temperatures have risen substantially
    from pre-industrial levels. Hence, there is a compelling need to plan future cities
    to be sustainable [21], [22]. Harvesting energy from natural sources is a promising
    self-sustainable solution that prolongs battery life, eliminates maintenance costs,
    and aids in long-term deployment. Particularly, photo-voltaic (PV) cells [23],
    [24] and radio frequency (RF) [25], [26] have been identified as cost-effective
    energy sources that enable on-site charging of rechargeable batteries for sustainable
    IoT applications. It is necessary to have a thorough understanding of IoT devices
    in terms of power, cost, and critical features (sensing interface, actuation interface,
    processing interface, data-storage interface, data-management interface, and communication
    interface) at different layers to assemble the self-sustainable IoT system design.
    However, no such architecture collaborates the function of three-layer, four-layer,
    five-layer, and seven-layer architecture design for sustainable IoT applications.
    So, there is a need to establish a clean and streamlined cross-layer architecture
    to bridge the gap between application requirements and IoT system design. The
    widely researched, self-sustainable IoT-enabled layered architecture design, compatible
    with various IoT applications, has been effectively illustrated in Fig. 1. In
    a self-sustainable layered architecture design, Fig. 1 represents every possible
    IoT service, device, and application congruously. The layered architectural design
    begins with the energy harvesting interface, which includes energy sources, transducers,
    trackers, and storage interface. Additionally, it demonstrates various optimization
    strategies to reap the maximum benefit of the harvested energy. Various IoT devices
    that require power to perform data sensing, transmission, processing, and accumulation

    architecture design are categorized in terms of power requirement, cost, and other

    Motivation and contribution Based on the state-of-art, we conclude that several
    studies have been conducted on EH-IoT networks (see Table 1), and a tutorial on
    EH-IoT networks based on the layered architecture design is missing. Moreover,
    no substantial survey has ever been performed to develop a self-sustainable IoT
    device based on application requirements by following a sequential set of IoT
    reference layer models as shown in Fig. 1. For energy harvesting, it is necessary
    to have a clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT
    devices. The framework involves generation process, storage mechanism, tracking
    energy consumption, and managing the supply of harvested energy. We have designed
    a framework for EH-IoT by dividing it into energy sources, energy transducers,
    energy trackers, energy management, and energy consumption interfaces. The proposed
    mapping of EH-IoT, along with the design framework, will help researchers and
    practitioners of this domain to reduce the time to collate knowledge and create
    a road map for their specific needs. The contributions of this survey are summarized
    as follows: • We have classified IoT modules based on their applications. Next,
    each class has been divided into IoT device based layered architecture to study
    layer-specific power requirements (or demand) versus the sources (or supply).
    • This is followed by a discussion on energy harvesting from several sources,
    which will act as an enabler of power source for EH-IoT. Also, the method to harvest
    and store that harvested energy is outlined by highlighting the currently available
    and emerging energy storage interfaces. • We proposed a balanced and well-researched
    layers architecture design of self-sustainable IoT device for various IoT applications.
    We developed a single overview of all layers’ architecture and their relations
    with energy harvesting interfaces. • The energy-saving and resource-optimization
    method for self-sustainable IoT design is discussed in terms of power and data
    optimization. Moreover, various methods to maintain balance among bandwidth, range,
    power consumption, and time constraints of IoT sensing, processing, and transmission
    interfaces are discussed by following a common framework of the EH interface.
    • Insights on IoT-based energy harvesting interfaces that contribute to interoperability
    and the interfacing units such as sensing, processing, communication, and energy
    harvesting are discussed in IoT layered design. • Finally, based on state-of-art
    literature, we highlight several open research issues and future possibilities
    for self-sustainable IoT device based on the layered architecture design. Table

    Table 1 indicates a complete summary of the existing survey papers based on different
    functionalities of devices. The functionalities of the device are shown based
    on different IoT interfaces from the cross-layer architecture design by considering
    their use in specific IoT applications. The different functionalities mainly incorporates
    the sensing & actuation, processing, EH, energy storage, data management and storage
    and wireless interfaces. 43% of the literature covers any four layers (mostly
    sensing and actuation, processing, EH, and wireless interface are covered under
    review). But most of the time these articles omit discussion on data management,
    and energy storage interfaces. We have covered all six interfaces. In contrast
    to the other surveys, our survey provides a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated
    overview of the proposed self-sustainable IoT device for diverse IoT applications.
    It is achieved by covering all the IoT interfaces from the cross-layer architecture
    design. Each interfacing region operates in the different layers of IoT device.
    The description of different interfaces is as follows: • The sensing and actuation
    interface is a part of the physical layer and deals with different sensing and
    actuating devices for IoT applications. Moreover, the processing interface is
    also a part of the physical layer, which focuses on the number of micro-controllers
    and microprocessors used in different IoT applications. • Once the data has been
    sensed and processed by sensing and processing interface of the physical layer
    architecture design, it needs to be sent among different devices for the exchange
    of information. This data transmission is carried out by a wireless interface
    unit which is a part of network layer in the IoT device based layer architecture
    design. • The data management and storage interface is part of the processing
    layer. It is responsible for handling and organizing large amounts of data. This
    interface also includes certain protocols used at the application layer, like
    MQTT, AMPQP, and XMPP, which are the methods used for managing the data at the
    remote server. • Finally, we need an energy-harvesting (EH) and energy storage
    interface to power the IoT devices. These interfacing units manage and store the
    power supply of IoT devices. For energy harvesting, it is necessary to have a
    clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT devices.
    The framework involves the generation process, storage mechanism, tracking energy
    consumption, and managing the supply of harvested energy. We have designed a framework
    for self-sustainable IoT device by dividing it into energy source units, energy
    transducers, energy tracker units, energy management units, and energy consumption
    units. The proposed mapping of self-sustainable IoT device, along with the design
    framework, will help researchers and practitioners of this domain to reduce the
    time to collate knowledge and create a road map for their specific needs. Some
    of the available research papers based on the above interfacing layers are discussed
    below. In [27], the authors describe the overview of IoT in terms of wireless,
    sensing, and actuation interfaces by considering the middleware layer. This layer
    enables interoperability across various IoT devices, applications, and platforms.
    They define the suitability of the sensors, actuators, and different communication
    protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, and WiFi for IoT applications in a variety
    of applications, including healthcare, transportation, and smart cities. The authors
    of [28] described the cloud-centric/Internet-centric architecture for the IoT
    networking, sensing, and processing interface. The intention is to offer an integrated
    platform for developing analytics tools, computer graphic designers, specialists
    in artificial intelligence, and sensing service units. Therefore, a single platform
    can combine storage, computation, and visualization paradigms to improve IoT performance
    for various applications. Apart from this, authors in [29] focused on providing
    a promising approach to build a smart industrial system by using the four-layered
    architecture design. Authors in [30] focused on handling the security and privacy
    issue of the IoT paradigm at the perception and processing layers. IoT sensors
    generate massive data to make it applicable at the application interface. But
    unauthorized users generate several attacks, such as brute force, phishing, man-in-the-middle
    attack, spoofing, and denial of service attacks in the lower layers of IoT system
    design to steal valuable data. To address this issue, authors paved forward various
    technologies such as blockchain and physical layer security to secure the data.
    Authors in [31] discussed the state-of-the-art protocols and applications in the
    emerging era of IoT networks. They consolidate most IoT applications, including
    smart wearables, brain-sensing headphones, and embedded skin patches, by concentrating
    on the taxonomy of three- and five-layered architectural designs. The architecture
    section of this paper also considers fog computing, which has never been considered
    earlier but lacks a discussion on data management and power interfaces. Despite
    the advancement in IoT technology, work on sensing, processing, and actuation
    interfaces are still underway in terms of power requirement. To overcome the power
    interface units, authors in [32], [33] covered a thorough review of energy harvesting
    sources, energy storage devices, and associated topologies of energy harvesting
    systems for energy-constrained IoT networks. It mainly focused on distribution
    approaches, conversion modules, storage devices, and control units to minimize
    circuit losses. Similarly, authors in [1] examine several strategies that facilitate
    the efficient use of energy harvesting as a proxy for different IoT devices in
    an efficient manner. It also investigates the effective checkpointing and timestamping
    methods to power IoT devices without depending on conventional power supplies.
    In addition to utilizing renewable energy sources to power IoT devices, new machine
    learning and wireless communication techniques for EH-IoTs are being researched.
    These include the backscatter communication technique, packet-less IoT communication,
    and reinforcement learning. The authors of [34] present energy harvesting solutions
    and energy efficient approaches for information and communication technology (ICT)
    by dividing the discussion of the paper into two parts: Green of ICT and Green
    by ICT. Green of ICTencompasses a wide range of topics, including green data center,
    network, and device approaches. Furthermore, Green by ICT provides energy harvesting
    strategies and resource-saving options for device-to-device communication. Further
    on, Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT) technology that increases battery life is also covered.
    A comprehensive analysis of the most recent energy harvesting technologies for
    IoT sensing devices is provided by the authors in [35], who also emphasize the
    IoT system’s potential for energy autonomy. In addition, the authors describe
    two case studies of IoT systems that utilize energy harvesting via solar and RF
    energy sources to provide energy autonomy for sensing devices. Both systems employ
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons as sensors, which broadcast the sensed parameters
    to BLE-capable terminals like mobile devices. The mobile devices then transmit
    this data to the cloud via internet services. The authors of [36] focus on the
    wireless interface of the current and future IoT applications, including 5G cellular
    networks, wide-area networks, and unlicensed band communication. It is accomplished
    by utilizing grant-free access, channel coding for short-packet communication,
    non-orthogonal multiple access, and on-device intelligence to make the wireless
    unit energy-efficient, highly reliable, low latency, and scalable. In [37], the
    authors emphasized the data management unit by proposing a proportional trade-off
    between high security and reduced energy usage of IoT devices. It employs a context-aware
    technique to safeguard IoT data while consuming minimal energy. The authors also
    considered the scope of artificial intelligence and Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) to deploy a secure, energy-efficient IoT network. Similarly, in [38], [39],
    the authors presented different approaches to predictive analysis and classification
    methods to secure the data at minimal power consumption. It shows that during
    data transmission, most of the power is consumed when data packet collisions occur,
    packet overheads are unaddressed, redundant data is present, and a longer distance
    exists between the transmitter and receiver. Additionally, they highlight a number
    of efficient ways to lower energy consumption in both single-hop and multi-hop
    communication networks. The existing studies involves shallow discussion on the
    interfacing units within the IoT context. However, it fails to provide detailed
    information about the specific types of sensing, processing, and communication
    devices involved, as well as their corresponding power consumption in the layer
    architecture design. From the state-of-art, it has been seen that there is no
    substantial survey has ever been performed to develop a self-sustainable IoT device
    based on application requirements by following a sequential set of IoT reference
    layer models. As a result, our proposed framework filling the gap by mapping the
    IoT applications to the devices and, subsequently, the devices to the energy harvesting
    (EH) interface. The first step in this process involves identifying the layer
    architecture design for self-sustainable IoT device. Each layer accommodates different
    devices for different IoT applications. These IoT devices require a ubiquitous
    supply of power for their operations. To fulfill the power requirement of different
    devices that fall into different layers of IoT applications, there is a need for
    energy harvesting sources, transducers and storage interfaces. So, this necessitate
    the development of the self-sustainable IoT device that establish a connection
    among IoT application, devices and energy-harvesting interface. Download : Download

    of the paper. 1.3. Organization This survey is further structured as shown in
    Fig. 2. After a brief introduction, Section 2 presents survey on standard system
    architecture for IoT applications. Next in Section 3, the energy (power) requirement
    at different layers have been outlined. In Section 4, the different EH sources,
    transducers, trackers, and storage approaches that can be used in various IoT
    applications are discussed. Next, in Section 5, the various optimization techniques
    for effective utilizing the harvested energy are presented. Then, in Section 6,
    a comprehensive surveys is highlighted for various IoT applications based on the
    devices of different IoT layers and energy harvesting interfaces to establish
    the mapping between the IoT devices and the energy harvesting interfaces. Additionally,
    Section 7 discusses open issues and future trends. Finally, the paper is concluded
    in Section 8. 2. Standard layered architecture for IoT-enabled applications While
    designing an IoT system, it is essential to have an understanding of the devices
    and their organization. It is important to visualize the organization of different
    devices acting as a connected system. This Section describes the first step towards
    the strategic mapping between applications to layers and layers to devices. The
    designer has to take care of not only the functionality but also the coverage
    area, power requirements, architecture, and cost factors associated with the communication
    system. The standard functionalities are sensing, actuation, processing, data
    storage, and management. The cost factors include developmental, fabrication,
    and maintenance costs. This complex system model can be organized into a layered
    architecture. The design approach helps the system designer in two ways, namely,
    to create functional interactions and subsequently design communication strategies
    based on those interactions. In the first phase, the required functionalities
    are organized into different layers (e.g., starting from sensing any event to
    a final consumable product/application). The interfaces are laid down in the second
    phase to exchange information (intra and inter-layer communication). We have presented
    an example in Fig. 3. There are several position papers and surveys that deal
    with layer architecture design of IoT device [40], [41], [42]. Despite the refinement
    in IoT system design, the state-of-the-art has yet to have a single framework
    on layer architecture of IoT device that is widely accepted. While one group of
    researchers focused on the protocol, another group concentrated on the cloud-based
    architecture. In 2014, Rockwell Automation, Cisco, and IBM presented a seven-layer
    architectural model for IoT. However, the one proposed by the IoT world forum
    aimed to fulfill the space between application requirements and system design
    [43], [44]. The seven-layer architecture is an updated version of the five-layer
    architecture that introduced edge computing, fog computing, and big data processing.
    Fig. 3 depicts all the necessary functions and collaborative overview of several
    three-layer, four-layer, five-layer, and seven-layer architectural reference models.
    The role and requirements of each layer in the self-sustainable IoT devices, applications,
    and services is discussed in the following sections. In this work, the seven-layer
    interface has been consolidated into a five-layer architecture which is discussed
    below. A typical IoT application requirement can be connected to a self-sustainable
    system design by identifying the mapping between interfacing sub-layers [31].
    We shall use this layered architecture to review the power requirement of IoT
    devices. Next, we present a brief discussion on different layers covering the
    functionality, whereas an in-depth discussion on the IoT devices can be found
    in Section 3. Download : Download high-res image (753KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Different layer architecture designs for IoT device. 2.1. Business
    layer The main aim of the business layer is to handle the entire IoT system. It
    communicates with the application layer and consumes the information available
    at that layer. It can alter business operations and benefit the overall operation
    of the IoT network. 2.2. Application layer The application layer provides application-oriented
    services to the end users. A huge number of IoT applications have been developed
    that cater to different services such as smart home, smart transportation, smart
    infrastructure management, and many more sustainable IoT applications have been
    broadly categorized into three classes, namely, social, business and environmental.
    2.3. Processing layer This layer is referred to as the middleware layer, and it
    is responsible for storing, processing, and analyzing a large amount of information
    from the connectivity layer. It incorporates database management, cloud computing,
    and analytics of big data-based technologies. The processing layer encompasses
    two most important sub-layer interfaces that recreate a crucial part of IoT system
    design, e.g., (a) data storage/accumulation interface (b) data management/abstraction
    interface. 2.4. Connectivity layer The connectivity layer mainly deals with the
    transmission of useful information in an efficient and timely manner. The layer
    includes all networking elements of IoT. This layer includes wireless communication
    protocols such as Z-Wave, LoRa, Zigbee, Thread, Wi-Fi, SigFox, Bluetooth, and
    cellular communication. 2.5. Physical layer (Perception layer) The physical layer
    is the initial layer of the IoT reference model that deals with the things/devices
    of IoT. The “things” in IoT refers to different end devices that transmit and
    receive data. The layer includes sensors, actuators, and controllers. The power
    supply is also managed through this layer. Multiple interfacing sub-layers exist
    between the physical and connection layer (as depicted in Fig. 3), namely, the
    sensing and actuation interface, power supply/monitoring interface, pre-processing
    interface, and temporary storage interface. Moreover, a detailed discussion on
    sensors and actuators, which are part of the layer, is discussed in Section 3.5.1
    The following Section goes through the power, cost, and critical features of IoT
    devices at different layers to assemble the self-sustainable IoT system design.
    3. Power and cost required for self-sustainable IoT devices in the layer architecture
    design This Section discusses the power or voltage and the associated cost of
    operating different IoT layers. IoT devices’ power consumption is crucial in identifying
    suitable energy harvesting interfaces to make them sustainable. Moreover, different
    IoT devices consume power at different layers based on their functioning. However,
    business layers need not be mentioned in this Section, as this layer do not involve
    physical IoT devices that consume power. So, this layer mainly do not contribute
    towards the sustainable IoT device. Moreover, this layers deal with application-oriented
    services involving different groups and business processes. Above this, we look
    at the cost requirement and critical features of different types of microcontrollers,
    sensors and actuators network (SANET), and communication modules to make the architecture
    of IoT device self-sustainable in different smart applications as discussed below:
    3.1. Application layer The application layer protocols play a significant role
    in sustaining the IoT devices for different applications as it establishes the
    communication among things, devices, or objects with different application interfaces.
    Cloud-based communication protocols often improve connectivity rates to ensure
    stability, durability, and productivity through better information access. The
    most commonly used application layer protocols are Websocket, Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Representational
    State Transfer (RESTful Services) and Data Distribution Services (DDS). These
    protocols can be employed in different IoT applications for sustainable operations
    to provide a strategic mapping between the application layer with other layers.
    Below we mention different communication protocols to link a connection between
    IoT devices and the cloud. • Advanced message queuing protocol (AMQP): It is an
    application layer protocol that facilitates client–server communications between
    cloud and IoT nodes. This open-access based protocol contains more message overheads
    and is not accepted widely [45]. • Message queue telemetry transport (MQTT): MQTT
    is a lightweight communication protocol based on publish–subscribe-based architecture
    [46], which allows the client device to subscribe to the broker for receiving
    data from the server (publisher) through the topic. In the existing literature,
    MQTT ensured the reliable reception of messages offering different quality of
    services (QoS) [47], [48], [49]. • Constrained application protocol (CoAP): It
    is a web communication protocol with constrained nodes and a restricted network.
    It also facilitates a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) for smooth network integration.
    It mostly provides communication among machine-to-machine networks and uses the
    HTTP and publish–subscribe architecture with various commands. In comparison to
    the MQTT, the centralized device in CoAP uses a universal resource identifier
    (URI) [50]. In comparison to available protocols, MQTT offers better QoS, throughput,
    data protection, low latency [51], low packet loss [52], low power consumption
    and restricted bandwidth usage [53], [54]. The widely available cloud service
    providers are xively, grove stream, carriots, things worx, things speak, plotty,
    amazon web services (AWS), microsoft azure and many more. 3.2. Processing layer
    In this subsection, we discuss the different computing platforms that is responsible
    for making the decision based on the data sensed from the sensor and communicated
    to the central server for analysis, computation, and storage. The power consumption
    of the processing layer services is very high, and the cost requirement is moderate
    and varies from different service providers such as Xively, Grove Stream, Carriots,
    Plotty, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services, and many more. Based on the intense
    survey, it is noticed that there is no criteria for selecting these data processing
    services for particular IoT applications based on the IoT device requirement.
    The processing layer mainly incorporated the hierarchical computing platforms
    for the data operation, as discussed below: • Cloud computing: In a wide variety
    of IoT applications, storing, processing, and analyzing unstructured data in a
    well-manageable form is a significant challenge. Cloud services are the most common
    platform for monitoring, analyzing, and storing huge IoT data. However, as the
    number of IoT devices increases, processing a huge amount of data on a single-layer
    platform leads to network congestion and an increase in the loss of data packets.
    So processing data on a single layer for a longer interval is not feasible due
    to the high latency and limited bandwidth per user. As a result, Cloud-computing
    is considered as a non-optimal approach for distributed processing of IoT data
    generated by different sensors and other devices at lower layers. So, fog and
    edge computing came into existence to address this challenge and maintain highly
    responsive IoT applications with low latency [55]. • Fog computing: To overcome
    the challenges in cloud computing, it is suggested to distribute data processing
    across the middle region of the processing layer rather than directly sending
    data to the cloud service (final region of processing layer). This process, known
    as Fog computing, involves handling data as close to the connectivity layer. It
    will reduce the latency and network congestion to a larger extent [56]. Fog computing
    is considered to be the best as it may link to the nearby edge device for analyzing
    and transformation that are later supported by the cloud services for storage
    and processing. • Edge computing: Although the concept of Fog computing solves
    all the limitations of Cloud computing, the concept of Edge computing came into
    origination to further minimize the latency. The main aim of Edge computing is
    to bring a IoT device closer to the data processing, computation and accumulation
    layer rather than relying on the cloud server. So that it can preprocess data
    and only forward the metadata by reducing the bandwidth requirement per device.
    Fog and edge computing can be employed in various IoT applications, such as smart
    traffic systems to enable the warning system by generating real-time warnings
    using the edge service [57]. The smart metering system also uses fog, edge, and
    cloud services to analyze the energy consumption of different households, industries,
    hospitals, schools and many more. Such analysis generates more data and uses a
    larger bandwidth. To address this, a hierarchical fog service is proposed [44],
    [58] as a solution by interconnecting them with a different edge service employed
    on each meter to reduce latency. On the other hand latency-tolerant data may be
    sent directly to the cloud services platforms for processing and storage. Apart
    from this, it is also used in various other IoT applications, such as smart hospitals,
    smart homes, smart industries, smart cities, and many more [59], [60], [61] to
    process data with low latency and high responsiveness. 3.3. Connectivity layer
    In this subsection, we discuss the various types of wireless communication protocols
    for enables communication from the device-to-device and the device-to-access point.
    Additionally, the characteristics of a protocol in terms of its bandwidth, data
    rate, lifespan, and cost are provided. 3.3.1. Device to device/device to access
    point wireless protocol Communication via IoT devices involves data transfer from
    D2D and the device to the access point gateway. The IoT ecosystem incorporates
    billions of smart devices, but they have significant limitations e.g. processing
    speed, power, lifetime, and range. Since IoT devices mainly operate at low power,
    commercially available communication devices for device-device communication are
    Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), WiMAX, cellular, Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1), Z-Wave, Zigbee,
    6LowPAN (IEEE 802.15.4), BLE 5.0 (IEEE 802.15.6), SigFox, LoRa, RFID, Near field
    communication (NFC), etc. Classification of these devices based on coverage area
    is shown in Fig. 4. A comparative study on the above-discussed communication protocols
    is presented in Table 2. In 2016, a new standard for energy harvesting was launched
    as ZigBee green power (GP) for wireless sensor networks [84]. The ZigBee GP specifications
    and the IEEE 802.15.4 networking protocol are used in energy-harvesting ZigBee-based
    communication protocol applications that operate on a low-power microcontroller
    framework [85]. IEEE 802.11ah is another framework that achieves a lower data
    rate but has a greater coverage area than traditional Wi-Fi operating above 1
    GHz. In this frequency range, absorption by buildings and other objects increases
    significantly. Hence, 802.11ah is an ideal candidate to be used for IoT networks.
    The analytical expression of throughput for IEEE 802.11ah has been obtained in
    [86]. Download : Download high-res image (180KB) Download : Download full-size

    deals with a temporary and permanent memory device to store data. It also involves
    the collection and processing of data on virtual storage systems, such as cloud,
    fog, and edge, and how the data can be structured. The microcontroller board (temporary
    storage interface) can have two types of memory, i.e., volatile (RAM) and non-volatile
    (e.g., flash, EEPROM) memories. Volatile memory requires continuous power, while
    non-volatile memory requires power on demand. 3.5. Physical layer In this subsection,
    we discuss several types of sensing and actuating devices that are utilized in
    various IoT-based smart applications. The power utilization and the associated
    cost to fabricate each sensor are described in Table 3. The cost of sensors has
    been taken from amazon.com. The search keyword was “IoT sensors” and visited on
    5th January, . Sensors with the capability of harvesting energy can be reused.
    Thus the overall power consumed by the sensing system reduces significantly and,
    in effect, extends the operation time of an IoT device as discussed in [15], [87],
    [88], [89], [90], [91], [92]. In this Section, we examine different types of sensors
    and actuators and list out possible areas of application in connection to IoT
    system design. Table 3. Comparison of sensors employed in sustainable IoT designs.

    a device that senses or measures physical changes in the surrounding environment,
    such as thermistors, light-dependent resistors, magnetic field-based sensors.
    A response is created whenever there is any change in the physical or chemical
    state of objects in the vicinity of the sensor. This response is measured and
    analyzed by the sensors [93]. We specifically discuss a few sensors used for a
    particular IoT application. We also list out the associated parameters required
    to achieve specific design objectives. Velocity This type of sensor measures consecutive
    positions at known intervals and computes the rate at which the movable object
    position varies at different times. Based on the working principle, velocity sensors
    can be of two types, e.g., linear and angular. A linear sensor measures the rectilinear
    motion, and an angular sensor measures the spin rate of an entity. Examples of
    velocity sensors include doppler-effect sensors, accelerometers [11], and gyroscopes.
    Such sensors mainly find applications in smart vehicles, traffic monitoring systems,
    smart cities [93]. Proximity The proximity sensor detects the location of a neighboring
    object without making any physical contact [94]. It emits infrared waves and senses
    the presence of any object by measuring the difference of signal indicating return
    status [95]. Its use can be inductive, capacitive, ultrasonic, photoelectric,
    and magnetic [96]. Moreover, it is employed in several places to count the number
    of cars and objects in applications like smart parking and smart homes. Position
    The position sensor uses a motion detection mechanism to determine whether humans
    or other objects are within a specific region. Examples of position sensors are
    rotary encoders and hall effect sensors. This type of sensor is used in typical
    hospital surveillance systems that track patients, nurses, and doctors [97]. In
    [98], Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is also utilized to monitor the real-time location
    of people working in an underground mine. Temperature Temperature sensor calculates
    the heat intensity of a person to assess ambient conditions using non-contact-based
    or contact-based mechanisms. The contact-based sensor works when it is in physical
    touch with the object. However, the non-contact-based sensor measures the temperature
    using the convection and radiation method [99]. Typical examples of temperature
    sensors include thermocouples and thermistors. Such sensors are used in smart
    irrigation, smart healthcare, and environment monitoring [100]. Chemical Chemical
    sensors measure the chemical composition of the overall environment. It operates
    by detecting chemical reactions or a set of chemicals. Some examples of chemical
    sensors are breath analyzers, olfactometers, and smoke detectors. These sensors
    are typically employed in different IoT applications like smart cities, smart
    buildings, smart irrigation, air quality monitoring [101], etc. Force The Force
    sensor detects the amount of stress and converts it into an output signal. Examples
    of such a sensor include the strain gauge and pressure switch. These sensors are
    applied to numerous IoT applications, e.g., smart buildings, intelligent construction,
    medical monitoring [102], etc. Light The light sensor is a passive device that
    receives energy from light and transforms this energy into an electrical signal
    [103]. Hence an external power source is not needed in this case. Infrared sensors,
    photodetectors, and flame detectors are some of their examples. Biomolecular Biomolecular
    sensor translates metabolic reactions into electrical signals. These sensors monitor
    several biological factors, e.g., tissue, antigen, antibodies, hemoglobin level,
    glucose, and nucleic acid. Examples of such sensors are pulse oximeters, electrocardiographs,
    and various others that measure the physical and chemical changes in the human
    body. Humidity The humidity sensor first picks up the amount of water vapor in
    the air and then converts it into an equivalent electrical signal. The humidity
    level can be calculated in different ways, e.g., absolute, relative, and mass
    ratio. Hygrometer, soil moisture indicator, temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11),
    and so on are some of its examples. 3.5.2. Actuation interface An actuator is
    an element of a device that drives the system by converting the available energy
    into physical movement. An actuator needs a control signal and an energy source
    to operate. For IoT applications, actuators are mainly two types, i.e., continuous
    and binary actuators. A relay is an example of a binary actuation interface with
    two stable states, either latched (ON) or unlatched (OFF). Binary actuators consume
    full power or no power in the ON and OFF state, respectively. A motor is an example
    of a continuous actuator, as it can rotate through an angle of 360°. The speed
    and direction of a motor are governed by a microcontroller with pulse width modulation
    (PWM) signal pins. Next, we discuss the operation of some commonly used actuators.
    Servo motor A servo motor includes a direct current (DC) motor with two wires,
    a gear line, a potentiometer, an integrated microcontroller IC and a shaft (output
    spine). The shaft is mounted at a particular angular position by sending a control
    signal to the servo via a microcontroller. However, it can rotate up to 180° only.
    The servo motor consumes power only in position control mode. Servo motor is used
    in different IoT devices such as dual-axis solar panels (self-sustainable IoT),
    smart positioning, e.g., in an elevator (smart infrastructure), movement of a
    smart robot, computer numerical control (CNC) machine, and automatic production
    in smart industries. Relay The relay is a programmable electrical switch to energize
    (ON) or de-energize (OFF) devices that consume high voltage, current, or both.
    Hence it is an intermediate device that connects high-voltage devices and microcontrollers.
    It comes with two sets of pins. One set is used for a microcontroller or low-voltage
    device, and the other is used for a high-voltage device. Relays are part of most
    IoT applications to control the devices based on the controlling signals from
    interfaced microcontrollers. One of the examples is smart irrigation to energize
    and de-energize the water pump based on the controlling signals. Stepper motor
    The DC voltage drives a stepper motor, and it rotates in discrete steps. Such
    a motor consists of several coils organized in a group known as ‘phase’. Only
    a single series phase is energized at a time, and the motor rotates one step.
    Its rotating position, speed, acceleration, and deceleration can be precisely
    controlled. Like the servo motor, the stepper motor is not limited in rotation.
    It requires additional hardware and power supply to complete a single rotation.
    A stepper motor consumes power to lock in and remain in position command. Its
    application domain is limited to automation, robotics, 3-D printer, and X-Y plotter.
    Hydraulic actuator A hydraulic actuator consists of a fluid engine that utilizes
    hydraulic power to enable mechanical operation. The mechanical movement is then
    transformed into linear, rotating, or oscillatory motion. Its application domain
    is restricted to single-axis movement of any heavy load, braking system, heavy
    load lifting/balancing system, and radial engines DC motor DC motor is the most
    commonly used actuator in electronics projects. It is available in different sizes
    to handle various activities. It consists of permanent magnets and loops of wire.
    When the device is switched ON, the loops induce a magnetic field, which interacts
    against the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. Pneumatic actuator The pneumatic
    actuator transforms the energy shaped by vacuum or compressed air in linear or
    rotational movement at high pressure. It converts pressure into force. Pneumatic
    actuators can generate a large amount of force from relatively minor variations
    in pressure. 3.5.3. Processing interface In processing and controlling interface,
    we list out different types of microcontrollers boards. The widely used microcontrollers
    in this layer are Arduino UNO [104], Raspberry Pi [105], and NodeMCU ESP8266 [106].
    The microcontrollers along with their processing speed, operating voltage, characteristics
    and the cost are tabulated in Table 4. Depending on the energy consumed by a sensor
    node, the following operational states have been defined, namely, active state
    (AS), sleep state (SS), ultra low power active state (ULPAS), low power active
    state (LPAS) and low power state (LPS). The most commonly used processor is MSP432.
    There are typically four low power modes (LPM) in MSP432 processor. LPM 3, LPM
    4 refer to deep sleep states, while LPM 3.5 and LPM 4.5 refer to stop or shut
    down state. The operational, ADC states of a MSP432 processor along with the current
    rating and cost are depicted in Table 5. Table 4. Comparison among different microcontroller

    4. EH techniques: Different components required for self-sustainable IoT devices
    In this Section, commonly used sources of energy harvesting are discussed. Subsequently,
    EH transducers, standards and energy trackers are outlined. Next, we list the
    amount of power generated through harvesting, the cost of those harvesters, and
    the applications that utilize the effective harvested power. Frequent battery
    replacement in devices is a time-consuming and costly process, as it requires
    human intervention. Further, access to IoT devices is limited in remote locations.
    Additionally, many IoT devices are deployed in several IoT applications, making
    it difficult to run on battery throughout their life. To tackle these issues,
    harvesting energy is seen as a critical enabler technology that reduces dependence
    on batteries [35]. A battery life may be extended indefinitely subject to the
    fact that the converted electrical energy is more than the minimum energy requirement
    [107]. EH modules integrated with WSNs are referred to as energy-harvesting wireless
    sensor networks. These integrated modules collect energy by utilizing external
    sources, i.e., RF, solar, wind, vibration, and thermal. Since the harvested energy
    is stochastic and unstable, the transmission parameters of the WSN need dynamic
    adjustment to maintain a sustainable operation. The design methodology of energy-efficient
    IoT devices is explored in [108]. For energy harvesting, it is necessary to have
    a clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT devices.
    The framework involves the generation process (source, transducer, and converter),
    storage mechanism, and managing the supply of harvested energy. The proposed mapping
    of EH-IoT and design framework are shown in Fig. 5. It will help the researchers
    and practitioners to build a system for a specific use case. Next, we discuss
    the different interfaces of Fig. 5 one by one. Download : Download high-res image

    interfaces, BW refers to bandwidth. 4.1. EH sources WSN is the fundamental building
    block of IoT. Moreover, considering the duty cycle, the battery life of WSN is
    lessened to just a few days as nodes remain active most of the time. Hence, battery
    life plays a significant role in overall energy consumption. Energy harvesting
    sources can be categorized into external and ambient. Further categorization and
    examples of these sources are shown in Fig. 6. The ambient sources are accessible
    within the surrounding region of energy harvesting objects. These sources can
    either be static or dynamic in nature [21]. A static source provides a predictable
    energy level, while a dynamic source generates energy randomly or periodically.
    The external sources emit energy to the nearby surroundings, such that the devices
    can harvest from this emission. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download

    Light The photovoltaic (PV) effect is the standard method of extracting electrical
    energy from light sources. Based on the composition, PV cells are of the following
    type [91]: • Mono-crystalline: It offers 15%–24% efficiency, however, it is quite
    costly. • Poly-crystalline: This cell offers 14%–20.4% efficiency, and it is less
    costly as compared to the mono-crystalline one. • Thin-film: It is the cheapest
    cell and can absorb low-intensity light. However, it is less efficient 8%–13.2%.
    PV cells are commonly known as solar cells. Light energy can be harvested in the
    following IoT applications: environment monitoring, smart homes, and commercial
    buildings. There has been considerable research effort to power IoT networks using
    light energy in remote locations. The author in [109] employed an eco-sensing
    method that offers a wide range of light energy harvesting technology. It also
    shows that nodes in an IoT network react more to light energy than other sources,
    thus making the system highly efficient. To power a beacon node, the design methodology
    of a light-harvesting device is introduced in [110]. Similarly, in [111], a light-harvesting
    circuit has been proposed to provide sufficient power to the Bluetooth low-energy
    node. Although the aforementioned IoT network has good scope in terms of application,
    it cannot support an achievable information rate with high efficiency. In [112],
    a power controller is developed for a current-deprived voltage control oscillator
    (VCO). This controller generates a power of W, for a solar irradiance of lx. Light
    energy is stochastic and intermittent, which is very difficult to predict. So
    maintaining a continuous power flow using light energy requires adopting specific
    mechanisms or principles. The feedback principle is commonly employed in [112]
    to ensure a continuous power flow. For example, in [113], the authors achieved
    a continuous power flow with controlled voltage or current. An analytical connectivity
    model, a zero-energy IoT system, is proposed in [114], where the networking elements
    are solar-powered. Typically, at 25 °C ambient temperature, the solar panel can
    harvest about power. A solar panel has 15% conversion efficiency and converts
    the harvested power into 15 mW/cm2 power [115]. Only 70% of the harvested power
    is consumed at the PWM circuit’s output. The remaining harvested power leaks into
    the atmosphere. A cluster-based algorithm is proposed in [107], which enhances
    the utilization of harvested energy. Moreover, the different light intensity in
    indoor and outside environments results in different amount of harvested energy.
    The efficiency of harvested light in the indoor environment is of the one produced
    in the outdoor environment. Several authors have presented analytical and experimental
    models considering light harvesting for indoor and outdoor environments. A novel
    framework that generates power using PV cells is presented for the indoor environment
    in [116]. For indoor settings, [117] reported W power using an artificial source
    of light energy at different intensities. An EH framework for smart building using
    PV is developed in [24] that generates V output voltage with mA pulse current
    in an indoor environment. Apart from this, the authors in [118] proposed an energy
    estimation algorithm to analyze the random behavior of light intensity in the
    indoor environment. It generates a high-efficient end node harvesting device that
    produces 0.8% error while predicting energy availability in one day. Authors in
    [119] compared wireless power transfer (WPT) and solar energy sources. Interestingly,
    the authors proposed a hybrid source that combines the merits of the aforementioned
    sources. 4.1.2. Thermal Unlike solar energy, thermal energy is available indoors
    and outdoors. Thermal energy can be collected by an electrical and mechanical
    source and converted into consumable electrical energy. The heat from various
    sources, including sunlight, engine exhaustion, indoor temperature, temperature
    difference, and even body heat, can be counted as a source. The generation method
    is cost-effective and efficient as it generates electricity from the abovementioned
    sources. However, the energy produced using thermal sources needs better energy
    conversion efficiency [90]. It can be made possible using different harvesters,
    such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), biochip, nanomaterial, and cloth-printed
    harvesters, which are commercially available. Thermoelectric (TE) and pyroelectric
    (PE) methods are the most widely used thermal harvesters. For a thermoelectric
    generator, an -type junction is used. This junction is connected to the heating
    material. Aluminum oxide and silicon wafers [120] are the most widely used heating
    materials because of their high conductivity and low coefficient of thermal expansion.
    The transmission of carriers across the junction produces the necessary potential
    difference and is sent to the voltage controller and converter. The voltage thus
    obtained can be increased using a large number of junctions between heating materials.
    Finally, the increased DC voltage can be transmitted wirelessly to one or more
    IoT sensors. On the other hand, the pyroelectric solution uses a special crystal
    material that generates considerable energy under temperature fluctuation in the
    environment. The design of the thermal transducer is not simply restricted to
    the approaches of TE and PE. However, as with many other thermal harvesters, other
    proposed transducers are described in Table 6. Table 6. Comparison of different
    thermal transducers. Harvesting technology Characteristics Average power/efficiency

    the increasing energy demand of IoT networks, energy harvesting through RF signals
    (RF-EH) evolved as an alternative technique that offers reduced operational cost
    and attains a sustainable framework. Instead of using conventional energy sources
    (power grid), RF signals are employed to recharge the batteries of IoT devices.
    Typically, ambient EM sources like cellular, microwave, and infrared (IR) radiation
    harvest the RF energy using high-gain antennas. The harvested energy is processed,
    rectified, and stored for future use. Rectenna, voltage multiplier, and storage-control
    interfaces are the building blocks of an RF-EH module. The rectenna block consists
    of a dipole or a patch antenna, along with a rectifier (Schottky diodes) that
    performs AC-DC conversion. A reconfigurable rectifier integrated with double-stage
    controlled maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is proposed in [127] to have a
    highly efficient energy harvesting node at dB. The peak power conversion efficiency
    can be written as (1) where is the DC power at output of rectifier and is the
    harvested rectifier’s power at the input. An optimal dual-stage RF-EH circuit
    is fabricated in [128]. The work in [129] discusses an ambient ultrahigh-frequency
    (UHF) enabled energy harvesting technique. The energy density of RF-EH is very
    low in comparison to other sources, as investigated in [128], [129]. Hence a voltage
    multiplier is utilized for further enhancing the voltage level [130]. The storage
    and control interface is responsible for the persistent power flow to the endpoint
    devices [131]. Several RF harvesters are classified according to their efficiencies
    and are studied in [132]. In [133], the authors reported energy harvesting strategies
    using single and multiple sources. There has been considerable research on low
    power transfer to IoT end users in the past few years, specifically where replenishment
    of batteries is difficult [134]. With a focus on WPT, some recent literature enhanced
    performance and optimized design parameters to increase the energy efficiency
    of the harvested node [135], [136]. However, the WPT mechanism requires a fixed
    charging point, and there is a limit on power density as well. Recently, the utilization
    of RF signals to deliver energy and convey information signals has received considerable
    research attention. This technique is referred to as simultaneous wireless power
    and information transfer (SWIPT). The authors in [137], [138], [139] discussed
    resource allocation and performance analysis of different SWIPT-aided systems.
    Moreover, the authors in [140] discussed the time division strategy for power
    and information transfer (see Table 7). Table 7. Comparison of different RF transducers.

    networks, IoT has incorporated several sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, communication
    devices, and so on. These devices mostly remain operational, resulting in limited
    battery life for a few days. Therefore, batteries play a significant part in ensuring
    sustainability in smart applications. However, most of the harvested energy is
    wasted due to the losses in the circuits or not managing it properly. As a result,
    not all the harvested energy is stored in the batteries. It can be prevented by
    keeping track of the energy from the harvesting stage to the storage stage. In
    this context, authors in [145] employed various methods to disseminate the significance
    of energy trackers in energy harvesting systems. Some researchers focused on detecting
    the sun’s motion to improve the efficiency of harvested energy. In contrast, the
    authors of [146] presented an animal tracking-based thermal harvesting system
    based on the temperature differential between the animal’s body and the immediate
    surroundings. This survey paper focused on tracking the harvesting energy after
    the transducers stage so that the energy flow to the storage interface is efficiently
    managed. Some of the existing available energy trackers are depicted in Table
    8. 4.2.1. Solar charger controller The overall output voltage of the solar panel
    is typically quite low. As a result, researchers have proposed different charge
    control mechanisms to achieve an efficient harvesting framework, such as Pulse
    width modulation (PWM) and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) [152]. PWM controller
    can handle the flow of current from the solar panel with reduced efficiency due
    to the discontinuity in the harvested energy. It is frequently used for low-powered
    devices [153]. As a result, it can contribute to the sustainability of IoT devices
    with lower efficiency. On the other hand, MPPT has been identified as a charge
    controller circuit that optimally manages the harvested energy from solar panels
    to storage interfaces efficiently. It tracks voltage and maximum power using the
    most commonly used perturbation and observation (P&O) algorithm. In [154], the
    harvested energy is provided to a boost converter (DC-DC) using MPPT to improve
    the conversion efficiency. The authors obtained an analytical model for a harvester
    in [155] using MPPT and achieved 96% efficiency. A novel wearable fitness monitoring
    device powered by solar cells is developed in [156]. The harvesting efficiency
    of the system ( ) is computed as (2) where , are the efficiency of the conversion
    interface and MPPT respectively. Table 8. Comparison of different energy tracker

    received from ambient sources needs a better power density to make the IoT device
    sustainable. As a result, power converters or amplifier circuits are required
    to drive the low-powered DC load. It can be made feasible by incorporating the
    rectifiers with capacitors and diodes to form the multi-stage voltage multipliers
    circuits. So that voltage gain can be increased at the output of the RF energy
    harvester. In [157], authors designed multi-stage circuits such as Dickson and
    Cockcroft–Walton voltage multipliers to obtain high-voltage at the output. These
    circuits mainly act as energy trackers or DC-DC converters to enhance the harvested
    voltage at the output. In this way, RF energy is properly managed from the transmitter
    end to the storage interface. 4.3. Storage interface This is a part of the power
    management system. After energy is harvested, it needs to be utilized at the end
    node application with the help of storage interface device. A number of storage
    interfaces are available, however, we list out only the most commonly used ones
    as follows. 4.3.1. Rechargeable batteries This type of battery contains a large
    number of capacitors and has high energy density. However, it is hardly used for
    storage as it has a low depth-of-discharge (DoD) rating. Moreover, there are numerous
    ways to select a battery for a self-sustainable IoT network, such as battery life
    expectancy, the necessity for rapid charging cycles, size, and weight, which are
    the most crucial factors influencing the decision [158]. Although rechargeable
    batteries/secondary batteries have less capacity and temperature stability than
    primary batteries, they do not require periodic maintenance and replacement at
    complete discharge. The most popular battery for EH-IoT is lithium-ion. Depending
    on the operating cycle, the total efficiency of battery storage ranges from 60%
    to 80%. These batteries do not operate well in low temperatures due to increased
    internal resistance, resulting in a self-discharge [159]. However, there are Alkaline
    MnO batteries available with a low self-discharge rate [160]. These batteries
    are used in the IoT applications, such as IoT monitoring applications that require
    data monitoring even for smaller intervals of time with high precision (smart
    healthcare, smart home, and smart industries) at a higher cost. Apart from this,
    Lead-Acid batteries are used in IoT applications that require data monitoring
    with larger sampling intervals and are mainly used in environmental monitoring
    applications. These batteries are inexpensive, highly reliable, and efficient,
    with limited cycle capacity and poor performance under adverse circumstances [161].
    4.3.2. Super-capacitors These are high-energy-density batteries with high DoD
    ratings. Supercapacitor discharges on its own, hence it cannot store energy for
    a longer duration [162]. Several studies revealed that the self-discharging nature
    of the supercapacitors is due to leakage and fast charging and can be compensated
    by charging it over a longer period of time [163]. The severity of the self-discharging
    problem is not only determined by the device capacity but also differs among manufacturers
    and even among specific production batches. This results from variations in the
    materials used, the manufacturing process, and production irregularities. As a
    result, selecting a reliable supercapacitor for appropriate IoT applications is
    still a significant issue [164]. It is mostly employed in applications requiring
    a power source with a shorter charging time and a wider operational temperature
    range and lacks involvement of toxic heavy metals, such as smart healthcare, smart
    irrigation, and smart agriculture. 4.3.3. Recent advancement in energy storage
    batteries The development of hybrid storage devices and novel materials enables
    a breakthrough in advancing energy storage interfaces. In [165], a hybrid storage
    system that increases operational duration is developed by integrating rechargeable
    batteries with supercapacitors. A unique ionic liquid combination is employed
    as an electrolyte for supercapacitor applications to enable IoT applications that
    demand a large working temperature range (60 to 80 ) and a low charging/discharging
    rate [166]. In addition, several IoT applications (smart factories, smart automobiles,
    etc.) need a high voltage than a large working temperature and life span. So,
    asymmetric capacitors were developed by fusing several conducting polymers (ECPs),
    amorphous manganese dioxide (a-MnO ), and activated carbon. These capacitors offer
    two times the power of conventional supercapacitors [167]. Additionally, the storage
    capacity of supercapacitors and sodium-ion batteries is increased by using graphene-based
    materials [168]. Furthermore, the energy density and safety of rechargeable batteries
    are improved by using Lithium-ion batteries with solid-state electrolytes at a
    higher cost. However, some IoT applications require high capacity, high voltage,
    and low cost. To achieve this, authors in [169] develop carbon monoxide-free layered
    cathode material. Apart from this, different types of inorganic materials such
    as lithium-polymer [170], lithium nitride [171], perovskite [172], and sulfide
    [173] have used in solid-state batteries to extend the lifetime of the storage
    interface. 5. The energy saving and resource constrained optimizers for sustainable
    IoT operations Trillions of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and communication
    interfaces will be deployed in the atmosphere during the emerging IoT era. Such
    interfaces will be using power from energy harvesting sources via storage interfaces
    and energy trackers. So, once the energy is harvested and stored efficiently with
    the help of energy trackers, it needs to be used properly at IoT device to keep
    it sustainable for ubiquitous operations. The energy stored for sustainable IoT
    devices can be utilized effectively by energy-saving or resource-optimizer protocols.
    Energy saving and resource optimization in EH-IoT is a primary concern because
    it incorporates a large number of resource-constrained devices that come with
    diverse QoS requirements. Moreover, different researchers have designed different
    decision-making topologies, algorithms, standards, and conceptual designs for
    the optimal use of harvested and stored energy [174]. Here, we will discuss the
    current research trends and challenges associated with decision-making tasks in
    this process flow. 5.1. Optimizing device power Devices play a crucial role in
    managing the power of IoT networks. Depending on the flow of data, a typical node
    in an IoT network is of two types i.e., the source and the sink. IoT combines
    different sources and sinks that can communicate without human intervention [175].
    For example, when the source and sink devices are connected via an RF chain, the
    transmit power of the RF network should be minimized [176], [177], [178]. In addition,
    if the connectivity between the source and sink fails, the data packets are lost.
    Retransmission of the same packet consumes a considerable amount of power. Cognitive
    radio (CR) can overcome these challenges [113], [177]. This technology monitors
    the wireless spectrum and identifies the holes (unoccupied channels). Design and
    optimization of a CR-assisted framework that ensures spectrum efficiency can be
    found in [113], [178]. Joint optimization of computational tasks and the energy
    transfer parameters employed with the design objective of increasing the network
    lifetime is discussed in [179]. To adjust the device’s duty cycle and dynamic
    transmission power, an opportunistic routing policy is proposed in [180]. 5.2.
    Data optimization Research articles show that SANET, along with optimized data
    processors, would drive the next-generation technology in the renewable energy
    sector to make the existing technologies sustainable [181]. Data optimization
    is the most crucial aspect of the energy-saving process since the consolidated
    data requires a smaller setup for management. To optimize data rate and data collection
    in cognitive radio and D2D communication, different modulation and coding schemes
    are studied in [182], [183], [184]. This ensures energy-efficient communication
    from the data aggregator to other nodes. Instead of transmitting the original
    data, only the compressed data is communicated. Hadoop is another data-management
    framework that allows decentralized storage and processing of data at the bit
    level. This framework consists of clusters of systems utilizing simpler algorithms.
    Moreover, several authors have explored the compressive sensing method to analyze
    performance metrics, e.g., EE, security, reliability, etc. [185], [186]. These
    works explain how the data at the receiving end is extracted from the compressed
    data. Clustering is another method to efficiently transmit consolidated data to
    the central server [187]. There are many research studies where authors have discussed
    the clustering method for various sensors [188]. In [189], the authors have shown
    how to capture remote data using a battery-driven wireless IoT. IoT systems clock
    and log data are coordinated using network time protocol (NTP) and data logger,
    respectively. The authors in [189] has provided a statistical model to predict
    the battery’s charging and discharging rate and analyze energy consumption at
    IoT nodes. The average current is obtained as follows (3) where , denote the instantaneous
    current and the number of data samples received through the entire time slot.
    Battery life, , can be subsequently calculated as (4) where denotes the battery
    capacity. 5.3. Time constrained power optimization In order to optimize power,
    time constraints play a vital role in the synchronization process, sleep mode,
    standby, and idle state of the sensing node. While the sensor is not in use, turning
    it off is better to save power. To manage energy, different time limits are set
    for different methods, namely, sleep timing, traffic monitoring [190], and appropriate
    duty cycle. In [191], [192], devices are put in sleep mode after completing their
    tasks, as sleep mode consumes negligible power. MAC duty cycling is another strategy
    that puts the device into idle mode until the next process cycle begins. This
    method is also energy efficient [193], [194]. 5.4. Trade-off among bandwidth,
    range and power consumption A typical IoT network must consider trade-offs on
    energy usage, bandwidth, and coverage area. The design objectives are to maximize
    the coverage area, minimize transmit power and improve the bandwidth [195]. A
    long-range (1.8 km), multi-hop, and self-powered IoT framework is proposed in
    [196] to be applied in agriculture. The network delivers an average power consumption
    of W at a -min interval for a sensor node [197]. In another work, Bluetooth is
    used to achieve long-range support, and the framework is built on BQ25570 IC.
    It has the following applications, e.g. battery charging and voltage conditioning
    [198]. 5.5. Standardization for EH-IoT This standardization is crucial for achieving
    interoperability and compatibility among self-sustainable IoT devices. It will
    help in optimizing the IoT resources by ensuring that they all follow the same
    set of rules and protocols by eradicating external peripheral interfaces. So,
    to incorporate all the EH-IoT under one platform, the International electrotechnical
    commission (IEC) has laid out standards for testing and evaluating different types
    of transducer and wireless protocols for green energy solutions. Some are discussed
    below for energy harvesting transducers and self-sustainable IoT communication
    protocols. 5.5.1. EH transducer Leading standardization development organizations
    (SDOs) have made the efforts to standardize EH transducers [199]. These standards
    are discussed in Table 9. Table 9. EH-IoT transducers standardization. Transducer

    infrastructure, home appliances Hybrid (mechanical, kinetic) Piezoelectric IEC

    5.5.2. Wireless protocol The international organization for standardization (ISO)
    introduced standards for wireless networking protocols to improve interoperability.
    Interoperable wireless protocols for low-power devices are studied in [200], [201].
    Table 10 mentions some of the standards released by ISO and IEC. These EH-IoT
    devices conform to short-packet systems using amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency
    modulation (FM) for IoT operations as shown in Table 10. Table 10. Wireless EH-IoT

    Upon identifying the various sections (Section 1 to Section 5), it becomes apparent
    that different energy harvesting sources can power the IoT devices for various
    IoT applications as shown in Table 11. The introduction section has offered a
    brief discussion on IoT applications for readers with the scope of establishing
    the relation among IoT applications, devices and energy harvesting interfaces.
    In this section, we investigate the comprehensive discussion of the IoT applications
    based on the devices of different IoT layers and energy harvesting interfaces
    that can be utilized. • Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture plays a significant
    role in enhancing crop cultivation by incorporating different sensing and actuation
    interfaces, including temperature, humidity, chemicals, and many more. These sensors
    detect the physical changes in the surrounding environment of the crops, soils,
    flowers, and plants. Additionally, various chemical sensors are used to determine
    the potential of hydrogen (PH) level and nutrient properties of the soils to optimize
    agriculture practices. Some researchers also employed proximity and position sensors
    to detect the animals’ movement in the fields [203]. The sensing data also requires
    actuation actions, which are usually carried out by solenoid valves, DC pumps,
    AC pumps, and relays. These actuation actions can be taken remotely with the help
    of communications protocols that can be operated up to a longer distance, i.e.,
    LoRa, Cellular, and SigFox [221], [222]. All these devices require significant
    power for their operations to run smoothly. Among all the sources, various researchers
    identified light energy as the most viable source to generate a considerable amount
    of electricity to be used in smart agriculture practices [202]. • Smart city:
    The smart city is conceptualized as a network that incorporates many sensors,
    actuators, and communication devices. The utilization of the devices in smart
    city can vary significantly based on day-to-day requirements. In some scenarios,
    the focus of smartness may be ensuring safety during natural calamities and emergencies
    such as earthquakes, floods, or fires [223]. In other situations, proper management
    of parking, lighting, waste management, the smart grid, smart sanitation, and
    many more. So smart cities incorporate almost all ranges of sensors and actuators
    [202], [203], [224], as shown in Table 11. It also employs a wide range of communication
    protocols in most scenarios to exchange real-time data up to a distance of several
    kilometers (Kms). These communication modules and actuators require power. As
    a result, they are powered by solar energy by controlling the peak of electrical
    energy consumption in the hottest and coldest months [225]. On the other hand,
    sensors used in the indoor area of smart cities are powered by RF sources [226].
    • Smart environment: Weather conditions significantly influence numerous applications,
    including agriculture, irrigation, and traffic monitoring. These applications
    mainly incorporate sensors that can measure physical and chemical changes in the
    environment. The light, temperature, humidity, biomolecules, and rain sensors
    are utilized to detect physical changes in the surroundings, such as rainfall,
    forest fires, solar irradiance, and air pollution levels. Additionally, sensors
    such as motion, gyroscopes, and accelerometers are used in the early detection
    of catastrophes in smart environments [227], [228], [229]. These sensed values
    typically trigger relays to manage external actions and DC motors using PWM signals
    to control the speed of devices like fire-avoidance robots to avoid catastrophe.
    The smart environment mainly employs communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX,
    Cellular, and LoRa to exchange information in metropolitan and wide-area networks.
    The energy from light and thermal sources provides adequate power to the sensors
    and communication devices employed in smart environments [206], [208]. Additionally,
    RF sources are usually used to power the sensors in highly populated locations
    using radio frequency generators for the device’s ubiquitous operations in a smart
    environment to prevent disaster [207]. • Smart heath care: Smart health care,
    or the Internet of medical things, is the systematic implementation mode that
    links healthcare services to the IoT via various sensors, actuators, and acceptable
    communication protocols. Smart health care predominantly requires sensors such
    as heartbeat, biomolecular, chemical, and gyroscopes to monitor the physical and
    chemical changes in the human body, like heartbeat, muscle movement, blood pressure,
    hemoglobin content, oxygen level, and many more. On the other hand, the wearable
    sensors may also be mounted to the human’s skin or tied to the clothes, which
    work by reading the values with RF signals. If sensor readings fall below safe
    limits or a person’s health enters a critical state, the nearby hospital authority
    is alerted using short-range communication protocols such as Bluetooth, BLE, and
    Zigbee [209], [210]. It is also notified at a longer distance using Cellular communication
    protocols [230]. Additional actuators, such as buzzers, also alert the individual
    to take precautions. This application mainly relies on short-range network communication
    protocols that operate by harvesting the energy from radio frequency [231], which
    usually has low bandwidth and does not harm the human body. • Smart Industry:
    The idea of IoT has rapidly developed in the industrial sector over recent years
    to revolutionize it with Industry 4.0. Its presence is in almost all business,
    private, and government sectors, like smart schools, hospitals, shopping complexes,
    grids, offices, and retail outlets [211]. Due to the vast amount of IoT applications
    in smart industries, there is no limit to incorporating the sensing, actuation,
    and communication modules as shown in Table 11. It involves various sensors and
    actuators that can help monitor and automate the decision-making process, leading
    to more efficient, faster, and cost-effective production. Moreover, it incorporates
    short-range (BLE 5.0, Zigbee, RFID, Z-wave WiFi, and Zigbee) and wide-range communication
    devices (LoRa, SigFox, and Cellular) to provide interoperability within and between
    the different sectors by enabling smooth operations [212]. In order to power this
    extensive set of devices, all feasible energy sources are utilized to provide
    uninterrupted power to various devices at different layers. Solar, thermal, and
    electromagnetic (EM) sources are the most commonly employed sources in the industry.
    Authors in [232], [233] designed self-powered sensors using a thermally conductive
    pyroelectric block for industrial applications. Additionally, authors in [234],
    [235] have employed EM and solar sources to power the IoT devices used in the
    industry. Finally, authors in [236] focused on providing low power to the IoT
    devices in various industrial sectors using a microstrip patch antenna to regulate
    the operations of different IoT devices using the energy emitted by the mobile
    base station and the WiFi transmitter. • Smart Security: In recent years, there
    has been a sudden exponential growth of security systems in our daily lives. These
    systems typically involve various sensors, such as an accelerometer, proximity,
    gyroscope, and infrared (IR) sensors, that can detect the presence of any unauthorized
    individual. It also employs other sensors that may detect chemical changes, such
    as harmful gas emissions, radiation levels increase, and leakages of deadly substances
    in the nearby region [237]. Based on these sensors, actuators such as a buzzer,
    pneumatic cylinders, and relays are most commonly employed to turn off the door
    and produce alarm sounds in case of a security breach. These applications necessitate
    using both short-range and long-range communications protocols for monitoring
    from remote locations and having connections among the devices with short-range
    communication devices. For seamless functionality in a smart security system,
    authors in [238] implemented a solar energy harvesting unit in a -storey building
    to detect the presence of any unauthorized individual. Apart from this, the authors
    in [239] implemented an RF energy harvesting source to establish the connection
    among the sensors using short-range communications protocols to detect the presence
    of any harmful gases in the surroundings. • Smart transport: In recent times,
    advancements in communication modules and several devices at different IoT layers
    have significantly enhanced transportation, which aims to improve driver safety,
    reduce traffic congestion, etc. These advancements incorporate motion sensors,
    gyroscopes, infrared sensors, GPS, and camera sensors to monitor the location
    and behaviors of drivers and passengers [215]. In addition, continuous monitoring
    is ensured through the use of temperature, pressure, and oxygen sensors within
    the vehicle to safeguard the driver. In order to enhance the comfortable experience
    of the driver, hydraulic actuators are utilized in various parts of the vehicles.
    Moreover, the pneumatic cylinder in vehicles using the devices may avoid injuries
    in accidents or mishaps. The increasing number of vehicles on the road poses a
    collision risk, which mandates the requirement of communication devices among
    vehicles. It incorporates all long-range communication protocols to identify the
    traffic pattern on the road within certain distances. Moreover, it also incorporates
    BLE, Bluetooth, and Zigbee to establish communication among the different devices
    inside the vehicle [216]. Power management in smart transportation is still a
    significant issue for many researchers due to continuous battery replacement and
    fuel consumption. To address this, authors in [217] integrate the piezoelectric
    device into the tires of the vehicles, through which driving-induced mechanical
    energy is converted to electric energy. Apart from this, several studies [240],
    [241], [242] also focused on incorporating power into smart vehicles using the
    highly efficient solar cell module to increase the power supply by up to 30%.
    7. Future scope Considering the self-sustainable IoT device based on the layers
    architecture design for smart applications, we have emphasized the layer-wise
    issues of implementing sustainability. It is employed in sensing, actuation, processing,
    and a transmission interface by utilizing energy sources, energy transducers,
    energy management, energy tracking, energy storage, and energy optimizers. Based
    on that, we have outlined the potential areas for further study in developing
    self-sustaining IoT systems. 7.1. Sustainable smart network With the rapid deployment
    of IoT nodes, the data generated by such nodes are also anticipated to grow manifold.
    These data operations necessitated external hardware assistance for storage, which
    will be an expense for power and outlay. This extraneous requirement will pose
    a threat to sustainable IoT operations due to the increase in power consumption.
    Moreover, traditional data collection and processing techniques might fail to
    handle, analyze and extract information at that scale for a long time with a fixed
    energy storage device. Additional energy harvesting devices and storage interfaces
    must be included in the existing EH-IoT system design to address this issue. Further,
    different IoT devices generate heterogeneous data, which is difficult to be processed
    using an existing processing interface. An intelligent IoT network works on the
    premise of learning from the pattern of past data and predicting data for future
    instances. Thus the system’s performance can be enhanced through better detection
    accuracy [243], [244]. Thus the cost of a storage interface and communication
    resources can be minimized by limiting the number of re-transmissions. However,
    machine algorithms to classify problems related to self-sustainable IoT devices
    are still in their infancy [245] to connect it to layered architecture design,
    and significant research scope exists in this area. In a large-scale self-sustainable
    IoT network, how to analyze collected data through deep learning techniques to
    obtain design insights is an emerging field. 7.2. Secure energy harvesting design
    A self-sustainable IoT device needs to collect energy from different available
    sources in close proximity for ubiquitous operations. However, this energy harvesting
    task can raise security concerns as attackers can produce unnecessary radiation
    as the malware energy in the processing system when extracting power from the
    RF source. So malware exposed to electricity generation data from unwanted radiation
    may cause significant privacy issues for users. It may sometimes damage the energy
    storage interface without proper protection. On the other hand, if an intruder
    knows the system’s harvesting pattern, it might launch different types of attacks
    at the user-end, namely, time synchronization, replay, dynamic data injections,
    brute force attack, man in middle attack or can generate unwanted signals. On
    the other hand, communication among IoT devices may also raise privacy concerns
    for users. Extensive sensitive data is stored, processed, and transmitted by sustainable
    IoT nodes powered by the energy storage interface. If this harvested energy is
    continuously used to transmit information vulnerable to replay and denial of service
    attacks, the stored energy will drain more quickly. Although technologies like
    Physical layer security (PLS) and Blockchain [246], [247] are integrated with
    SWIPT to form an IoT-based cooperative energy harvesting network, the issue of
    energy outages still needs to be addressed effectively. 7.3. Trade-off among energy
    consumption, bandwidth and coverage area Certain IoT communication modules like
    LoRa, WiFi, SigFox, and cellular devices can communicate with each other at a
    long distance. Managing power for such long-distance IoT communication devices
    is crucial in EH. However, the process of storing harvested energy for a longer
    time duration is a challenge in itself. Hence providing the required energy to
    the module to cover a wide area while maintaining low power consumption is difficult.
    A decrease in bandwidth leads to a decrease in the data rate. Efficient power
    management involving a the trade-off among energy consumption, bandwidth, and
    coverage area poses a design challenge. 7.4. Energy supply design for sporadic
    source and hazardous material During the daytime, the solar power supply works
    effectively. However, it is not the case at night. Solar supply uses PV cells
    to convert light into energy. Nonetheless, solar supply requires more space. Energy-intensive
    devices like laptops and smart electric cars consume more power to perform for
    a long duration. Nevertheless, small-scale PVs play a significant role in calculators,
    watches, and small devices. A typical example is the monitoring and identifying
    faults in the power distribution system using solar panels [248]. Furthermore,
    solar irradiance is stochastic in nature, with seasonal and temporal variations.
    As a result, depending only on solar energy harvesting for self-sustaining IoT
    system design may result in energy outages, where energy harvested by the solar
    panel will be less than the energy consumed by IoT devices. On the other hand,
    EH can be achieved using an RF field with a certain signal frequency. The potential
    safety threats must be considered in case more RF fields are used. So it is challenging
    to design efficient PV cells and maintain a safe level of exposure to RF intensities.
    7.5. Storage unit 7.5.1. Data storage While designing the system for a specific
    IoT application, the main challenge lies in cleaning, processing, and interpreting
    the massive data collected by the sensors. Storing bulky data is another challenge.
    Depending on the self-sustainable IoT application, an extensive data acquisition
    system might be needed, which calls for a storage unit with a large capacity.
    The storage data of the IoT sensor for smart weather monitoring, intelligent transportation
    system, and many other smart applications require data to be sensed at small sampling
    intervals. When data is sensed continuously for a longer period of time with smaller
    sample intervals, a more significant amount of energy and storage is required.
    Some researchers have used big data storage systems as an enabling architecture.
    However, the problem of storing and sensing data over a longer period of time
    with a small sampling interval still needs to be addressed. 7.5.2. Power storage
    Due to the rapid charge or discharge cycles, a rechargeable battery is insufficient
    for energy storage. Also, a rechargeable battery is made up of a large number
    of capacitors, which occupies space. For example, a nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery
    has got higher energy capacity but a fast discharge rate. On the other hand, lithium-ion
    and nickel metal hybrid batteries come with higher energy density and a lower
    discharge rate. However, due to their highly combustible nature, they do not provide
    a viable choice for IoT applications. Solid-state batteries come with a minimum
    rate of self-discharge and are eco-friendly. However, their use in IoT could be
    improved, as they come at a high price. Since super-capacitors have a large energy
    capacity, they may be considered as one of the alternative possibilities for EH-IoT.
    However, because of its auto-draining rate, it is not an ideal fit for EH-IoT
    applications. A low-cost battery with a high energy consumption volume and low
    discharge rate poses a design challenge. Different storage units are outlined
    in Section 4.3. 7.6. Hardware assistance Hardware design in self-sustainable IoT
    devices needs to cope with many issues. The power harvested from the surrounding
    is often intermittent. This leads to heavy fluctuation in current at IoT node.
    Hence, small-sized hardware that yields stable performance for a wide range of
    power is required at the energy harvesting stage. The harvesting stage includes
    transducers, MPPT, DC-DC converters, AC-DC converters, and supercapacitors. Arranging
    all such components with sensors, actuators, and communication devices will result
    in a highly dense circuit. How many bulky circuits can coexist with nanomaterials
    poses a relevant research question. 7.7. Network congestion in EH-IoT network
    Previously data sensed by IoT devices were used to store in the cloud. Several
    IoT devices or platforms use the same cloud platform for data storage. However,
    accessing the required data from vast aggregated data available on the cloud takes
    time and effort. In case different IoT devices wish to access data from the same
    cloud simultaneously, it will increase incoming traffic in the network. Recently
    in [249], edge computing is proposed to optimize energy efficiency for medical
    devices using their inactive mode. Edge computing networks are dense and highly
    congested. In this technique, firstly, data is transferred to a storage unit near
    IoT device. After sorting and analyzing data, the local storage unit transfers
    some of the data to the cloud. Thus reducing both latencies and network congestion
    in this process at the cost of increased power consumption due to the dense network.
    As a result, the tradeoff between dense storage network deployment and power consumption
    in a sustainable IoT system still needs to be addressed. 8. Conclusion IoT is
    an effective solution to our day-to-day problems that open up numerous new opportunities
    worldwide. This is an interesting phenomenon in networking devices, where the
    reach of device connectivity increases every year. IoT incorporates billions of
    sensors, actuators, and communication devices in various IoT applications. This
    paper addresses several IoT applications and clarifies the necessitates of IoT
    devices, in particular smart applications. It is accomplished by incorporating
    five different interfaces such as sensing interface, energy harvesting interface,
    storage interface, microcontroller interface, and wireless interface. It focuses
    on bridging the gap between IoT application and IoT system design centered on
    layered architecture design. Besides, the study of various types of sensors, actuators,
    and communication protocols, this paper also discusses the various types of energy
    harvesting techniques to make the self-sustainable IoT system design. The primary
    task of EH-IoT is to guarantee smooth functioning using an uncontrolled and unpredicted
    power supply. This paper also investigates the comparison among the different
    layers architecture design of self-sustainable IoT device. While reviewing the
    different research articles, we also examined the effect of the stochastic source
    on the memory interface. This work is concluded with the potential research problems
    that will enable researchers to build a new paradigm for self-sustainable IoT
    system design. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they

    A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a set of small devices called sensors deployed
    randomly in a specific geographic area. Each sensor can supervise a particular
    phenomenon and send data to one or more collection point (s) (gateway or base
    station) interconnected via wireless connection [29, 30, 40, 41]. Figure 1 illustrates
    the general diagram of WSNs. Each sensor detects an event, then transfers it to
    a gateway that will forward it to the administrator. Generally, a WSN has a large
    number of nodes. However, these nodes are limited in energy resources, storage
    space, and calculation capacity [25, 108]. The WSNs have initially been used in
    military applications (for example battlefield surveillance), then in various
    applications, such as medical surveillance and supervision of civil structures
    [19, 79, 139]. Nowadays, WSNs are widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications
    such as smart homes or smart cities. For this reason, reliability is a significant
    challenge [57, 81].Moreover, energy consumption (network lifetime) represents
    the most critical metric for the performance evaluation of WSNs used in IoT applications.
    Indeed, the network lifetime is considered as a fundamental parameter in the context
    of availability in these applications [31, 42, 113]. Several studies comparing
    and classifying energy conservation methods have been conducted. However, those
    dedicated to IoTs-based WSNs have not received much interest. This work aims to
    study the energy conservation methods fo IoT based on WSN applications. First,
    an efficient process of selecting research papers is accomplished. Then, three
    categories are presented to classify the different propositions (routing, clustering,
    and miscellaneous). The research papers are chosen according to four criteria:
    (1) Keywords: each paper must contain the different keywords that characterize
    our research topic (WSNs, IoT, and energy conservation). (2) The impact factor
    is the most critical factor that researchers take into account when deciding where
    to publish a paper, hence the interest choosing journals with high impact factor.
    (3) Indexing: articles are selected according to their citation in the Web of
    Science, Scopus, and SCI indexed databases. (4) The year of publication: the selected
    papers were published in the last five years (from 2015 to 2021). After classification,
    the methods are compared in terms of types, performance metrics, applications,
    used simulators, and future research directions. Statistics analysis proves that
    the most suggested routing protocol types in the literature are (1) “distributed”
    and “QoS based”, (2) the most proposed clustering algorithms are based on fuzzy
    or weighted approaches, and that (3) the security step is the most studied for
    the miscellaneous methods. In addition, MATLAB and NS2 are the most exploited
    simulation tools. Moreover, healthcare monitoring applications are the most widely
    used. Thus, this study provides a guideline for researchers (1) to know the principle
    of each approach, its advantages and disadvantages and (2) to highlight the future
    research direction that would be realized. The remainder of the paper is organized
    as follows: Section 2 presents the related works, and an overview of IoT technology
    is introduced in Section 3. Section 4 describes a classification, a comparison,
    and discussion of 60 energy conservation algorithms proposed in the literature.
    The final section outlines the conclusion and upcoming work. Fig. 1 General diagram
    of the WSNs Full size image 2 Related works Several studies have been conducted
    on energy-efficient issues in the IoT-based WSNs. Most of which focus on a specific
    topic. For instance, a general survey of existing opportunistic routing protocols,
    metrics, and their drawbacks is suggested in [56]. The compared methods are not
    all dedicated to IoT applications (only 40%). Indeed, only 20% of protocols consider
    energy consumption. Similarly, a new classification of energy-efficient routing
    mechanisms is proposed in [115]. However, the authors did not indicate that the
    compared algorithms are adequate for IoT networks. Other surveys such as [84,
    116, 143] presented a comprehensive comparison of different clustering protocols
    that optimize energy for IoT-based WSNs. Moreover, other objectives, such as mobility,
    heterogeneity, and load balancing, are defined in [116]. Another study of energy-efficient
    clustering schemes for WSN is proposed in [61]. Nevertheless, most of the presented
    approaches are inappropriate for IoT applications. Indeed, IoT security services
    are discussed, and a new taxonomy of energy-efficient mechanisms is proposed in
    [54]. MAC protocols for IoT applications that optimize energy are also discussed
    in [75], and a review of energy-efficient data aggregation techniques is presented
    and discussed in [2]. Other studies, namely [89, 132, 146] presented all topics
    (clustering, routing, data aggregation, Mac, physic) and proposed a taxonomy of
    different energy-efficient schemes. However, the different approaches use WSNs
    in diverse applications, but the IoT applications have not been considered. In
    [46], the authors outlined an overview of the current research on QoS-aware approaches
    in Fog Computing. The selected methods were discussed and classified into three
    categories: resource/service management, communication management, and application
    management. However, most of the presented approaches are inappropriate for IoT
    applications and have not considered the energy parameter. In the same vein, the
    authors in [121] provided a systematic review to evaluate the offloading mechanisms
    in Fog Computing. Most of these methods minimize energy consumption but, are not
    all dedicated to IoT networks. Other studies, such as [4, 45] focused on new studies
    of healthcare systems based on IoT and fog networks, respectively. In [45], the
    authors compared many existing methods dealing with healthcare IoT systems. The
    proposed strategies are also classified into five categories (sensor-based, resource-based,
    communication-based, application-based, and security-based) according to their
    topics. Many approaches of fog-based healthcare systems were compared and discussed
    in [4]. Most of the approaches presented in [4, 45] are not based on WSN networks
    and do not consider energy parameters. Table 1 presents a summary of these surveys.
    This paper suggests a study of energy-efficient approaches for IoT applications
    using WSNs. In addition, a new classification of methods is proposed according
    to the topic or layer in question. Three keywords are considered: energy-efficient,
    WSNs, and IoT. These have not been treated together with such a classification
    in previous studies. This survey describes, classifies, and compares 60 existing
    protocols from 2015 to 2021. Furthermore, a comparison concerning the architecture,
    different QoS parameters, used simulators, and future research directions are
    taken into account. This study provides a guideline for researchers: To know the
    60 best recent energy-efficient solutions (the new methods in this area). To find
    the best solution which reduces energy consumption according to the requirements
    of specific applications. To find the most used simulators in these fields. To
    develop and design new energy-efficient solutions. Table 1 Surveys on energy efficiency
    for WSNs and IoT Full size table 3 An overview of IoT technologies The Internet
    of Things (IoT) is a technology that allows many Things (objects) to connect and
    communicate among themselves to offer an enhanced service for operators. The connected
    objects can be smartphones, wireless sensors, or actuators [134]. The IoT model
    tends to enlarge the existing Internet network using many intelligent communicating
    machines [94]. The IoT applications are multiplying day by day (Fig. 2). Nowadays,
    everything has become a part of IoT [118]. There are various applications of IoT
    in several fields such as Smart Home (Home Automation), Health Care (Physical
    activity monitoring, Weight/cardiac monitoring), Smart Grid (Metering application),
    Smart mobility (Smart roads), Smart Logistic (Product tracking/Item location),
    Smart Agriculture (Green Houses), Smart City (Smart Parking), Smart Security (Intrusion
    detection), Smart Environment monitoring (Flood monitoring), underwater sensor
    networks and underground sensor networks [76, 118, 134]. There are many requirements
    for implementing an IoT application, such as identification, scalability, security,
    energy efficiency, interoperability, and data management. In recent studies, the
    major concern in IoT is energy efficiency and security [57, 81, 134]. The IoT
    model can be realized using various technologies, for instance, Radio Frequency
    Identification (RFID) [7, 66] Machine to Machine (M2M) communication [95], and
    WSNs [107]. RFID is a method for remotely storing and retrieving data using devices
    called “ RFID tags”. Many IoT applications, such as supply chain management and
    home automation, use RFID technology. However, many other needs to be considered
    using RFID devices. In fact, due to simultaneous tag responses, the collisions
    problem must be resolved, and a security model has to be added [15]. The M2M technology
    allows intelligent machines to communicate and interact without human intervention.
    This tool is limited in IoT applications because of the absence of security and
    multicast transmission [113]. Besides, 83% of IoT applications use WSNs technology,
    which represents the key that allows their applications. In this case, the significant
    requirements are security and energy efficiency. Two solutions are introduced
    in the literature to solve the energy problem: energy harvesting and batteries.
    Using rechargeable batteries or applying an energy harvesting procedure increases
    the application cost. The second solution is to use an ordinary battery and define
    methods to minimize energy consumption and raise network lifetime. This work compares
    numerous energy conservation methods for WSN in IoT applications. Fig. 2 IoT applications
    Full size image 4 Classification and comparison of energy efficient methods The
    present paper presents a literature review concerning energy-efficient management
    in IoT-based WSNs. Many researchers have suggested and published hundreds of methods
    aiming to improve network performances of IoT-based WSNs. Therefore, research
    articles with the best citation through the Web of Science, Scopus, and SCI indexed
    databases are selected. Hence, this review paper treats the content of 60 research
    articles about energy management in IoT-based WSNs from 2015 to 2021 (Fig. 3).
    As can be seen from this figure, the most significant number of selected papers
    were published between 2019 and 2020. Fig. 3 Paper distribution over time Full
    size image The energy consumed by a sensor node is the energy consumed by its
    capture, processing, and communication units. In fact, 70% of this energy is due
    to the transmissions by sensors (communication: routing and clustering phases),
    and only 30% of the energy is dedicated to other operations, such as securing
    data, accessing support, and others. Based on this information and the through
    reading of the selected articles, the authors decided that three categories are
    identified: routing methods, clustering methods, and miscellaneous. In addition,
    routing algorithms are sorted into seven types: multipath, distributed, centralized,
    survivable path, opportunistic, SDN based, and QoS based. Moreover, clustering
    methods are rearranged into four types: fuzzy, random, weighted, and hybrid. For
    the Miscellaneous methods, three parts are discussed: the physical layer, MAC
    layer, and security. Figure 4 describes the proposed classification of methods
    consisting of three categories (routing, clustering, and miscellaneous). Each
    method tended to optimize some QoS metrics to offer an efficient structure. Regarding
    the literature, the most cited performance metrics are: Energy consumption: The
    quantity of energy dissipated by a sensor during transmission phase. Network lifetime:
    the time to the first sensor-node failure. Throughput: the number of packets per
    second received at the receiver node. Packet ratio: the ratio of data packets
    that are actually transmitted to the destination. Delay : the difference between
    the time a packet is sent and the time it is received by the receiver node. Security:
    the optimal procedure that protects the data during the transmission phase. Congestion:
    it appears when the transmitted traffic becomes greater than the load of the channels.
    Distance: the distance between the transmitter node and the receiver node Scalability:
    the network’s ability to continue an efficient transmission when its size changes
    (the number of nodes increases). Mobility: the node’s ability to move without
    interrupting the transmission. Degree: the number of neighbor nodes. In the following
    subsections, we will define each classification and discuss some propositions
    for each type. Fig. 4 The proposed classification of energy efficient methods
    Full size image 4.1 Routing methods In WSNs, sensors are deployed in large numbers
    to monitor a particular phenomenon and report the information to the Base station
    (Fig. 5). To this end, the sensors can communicate and collaborate to send the
    collected information to the base station [99]. Routing presents the mechanism
    by which paths are chosen in a network to carry data from a sender node to the
    receiver node. In other words, node 1 decides to send the data to node 4 or node
    2 according to a specific routing procedure. While routing the information, the
    routingmethod must consider the sensor node’s energy consumption issues to increase
    the network lifetime. Every routing strategy has own specifications and characteristics
    based on network structure and applications [102]. Fig. 5 Routing procedure Full
    size image In what follows, we will describe many routing algorithms that aim
    to minimize energy consumption during data transmission. 4.1.1 Multipath routing
    Multipath routing uses multiple alternative paths during transmission inside the
    network. This method is more efficient compared to the traditional routing methods
    based on a single path. It can improve several network parameters, such as congestion,
    load balancing [150], and reliability [82]. However, there is no path identification
    in case of packet loss. Many researchers chose this routing type; for example
    Malathy et al. [86] proposed a new routing procedure for data packets in IoT networks.
    The main objective is to minimize congestion, and packet redundancy and improve
    throughput. Simulation results show the proposed approach’s-effectiveness in terms
    of these parameters than DRINA and InFRA methods. As future research directions,
    the network lifetime can be evaluated, and a testbed verification can be realized.
    Another example of multipath routing methods was presented in [65]. In this paper,
    the authors designed a new method to deal with an unfair traffic load in the network.
    Three parameters are defined to select the optimal path: network lifetime, reliability,
    and the traffic value at the next hop. The simulation results (NS2) expose the
    proposed protocol’s effectiveness in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery
    ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay, and network lifetime. However, the authors have
    not considered some parameters, such as throughput and delay, and a testbed verification
    should be realized. A new optimal QoS-aware multipath routing protocol for IoT
    applications based on WSNs is proposed in [59]. The new path is determined based
    on the network lifetime and congestion factors considering two other parameters,
    namely energy consumption and QoS. Nevertheless, some important parameters, such
    as network lifetime, throughput, and delay, were not considered. 4.1.2 Distributed
    routing In this approach, each sensor receives data from its neighbors and then
    finds the route’s decision. Data will be transmitted through an optimal route
    according to some parameters, such as energy, throughput, and delay [88]. Nevertheless,
    this method should find solutions in case of congestion. Many protocols were suggested
    for distributed routing. For instance, a new routing protocol, named Balanced
    Energy Adaptive Routing (BEAR), was proposed to increase the network lifetime
    of Underwater WSNs [62]. The proposed protocol consisted of three steps: Each
    node shares information about its residual energy and location during the first
    step. In the second step, each node chooses its next optimal node according to
    its residual energy. The third step is the transmission procedure. The new method
    was compared to two other protocols dedicated to Underwater WSNs. The simulation
    results confirm that BEAR allows to increase the network lifetime. As a future
    research direction, researchers can verify the delay and the throughput of this
    application and try the experimental study. Jian Shen et al. described a new clustering
    scheme named Energy-Efficient Cluster-based Routing Protocol (EECRP) for IoT-based
    WSNs [125] . This method consists of two steps: the cluster formation phase and
    the transmission phase. The clustering, communication and route discovery were
    based on the energy consumption for each node. This approach considers energy
    but requires an evaluation of network lifetime, delay, and throughput. A new routing
    protocol named Energy Harvesting Aware Routing Algorithm (EHARA) for IoT applications
    based on heterogeneous WSNs is proposed in [138]. It is based on the ambient energy
    sources and uses a new process called “extra backoff” that increases the IEEE
    802.15.4 CSMA/CA. The major goal is to extend the waiting time for each node.
    This process aims to increase network lifetime and improve the network QoS, such
    as throughput, packet loss, and PDR. A testbed verification can be a promising
    future research direction. Another proposition of distributed routing has been
    developed in [53]. The problem of routing is considered as an in-zone random process.
    The authors propose a new distributed protocol, named Zone Probabilistic Routing
    (ZPR), which transmits data randomly according to a forwarding probability distribution.
    Some parameters, such as energy, distance, and direction are considered. Direction
    can be modified according to network architecture to improve network performance.
    Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed protocol in terms of energy,
    network lifetime, and delay. However, other parameters, such as throughput and
    mobility, should be considered and tested. To improve the routing flexibility
    of WSNs, the authors in [80] propose a new distributed and flexible routing approach
    named Flexible Routing Computing Approach (FRCA). Three aspects are considered:
    routing parameters, the built-in base math functions, and the collected physical
    quantities. These elements can be modified according to network policies and modifications
    while maintaining network services. Thus, the proposed approach is flexible to
    maintain network performance despite the dynamicity of environment situations
    and application requirements. The simulation results prove that FRCA is effective
    concerning some parameters, such as network lifetime, energy consumption, and
    duplicate packets. Nevertheless, the proposed method has not considered mobility,
    which presents a fundamental parameter in IoT applications based on WSNs. To solve
    the problem of the burden on the nodes close to the sink, Busaileh et al. [17]
    presented a new hierarchical tree structure called Tuft, which uses a mobile sink.
    The use of a mobile base station allows balancing energy consumption between nodes.
    In addition, a new distributed routing approach named Multi-Criteria Decision
    Making (MCDM) is presented. It consists of three steps: Firstly, a mass function
    is introduced for each criterion. Secondly, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
    is presented to quantify the relationship between criteria. Finally, a weighted
    aggregation is realized in the final decision. Some network parameters, namely
    energy and network lifetime, have been improved in these propositions. However,
    some fundamental parameters such as throughput, delay, and congestion, have not
    been tested during the simulation. Khan et al. [67] suggested a sink-to-sink coordination
    framework using RPL periodic route maintenance messages. The main objective is
    to increase throughput and network lifetime. Load balancing is also maintained
    due to the base station’s adjustment. During the simulation, both random and grid
    multi-sink topology are tested. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
    the RPL approach in terms of throughput. However, this approach requires testbed
    evaluation. Banh et al. [10] proposed a radio module algorithm to estimate the
    mote energy consumption (EE) during transmission. Moreover, EE and ETX are combined
    to enhance load balancing. Simulation results show this proposition’s effectiveness
    in energy efficiency, energy balance, and PDR. However, this method requires testbed
    evaluation and validation with a large-scale network. To improve the Trickle algorithm’s
    performance, a new approach, called “Trickle-Plus”, is developed [38]. The main
    goal is to reduce energy consumption and enhance network convergence time. The
    simulation results illustrate better results compared to the original Trickle
    algorithm. However, the obtained results require testbed evaluation and taking
    into consideration some parameters, such as mobility and delay. Another version
    of the Trickle algorithm that defines a dynamic one is proposed in [145]. During
    the simulation, the proposed approach shows its effectiveness in terms of energy
    and convergence time. Nevertheless, some parameters have not been considered as
    delay and PDR. In addition, the testbed evaluation is absent and should be realized.
    A new routing algorithm named Dynamic Routing Algorithm, based on Energy-Efficient
    Relay Selection (DRAWERS), is proposed in [27]. Each network link has a weight
    that depends on energy consumption, and the routing procedure is realized according
    to these weights. The proposed scheme is compared to other propositions, such
    as the shortest path approach, and shows its effectiveness in terms of energy
    and throughput. Nevertheless, the testbed evaluation is required, and some parameters,
    such as the delay and network lifetime, can be considered to improve the routing.
    4.1.3 Centralized routing In this technique, a centralized node (like a Base Station
    (BS)) has comprehensive information about the network and creates all the routing
    decisions. The definition of a centralized method for WSN can minimize the consumed
    energy during the best path research [5]. The major cons of this approach reside
    in the case of a centralized node failure. An example of centralized routing,
    which introduced a new Scalable and energy-efficient routing protocol (SEEP),
    is presented in [72]. It is a new routing scheme based on a clustering framework
    to minimize energy consumption. In this procedure, the network area is divided
    into zones based on the new sub-area division method. Some other parameters, such
    as distance and mobility, were considered to make the simulation phase more realistic
    as the various applications of WSN-assisted IoT. The SEEP was compared to LEACH,
    MLEACH, EA-CRP, TDEEC, DEEC, SEP, and MIEEPB. As a result, this protocol showed
    its effectiveness in network lifetime, scalability, and energy efficiency. The
    experimental study can be realized later. A new routing approach using a modified
    Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA) is introduced in [140] . Many solutions are
    presented and classified into two groups: The first group is based on the average
    value of bypass and follower riders. The second considers the average value of
    attackers and overtaker riders. The simulation results indicate that the proposed
    approach outperforms several other methods in terms of energy and network lifetime.
    Nevertheless, some parameters, such as throughput, delay, and security, are not
    considered. Moreover, the scheme has not been tested by a real application. 4.1.4
    Survivable path routing The survivable path routing algorithm represents the network’s
    ability to support the devoted QoS continuously in the occurrence of failure scenarios.
    Generally, this method is used to reduce network bandwidth utilization [93]. For
    WSNs, the routing procedure should consider the node’s energy and tends to optimize
    this fundamental parameter. In [33], the authors introduced a new energy-efficient
    routing technique for WSNs used in healthcare monitoring applications. The next-hop
    node selection procedure is based on three parameters: the interference and noise
    ratio of the connection between nodes, the survivability factor, and the congestion
    level in the link. To sum up, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown
    in terms of energy consumption, throughput, and end-to-end delay. However some
    parameters, such as network lifetime, are not considered. In [78], the authors
    developed a new routing protocol for IoT networks based on WSNs. This assignment
    focuses on a pair of cluster fault-tolerant disjoint paths and defines a new approach
    to resolve this dilemma in a polynomial time of the graph degree. The authors
    suggested a new IoT architecture based on WSNs to improve many parameters, such
    as latency, end-to-end delay, energy consumption, throughput, and PDR. However,
    the method has not been tested by a real application. A new survivable path routing
    technique was defined to minimize energy consumption, congestion, and interference
    [32]. This strategy is allowed to remote healthcare monitoring applications, which
    are characterized by a high traffic network. For each transmission, the choice
    of the next hop is based on three parameters: the interference ratio of the link,
    the survivability factor, and the congestion level. The simulation results have
    shown that the proposed protocol outperforms other protocols in terms of throughput,
    end-to-end delay, PDR, and energy. The proposed structure should take into account
    other parameters such as network lifetime. 4.1.5 Opportunistic routing Opportunistic
    Routing’s (OR) main objective is to optimize data transmission using wireless
    networks broadcast characteristics. This method improves the transfer of information
    and minimizes the data loss ratio [63]. However, the congestion and the energy
    should be considered in the case of WSNs. In [51], a new opportunistic routing
    protocol is developed to solve two main network problems: the waiting time and
    the duplicate packets. First, each sensor identifies its proper Candidates Zone
    (CZ), which depends on the network density. This node transmits data inside its
    CZ. Second, the different nodes of each CZ are prioritized according to the OR
    metric, which depends on four parameters: transmission-distance distribution,
    direction distribution, residual energy distribution, and perpendicular-distance
    distribution. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of this scheme in
    terms of energy, network lifetime, latency, and routing efficiency. Nevertheless,
    some parameters, such as mobility and throughput, should be considered and improved.
    An Improved-Adaptive Ranking based Energy-efficient Opportunistic Routing protocol
    (I-AREOR) was defined to balance energy consumption and increase network lifetime
    [22]. Three parameters are considered: distance, energy and density. In addition,
    I-AREOR tends to extend the first node death (FND) value by considering these
    parameters. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of this proposition in
    terms of energy, network lifetime, FND, half-node death (HND), and last node death
    (LND). However, it requires dense testbed evaluation and considering some parameters,
    such as delay. An intelligent opportunistic routing protocol (IOP) based on a
    machine learning technique is proposed in [9] to improve energy consumption and
    the reliability of a healthcare application. This method outperforms similar schemes
    concerning energy and network lifetime. However, a security approach should be
    defined to secure transmission in healthcare applications. 4.1.6 SDN based routing
    Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a method that uses open protocols, such as
    OpenFlow, to apply globally aware software control at the edges of the network.
    The main problem with SDN is the optimization of transmission delay [28]. Among
    the SDN-based routing schemes, the suggestion treated in [52] aims to decrease
    data transmission between the data and control planes and optimize waiting time
    and duplicate packets. Moreover, a new protocol named MINI-FLOW is proposed to
    optimize the routing process between two planes based on four parameters: energy,
    hops to the sink, the Received Signal Strength (RSS), and the direction toward
    the sink. Moreover, two heuristic methods are suggested: Optimized Reverse Downlink
    (ORD), which considers the reverse direction of the uplink, and the Location-based
    Downlink (LD), which uses some parameters, such as distance, energy, and RSS value.
    The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches in
    terms of energy, network lifetime, redundant packet rate (RPR), routing distance,
    and waiting time. A testbed verification can be an interesting future research
    direction. 4.1.7 Qos-based routing The QoS-based routing method finds an optimal
    path that enforces the QoS requirements [92]. A new architecture for IoT-based
    WSNs is proposed in [57]. It guarantees security and energy inside the network.
    Three aspects are suggested: TDMA schemes, a definition of new Energy Efficient
    Secure Route Adjustment (ESRA) and security. The performance analyses are realized
    based on many metrics: connectivity ratio, energy consumption, delay time, packet
    failure rate, and encryption time. These analyses show the effectiveness of the
    proposed algorithm compared to other proposals from the literature. Nevertheless,
    network lifetime parameters can be considered and tested. Juan Luo et al. [81]
    described a new Energy Saving via Probabilistic Dissemination (ENS-PD) algorithm.
    This strategy chooses an optimal energy method and prolongs the network lifetime.
    The authors defined new communication and energy models to guarantee the quality
    of communication in IoT-based WSNs applications. However, network lifetime, delay,
    and throughput should be considered. A new method searching an optimal path between
    the sensor and the destination is developed in [58]. The authors considered two
    QoS parameters: energy consumption (or the network lifetime) and node congestion.
    First, each node calculates its weight according to the QoS parameters. Then,
    for each hop, the source node searches the next node with the optimal cost. In
    addition, the authors have compared the proposed method with CDB and DDR routing
    schemes. The simulation results showed the effectiveness of this method in terms
    of packet drop ratio, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and delay. As a future
    research direction, the network lifetime can be evaluated by comparing it to other
    propositions. A new energy-efficient routing protocol for IoT applications based
    on WSN is proposed in [60]. During the transmission phase, each node tends to
    find the optimal path according to three parameters: energy, reliability, and
    traffic intensity of the next node. To improve the effectiveness of this protocol,
    a comparison with two major popular routing protocols, namely Rumor and REER,
    is realized. The simulation results assert that the proposed method is better
    in terms of energy saving, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and network
    lifetime. Hence, it requires a testbed verification procedure. A new fuzzy algorithm
    called Fuzzy rule-based Energy Efficient clustering and Immune Inspired Routing
    (FEEC-IIR) is introduced in [111]. It is a new fuzzy method that optimizes energy
    consumption in IoT systems. It consists of two steps: First, the CH selection
    step aims to minimize energy consumption. Second, the routing process tries to
    improve the information delivery reliability. To enhance the effectiveness of
    FEEC-IIR, the authors compare the introduced method to many existing schemes.
    The results show that this protocol improves node energy consumption, the network
    lifetime, and other QoS parameters, namely packet loss ratio, throughput, and
    bit error rate. This application requires testbed verification. The selection
    of cluster heads is based on QoS impact and node location. For the routing process,
    the optimization includes the intra-cluster communication cost and inter-cluster
    communication cost. The routing procedure optimizes other QoS parameters, such
    as data delivery reliability. An energy-efficient routing (Prinergy) method is
    presented in [142] to minimize energy consumption. It is based on the low-power
    and lossy network (RPL) model. Timing patterns are used when sending data (network
    traffic, audio, or image data) between the source and the destination. The simulation
    results demonstrate that the proposed Prinergy procedure reduces overhead on the
    mesh, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption. Furthermore, it exceeds the most
    popular routing methods in an IoT environment (the quality-of-service RPL (QRPL))
    which can be improved by the verification of network lifetime. A new routing protocol
    was designed according to the residual energy of the node and that of its neighbors.
    Performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this routing scheme in
    terms of energy and network lifetime. However, other parameters, such as throughput
    and delay, can be considered to improve these parameters and enhance the QoS of
    the routing process. A Deep Reinforcement Learning based intelligent routing scheme
    for IoT-enabled WSNs is suggested in [64]. The principal objective is to reduce
    delay and raise network lifetime. The CH selection phase tends to balance the
    data load between sensors. Many parameters, such as alive nodes, packet delivery,
    energy, and delay, are improved. However, others, such as throughput and scalability,
    are not considered. Table 2 presents a comparison of the previous propositions
    in terms of: Types: the type of the proposition. Performance metrics: energy,
    network lifetime, throughput and others must be improved during the process. Applications:
    the proposed method can be dedicated to the specific application or any type of
    application (–). Simulators: the used simulators during the simulation process.
    Future research directions: presents different parameters that can be improved
    as a future research direction. Table 2 Routing methods analysis and future research
    direction Full size table 4.2 Clustering methods Clustering is the division of
    a network into zones (Fig. 6). Each zone, called a cluster is managed by a leader
    called ClusterHead (CH). Each sensor must be a neighbor of at least one CH. Generally,
    the existing clustering algorithms try to minimize the number of clusters (i.e.,
    CHs) to optimize the transmission parameters (latency, congestion, control traffic,
    etc). [49, 117]. In a cluster, nodes can be linked directly to their CH (1-hop)
    or through a k-hops connection, in which case the structure is called k-cluster.
    The choice of CHs is made based on a decision criterion which can be a metric
    (identifier, residual energy, mobility, etc) or the combination of two or more
    metrics. The following figure describes an example of clustering [130]. Fig. 6
    clustering procedure Full size image In what follows, a set of clustering algorithms
    will be presented and compared. 4.2.1 Fuzzy methods Fuzzy clustering consists
    of forming clusters in which each sensor node can belong to more than one cluster
    [109]. A new protocol named Neuro-Fuzzy Rule-Based Cluster Formation and Routing
    Protocol (FBCFP), which defines a new routing process for IoT-based WSNs, is presented
    in [136]. The authors tried to improve many parameters, such as residual energy,
    the distance between CH and BS, and the degree of CH. Two steps are defined: the
    cluster formation process and the routing procedure. The former uses a fuzzy reasoning
    approach. In the latter, the CH finds the shortest path via a fuzzy rule-based
    approach and then, the packets are routed to the BS. While this method reduces
    energy consumption and delay, it requires testbed verification and validation
    of throughput. In [133], the Enhanced Clustering Algorithm based on Fuzzy Logic
    (E-CAFL) is proposed. This new clustering protocol is based on four parameters:
    energy, distance, density, and interference. This method uses fuzzy approach to
    empower the cluster formation phase and improve the routing procedure. The algorithm
    is compared to LEACH and CAFL protocols and shows its efficiency in minimizing
    energy consumption and increasing the network lifetime. Another scheme that considers
    a densely distributed WSN used in IoT systems is proposed in [112]. The clustering
    procedure uses the tree formation method, and the CH selection phase is based
    on an energy-efficient goal. The choice of CH is launched by a Reinforcement Learning
    based Fuzzy Inference System (RL-FIS). The elected node performs the data gathering
    phase to minimize energy consumption. The proposed algorithm is compared to other
    recent methods introduced in the literature. It shows its effectiveness in terms
    of energy consumption and network lifetime. Furthermore, this solution needs to
    reduce delay, and optimize throughput. Testbed validation is required. Wang et
    al. [141] tried a new energy-efficient clustering routing algorithm for IoT applications
    based on WSNs. The clustering procedure considers the non-uniform traffic distribution
    and aims to balance the load and minimize energy consumption. The routing algorithm
    is designed based on the cost function aiming to resolve the energy problem. To
    sum up, the effectiveness of the proposed procedures concerning energy, network
    lifetime, and throughput is proven. Hence, it requires optimizing delay and considering
    mobility. A new cluster head selection phase was defined among the different IoT
    devices of the network to define an efficient data transmission between nodes
    [106]. To accomplish this phase, the authors used a new Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering
    calculation which is based on the combination of the Optimal Secured Energy-Aware
    Protocol (OSEAP) and Improved Bacterial Foraging Optimization (IBFO) algorithm.
    The simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method in
    terms of energy, delay, throughput, and security. Furthermore, this procedure
    needs a testbed evaluation. In [97], the authors develop a new fuzzy clustering
    approach to raise the energy efficiency of routing methods in IoT networks. It
    is implemented with minimal energy consumption and high reliability. Besides,
    a new clustering formation procedure is introduced to minimize energy consumption.
    Experimental results prove the optimality of the packet loss ratio and jitter
    ratio in the network. Improving this method concerning network lifetime, delay,
    and throughput would be an interesting future work. In [103], a new algorithm,
    namedEnergy Efficient Fuzzy logic-based clustering Algorithm (TEEFCA), is presented.
    Two phases are defined: the identification of the trustworthy nodes and the implementation
    of the fuzzy inference system. The CH selection procedure is based on three parameters:
    energy, distance, and density. Hence, several parameters, such as scalability
    and throughput, should be considered and evaluated. 4.2.2 Random methods During
    the random clustering procedure, leader nodes are selected randomly in each round.
    This method minimizes energy consumption through the selection phase. However,
    choosing a damaged node can disrupt the transmission process [21, 129]. A new
    scheme for green IoT-based WSN is proposed in [13]. The authors used hierarchical
    topology and communication constraints. They also defined many Relay Nodes (RN)
    to transmit data between sensors and the base station. Moreover, a new protocol
    named Minimum Energy Consumption Chain-based Cluster Coordinator Protocol (ME-CBCCP)
    was introduced to increase network lifetime for large-scale networks. Testbed
    verification and considering delay and throughput are required. Using a random
    process, another clustering protocol entitled Energy-Efficient Centroid-based
    Routing Protocol (EECRP), consisting of three parts: the cluster formation phase,
    the CH election and, rotation algorithms, is developed in [124] to balance energy
    load among all nodes and minimize energy consumption in communications. A comparison
    with LEACH, LEACH-C, and GEEC demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of network
    lifetime. However, it needs to be tested in real applications taking into account
    throughput and delay. 4.2.3 Weighted methods In this approach, a calculated weight
    is attributed for each node according to the weighted function. Some parameters,
    such as distance, energy, and location, can be considered [137]. In [11], the
    optimization problem is defined as an energy constraint problem for IoT applications
    tools. The main goal is to conserve the energy of each node. To this end, a new
    routing protocol is implemented. The first step is the production of clusters
    based on distance from the base station, message length, and data transmitted
    from the environment. Then, the set of cluster heads is elected, and a new directed
    acyclic graph (DAG) is produced. Edges represent the communication between the
    transmitter and the receiver nodes. In addition, the edge weights are computed
    based on a formulated equation. A real-time routing is defined as the minimum
    cost path to the base station. The simulation results prove that the proposed
    routing protocol outperforms several existing routing protocols regarding the
    number of active nodes, energy and network coverage. Hence, the throughput and
    delay should be considered. In [110], the crucial challenge was to have an efficient
    energy strategy during communication between homogeneous or heterogeneous nodes.
    Many current protocols use either the homogenous or the heterogeneous nodes. However,
    the authors in [110] used the relation between physical WSN and heterogeneous
    Cyber IoT tools. They also implemented an efficient energy-aware clustering communication
    and a new real IoT network architecture (Hy-IoT). The adequate cluster-head selection
    strategy allows raising network lifetime and packets transmission rate to the
    base station. Therefore, Hy- IoT method uses various weighted election probabilities
    to choose a cluster-head of each region. As a result, this strategy increases
    the throughput and the network lifetime compared to other recent protocols, such
    as SEP, LEACH, and Z-SEP. A testbed evaluation can be conducted as a future work.
    In [128], the authors present an energy-aware deduction routing algorithm. Three
    crucial factors are considered; lifetime, energy, and distance rate. The cluster
    head selection procedure aims to minimize the nodes numbers in the IoT network.
    Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of
    energy and feasibility. Other parameters, such as a network lifetime and throughput,
    can be considered. In [83], the authors proposed a new efficient CH election method.
    First, the set of CHs is created according to the LEACH protocol. Then, for each
    round, the election phase is based on the residual energy of each node. The proposed
    algorithm is compared to LEACH in terms of throughput, lifetime, and residual
    energy, and its effectiveness is proven. However, the delay should be considered,
    and a testbed evaluation is required. In [127], the authors invented a new clustering
    scheme and routing procedure for IoT-based WSNs to improve the network lifetime.
    First, they introduced a hierarchical topology based on clusters. Then, they mentioned
    a new method to select relay nodes. This strategy considers many parameters, such
    as node density in the cluster, shortest distance, and communication range. Finally,
    an efficient routing algorithm is defined. The numerical results of the simulation
    prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods in terms of energy consumption
    and network lifetime. In [12], the authors proposed a new clustering procedure
    to diminish energy consumption. It chooses the optimal cluster head according
    to its energy level, and the same election procedure is repeated for each round.
    The proposed protocol is compared to LEACH, and the simulation results demonstrate
    that the new version outperforms LEACH, upgrading throughput by 60%, residual
    energy by 64%, and lifetime by 66%. Nevertheless, reducing transmission delay
    and testbed evaluation are required. A new clustering approach using a modified
    Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA) is introduced in [6]. Many solutions are presented
    and are classified into two groups. The first group is based on the average value
    of bypass and follower riders. The second considers the average value of attackers
    and overtaker riders. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach
    outperforms several other methods in terms of energy and network lifetime. Nonetheless,
    some parameters, such as throughput, delay, and security, are not considered.
    Moreover, the proposition has not been tested by a real application. 4.2.4 Hybrid
    methods For hybrid methods, both random approach and weighted processes are used
    [34]. In [14], the authors modified the existing clustering algorithm LEACH to
    fit IoT applications. Due to LEACH, the choice of the CH is random for each round:
    some nodes could be elected many times; consequently, their batteries could be
    affected. The proposed IoT LEACH (ILEACH) resolves this problem and introduces
    a threshold limit: When the CH has more energy than this value, it remains a CH
    for the next round, thus, minimizing the energy consumed for the CH election phase
    and the cluster formation step. This algorithm improves the throughput, energy
    consumption, and network lifetime. Nonetheless, the delay has to be reduced, and
    a testbed verification is required. In [105], a new protocol for WSN-assisted
    IoT network entitled Minimum Energy Consumption Chain-based Cluster Coordinator
    Protocol (MBCBCCP) is developed. It highlights a hierarchical cluster framework
    and considers many constraints to increase the network lifetime. The RNs are selected
    randomly based on the shortest distance nodes. This choice leads to various RNs
    from one cluster to another, hence inefficient resource utilization. The procedure
    optimizes energy and network lifetime but does not consider throughput and a testbed
    verification. In [18], a new clustering algorithm for heterogeneous WSNs, REECHD,
    is introduced to construct equal size clusters. This procedure contains four phases:
    cluster head election, cluster formation, rotation, and network operation. During
    the first phase, REECHD considers residual energy and the transmission rate of
    nodes. It also introduces the notion of the intra-traffic rate limit (ITRL) that
    limits the intra-traffic communication for each cluster. Compared to many other
    algorithms, the proposition shows its effectiveness in terms of energy. Reducing
    delay can be an important future work. In [96], the authors propose a new hybrid
    clustering scheme named Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with Simulated Annealing
    (SA). The selection process is based on several parameters, namely load, energy,
    cost function, temperature, and the number of alive nodes. The proposed method
    shows its energy efficiency. Some other parameters, such as delay, node density,
    link lifetime, and scalability, should be tested and considered. Table 3 shows
    a comparison of the previously presented methods. Table 3 Clustering methods analysis
    and future research directions Full size table 4.3 Miscellaneous This section
    will describe an energy efficient method related to various layers ,such as physical
    layer, MAC layer, and security step. 4.3.1 Security step Nowadays, IoT-based on
    WSN architecture is commonly applied to social life applications, such as intelligent
    transportation, smart grid, smart security, and smart home. Although, IoT applications
    can bring comfort to people, it cannot guarantee the security of personal privacy.
    consequently, security presents a crucial requirement for IoT developers [50].
    IoT applications, protocols, and devices must provide methods to guarantee Availability,
    Confidentiality, and Security (CIA) services. For each IoT application, the following
    requirements must be provided [148]: a) Authenticity: Only some authorized sensors
    can communicate between any two nodes. b) Confidentiality: The loss of critical
    information to any unauthorized user must be avoided. c) Integrity: Data integrity
    guarantees the uniqueness of the information, i.e., that it is not rewritten ,
    fabricated, copied, or replaced by the attacker. d) Privacy: The identity of a
    particular user must be protected by the IoT system to ensure privacy. e) Availability:
    An authorized user can refer to various services offered by network protocols
    that support service availability. Security issues in IoT-based WSNs have become
    crucial and are attracting much attention [144]. For example, the work presented
    in [77] introduces a new secure and energy-efficient scheme for IoT- based WSNs.
    The proposition concerns the authentication of nodes and consists of three phases:
    registration, authentication, and password change. The simulation results affirm
    that this method is better than other protocols concerning low computational cost
    and power consumption. However, some parameters, namely delay and network lifetime,
    should be considered. In [70], an effective security method for the jamming attack
    was proposed. The new mechanism called threshold-based countermeasure (TBC) is
    based on a threshold value. Each node has a threshold value that is compared to
    the current transmission. If this value exceeds the limit value, there is an attack
    in the network. Then, the information of attack detection is transmitted to network
    nodes to isolate the malicious sensor. The proposition proves its effectiveness
    during simulation regarding energy consumption, scalability, mobility, and delay.
    A testbed evaluation, throughput, and delay improvement can be realized as a future
    work. A robust key management approach is developed in [71] to solve the problem
    of current key management technologies, while the bandwidth capacity of nodes
    is limited. The new mechanism proposes a two-level verification process for one-hop
    transmission and multi-hop transmission. The simulation results show the efficiency
    of the proposed scheme concerning delay, energy consumption, and packet loss ratio.
    However, network lifetime should be considered and evaluated. A cognitive key
    management technique CKMT is introduced in [69] . It assumes that nodes are mobile;
    Each CH acts as a key manager and keeps up the private keys of the nodes. The
    mobility assumption is used to minimize the computational cost in the network.
    While each node has local and foreign keys, a pairwise key is defined solely for
    the cluster’s common nodes. The simulation results prove the efficiency of this
    approach regarding energy, delay, and computational costs. However, network lifetime
    and throughput should be enhanced. In [48], the authors suggested an IoT-based
    WSN architecture as an application for smart agriculture consisting of two steps.
    First, the sensors detect data and reveal a different CH using a decision function.
    Second, the transmission security is realized according to the recurrence of the
    linear congruential generator. The proposed scheme guarantees the efficiency of
    some parameters like energy, throughput, and latency. However, the testbed evaluation
    is absent, and the scalability should be tested and considered. In [122], the
    authors proposed an approach for data acquisition, communication, and security
    subsystems to minimize energy consumption through the transmission and security
    phase. Nevertheless, the suggested approach is not tested or evaluated. Moreover,
    some parameters, such as scalability, delay and throughput, can be considered.
    4.3.2 MAC layer The data link layer is divided into two sub-layers: the Medium
    Access Protocol (MAC) sublayer, which is responsible for managing the medium access,
    and the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer, which carries out the error correction
    method [37]. The MAC sublayer represents the layer that manages the hardware responsible
    for interaction with the wireless transmission medium [131]. In [73], a new data
    dissemination protocol for the IoT-WSNs environment is proposed to minimize energy
    consumption and dissemination delay time. The proposed protocol solves the problem
    of routing tables and their updates by defining the dissemination procedure. It
    shows its effectiveness compared to two well-known protocols in terms of control
    packets, energy consumption, transmission time, data transmission ratio, and network
    disconnection time. Nevertheless, network lifetime and throughput should be considered.
    4.3.3 Physical layer The physical layer presents the means of transmitting bits
    over a physical data link connecting WSNs [8]. It guarantees the steps of the
    data transmission procedure, such as frequency selection, carrier generation,
    and signal detection. The splitting of data into packets and their reassembly
    are carried out by the data link layer. This layer is responsible for the reliability
    of the connection through a robust error control procedure [119]. Figure 7 presents
    the various physical layer mechanisms for wireless IoT. Fig. 7 Physical layer
    machanisms Full size image In [87], the authors developed a new architecture that
    defines a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard and mesh topology. The main objective
    is to minimize energy consumption in IoT-based WSNs applications. The use of the
    BLE allows to reduce the power consumption and improve the network lifetime. The
    BLE is compared to two technologies, namely Zig Bee and NRF24L01, and shows its
    effectiveness in terms of network lifetime. Nevertheless, it needs verification
    of throughput, delay, and network lifetime. In [91], a new energy harvesting strategy
    based on vehicles’ movement is developed. The proposed algorithm called Adaptive
    Beacon order, Super-frame Order and Duty cycle (ABSD) uses MAC parameters of IEEE
    802.15.4 sensor nodes to manage the traffic transmission. This approach tends
    to minimize the network contention level to improve the network throughput and
    minimize energy consumption. Numerical results prove that it accomplishes energy
    efficiency and QoS in terms of throughput and network lifetime. The proposed approach
    does not take into account delay and network lifetime and requires a testbed evaluation.
    Table 4 represents a comparison of previous methods. Table 4 Miscellaneous analysis
    and future research directions Full size table 4.4 Discussion In this study, we
    compared and classified 60 recent energy-efficient methods for IoT applications
    using WSNs. Figure 8 presents a statistical analysis of the Studied approaches
    in terms of types, applications, and used simulators. As can be seen in subfigure
    (a), most strategies concern the routing or clustering steps. In total, 51,66%
    are dedicated to routing, 33,33% to clustering, and only 15% to others (physical
    layer, Mac layer, and security step). This finding can be explained by the influence
    of routing and clustering steps in energy consumption. About 75% of energy is
    consumed during the transmission step (routing and clustering). Thus, energy consumption
    optimization can be realized by minimizing energy consumption through these steps.
    Subfigure (b) shows that several methods have been developed for all IoT applications,
    with only 15% presented for a specific application. The choice of the application
    at the beginning makes the method more efficient and outlines the application’s
    requirements. In addition, studying these algorithms in a precise application
    would be an important future research direction. Subfigure (c) summarizes the
    most used simulators during the simulation steps. Figure 9 summarizes the number
    of methods that use each simulator, with ’MATLAB’ being the most used simulator
    by 40% . Generally, ’MATLAB’ is a numerical computing environment that is not
    dedicated to network simulation. The network simulator ’NS2’ is also commonly
    used (25%). It is an effective simulator for wired and wireless networks. For
    wireless sensor networks, some simulators, such as ’COOJA’, ’ Opnet’, and ’ C#’,
    are defined but are less used than ’ MATLAB’ and ’ NS2’. ’Python’ is used solely
    in one proposition despite its effectiveness and simplicity. Moreover, a testbed
    verification is realized only by two methods (about 3%). Although this value is
    very low, it is crucial to test a real application proposition before use. Fig.

    comparison Full size image Figure 10 gives a statistical analysis for each type.
    For routing algorithms, the most suggested types are “distributed” (55%) and “QoS
    based ”(26%). The distributed routing opts for distributing the routing process
    through network nodes. It balances the load between nodes to cause energy efficiency.
    The QoS-based algorithm chooses the path according to some designated parameters.
    Accordingly, it is commonly used to obtain the desired QoS. As can be seen from
    subfigure (b), the most suggested clustering algorithm is based on a fuzzy or
    weighted approach. Generally, these two clustering methods gave the best results
    concerning energy consumption. Subfigure (c) demonstrates that the security step
    is the most studied (67%). This step is crucial for IoT applications. Fig. 10
    Statistics Analysis for each type Full size image Figure 11 presents the comparison
    of all the discussed performance metrics. As can be seen from this figure, energy,
    network lifetime, and throughput are the most used parameters. The definition
    of such parameters depends on the IoT application. For example, a healthcare application
    requires a high throughput and low packet delivery ratio. Despite their importance,
    other parameters, such as security and mobility, are not considered in most propositions.
    Fig. 11 Performace metrics comparison Full size image Figure 12 illustrates that
    the healthcare monitoring application has the highest percentage of use. This
    application is linked to people’s health and requires specific parameters concerning
    delay, network lifetime and packet delivery ratio. Fig. 12 Applications comparison
    Full size image As a results, the statistical analyses demonstrate that the most
    proposed types are (1) “distributed” and “QoS based ” for routing protocols, (2)
    “fuzzy” and “weighted” approaches for clustering algorithms, and (3) the security
    step is the most studied for miscellaneous parts. MATLAB and NS2 present the most
    used simulators. 5 IoT collection : Challenges, main issues, solutions, and future
    research directions 5.1 Challenges In this subsection, we will discuss the major
    challenges that can appear during the routing process, MAC layer, and security
    process. Node’s deployment: Unlike traditional networks, where nodes are organized
    in the known region before network establishment, IoT-based WSNs do not have a
    fixed topology while nodes are deployed randomly in the region of interest [98].
    Generally, the used application depends on the efficiency of the deployed sensors.
    Therefore, the deployment strategy must be carefully arranged. Nevertheless, this
    process is challenging due to many constraints, such as the localization of mobile
    nodes that needs to be taken into account. Node’s Heterogeneity: Some IoT applications
    need to use heterogeneous devices with different abilities (energy resources,
    storage space, and calculation capacity) [43]. The use of heterogeneous networks
    can increase the throughput and maintain the network lifetime due to the existence
    of powerful (rechargeable) nodes. When deploying a heterogeneous WSN, some parameters,
    such as the number of powerful nodes and their locations, must be specified. Moreover,
    the cost of the network increases according to the number of powerful nodes. Intermittent
    connectivity: Most IoT applications require a crowd of IoT devices to guarantee
    better deployment and connectivity, but due to limited energy resources and random
    network topology, nodes connectivity can be damaged [16]. For IoT-based WSN networks,
    connectivity is central. It affects the efficiency of data transmission as well
    as the network lifetime. Indeed, if the connectivity is damaged, the control traffic
    increases, and consequently, the energy consumed rises. Multi-hop communications:
    Generally, sensors have short-range wireless communication. In addition, the consumed
    energy increases according to the distance. Thus, the data need to be transmitted
    through a relay [35]. Indeed, it is essential to define an efficient multi-hop
    routing strategy, which minimizes energy consumption and increases the network
    lifetime. Fault tolerance: Energy constraints, random deployment, and environmental
    issues are the main problem affecting the network performances. Consequently,
    routing protocols must contain a fault tolerance mechanism to control such accidental
    events [85]. For instance, when the sensor suffers a failure that can be caused
    by its energy reserve or when new sensors want to connect to the structure, the
    network must continue to run normally and without interruption. Security: Due
    to the presence of dishonest sensors, optimal security methods must be taken into
    consideration. In fact, protection issues are an essential test for IoT-based
    WSNs applications, and are challenging [36]. Mobility: Mobility sensors can trouble
    the connections and affect the data transmission phase. Consequently, the number
    of retransmission packets increases and impacts the network performance in terms
    of the congestion phenomenon [135]. Moreover, it is essential to consider this
    parameter during the clustering and routing phases. For instance, for the clustering
    phase, it is better to choose the CHs having lower mobility to maintain the structure’s
    stability for as long as possible. Scalability: Some IoT applications can contain
    hundreds to thousands of sensors. Therefore, the defined protocols should be scalable
    to respond to different requests [90]. Most proposed methods did not consider
    this parameter and applied their algorithms to small-scale networks. Therefore,
    defining protocols that respond to different requests remains a challenging task.
    Energy: Energy-efficiency presents a central challenge while sensors require energy
    during various tasks (sensing, computation, and routing) [123]. In addition, a
    node that has a low energy reserve is unable to transmit information, especially
    if the distance between the nodes is high and requires much energy. 5.2 Main issues
    To design an effective IoT application based on WSNs, we have considered a set
    of issues: Scheduling: Scheduling is used to allocate resources to each node based
    on QoS. Due to a resource’s limitation of WSNs, scheduling presents a serious
    issue [100]. For IoT-based WSNs, the goal of the scheduling problem is to find
    an optimal resource allocation algorithm that behaves well in practice (in terms
    of energy). However, scheduling presents a serious issue due to the resource’s
    limitation of WSNs. Synchronization: the synchronization between nodes is the
    ability to decide to be either active or sleeping. The main objective is to reduce
    overhearing or the idle-listening period [74]. Many studies have developed synchronization
    methods for IoT networks with the goal of optimizing various parameters, such
    as energy, network lifetime, throughput, and network cost. However, the synchronization
    problem remains an open issue because of the resource limitation and the number
    of nodes in the network. Resources limitation: energy resources, storage space,
    and calculation capacity are restricted parameters for IoT applications based
    on WSNs. Hence, any application should consider these constraints to maintain
    network reliability [24]. For example, the CH formation phase should consider
    the remaining energy of the nodes to ensure an efficient transmission to the base
    station. Load balance: load balance of WSNs presents the key to ensuring the efficiency
    of reliable deployment. The fundamental issue here is distributing network traffic
    across multiple nodes to reduce energy consumption [149]. The fundamental issue
    here is to distribute network traffic across multiple nodes to provide a stable
    structure, reduce energy consumption, and increase network lifetime. For instance,
    the clustering techniques tend to minimize the size (number of nodes) of the clusters
    closer to the base station to minimize their energy consumption during intra-cluster
    communication. As a result, more energy will be available to manage inter-cluster
    communication. Network lifetime: Minimizing energy consumption and maximizing
    network lifetime are two major issues in WSNs satisfying the QoS parameters. Network
    lifetime is generally calculated based on the number of alive sensors [20]. The
    lifetime is considered a fundamental parameter in the context of availability
    in WSNs. This parameter poses a problem of energy reservation, especially if the
    application has to run for a long time. Usually, it is impossible to recharge
    or replace node batteries after their exhaustion. Traffic management: To enhance
    the performance metrics of any IoT application based on WSNs, traffic management
    techniques should control some parameters, such as packet loss ratio and error
    bit rates [39]. This parameter usually presents a serious issue due to its impact
    on the energy consumption and the network lifetime. For instance, much control
    traffic can lead to the battery exhaustion, and successive retransmissions are
    also a source of additional energy consumption. Dynamic topology: The WSNs topology
    should be dynamically updated when new nodes are added, or some active nodes’
    remaining energies become very low [55]. Routing protocols and CHs phases need
    to be updated according to one or more changes in the network. For instance, a
    CH having a low energy reserve must be elected as an ordinary node during the
    next round to maintain the network functioning. The dynamic topology remains an
    open issue since the majority of proposed solutions tend to define a stable structure.
    Real-time transmission: Some IoT applications need data transmission with high
    real-time requirements. Hence, the routing procedure should be able to consider
    transmission delay while ensuring a better QoS [114]. This parameter is challenging
    because of the resource limitation, especially in terms of energy. 5.3 Solutions
    and future research directions To solve different issues described previously,
    many solutions, such as clustering methods and load balancing approaches, have
    been proposed in the literature. These propositions aim to minimize energy consumption,
    increase network lifetime, and balance the traffic load between nodes by optimizing
    some parameters, namely latency, throughput, and congestion. To minimize energy
    consumption, optimal routing protocols present an effective solution since they
    can find an optimal path considering resource limitations and network dynamic
    topology. MAC protocols can solve the scheduling and synchronization problem and
    optimize some network parameters, such as lifetime, energy consumption, and latency.
    Future research directions need to resolve the specific IoT trends and challenges
    [147]: Scalability:IoT systems should be able to accommodate broad user groups,
    programs, decision points, and policy enforcement as they grow in popularity.
    Some research works, such as [44, 126] ensure network scalability and optimize
    energy consumption. Virtualization: Several connected sensors can represent a
    single virtual sensor that reports a virtual measurement result from the aggregation
    of several secondary states. For example, a virtual sensor that tells us if the
    patient’s health state is good or not. This information is a combination of several
    pieces of information provided by several medical sensors. Thus, a generic model
    of virtualization of connected objects, called Virtualization of Things (VoT),
    allows an abstract representation of objects and the accumulation of data coming
    from different places to facilitate their control. For example, some proposed
    methods, such as [47], define a virtual routing process to balance network energy
    consumption and prolong the network lifetime. Mobility: A huge number of objects
    connected to the internet, as part of IoT, will be most often mobile. Therefore,
    flexible mobility management solutions must be implemented to allow such objects
    to accomplish their missions effectively regardless of the frequency and speed
    of mobility [26, 101]. Interoperability: Interoperability is the cohabitation
    of different devices, systems, and mechanisms and the possibility of making them
    cooperate and interact permanently. To facilitate collaboration between connected
    objects, a recent trend is towards the standardization and unification of operating
    systems and protocols in IoT and their presentation in open source [1, 68, 104].
    Protecting user privacy: Many sensors connected to the internet and implanted
    in objects of daily use reveal our habits, state of health, geographic location,
    and other types of private information. For this reason, there must strictly be
    robust mechanisms that can ensure the confidentiality of data that the user qualifies
    as sensitive [3, 120]. 6 Conclusion The IoT application is a new paradigm that
    links many electronic objects to provide services. An IoT application can be based
    on WSNs when each sensor detects data and transmits it to an administrator. Energy
    efficiency is the most important parameter during the implementation of these
    applications. This paper depicted the taxonomy of various energy-efficient-methods
    for IoT applications using WSNs. Some surveys in the same fields were compared,
    and an overview of IoT Technologies was presented. Then, 60 papers that suggested
    energy conservation methods were selected. Most of the selected papers were published
    between 2019 and 2020. The classification of these methods was realized into three
    types: routing (52%), clustering (33%), and miscellaneous methods (15%). The different
    approaches were compared based on several parameters, such as performance metrics,
    simulators, and used applications. Most of the studied papers tended to enhance
    energy, network lifetime, and throughput. Other parameters, such as packet ratio,
    delay, security, congestion, and distance, were not often taken into account.
    The most used simulators were MATLAB (40%) and NS2 (25%). Concerning used applications,
    healthcare monitoring presented the most considered application (35%). Finally,
    we outlined some open challenges and future directions, such as scalability, mobility,
    energy, interoperability, and security. This study highlighted the pros and cons
    of each proposition; it offers guidelines to help researchers develop new energy-efficient
    methods. Each highlighted con for each method can be an interesting future research
    direction. Upcoming work will be a proposition of a new energy-efficient method
    for IoT based WSNs. This method will use Artificial Intelligence algorithms to
    improve performance metrics. Data Availability No availabilities Code Availability

    Introduction The (IoT) Internet of Things technology enables linking of objects
    via the internet [1]. Wireless sensors have grown to be important components of
    data collection in IoTs as a result of a significant advancement in wireless communication
    [2]. The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is how the wireless sensors are arranged
    in this case. Additionally, it is capable of wireless communication, information
    pre-processing, and information detection [3]. Through short-range wireless communication,
    a network that has been created between the sensor nodes and the Routing protocol
    [4]. LEACH Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy Protocol execution is relatively
    intuitive [5]and produces higher performance results when compared to conventional
    hierarchical routing protocols. Additionally, it employs probability theory to
    distribute SNs'' energy loads randomly throughout the network [6]. The Cluster
    energy efficiency has to be improved, which is dependent on the CH election, classic
    LEACH elects arbitrary values on each sensor node and compares them with the acquired
    threshold values [7]. In LEACH, the CH is chosen at random, giving each cluster
    node an equal chance to become the CH [8]. Because the CH is also a node with
    low energy, the whole cluster will be insensitive [9]. Additionally, the entire
    networks security cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, The Attack in WSNs [10] is
    insecure in traditional LEACH. The Novel Trust based management LEACH protocol
    with RSA Cryptographic approach (NTM-LEACH-RSA) is recommended to provide network
    load security and balancing. In WSN, Security is a key study area. Therefore,
    security analysis is carried out independently to improve secure data transfer.
    The study''s main contribution is twofold. 1. In order to extend network lifetime
    and improve energy efficiency, elements including remaining energy, the density
    of adjacent nodes, trust value, energy domain, distance domain, environmental
    domain, and security domain are taken into consideration while calculating the
    number of dynamic conclusion CH nodes. 2. The interlocking protocol with the authentication
    protocol and RSA algorithm are used for secure data transmission. The remainder
    of the research study is structured as follows. The overview and analysis of current
    research approaches are presented in section II. In Section III the explicated
    protocol is NTM-LEACH-RSA. Performance analysis is presented and addressed in
    Section IV. In Section V, the proposed methodology''s conclusion is fully stated.
    2. Literature survey This section reviews few previous research work with this
    new proposed methodology and also discusses some of the shortcomings of conventional
    approaches. Huangshui et al. a brand-new trust-based, energy-efficient, and secure
    routing system. Adaptive direct, indirect, and energy trust values are used to
    calculate the overall trust value. It lowers routing overhead and improves packet
    transport dependability [11]. A GDTMS for F-IWSN was proposed by Weidong et al.
    A secure and reliable relay node was chosen using this TM-based secured routing
    strategy. However, in this approach [12], the quantity of some probabilities was
    negative. To provide secure data transfer and determine transmission duration,
    Reegan and Kabila presented a clustering-based innovative FCM clustering system
    and improved ElGamal encryption algorithm [13]. The techniques to key management,
    authentication, and trut management were studied by Gautam and Rajesh. Additionally,
    it contains the benefits, drawbacks, and unresolved problems of various current
    methods for delivering improved security solutions [14]. Using a designated credential
    validation technique, Wang et al. established a routing-driven key management
    strategy for the Internet of Things. It offers higher energy efficiency, storage
    capacity, and security. For decentralised IoT applications, it was ineffective,
    albeit [15]. Eko et al. conducted research on WSN''s pricing and security measures.
    It creates an entire data security framework and successfully conceals user-side
    information [16]. By utilising an ML categorization system, Putty and Lavadya
    provided an ideal cluster and reliable route in the development of routing and
    classification of invasion. RBP-DT strategy was used in this research to perform
    assault categorization and sensing [17]. An innovative and lightweight solution
    for information integrity with connected blocks in WSN was proposed by Francisco
    et al. On the other hand, no software cryptographic method is used [18]. To safeguard
    sensitive information in networks. A Hybrid cryptographic algorithm that lies
    on RC4, ECC, and SHA-256 was discovered by Seyyed et al. It was, however, more
    difficult and challenging to execute securely [19]. A realistic technique to trustworthy
    communication based on interbred trust was proposed by Tayyab Khan and Karan Singh
    to identify selfish nodes. To provide a specific channel between trusted nodes,
    a routing strategy was used with trust values of SNs, remaining energy, and route
    length [20]. Using the trust function in WSN, Vipul and Daniel proposed an effective
    clustering and CH election strategy. The CH election, which is based on the minimum
    region from BS and the SN''s residual energy, was completed. However, this solution
    uses the network''s inherent energy consumption and yields poor performance [21].
    A trustworthy and economically sound strategy to information collection was introduced
    by Mishall et al. It served mostly as protection from well-known attacks. However,
    this strategy does not contain security mechanisms to allow authentication requests.
    Additionally, it wasn''t appropriate for use at all times [22]. A recent review
    of IoT applications and cryptography methods was conducted by Saraswaran et al.
    In this survey, various technique kinds and their benefits and drawbacks were
    covered. But quantum secure encryption is where the researchers need to concentrate
    [23]. A safe rule against egotistical and impure attacks in clustered WSN was
    proposed by Hana Rhim et al. However, it significantly decreased the percentage
    of lost packets, which in turn decreased the prevalence of unauthorised number
    of nodes in the network [24]. Hussain Manoj Kumar looked at a wireless body area
    network protected key agreement mechanism. Better network lifetime is provided;
    however, security is not a priority [25]. 3. Proposed approach This proposed approach
    balances energy consumption and network lifetime extension using the RSA Cryptography
    (NTM-LEACH-RSA) with Novel Trust Based Management LEACH Protocol. This methodology
    comprises two stages that improve WSN security. Using the suggested NTM-LEACH
    technique, cluster formation and cluster head election are carried out in the
    initial phase. The RSA cryptography technique is employed in the second phase
    to protect data transmission and guarantee data integrity. Below is an illustration
    of this proposed methodology''s basic architecture. 3.1. Energy consumption model
    The model used for energy consumption is to represent the data transfer between
    the CH nodes and sensor nodes of the network, is clearly shown in Fig. 1 and also
    it displays the packet transaction between the Base Station(BS) and the CH node.
    The following describes how much energy is used when delivering a single bit of
    information between the sender and the acceptor. Etx(1,dt) = {1 Eerc + 1εfrsdt2
    where dt≤ dt0; (3.1) 1Eerc + 1εampdt4 where dt >dt0; In this case, the separation
    between the transmitting and receiving ends will be noted as dt. The receiving
    circuit receives energy as of one bit of receiving data, is represented by the
    symbol Eerc. Both the free space and multi-path attenuation propagation models''
    constant properties of amplification are shown by the symbols “frsand” and “amp.”
    Additionally, dt0 stands for both models'' distance threshold and is calculated
    as shown below: (3.2) dt0 = Square root (εfrs and εamp) Download : Download high-res
    image (481KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Architecture of proposed
    NTM-LEACH-RSA scheme. A free space transmission model is used, which is preferable,
    if the transmission distance between the sensor nodes is dt dt0. Furthermore,
    if the WSN''s SN-to-SN transmission distance is dt > dt0, the energy used for
    data packet transmission will quickly rise. It utilises the path fading channel
    model with dt4 enhancements. At the receiving end, it is predicted that one bit
    of data uses the following amount of energy: (3.3) Erx (1) = 1Eerc During the
    compression and aggregation processes, one bit of data''s power consumption is
    calculated as follows: (3.4) Edx (1) = 1EDG EDG stands for energy consumed when
    compressing one bit of information. 3.2. Adequate number of CH The two approaches
    used in this proposed NTM-LEACH methodology are separate processes. The first
    technique involves CH Selection and clustering, and the second involves data transmission.
    Which is a protocol''s fixed mode of operation. Data packet transmission is split
    into two phases in this fixed process. The typical SN in the cluster will initially
    acquire data and deliver it into CH. The second stage involves the CH node compressing
    the accepted data and sending it together with routing instructions from CH to
    BS. Assuming that the entire amount of CH in the relevant detecting zone is c,
    the second step involves acquiring the necessary amount of CH by reducing the
    energy used in the data transmission procedure. The total amount of energy used
    during data exchange is indicated as given below: ETEC = 1 (Nd*Erx(1) + Nd*EDG
    + Nd*Etx(1,dt)) (3.5) =1(EercNd + EDGNd + c εampdt 4toBS + εfrs ND R2/2πc) In
    this ETEC is denoted for the total amount of energy is used when data packets
    are being transmitted, Nd stands for the number of SN''s in the network, and the
    distance between CH nd BS is denoted by dttoBS. When the chosen area is square,
    R represents the length of each side. Since the resultant ETEC to c from the equation
    above is 0, the appropriate number of CH that efficiently minimises the expenditure
    of energy during the transmission is computed using the given below equation.
    (3.6) copt = Sqrt (NA/2π) * Sqrt (Efrs/Eamp) *R/dt2toBS Although the CH will automatically
    reduces the energy exhaustion of the SNs in the network ass the total number of
    execution rounds rises, this will result in an increase in the overall number
    of dead or inactive nodes. Additionally, Constant Variable Copt is absurd. Because
    of this, the proposed methodology uses this constant variable as a more accurate
    criterion to determine if the selected node will actually serve as a CH. N stands
    for the total number of active sensor nodes in the final round in equation (3.6)
    above, and dttoBS stands for the average value of the CH node elected in the final
    round from the BS. As a result, the total number of CH is changed during data
    transfer in order to dynamically reduce energy consumption. 3.3. Trust value estimation
    The Trust value is one of the key factors in the CH election scheme according
    to the presented methodology. The actual round of CH dispersion to SN in the cluster
    examines the prospective CH nodes as the final round''s trust value. The trust
    value is evaluated in this case as follows: (3.7) Tab = E [ Rtab ] = E [ Beta
    (φb + βb) ] = φb/ (φb + βb) Here, Rtab represents the reputation evaluation of
    sensor nodes a to node b, and Tab symbolises the trust value of Rtab''s mathematical
    expression. From the perspective of node a, b represents node φb cooperative behaviour,
    and b represents node βb non-cooperative behaviour. This assessment technique
    effectively increases the security of every sensor node in the network to prevent
    the failure of a particular function node. The trust value impacting factor The
    CH election procedure is handled by Iftv.The evaluation is as follows: (3.8) Iftv
    = tva/ tva-avg where tva stands for the final ARC average trust value of all SNs
    in the cluster, and tva-avg stands for the actual trust value of node a to the
    real CH. The energy and distance domains are also carefully considered while using
    this suggested NTM-LEACH protocol to choose CH from a certain cluster in the network.
    By adhering to the conditions listed below, the CH election in the present round
    for the threshold function is estimated. The threshold of an is estimated as follows
    if a belongs to V: (3.9) T(a) = {K/ 1-K (r mod 1/K) (wegy * (Eres(a)/Eegy(a))
    +wdt * (dtBS(a)/dtBS-max) + wenmt *Ekenmt (a) +wtv * Rtv (a)} Additionally, the
    threshold value of an is equal to zero if the a does not belong to V. Here, Eres(a)
    stands for the energy level of node an at the moment. Eegy(a) denotes the node
    a''s initial energy level, dtBS-max denotes the maximum area between SN and BS,
    and dtBS(a) denotes the node a''s distance from BS. K represents the likelihood
    that the sensor node is SN to CH. A group of SN is V which haven''t turned into
    CHs in the previous round, and r stands for the present round. Dt, Weng, Wenmt
    and Wtv stand for the domains of power, distance, environment and security. These
    domains need to satisfy the following expression, (3.10) weng+ wdt+wenmt+wtv =
    1 The Proposed NTM-LEACH-RSA Protocol is expreseed step by step as shown below.
    STEP 1: The CH election and stabilisation are carried out immediately in the first
    round. Each sensor node in this cluster sends data to the BS via a control packet
    sent via CH. STEP 2: Based on information received from BS, BS estimates and broadcasts
    the copt. STEP 3: Each cluster node in the cluster broadcasts the control packet
    to the SN in a specific area. Verifies the quantity of control packets received
    concurrently with the total number of nearby nodes. STEP 4: According to equation
    3.9''s predicted threshold value based on energy domain, distance domain, environmental
    domain, and security domain, each cluster member in the cluster is qualified to
    be a CH. The main thing it looks for is whether the chosen sensor node turns into
    a CH in a real round. STEP 5: Stabilisation is completed and it depends on the
    proposed NTM-LEACH-RSA protocol. Sensor node sends data and control packets to
    the CH with the information it has collected and its most recent information,
    which includes the trust value. The Data is delivered to BS after the compressed
    by CH. STEP 6: Redo the steps from 2 to 5. STEP 7: When multiple nodes die, the
    algorithm comes to a conclusion. Each sensor node in the network has an equal
    chance of acting as a CH when the suggested NTM-LEACH-RSA protocol is used, balancing
    the energy dissipation among nodes. Time is divided into numerous rounds in this
    situation. As a result, by adhering to certain restrictions, each node in the
    cluster serves as the CH in each round. The following restrictions, which are
    explicitly stated in the proposed NTM-LEACH-RSA protocol''s procedure, must be
    met by each node in the cluster in order for it to qualify as a CH means under
    the proposed methodology. Additionally, asymmetric cryptography is a preferable
    option for transmitting data in a secure manner. Therefore, both the encryption
    and decryption processes use the RSA method. This particular RSA algorithm uses
    a public key encryption method. This encryption algorithm is safe to use. Key
    generation and the encryption/decryption process are the two primary elements
    of RSA Cryptography. 3.3.1. Key generation Key generation for encrypting and decrypting
    the shared data takes place at this stage. The algorithm used to generate RSA
    keys is described below. RSA Key Generation Algorithm. STEP 1: Initialization
    Action: Key Generation. STEP 2: Select two large prime numbers D and J. Where
    D ≠ J STEP 3: Estimate the value of L. Where L = D *J, n is a module for both
    public and private keys. STEP 4: Estimate the public key ∂ (L). Where, ∂ (L) =
    (D-1) * (J-1) STEP 5: Select the Integer I by satisfying the following condition
    that 1<a<∂ (L), where a and ∂ (L) has no divisor except. gcd (a, ∂ (L)) = 1 STEP
    6: Estimate the value of satisfying the following constraints, Sa = 1 + k ∂ (L)
    STEP 7: Conside sa as private key. STEP 8: Termination. In this case, the sink
    node has access to the public key while both the CH and the cluster member can
    use the secret key. Pass the arguments to the functions once the key generation
    procedure is finished so they can use the generated key to efficiently value for
    both cypher text and plain text. The following steps need be taken to encrypt
    the data: RSA Encryption key for Pseudo-code. STEP 1: Initialization Process:
    Encryption STEP 2: Sensor node in the network hold public key (a,L), Where a is
    a public key STEP 3: Cif = (M Ʌ a) mod (L) STEP 4: Encrypt the packets, STEP 5:
    Termination. To ensure secure data transfer, the plain text is changed during
    encryption into cypher text. After the encryption procedure is finished, the cypher
    text is converted to plain text through the decryption process. RSA Encryption
    key for Pseudo-code. STEP 1: Initialization Process: Decryption STEP 2: BS hold
    private key (sa, L), where sa is private key STEP 3: M = (Cif Ʌ sa) mod (L) STEP
    4: Dencrypt the packets, STEP 5: Termination. BS is responsible for this RSA key
    generating scheme. Key distribution and node authentication are subsequently carried
    out via the interlock protocol and the authentication sent by network sensor nodes,
    respectively. The SN is either refused or accepted for secure data transmission
    if it is invalid. This RSA cryptography algorithm ensures the secure and safe
    transmission of sensitive data. 4. Performance analysis The proposed methodologies
    performance analysis is briefly described as follows. 4.1. The number of packets
    is compared with the proposed NTM-LEACH-RSA and without trust value under malicious
    attacks In the proposed NTM-LEACH-RSA, the number of packets transmitted with
    and without a trust value are clearly compared in Fig. 2. Assume that 5% of the
    network''s nodes are malevolent. Without the estimation of trust value, the process
    of 50–150 rounds is significantly slowed down. As a result, some packet loss occurs.
    After 100 rounds have been completed, the packet failure tends to stop being justified
    as a malicious attack. Fig. 2 only shows 11 rounds for demonstration purposes.
    This methodology''s trust value is added so that it can quickly identify malicious
    nodes in the initial stages of attacks. As a result, it successfully prevents
    the rogue node from becoming the cluster head, which prevents packet loss by default.

    without trust value. 4.2. Energy consumption Energy used during packet transmission
    is all that is meant by the term “energy consumption.\" Energy Consumption is
    as follows, (4.1) EC = Pr * (t/1000) where t is the length of time over which
    the energy was used and Pr stands for power in watts. Fig. 3 shows that when compared
    to the current LEACH, Integrated LEACH (I-LEACH), and LEACH with Target Location
    Constraints (LEACH-TLC) techniques, the proposed NTM-LEACH-RSA methodology uses
    less energy during data packet transmission. Download : Download high-res image
    (253KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. this graph shows the comparison
    between the Energy Consumption. 4.3. Lifetime of network It is calculated using
    the time that has passed after a communication began, the time that has passed
    since the active node and the receiver''s communication link have broken, and
    other factors. The estimation is shown below: (4.2) NL = Σm a =1 L CHa where,
    LCHa indicates the network lifetime of ath CH. A comparison of network lifespan
    analysis is shown in Fig. 4. Here, the suggested NTM-LEACH-RSA methodology is
    contrasted with the LEACH, I-LEACH, and LEACH-TLC methodologies. When compared
    to other existing methods, the proposed methodology has increased the longevity
    of the network. As a result, the initial sensor node in the network might emit
    data packets for a long time. Download : Download high-res image (264KB) Download

    Packet delivery ratio It is the proportion of packets received at the destination
    SN to the data sent from the source SN. Percentages are used to describe this
    estimate. According to this PDR''s assessed value, (4.3) PDR = 1/n * DS/SN * 100%
    where, SN and DS are estimated as follows, (4.4) DS = Σna=1 Xa and SN = Σna=1Ya
    The PDR is illustrated and Estimated with the above equation and shown in Fig.

    to LEACH, I-LEACH, and LEACH-TLC methods, the PDR is high. the quantity of information
    a system can process in a given amount of time is directly related to the PDR.
    4.5. Residual energy The amount of energy left in each SN is calculated by adding
    the power used while it was in each condition. (4.5) RE = UT / Ld * Dc Fig. 6
    demonstrates that each sensor node in the network has a sizable amount of energy
    left over when contrasting the suggested NTM-LEACH-RSA methodology to the existing
    LEACH, I-LEACH, and LEACH-TLC methods. According to the performance study, the
    proposed NTM-LEACH-RSA technique ultimately outperformed the similar present approaches.

    Fig. 6. Residual energy – comparison graph. 5. Conclusion To balance energy consumption
    and extending network lifetime, the NTM-LEACH-RSA protocol, based on novel trust
    management, is introduced. Cluster construction and cluster head election, as
    well as cryptography, are two important stages of this methodology for improving
    security in WSN. Here, the proposed NTM-LEACH technique is used for cluster construction
    and cluster head election. Additionally, the threshold function value, distance
    and density of nearby nodes, and trust value are taken into consideration when
    choosing the cluster head. Additionally, the value of the threshold function is
    calculated using the energy domain and the distance domain. The RSA cryptography
    algorithm is used in the cryptographic phase to secure data communication and
    guarantee data integrity throughout the conversation. The final component of this
    methodology''s results covers packet delivery ratio, energy consumption, network
    lifetime, residual energy of sensor nodes in each cycle, and with and without
    trust value. The proposed NTM-LEACH-RSA approach outperforms the already used
    LEACH, I-LEACH, and LEACH-TLC approaches in this study. Longer network lifetime
    and increased energy consumption are the effects. In comparison to current methods,
    it also improves packet delivery ratio by 97% and residual energy by 97%. Future
    plans call for the usage of mobile sink nodes, which rely on a variety of meta-heuristic
    methods to reduce energy consumption. We also plan to research and assess the
    key effects of different distribution strategies on the security of WSN routing.

    Cloud computing is a transformative technology in IT infrastructure and resource
    management services. It operates on the XaaS model, offering various services
    like Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure
    as a Service (IaaS). Cloud computing''s pay-per-use model allows users to pay
    for resources based on their specific needs, ensuring Quality of Service (QoS)
    and privacy protection. Leading companies in the industry, such as Microsoft,
    Google, and IBM, have invested heavily in building data centers to provide cloud
    computing services. These data centers serve as the backbone of cloud infrastructure,
    hosting a wide range of tools, programs, and application development frameworks.
    Through cloud computing, customers can access these resources using a web browser,
    eliminating the need for local infrastructure and enabling remote access to computational
    services. The underlying principle of cloud computing is resource sharing among
    remote computers. By pooling and efficiently allocating computational resources,
    cloud providers ensure that businesses can access the necessary resources on-demand.
    The payment mechanism in cloud computing is closely tied to resource utilization,
    allowing customers to pay based on their actual usage rather than a fixed subscription
    fee(Boopathi, Siva Kumar, et al., 2023; Boopathi, Venkatesan, et al., 2023; Reddy
    et al., 2023; Sampath et al., 2022). Quality of Service (QoS) is a critical aspect
    of cloud computing. It encompasses factors such as performance, reliability, availability,
    and security, ensuring that cloud services meet the expectations and requirements
    of users. Privacy protection is another significant concern, as cloud computing
    involves the storage and processing of sensitive data. Cloud providers must implement
    robust security measures and adhere to privacy regulations to safeguard user information.
    In summary, cloud computing has revolutionized the IT industry by providing dynamic
    resource provisioning through a variety of services. By leveraging the benefits
    of cloud infrastructure, businesses can access computational resources on-demand,
    while the pay-per-use model ensures efficient resource utilization. Quality of
    Service (QoS) and privacy protection are vital considerations in the design and
    operation of cloud computing systems, ensuring reliable and secure service delivery
    to users (Alhasnawi et al., 2020; Sheikhi et al., 2015a). Cloud computing has
    witnessed a significant migration of customers due to its numerous advantages.
    It offers online services delivered over the Internet, enabling users to access
    a wide range of capabilities and resources. One of the key aspects of cloud computing
    is cloud storage services, which provide on-demand computing capabilities, flexible
    pay-as-you-go pricing models, and the ability to host multiple users on shared
    physical infrastructure. Cloud storage services empower consumers with virtually
    unlimited computational power. Platforms like Google Drive, Google Photos, Amazon
    Cloud, and others allow users to rent computing resources on an hourly basis.
    These services cater to various needs, including online file backup, computer
    picture editing, digital video tools, integration with social media platforms
    like Twitter, image album creation, web antivirus, application processing, word
    processing, travel and management software, and computer-based e-commerce solutions.
    Cloud computing is built on a virtualized infrastructure that combines data computation,
    storage, and software resources into a unified network and server environment.
    It leverages technologies such as clustering, grid computing, and cloud computing
    to aggregate resources and provide a seamless and unified view of the system.
    This unified picture allows users to access and utilize a diverse set of computing
    resources without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. By embracing
    cloud computing, businesses and individuals can benefit from the scalability,
    flexibility, and cost-effectiveness it offers. The ability to access a wide range
    of online services and resources provides users with unprecedented convenience
    and productivity. Cloud computing continues to evolve and innovate, driving digital
    transformation and enabling new possibilities in various industries (Luján et
    al., 2019; Yigit et al., 2014). Continue Reading References Follow Reference Ahmad

    aquaculturePrecision agriculture 1. Introduction Aquaculture refers to the farming
    of aquatic species under controlled conditions. In aquaculture, keeping water
    quality at the desired level, providing proper nutrition, promoting breeding,
    and preventing diseases and predators are the main factors that result in successful
    farming [1]. Aquaculture production enjoyed a growth rate of at least three percent
    during 2011-2019 [2]. This is due to the growing trend of the world population
    and limited wild aquatic resources. However, there are still many challenges in
    aquaculture that need to be addressed [3]. Maximizing the yield via efficient
    use of resources is one of the main challenges that could be addressed by precision
    aquaculture [4, 5]. Precision aquaculture tries to achieve its goal, i.e. ensuring
    profitability, sustainability and protection of the environment, by incorporating
    different innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the
    Internet of Things (IoT) in aquaculture [5]. In other words, this type of aquaculture
    converts traditional experienced based practices to knowledge based with the aid
    of state-of-the-art technologies [6]. Smart aquaculture, also known as intelligent
    aquaculture or digital aquaculture [7, 8], is a concept that involves the use
    of advanced technologies and data-driven approaches to improve the efficiency,
    sustainability, and productivity of aquaculture operations. Smart aquaculture
    seeks to integrate modern technologies, such as sensors, artificial intelligence,
    and the internet of things, into the management and operations of aquaculture
    systems [9]. IoT is the process of enabling different devices to communicate with
    each other over a network [10, 11]. In Fig. 1, the main components of an IoT aquaculture
    system are illustrated. It is possible to have a variety of IoT architectures
    based on the way different parts are implemented and work together. Download :

    show how components of an IoT system interact. The environment is sensed and acted
    upon by sensing and actuating nodes. A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is formed
    by the nodes and gateways in the system. The IoT system''s local devices that
    process data locally are considered edge devices. Local edge servers, cloud servers,
    or both may host the data of the IoT system. The IoT system would be able to be
    interacted with by the final user through user interfaces. Actuators and sensors
    are placed in the physical environment so that they can either measure different
    water parameters or affect the environment in a specific manner. A gateway acts
    as a transceiver of data between sensor/actuator nodes and other parts of the
    IoT system with the help of a gateway. IoT devices are usually connected to a
    Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) by which all network communication happens. An example
    of a WSN can be seen in Fig. 1, highlighted and tagged in light blue color, by
    combining sensors, actuators, and a gateway. To further process the data gathered
    from the environment, different architectures may combine cloud or edge servers.
    Modern IoT devices are often capable of performing some level of computation,
    and in some architectures, part of the computation is handled by local servers
    on-premises. In computing terms, edge computing refers to localized processing.
    Any device that performs local data processing is included in this category. Fig.
    1 shows an example of edge devices highlighted and tagged in light green. Edge
    computing has the advantage of enabling IoT systems to run locally without being
    connected to the internet. Cloud servers, on the other hand, tend to be more powerful
    and easier to maintain. Nevertheless, IoT systems can be accessed by end users
    in a variety of ways, such as over the internet or offline from the local network.
    Depending on the platform and software used, users could be presented with a variety
    of user interfaces for viewing and controlling their environment. It has to be
    noted that aquaculture can be performed in different environments both inland
    or off-land such as tanks, ponds, rivers, fish pens, etc. Likewise, different
    species are cultured in different aquacultures. The cultural environment and type
    of species affect the design and choice of hardware of IoT systems. The design
    of an IoT system for Aquaculture in a sea pen would be different from another
    inland counterpart. Likewise, the sensitivity of species affects the design and
    choice of hardware in IoT systems. The design and implementation of IoT systems
    in aquaculture have many challenges that need to be addressed. The following steps
    were performed to search for literature regarding the implementation of IoT in
    aquaculture. Efforts have been made to search the Web of Science for all relevant
    manuscripts in the last five years, i.e., 2018-2022. Then, two sets of keywords
    were queried including “IoT aquaculture” and “monitoring water quality IoT aquaculture”.
    Moreover, the same processes were performed in the Google Scholar service. A total
    of 153 manuscripts were collected. After removing duplicates and filtering non-relevant
    manuscripts based on their abstract, a total of 78 manuscripts was selected for
    review in this study. A further categorization of these manuscripts was performed
    while reading the contents. Each paper was labeled as either review, prototype,
    or proposal/laboratory scale prototype. Manuscripts in the review category cover
    review manuscripts found in the literature. Manuscripts in the proposal category
    cover manuscripts reporting the proposed system in the prototype stage and experimental
    evaluation of the systems on a laboratory scale. Finally, manuscripts in the prototype
    category cover manuscripts where a system was implemented in the intended aquaculture
    site. Fig. 2 depicts the percentage share of each category. As can be seen, 17
    percent of the manuscripts were articles reporting a prototyped system. Download

    based on their type into three categories including review, prototype, and product.
    Table 1 summarizes reviews related to aquaculture/agriculture along with their
    most relevant keywords. The main focus of aquaculture reviews is the use of emerging
    and innovative technologies in aquaculture. However, there has been some discussion
    of some general agricultural challenges [12]. To this end, a review focusing specifically
    on IoT challenges in aquaculture would be beneficial to the literature. Table

    Section 2 provides a brief introduction to aquaculture and the IoT. Using the
    literature as a guide, section 3 categorizes the current challenges associated
    with IoT in aquaculture. In addition, this section discusses possible solutions
    to the challenges using the literature. In section 4, discusses some potential
    approaches to aquaculture challenges in the foreseeable future. The paper will
    conclude in section 5 with discussions regarding other IoT concerns in aquaculture.
    2. Background This section introduces different types of aquacultures and then
    highlights important factors that are essential in the design of IoT in aquaculture.
    It is followed by the introduction of major components of IoT. 2.1. Aquaculture
    Three distinct types of aquaculture systems have been identified, namely intensive,
    semi-intensive, and extensive. An intensive system aims to maximize culture output
    with a minimum amount of water consumption. As a result, a large volume of aquaculture
    species is cultured in a comparatively small body of water. All of the requirements
    such as providing nutrition and maintaining water quality by treatment will be
    fulfilled by farmers to increase productivity in the shortest time. It has to
    be noted that due to the high costs in intensive systems, the choice of the species
    to be cultured is also based on their market value. The opposite is true for extensive
    systems that require minimal human intervention. These systems usually cultivate
    species in large bodies of water with low densities. While these systems are not
    costly, their harvest yield is very low. As a middle ground between the other
    two systems, semi-intensive systems treat water and provide nutrients to species
    during the culturing phase in a moderate manner [20]. Incorporating IoT into aquaculture
    aims to reduce the cost of intensive systems in the aquaculture industry. It should
    be understood, however, that adapting IoT could also cost farmers, which is why
    it is crucial to do so based on the specific needs of each system. Water quality
    is the main determinant factor in aquaculture regardless of the type of species
    [21]. Most of the proposed IoT systems in the literature are focusing on monitoring
    water quality factors such as temperature, pH, alkalinity, and nitrate level [18,
    [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]] A review of the literature has revealed
    that temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH are the most studied water quality
    parameters in the literature [18]. Depending on the type of species, there are
    predefined acceptable ranges for each of the water quality factors [29]. Maintaining
    water quality within the acceptable ranges are necessary for achieving a successful
    yield from an aquaculture farm [16]. Moreover, minimizing the mortality rate and
    maximizing yield can be achieved by maintaining quality factors at optimum levels.
    [30]. 2.1.1. Type of species Inhabitant factors vary depending on the aquatic
    species. Although some species are known for their resistance to environmental
    factors, some are also sensitive. It is known, for instance, that Tilapia is one
    of the easiest fish to culture as they show high tolerance to changing environmental
    factors such as water temperature [20]. A study on 182 shrimp farms revealed that
    the vulnerability of these species to diseases is the main concern of the farmers.
    Consequently, farmers restricted their visitors to their farms as a precautionary
    measure [31]. Incorporating IoT in farms with sensitive species could result in
    a reduction of human interaction on the farm and thus reducing the risks. To this
    end, designing and implementing IoT systems requires an understanding of the species''
    resistance. A system with higher accuracy and reliability is required for more
    sensitive species, as opposed to species with low resistance. In addition, the
    species'' population density also directly influences the design of different
    IoT systems. As species density increases, so will the complexity and cost of
    IoT systems. It has been shown that the application of proper husbandry methods
    could reduce stress in aquaculture [32]. Stress could reduce the growth rate of
    the species and also could weaken their immune system [33]. Reducing stress, due
    to its direct relation with fatality, growth rate, and increasing the vulnerability
    of species to diseases, is of high importance in aquaculture. Biomass statistic
    demands calculating the weight of the species. Traditionally, it will be done
    by catching species and weighting them which is known to be a labor-intensive
    process that is stressful for species [34]. Moreover, water quality parameters
    such as temperature and pH are also reported as stressors [35], [36], [37]. The
    utilization of IoT in aquaculture could reduce sources of stress by keeping water
    quality at an optimal level and also reducing human intervention. For example,
    the application of image processing for predicting fish weights improved the growth
    rate of fish by 47% [34]. The application of IoT could reduce human presence in
    the farm and thus reduces the chance of contamination. Moreover, IoT could facilitate
    faster detection of contamination, which could lead to early treatment procedures
    and thus an increase in survival rates. 2.1.2. Accessibility of the Farm There
    are different farming options in aquaculture with different environmental factors
    that directly affect the types and designs of the IoT systems. For example, access
    to power grids and internet connection on a farm is one of the crucial factors
    that affect the design of IoT. Traditionally, farms are located far from power
    grids [38]. In contrast, hatcheries are usually located in urban areas, with indoor
    tanks and usually access to environmental control equipment [6]. A reliable source
    of electricity and access to the internet could also be expected to be available.
    Some marine aquaculture farms are located in the sea where there is no access
    to power nor the internet. Moreover, some of the farms are located in environments
    with harsh weather conditions [39]. Marine aquaculture demands more maintenance
    and care in comparison to freshwater aquaculture as the existence of salt and
    its accumulation over time could cause corrosion to electrical equipment [40].
    Basically, the related cost of the IoT system is expected to increase with the
    distance of the farm from the urban area where the power grid and the internet
    connection are accessible. On the other side, hatcheries are expected to deal
    with more sensitive species compared to other types of farms. Therefore, utilization
    of more reliable sensors and actuators may be needed in comparison to other types
    of farms. In other words, the choice of equipment and design of the IoT system
    is dependent on many factors. 2.2. Internet of Things In IoT systems, the architecture
    of the system refers to how different components are categorized into different
    layers. Different IoT architectures are proposed in literature such as three-layered,
    four-layered, etc. [41]. Nevertheless, three-layered architecture is the most
    basic architecture that covers the basic functions of IoT [41]. The choice of
    architecture usually depends on the complexity of the IoT system. It would be
    more beneficial to adapt more sophisticated architectures to IoT systems that
    are more sophisticated. The three-layered model consists of three layers namely
    perception, network, and application layers. The perception layer contains nodes
    including sensors and actuators that interact with the physical environment. Next
    is the network layer that enables the IoT system with the transmission and processing
    of data to the next layer. Finally, the application layer is the topmost layer
    that delivers services to the end user [42]. In the following, the building blocks
    of the IoT system are presented concerning the three-layered architecture. 2.2.1.
    Perception layer According to the three-layered architecture, nodes are contained
    in the perception layer. A node can either be a sensor that monitors the environment
    or an actuator that changes the environment. In addition to the sensor/actuator,
    other components of a node are the subsystems for data processing, communication,
    and power supply. Nowadays most sensors are operating on voltage with very low
    current draw. To this end, IoT systems with battery-powered sensors are a practical
    solution in some scenarios. A) Sensors Sensors are the main hardware constituent
    of any IoT system. Sensors empower IoT systems to gather environmental data in
    quantitative values [43]. There are different sensors available in the market
    with different features that affect their price. Similar sensors with different
    qualities may have the same accuracy but different prices. For example, industrial
    sensors are designed to be heavily used in harsh environments while laboratory-made
    sensors are meant for regular usage in a controlled environment. Both industrial
    and laboratory build types are expected to have high accuracy. Available sensors
    in the market range from industrial sensors that are enjoying high accuracy and
    build quality to hobby sensors with reasonable accuracy and weak build quality.
    Usually, there is a direct relationship between price and build quality of sensors.
    The higher the price, the higher the accuracy and robustness. Fig. 3 depicts the
    relationship between price and accuracy (℃) for different temperature sensors
    available in the Malaysian market. As it can be seen sensors with higher accuracy
    (larger radius) are more expensive. It has to be noted that many sensors in the
    market are priced based on additional features and therefore one may find low/similar
    accuracy sensors with different prices. For example, in Fig. 3, five different
    prices were available for sensors with an accuracy of 0.5. Nevertheless, the aforementioned
    relation between price and accuracy holds as before. A general trend in the sensor
    market is that high-accuracy sensors are becoming more affordable over the course
    of time and the accuracy of the sensors in the market is more or less the same.

    Fig. 3. Contrasts the price and the accuracy of different temperature sensors
    available in the market. Each circle depicts a sensor with a radius equal to 1/accuracy.
    Related data could be viewed in supplementary materials. While cheap sensors are
    attributed to lower accuracy, it does not mean that they are not useful. Cost-benefit
    analysis may suggest acquiring sensors with lower build types depending on the
    characteristics of the aquaculture environment. It may be worth replacing sensors
    with new ones in regular short periods and saving on maintenance costs instead
    of maintaining a sensor with a high-quality build type. Nevertheless, if the aim
    is to minimize the costs, the choice of cheap sensors could be considered depending
    on the type of environment and sensitivity of the aquaculture species. A cluster
    of sensors with reasonable prices could be seen in Fig. 3. Error rate, i.e., accuracy,
    of these temperature sensors is around ±0.5 °C of that is arguably good for most
    aquaculture use cases. Additionally, incorporation of edge computing and different
    algorithms have demonstrated the ability to improve sensor accuracy. [44], [45],
    [46]. As water quality is the most determinant factor in aquaculture, most of
    the IoT projects for aquaculture used a variety of sensors for monitoring water
    quality [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. These sensors cover a wide variety
    of measurements such as Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, water level, etc.
    However, other types of sensors like cameras are also used in the aquaculture
    environment. An example is the incorporation of cameras for analyzing the fish
    growth rate [34]. A) Actuators Actuators are the way through which an IoT system
    may change the environment. Activation of an alarm or powering aerator(s) are
    examples of how actuators may be used in aquaculture [43]. While the incorporation
    of actuators in aquaculture increases the complexity of the IoT systems, it could
    reduce the need for human intervention and thus has the potential of reducing
    labor costs as well. Farming of sensitive species demands precise implementation
    of husbandry methods over the course of culturing period. Therefore, high costs
    and risk of failure are attributed to this type of culture. These costs are mainly
    due to maintaining an optimal culture environment that demands continuous monitoring
    and treatment to be done by a human agent. IoT systems are capable of performing
    such tasks accurately without human intervention and thus reducing attributed
    costs. An example would be monitoring the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) level and turning
    on the aerator if it drops below a predefined level. Labor cost has the highest
    share among operating costs in aquaculture. In particular, traditional feeding
    activity is labor intensive. Moreover, it has been shown that more than 60% of
    feeding material eventually changes into toxic compounds that reduce water quality
    [47]. The incorporation of automated feeding tools could reduce farms operating
    costs in the first place. Additionally, it can release the exact required amount
    of food and thus reduces waste as well. The actuator''s role in such a case might
    be in the form of an automated dispatcher that precisely releases a predefined
    amount of food or other physiochemical substances to the culturing environment.
    Drones can also be utilized to perform feeding tasks in large culturing environments
    [13]. In a proposed prototype a set of sensors were used to control the quality
    factors of water. The proposed system is capable to increase the level of DO in
    water using aerators in cases where DO drops below a predefined level [48]. To
    keep water quality levels in the optimal range for farming, adding freshwater
    and increasing the DO level of the culture environment is reported to be crucial
    [49] . Their proposed system automated a water pump and aerators by that freshwater
    addition and increase of water DO was performed. Likewise, a propeller was controlled
    to increase the DO of water if sensory measurement shows a large deviation from
    the predefined acceptable value [50]. In another work, a prototype was proposed
    for placement and intelligent control of an array of aerators in fish ponds [51].
    Each aerator was able to operate automatically based on the latest read of the
    sensors placed in different locations of the pond. In another work, six different
    water quality parameters were monitored and maintained within the desired level
    with the aid of multiple actuators including a heater, sodium bicarbonate distributer,
    solenoid valve, and water pump [52]. It has to be noted that usually actuator
    devices in aquaculture are demanding more power compared to sensory devices. Therefore,
    reliance on automated actuators in an IoT system would only be possible if the
    availability of power supply requirements for the aerator is assured. The intelligent
    activation of actuators could be accomplished by integrating various intelligent
    methods. This is because data from different sources will be collected and fed
    into a model which would activate the actuators. By doing so, the IoT system would
    be able to operate more efficiently [53]. 2.2.2. Network layer In a three-layered
    architecture, the network layer covers all networking between the gateway node,
    as a transceiver, and the cloud. However, there is another type of network communication
    that can happen between IoT nodes, which are sensors, actuators, and gateway.
    This is known in the literature as Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN)
    or sometimes Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) [54]. In this network, different nodes
    could communicate with each other to transfer data from a node to the gateway
    node of the system. The main characteristic of IoT devices is that they are usually
    low-powered devices optimized to operate on battery. To increase the battery life
    span, energy consumption needs to be minimal. As a result, low power consumption
    becomes a determining factor in developing networking protocols. Nevertheless,
    besides power consumption, the distance of the nodes from each other and the transfer
    rate are the other two crucial factors that differentiate protocols. Fig. 4 compares
    different protocols based on the operating distance and transfer rate. The vertical
    axis shows the maximum distance that a given protocol can transfer data. The higher
    a protocol is placed on the vertical axis, the farther it can transmit data. Whereas,
    the horizontal axis shows the transfer rate of a given protocol. The protocols
    on the right side of the plot are capable of transferring more data in comparison
    to the ones on the left side of the axis. Download : Download high-res image (202KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Comparison of different communication
    protocols based on the transmission rate and maximum operating distance. Values
    on both axes are replaced with the logarithm of the actual value. A set of marine
    sensors was used to provide farmers with real-time environment information [25].
    A Total of 10 water quality sensors were submerged into the water along 8 km of
    a river with aid of 10 buoys. A LoRaWan-enabled weather station was set up to
    collect weather information. The LoRaWan is a low-power wide area networking (LPWAN)
    protocol specifically designed for low-powered IoT devices. A maximum of 20% packet
    loss of LoRaWAN was reported and that was mainly due to the physical obstacles
    between nodes and gateway. The researcher reported that as the loss occurred from
    time to time, and they were able to fill loss packets by incorporating different
    forms of interpolation. They reported that further reduction in packet loss, i.e.
    as low as 5%, could be achieved by incorporating the message acknowledgment technique
    [55]. 2.2.3. Application Layer (Platform/software) IoT platforms are connecting
    users with the core of IoT devices by introducing Application Programming Interfaces
    (APIs) [56]. Due to challenges that are inherent to IoT in aquaculture, the choice
    of using the right platform needs special care. The whole IoT system should be
    able to continue its work even if there is no internet connection. In other words,
    even If there is no access to the cloud a platform should be able to work offline.
    All the necessary decision makings and automation should continue without any
    reliance on the internet. There must be the ability to perform the required critical
    analysis offline. This is because the transfer of data to the cloud may need to
    be postponed for an unknown period [56] due to the internet connectivity issues
    that may occur. In an ideal IoT system collection of related data is of great
    importance. Analyzing data could result in revealing hidden insights from a farm.
    However, collected data may only be used for visualization purposes and sometimes
    comparing current data against a predefined threshold. The data may be simply
    stored and visualized using simple custom software or a dedicated platform on
    the cloud. The internet is an essential component of cloud solutions, even though
    they offer worldwide accessibility and low maintenance costs. This could be a
    challenge in aquaculture where the farm location is in a remote area. Moreover,
    in cases where a cloud platform is in use any disconnection from the cloud could
    result in catastrophic results. It is specifically true in situations where controlling
    the environment is supposed to be done with the IoT system. Traditionally it is
    assumed that nodes are lacking processing power therefore the collected data need
    to be stored and analyzed in a dedicated device known as a hub/gateway (see Fig.
    1) [56]. Hub can be implemented as a local server, a cloud server, or a hybrid
    where two local and cloud servers are present in topology. Platforms based on
    local and hybrid topologies are able to perform even when there is no cloud connection
    and therefore might be a good solution for aquaculture farms. Developing a software
    platform or customizing existing open source platforms for aquaculture would not
    be affordable. It is true that most of the expenses will be incurred during production
    of the first version of any software. In other words, there is almost no cost
    for the second copy of a software except a reasonable maintenance cost [57]. Therefore,
    ordering a custom-made software platform would not be a practical solution specifically
    for small farm businesses. A possible solution would be sharing and dividing costs
    between multiple farms [25]. Another option for the small business farmers which
    could be even cheaper is to either subscribe to one of the available cloud based
    solutions or make use of an open source platform on-premise [58, 59]. 3. Challenges
    of IoT in Aquaculture Using literature as a guide, we identified two major categories
    of challenges. The first category (Common challenges) includes general problems
    that may occur for most IoT systems including aquaculture. The second category
    (Specific Challenges) covers specific challenges raised by different aspects of
    aquaculture, such as scarcity of electricity, inadequate communication coverage,
    harsh environment, and inadequate technology [39]. 3.1. Common challenges The
    permanent contact of sensors with water, which is usually polluted, reduces the
    accuracy of readings over time. To overcome this issue, the literature either
    suggests regular maintenance, i.e., cleaning, of the probes [24, 60, 61] or in
    some cases special mechanism was developed for automatic probe cleaning [62],
    [63], [64]. The incorporation of a sensor cleaning mechanism increases the overall
    cost of any IoT solution. However, it assures accurate reading of the need for
    manual maintenance. The design of the cleaning system must be in such a way that
    does not affect sensor readings. In an effort for cleaning sensors, a mechanism
    was designed that disseminates air bubbles around sensors to prevent dirt on the
    surface [62]. Such solutions might cause inaccurate readings of dissolved oxygen
    due to the high concentrations of oxygen molecules around the probe. A better
    solution would be the application of ultrasonic cleaners for the automating cleaning
    procedure of sensor probes which was reported to be effective [63]. A self-cleaning
    mechanism was designed to clean sensor''s probe after every measurement. This
    was done by designing a special robotic arm that automatically performs the measurement,
    rinsing the sensor probe. The proposed system submerges the sensor in the protective
    solution if it is not going to be used for long time [64]. 3.2. Specific Challenges
    Depending on the species and accessibility of farm, certain challenges occur more
    frequently in different farming setups. Table 2 lists challenges for implementing
    IoT in aquaculture systems over two dimensions. Rows are referring to the farm''s
    accessibility to basic facilities and columns refer to the type of species under
    culture. A farm with no access to electricity or internet access is considered
    to be in a rural area. Whereas farms in urban areas have access to both of these
    facilities. A farm with basic facilities would face fewer challenges in comparison
    to a farm that is located in a rural area. Likewise, sensitive species demand
    higher reliability and quality in design, hardware, and software. Contrary to
    this, simpler and more economical IoT systems could be designed for species that
    are less sensitive. Such Categorization resulted in four different scenarios in
    which any given farm falls in one of them. There are different challenges related
    to each scenario that are grouped into three different categories including infrastructure
    related challenges, data related challenges, and perception related challenges.
    Table 2. Different types of challenges that IoT system may need to overcome. Depending
    on type of species and accessibility of farm to facilities, some challenges are
    more likely to occur. Empty Cell Empty Cell Type of species Empty Cell Empty Cell

    should consider the related costs concerning Table 2. The higher is the number
    of challenges, the higher is implementation cost of the IoT system. It is due
    to the number of challenges that need to be resolved. As it could be seen, most
    of the challenges are for the farms with sensitive species that are located in
    rural area. Resolving the challenges could be done by taking one of the following
    approaches. First, changing the type of species or relocating the farm which reduces
    the number of challenges. Second, confronting them through solving the challenge
    by incorporating different methodologies proposed in the literature, which will
    be further discussed in the following. To this end, a detailed cost-benefit analysis
    is required to be done to choose one of the above approaches. For established
    farms, the first approach might not be practical. Whereas, for future farms, it
    might be wise to consider the location and the type of species in such a way that
    minimizes the number of challenges. In the following, each category of the challenges
    will be further explained along with the findings on how such challenges have
    been solved in the literature. 3.3. Infrastructure Related Challenges Access of
    the farm to the electricity and internet are two main infrastructural issues that
    can affect the design of IoT systems. In the following each of them will be discussed
    in more detail. 3.3.1. Electricity The existence of electricity is a prerequisite
    for IoT systems. The lack of electricity in rural areas or marine aquaculture
    and the unreliability of electricity in urban area has been recognized as one
    the challenges that need to be addressed [65]. Most IoT devices are designed in
    such a way as to operate on low power, meaning that they can operate for a reasonably
    long time on batteries [66]. However, possible actuators are usually power hungry
    and therefore reliance on a sole battery is not possible unless it is accompanied
    by a recharging facility. Though newly introduced betavoltaic batteries with life
    spans varying from multi-decade to multi-century may change this need in near
    future [67]. Solar panels and photovoltaic batteries have been shown to be a realistic
    solution that addresses this issue [38, 39, 65, 68]. However, a reliable operation
    of other hardware equipment using solar energy demand careful design. For example,
    reliable powering of aerator for fish farm using solar photovoltaic and the battery
    has shown to be dependent on the size of the pond [38]. It is worth mentioning
    that, while the incorporation of solar panels and batteries would add to the overall
    costs of the farm it has shown to be more cost effective than a gasoline-based
    solution or even electricity for the power grid. Optimizing energy consumption
    for the increasing life span of battery operating devices is an active research
    area [69, 70]. It has been shown that reducing the number of data transmissions
    over the network could save energy with negligible loss in data quality [71].
    Most of the proposed solutions in the literature are based on online monitoring
    of water quality [18]. Continuous monitoring of water quality consumes more power
    and therefore, optimizing power consumption by reducing sampling periods to as
    low as possible would result in maximizing the battery life span. Using the current
    technology IoT nodes could go to sleep mode by which power consumption reduces
    effectively [72], [73], [74]. Though periodical sampling would reduce the number
    of readings, most of the time incorporation of the machine learning methods would
    result in predictions that are comparable with actual reading [8]. 3.3.2. Network
    Access to the internet is another important requirement of IoT systems. It could
    be a real challenge for farms located in a rural area. Internet access enables
    the IoT system to transfer data to the cloud and thus it could be analyzed and
    monitored from anywhere. Different networking protocols could be used for transceiving
    data from/to the farm to/from the internet [25, 34, [75], [76], [77], [78], [79]].
    However, it has to be noted that the long-range networking protocols are designed
    for low-rate data transfer. As a result, while most of the requirements of IoT
    aquafarm will be covered, special requirements like transferring video data would
    not be possible using most of these technologies [80]. Research has been conducted
    comparing different low-power lossy networks (LLNs) in IoT for transferring video.
    Their evaluation has shown that most of the existing protocols are not capable
    of transmitting video. Authors asserted that due to the nature of these networks
    it is impossible to transfer video over them. However, there are other protocols
    like CoAP that can transfer high-rate data including video [80]. Recent technological
    advancements show that globally accessible internet is no more a dream [81]. This
    technology, i.e. reliable high-speed internet [82], has been available in some
    parts of the world for the past few years and is expected to be expanded to more
    locations in near future. However, just like any other new technology early adoption
    of this technology would be costly [83]. Sharing is a potential strategy that
    can be considered by small farms in rural locations to reduce adoption costs.
    In recent years, edge computing has enabled most computations to be performed
    on-site . [84, 85]. Edge computing could increase Quality of Service (QoS), response
    time, and security [86]. Moreover, when no additional off-site data is required
    for computing it reduces the dependency of the IoT system on to the cloud. In
    other words, the implementation IoT system by considering edge computing enables
    the whole system to act without reliance on cloud resources. Therefore, the feasibility
    of this architecture for a farm would leave the farm to the establishment of a
    local network within the farm. It is worth mentioning that edge computing in this
    sense does not isolate IoT system. In other words, edge computing reduces the
    reliance of the IoT system on high performance cloud computing machines accessible
    via the internet [87]. It enables local decision-making in an IoT system [3].
    Application of FOG computing or even hybridizing edge and fog computing could
    be beneficial for farms with network accessibility issues [88, 89]. Using fog
    computing it would be possible to filter data and thus reduce the amount of data
    that needs to be transferred over the internet [90]. Another common problem, more
    relevant to offshore farms, is known as the cable breakage problem of underwater
    sensor networks. Optimizing the wireless network and proposing a mixed wireless-wired
    topology have shown to resolve the problem effectively [91]. 3.4. Data Related
    Challenges The quality of measured data is very important as the whole purpose
    of an IoT system is to facilitate data-driven decision making. Many factors affect
    the quality of data along the way starting from the source of data to the quality
    of sensors that is of high importance for collecting high quality data. 3.4.1.
    Device Error Different vendors provide different made of the same sensor, suitable
    for different environments ranging from hobby usage to industrial use. Moreover,
    different sensors have different qualities that generally will be mentioned in
    terms of error rate for each sensor. The lower is the error the higher is accuracy
    (quality). The accuracy of the sensors is in direct relation to their price. Fig.
    3 contrasts the price and accuracy of different temperature sensors. As it could
    be seen there is a direct relationship between the price and the accuracy of a
    temperature sensor. Another source of data inaccuracy is related to the fact that
    some sensors may demand regular maintenance which could be in the form of performing
    regular procedures recommended by manufacturers or changing consumable parts.
    For example, pH sensors need to be recalibrated from time to time [92]. Or as
    discussed earlier most sensors require routine cleaning [93]. This is due to multiple
    reasons such as biofouling that cause drift in sensor accuracy [94]. A method
    was proposed for automatic cleaning of the sensor head by air through an air pump
    [62]. Nevertheless, this method demands energy for powering the air pump and also
    does not apply to all environments. Contact of sensors and electronic parts with
    water and humidity causes issues such as corrosion and demands regular maintenance
    that needs to be considered as well [95]. While sensors with higher prices offer
    higher accuracy, the chance of receiving erroneous data increases over time. Therefore,
    the incorporation of the following methods, besides performing maintenance procedures,
    for correcting the sensor readings has shown to be effective. • Incorporating
    the data fusion technique [96] to improve data quality [97] and also reduce the
    frequency of data transmission over the network and thus saving energy [98, 99].
    • Incorporating anomaly detection and other intelligent algorithms to improve
    and predict sensor values [16, 27, 44, 45, [100], [101], [102], [103], [104],
    [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115]].
    In a multi-depth temperature sensor network, 15 marine buoys were placed in different
    locations in the sea. The proposed system consisted of two software modules namely
    the accumulation system, and the visualization system. Sensor nodes send the temperature
    data by emailing them to a mail server. Data of each node then will be stored
    in the text format in a separate file that will be used later for visualization
    purposes. Interpolation was used to calculate the temperature for both missing
    sensor data and the predicting temperature value in the location between sensors
    [116, 117]. 3.4.2. Network Error Lossy networks affect the smooth collection of
    data. Most of the IoT platforms store collected data as time series. Losing data
    at a different time could affect the overall computation. Packet loss in networks
    is a well-known topic of research where the transition of data packets fails due
    to many reasons such as often poor received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values
    and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) [55, 118]. Resending the same reading multiple
    times could decrease the chance of data loss. However, different policies could
    be taken into account to overcome this issue such as interpolation or other statistical
    methods [25], utilizing more reliable radio and antenna configuration [39], or
    even deployment of an IoT platform on a local server as a solution that removes
    the need for internet connection [119]. The Topological design of the IoT system
    could also help in reducing network related problems. An agent based water quality
    monitoring system was proposed in [120]. Each sensor node was able to either directly
    connect to the gateway or use other nodes in the network for relaying data towards
    a gateway. 3.5. Perception Related Challenges According to an empirical study,
    the general perception of small business farmers was that IoT is not useful in
    aquaculture [31]. Lack of confrontation of the farmers with successful exemplary
    farms was found as the main reason for this finding. While large industrial scale
    companies are benefiting from IoT in aquaculture, small businesses are still resisting
    the adoption of IoT [24]. Many authors, suggested that policy makers should come
    up with pilot farms equipped with IoT facilities and show the effectiveness of
    it to the farmer empirically which may ease the adoption by farmers [24, 31].
    The cost of the IoT systems has also been an adoption barrier for small business
    aquacultures. While incorporating industrial grade sensors should not be missed
    if possible, it has been shown that it is possible to implement practical and
    reliable IoT systems using low cost sensors as well [24, 121]. While technical
    issues such as lack of power and access to the internet need to be addressed,
    perceptual issues regarding the usefulness of IoT need to be addressed even earlier
    [31]. Lack of economic power was determined to be one of the main reasons for
    small businesses in aquacultures to not adopt new technologies including IoT [122].
    As implementation costs grow linearly with the size of the system [123] then the
    amount of investment for farmers with small farms might not be considered high
    and therefore different providing an economic incentive such as an IoT adaptation
    loan for small businesses may convince farmers for adopting new technology. Moreover,
    lack of confidence in technological farms was recognized as another main factor
    [31]. Technology adoption could result in products with higher efficiency [122,
    124] and thus literature suggests that governments have to support small businesses
    [31, 122]. It has been shown that the adoption of IoT could be done using cheap
    solutions [24]. In other words, expensive industrial grade implementation is not
    the only viable solution in aquaculture. It is specifically useful for the small
    business farmer that is usually lacking behind because of a lack of economic power.
    The economical design of the IoT system could also reduce costs without losing
    quality. For example, combining the gateway with a node eliminated the need for
    a specific gateway node and therefore the cheaper system was offered [15, 48,
    125]. 4. Future Trends It is difficult to predict future trends with certainty,
    as the field of IoT (Internet of Things) is constantly evolving. Some potential
    future trends that may help tackling the challenges of IoT for aquaculture are
    discussed with regards to the type of the challenges categorized as follows: 4.1.
    common challenges Development of antifouling methods is an active research field
    in literature where it''s outcome could be used for sensors in aquaculture. These
    methods are more focusing on use of chemical and Nanocomposite technology for
    reducing accumulation of biofilm on the surface of the sensors and other equipment
    in direct contact to water [126]. It worth mentioning that it seems not many researches
    has been done focusing on incorporation of the self-cleaning methods for the sensors
    in aquaculture. Therefore, application of the current technologies would be beneficial
    for this regard. 4.2. Specific challenges As per our categorization, the specific
    challenges is subject to the aquaculture environment and setup, i.e. type of species
    and location of the farm. Therefore, not all of the IoT systems in aquaculture
    are expected to face the related challenges in this category. Nevertheless, advent
    of energy harvesting and renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, wave
    etc. [127], are expected to alleviate some of the challenges related to the energy
    and electricity of the farm located in rural area. While utilization of floating
    solar panel and wind turbine are a feasible common evolving practice [128, 129],
    application of newer sources of energy such as hydrogen has also shown promising
    applicability [130]. Advancement in battery production industry could also affect
    the challenges in IoT systems for aquaculture. While many IoT devices and sensors
    operate on low power, advancement of long lasting battery such as betavoltaic
    batteries [67, 131] could reduce the need for energy particularly when the farms
    are located in rural area. Regarding the data related challenges as mentioned
    earlier application of different software methods has shown to be successful.
    Moreover, data fusion [132] and sensor fusion [133] are also active research fields
    that could be practiced for tackling both network and data errors and increasing
    accuracy and reliability of data. 5. Conclusion The application of IoT is spread
    out in almost all industries. Aquaculture as a subfield of agriculture is not
    an exception. While there are many challenges related to the IoT in general, some
    of the challenges are related to aquaculture. The present paper, reviews reported
    challenges regarding the incorporation of IoT systems in aquaculture. Furthermore,
    possible solutions that could resolve reported challenges were discussed. • It
    is generally assumed that submerging any IoT device in water for a long time will
    result in mass gathering on its surface. As a result, it may cause improper working
    of the system. It is particularly important for sensory nodes that could cause
    inaccurate readings. Proposed solutions in the literature vary from suggesting
    regular maintenance of such devices to the design of different self-cleaning mechanisms.
    • Infrastructure related challenges are mainly concerning power supply and internet
    coverage. Solar based energy harvesting is the most prominent technology in hand
    for powering different power needs of the IoT systems. Edge computing and the
    possibility of implementing an IoT system that is not relying on the cloud enables
    the farms to operate smoothly. Remote access in such cases could get limited to
    simply observing vital stats. • Data related challenges are due to sensors or
    network errors that literature suggests application of different soft methods.
    • Perception related challenges cover issues related to the adaptation of IoT
    systems by farmers. It is particularly true for the small business aquaculture
    model and needs to be solved by policy maker and other institutions with social
    responsibility. Ethics approval statement This article does not contain any studies

    Keywords: UAV; IoT; satellite; Precision Agriculture; proximal sensing; remote
    sensing; challenges 1. Introduction Worldwide food production is a more sensitive
    issue than ever before. The global population is expected to reach 10 billion
    by 2050, adding an extra 2.4 billion to the global urban population, and increasing
    overall demand for food production by 70 percent [1]. At the same time, reduced
    rural population, degraded farmlands [2], climate change decreasing agricultural
    productivity [3], and food waste [4] make this requirement quite difficult to
    meet unless the agricultural productive model changes dramatically. To this end,
    Agriculture 4.0, or the fourth Agricultural Revolution, promises a technological
    revolution for enhanced agricultural productivity and increased eco-efficiency
    [5]. Driven by the wider Industry 4.0 paradigm shift, Agriculture 4.0 brings to
    the agricultural sector a number of mainstream technologies, including sensing
    infrastructures, big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and
    robotics [6]. It thus engages in a unifying model pertinent to different domains
    of human activity ([7,8]), recognizing cyberphysical systems and their components
    as a key element in this transition [9] and targeting an increase in the overall
    quality of life leading to Society 5.0 paradigm [10]. Sensing plays an important
    role in the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm shift. Obtaining the necessary information
    from the field may be achieved by exploiting different technological options that
    include ground-based sensors, or remote sensing techniques ([11,12]). The former
    are strongly associated with technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT)
    ([13,14]) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [15], as well as Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) [16]. The latter may be distinguished from airborne remote
    sensing utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and spaceborne remote sensing
    exploiting satellite data. The present work performs a systematic review related
    to the three aforementioned main technologies with reference to their application
    in agriculture. The main research questions (RQs) that the authors wish to answer
    in this work are the following: RQ1 What are the challenges of the three technologies
    that this work deals with? RQ2 How can these three technologies be used in a complementary
    way so as to facilitate the transition to Agriculture 4.0? The rest of the paper
    is structured as follows. An overview of the three aforementioned categories of
    sensing technologies is presented in Section 2. The methodology followed for the
    systematic review is showcased in Section 3. The outcome of the literature review
    performed is elaborated in Section 4 detailing the challenges and synergies found
    for the three technologies under investigation. Section 5 presents a discussion
    providing the paper’s view on the research questions formulated. Finally, Section
    6 presents conclusions and identifies potential future research directions. 2.
    Overview of Sensing Technologies 2.1. Ground-Based Sensing Ground or proximal
    sensors play a key role in Precision Agriculture (PA). Proximal sensing is defined
    as the use of field sensors to obtain signals from the analyzed feature (e.g.,
    climate, soil, or plant) when the sensor is in contact with or close to it (within
    a few meters) ([17,18]). Nowadays, there are many types of proximal sensors capable
    of monitoring multiple parameters related mainly to the plant water, nutritional,
    and health status [19]. Another classification includes the division into static
    proximal sensors, which remain stationary in the field, or mobile proximal sensors,
    mounted on vehicles or robots [20]. It is well known that climate is one of the
    main aspects determining plant growth and outputs [21]. This occurs because each
    plant is sensitive to certain growing conditions such as air temperature, relative
    humidity, wind, soil temperature, and light. Thus, it is crucial for farmers to
    understand the climatic conditions on their farms [22]. Hence, meteorological
    information may help the farmer make the most efficient use of natural resources
    to improve agricultural production. Among the most common proximal sensors are
    those that can assess climatic parameters. Usually, such sensors are mounted in
    small weather stations in the field, and a basic weather station usually consists
    of a temperature and humidity sensor, a wind speed sensor, a sensor that measures
    precipitation height, and one that can assess solar radiation information. Another
    category of ground-based sensors is soil-based sensors. New-generation proximal
    soil-based sensors are able to monitor real-time physical and chemical soil parameters,
    such as moisture, temperature, pH, soil nutrients, and pollutants, providing key
    information to optimize crop cycle management, combat biotic and abiotic stresses,
    and improve crop yields. One of the most common uses of such sensing is for irrigation
    management, through the capability of estimating the crop reference evapotranspiration
    (ETO), returning to the plant the full or partial (depending on the farm irrigation
    strategy) amount of water lost by evapotranspiration, using the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith
    equation recommended by the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) [23]. Weather observations and forecasts, coupled with physical observations,
    can help predict the development of the main pests and can be used to schedule
    control actions to prevent pest development. Thanks to such information, it is
    possible to change plant microclimate and influence the habitability for pests,
    for example, through pruning operations to reduce internal canopy humidity and
    reduce the probability of infection by plant pathogens. Integrated pest management
    has been a response to reduce the environmental impact of chemical pesticides
    [24]. For irrigation scheduling nowadays, there is a tendency to focus on plant-based
    sensors. Common and reliable sensors capable of continuously estimating plant
    water status include leaf turgor sensors, devices capable of assessing leaf turgor
    pressure, a parameter directly related to plant water status; sapflow sensors,
    capable of providing indications of the plant transpiration flows; trunk dendrometers,
    capable of monitoring trunk fluctuations over time, dependent on the plant hydration
    status; and Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) fruit gauges [25].
    The latter are low-cost devices that can continuously and very accurately monitor
    fruit development over the day, providing information about plant water and nutritional
    status during the fruit growth stage ([26,27]). Although plant-based sensors for
    monitoring plant water status are among the most common, there are other devices
    that are very useful for crop management. Foliar wetness sensors are devices installed
    inside the canopy to assess its moisture status, preventing the rise of pathogens
    and diseases [28]. Optical sensors, working in the visible/near-infrared band,
    can be useful for estimating the nutritional and health status of the plant ([29,30]).
    On the other hand, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology sensors can
    be used to assess and measure canopy shape and volume [31]. Last-generation sensors
    allow continuous data acquisition, greatly increasing the degree of information
    without increasing the farm workload. Moreover, these sensors can be used to create
    IoT networks for various applications [32]. IoT focuses primarily on providing
    many small, interconnected devices, mainly using WSN technology, that can work
    together with a common purpose [33]. A WSN has as a main target of offering sensing
    and monitoring capabilities utilizing wireless technologies to connect to sensing
    devices. In WSNs, data collection and transfer occur in four stages: collecting
    the data, processing the data, packaging the data, and transferring the data [34].
    With the help of WSN technologies, farmers can analyze weather conditions, water
    use, energy use, soil conditions, and plant morpho-physiological parameters collected
    from their farm feeding decision-support systems (DSSs) [35]. WSN has to fulfill
    requirements such as long range, low energy, and adequate data rate. Several technologies,
    including Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) [36], Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)
    [37], SigFox [38], and Long-Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M) [39], are arising
    as candidates in the upcoming transition to 5G communications [40]. In the context
    of this paper, and from this point on, we use the term IoT to collectively describe
    the different technologies associated with ground-based proximal sensing. 2.2.
    Remote Sensing Techniques UAVs were used in agriculture in 1997 for the first
    time. This technology was first used in Japan and South Korea, where mountainous
    terrain and relatively small family-owned farms required lower-cost and higher-precision
    spraying. Historically, the use of aerial application of pesticides was prohibited
    by the European Union, inhibiting the growth of UAV application in agriculture.
    Later use of UAVs was centered mainly around aerial imagery. Nowadays, UAVs are
    applied in PA to collect images of high quality, mounting adequate sensors to
    this end. Sensor choice is carried out carefully according to a number of parameters
    such as resolution, optical quality, weight, captured images, and price. UAVs
    may carry multiple types of sensors: RGB (red–green–blue), NIR (near-infrared),
    IR (infrared), multispectral (MS), and hyperspectral (HS) cameras. RGB and NIR
    bands are useful for collecting information about vegetation stress and chlorophyll
    content [41]. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors can also be used in environmental sciences
    for terrestrial scanning, obtaining information on crop height or canopy size
    [42]. Each type of sensor can be utilized for monitoring diverse parameters in
    vegetation. RGB is low in cost and useful for UAV applications of precision farming,
    such as the creation of orthomosaics, as they can capture images with high resolution.
    In addition, they are useful in different conditions (sunny and cloudy weather).
    But they cannot analyze many vegetation indices due to their limited spectral
    range. MS and HS sensors, compared to RGB, collect data in different spectral
    channels and acquire images with high quality that are useful for studying a multitude
    of physical and biological characteristics of plantations [43]. Therefore, MS
    and HS sensors are the most popular in PA, although they are expensive. Moreover,
    thermal sensors are used to collect temperature information. Their use proves
    to be optimal in irrigation-management applications [43]. The specific targeted
    application type is what dictates the adequate selection of sensors. For instance,
    MS sensors are suitable for the detection of diseases, offering many bands that
    can detect the sensitivity of symptoms. On the other hand, one RGB camera should
    be enough for data collection related to agricultural mapping. The most well-known
    applications of UAVs for PA, as found in the literature, include weed mapping
    and management [44], irrigation management [45], crop spraying [46], vegetation
    health monitoring and diseases detection [47], and vegetation growth monitoring
    and yield estimation [43]. UAVs acquire information that can be useful for the
    measurement of different parameters such as the crop height and the Leaf Area
    Index (LAI), allowing crop growth control in crops such as cotton, wheat, or sorghum.
    UAVs can be used to calculate the most common vegetative index to determine the
    diseased tissue, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which
    is useful for monitoring crop health and detecting diseases at an early stage,
    also mapping the size of the defect. In addition, a very important field of UAV
    application is water management, as precision irrigation techniques improve the
    efficiency of water use resources [43]. UAVs have rapidly evolved into a common
    tool to increase agricultural output and overall efficiency, decreasing expensive
    inputs of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. They can also indicate damages in
    crops that cannot be easily detected from the ground and be applicable in areas
    of big dimensions [48]. Finally, spaceborne remote sensing satellites equipped
    with digital RGB cameras and MS or HS sensors are nowadays among the most widely
    used technologies in monitoring field variability, which usually includes landscape
    monitoring, yield, field, soil and crop variability, or variability due to anomalous
    factors [49]. By measuring the reflectance of the light incident on soil and crops,
    they are used to assess their characteristics and behavior by acquiring information
    at different spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolutions. Similarly
    to UAV-based remote sensing, information acquired from satellites is usually expressed
    by indices, among which the NDVI index is one of the most widely used. Each index
    is calculated from values at visible and non-visible wavelengths: red, green,
    blue, near-infrared, red edge, and infrared bands are the most frequently used
    ([12,50]). Every satellite and sensor is characterized by different spatial and
    temporal resolutions. Temporal resolution is associated with the satellite itself
    and can be considered as the time the satellite takes to complete an orbit and
    revisit the same observation area. Sensors, instead, can have high spatial resolution
    and tend to have small footprints, or they have low spatial resolution and tend
    to have larger footprints. As Vanguard 2 and TIROS 1 were launched in 1959 and
    1960, respectively, and are used for assessing meteorological information, the
    history of satellites for agricultural use starts in 1972 with Landsat 1 (1972–1978),
    a satellite capturing multispectral data for earth-surface image acquisition.
    After that, a series of Landsat satellites (from 2 to 9) were launched. Used in
    many parts of the world, these satellites (Landsat-7, -8, and -9 are still active)
    provide high-quality images in order to classify land uses, monitor crop conditions,
    and estimate irrigation water requirements, resulting in more affordable imagery
    than the aerial photography once used to classify land use across large regions.
    Later, from the end of the 1990s to the 2010s, other satellites were launched,
    such as IKONOS (1999–2015), which provides 4 m spatial resolution images; Worldview-2
    (2009–present); and GeoEye-1 (2008–present), with a ≤2 m resolution; Sentinel-2A
    (2014–present) and -2B (2015–present), with a 10 to 60 m resolution; and other
    satellites constellations such as Pleiades-1A (2011–present) and -1B (2012–present),
    SkySat-1 (2013–present) and -2 (2014–present), or Superview-1 (2016–present),
    namely small satellites with compact, cheaper, and more replaceable sensors [51].
    The primary benefits of this type of technology use are widely documented in the
    literature and include reduced environmental impact, increased crop yield, enhanced
    product quality, and input savings ([52,53,54]). Despite the number and variety
    of satellite data being made available at various costs and for different purposes,
    there are certain challenges to using satellite imaging closely related to the
    purpose of the study. 3. Methodology The present review was conducted following
    the guidelines set by the Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) methodology [55]. The PRISMA statement consists
    of a checklist of 27 items recommended for reporting in systematic literature
    reviews. This checklist was designed to help reviewers report the purpose of the
    review, the methodology that was followed, and the outcomes of their research.
    This section provides answers to the PRISMA 2020 statement item checklist, giving
    a comprehensive illustration of the methodology followed in the present work.
    As the technology of sensors rapidly advances, a review of current literature
    in PA is needed to put into scope the available technologies, their competition,
    the cases that are most favorable for their application, and how to best utilize
    them in unison to maximize agricultural sustainability and profit for farmers.
    This review was conducted with the mindset of bringing to the fore the challenges
    of the three technologies that currently play a central role in the future of
    PA and sustainable development. To the knowledge of the authors, a systematic
    review with the scope of attempting to synthesize the literature for these three
    technologies has not been attempted before, testifying to the novelty of the current
    work. This study answers the two RQs that were mentioned in the introduction.
    According to the RQs, the following search query was formulated: TITLE-ABS-KEY
    (“Precision Agriculture” AND (((UAV OR Satellite) AND “Remote Sensing”) OR IoT))
    All results obtained from this query also had to fulfil the following criteria:
    Should be written in English, Should be published after 2017, Should be published
    in Q1 and Q2 journals. All studies that met the criteria proceeded to the first
    screening phase. During this phase, all six authors split the remaining papers
    between themselves and skimmed through the abstract and the main text for phrases
    mentioning challenges or synergies for the three technologies. At this phase,
    only phrases were sought. All works that survived this stage passed through a
    second screening phase, during which remaining works were split between two reviewers
    and carefully read through. The reviewers had to ascertain to what degree each
    study analysed the challenge or the synergy it mentioned. If the analysis of the
    challenge or synergy was profound enough, the work was finally admitted for inclusion.
    The aforementioned query and exclusion criteria were applied in the Scopus database
    on 6 October 2022. The explanation for the choice of this query was that the application
    of these three technologies in PA was sought for sensing purposes; therefore,
    “remote sensing” was added with an AND for UAVs and satellites to exclude other
    uses, e.g., spraying. Furthermore, the term “IoT” was regarded as more appropriate
    when paired with “Precision Agriculture” to provide a representative set of relevant
    works, and was preferred over terms such as “Wireless Sensor Networks” or “Ground
    Sensors”. The aforementioned query produced a result of 435 articles. Out of these,
    383 were articles published in Q1 and Q2 journals. These 383 articles were divided
    equally among the six authors for the first screening phase. Articles that had
    no mention of challenges, or synergy of technologies, were eliminated. The first
    screening phase eliminated a further 172 works. Therefore, 211 works made it to
    the second screening phase, during which 24 works were excluded, leading to a
    total of 187 articles. Looking through these 187 records, it was evident that
    synergies were underrepresented, as only 6 works mentioned a substantial synergy.
    Citation searching had to be performed to ensure that the contemporary literature
    on synergies was adequately represented. Citation searching added a further 18
    records, for a total of 205 records to be admitted for inclusion in the final
    review. Figure 1 presents a flowchart giving an overview of the screening phases
    and the steps followed for the systematic literature review. Figure 1. Systematic
    Literature Review Flowchart. During the second screening phase, all challenges
    found by the authors were added to a spreadsheet. Subsequently, these challenges
    were grouped together. These groups can be found in Table 1 and Table 2 for UAVs,
    Table 3 and Table 4 for satellites, and Table 5 and Table 6 for IoT. Papers that
    mentioned synergies where sparse among the body of results. These works are described
    in their own Section 4.4. Table 1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Technological
    Challenges for Applications in Agriculture. Table 2. UAV Peripheral Challenges
    for Applications in Agriculture. Table 3. Satellite Technological Challenges for
    Applications in Agriculture. Table 4. Satellite Peripheral Challenges for Applications
    in Agriculture. Table 5. Internet of Things (IoT) Technological Challenges for
    Applications in Agriculture. Table 6. IoT Peripheral Challenges for Applications
    in Agriculture. In order to give a sufficient definition of what a challenge is
    and what a synergy is, we refer to the following. A challenge is any type of impedance
    or problem that challenges the use of a particular technology in PA. For example,
    for UAVs, a challenge could be their short flight times, for satellites their
    lower resolution, and for ground sensors their inflexibility. Synergy is an idea
    that fuses together traits from two or more technologies to produce an effect
    that improves the use of both and augments each technology’s value overall. The
    high-resolution images acquired by UAV, combined with the wide coverage and high
    spectral resolution of satellite images, constitutes a good example of a synergy.
    Both challenges and synergies were sought in all examined papers, with the prerequisite
    that they were sufficiently analyzed in the review text. Therefore, it was much
    more probable to encounter UAV challenges in a UAV-centric paper than in an IoT-centric
    or a satellite-centric paper. To reduce bias, the two first authors double-checked
    the findings of each of the six authors during the second phase of deciding paper
    eligibility. Any paper that mentioned a well-analysed and evidence-supported phrase
    that met the challenge or synergy criteria was eligible for synthesis. During
    the second screening, a further 24 papers were excluded. After this step, the
    number of records was reduced to 187. Out of those papers, six of them discussed
    a synergy of the technologies. Citation searching was performed to identify more
    records mentioning synergies, which added another 18 records, for a total of 205.
    Synthesis of the results required that the phrases extracted from each paper described,
    in their core, the same basic challenge in order to be grouped with similar phrases
    from other papers. For example, papers mentioning UAV instability when carrying
    heavy equipment and UAV reduction in flight time due to heavy payloads were all
    grouped under the payload-limitation challenge because they describe the wider
    challenge that UAVs face when there is need to equip them with heavy payloads.
    As each challenge is further elaborated upon in the main text, the particular
    details of each phrase are not lost. The grouping helps to provide a summary of
    the challenge in a form that is quick and easy on the eye and captures how many
    works have mentioned it in the past. 4. Results This section presents the results
    for the synthesis of the challenges for each technology in three subsections and
    the results for synergies in the fourth subsection. 4.1. UAV Challenges This subsection
    provides the results of the categorization of challenges for UAV technology. Table
    2 presents the types of challenges for implementing UAV technology in agriculture
    that are peripherally related to the use of UAVs. The categories that were observed
    in this case were economic, social, and governmental challenges, as well as one
    miscellaneous challenge. Table 1 presents the type of challenges for implementing
    UAV technology in agriculture that are native to the UAV technology, and hence,
    occur according to the UAV system itself. The categories that were observed in
    this case were challenges concerning the sensors, the system security, the data
    processing, and the system hardware. Moreover, future research challenges for
    implementing UAV technology in agriculture are also investigated and included.
    Figure 2 presents these groups of challenges found in the literature that was
    examined. Figure 2. UAV Challenges Mentioned in the Literature. Most commercially
    available UAVs come out of the box with cheap RGB sensors that lack the precision
    and spectral range for PA applications (for example, for calculating NVDI) [58].
    It is necessary to equip UAVs with MS sensors, increasing the overall cost, and
    even then, cheaper MS sensors face saturation issues [59], especially since there
    are no standardized methods for their calibration [72]. The calibration of UAV
    sensors presents a challenge because camera position on a UAV might be slightly
    different for each flight [59], and differences in the orientation of the sensor
    result in different calibrations each time. This is especially true with HS sensors,
    as the slightest tilt has a negative impact in the sensor calibration [80]. With
    reference to HS sensors, although they have become more lightweight and cheaper,
    they are still a relatively expensive investment, and the processing of their
    output data remains extremely complex. Therefore, UAVs present a less cost-effective
    option for high spectral resolution when compared to satellites [129]. According
    to [71], another challenge for UAVs is their dependence on payload. Equipping
    the UAV with multiple sensors is not recommended, as it reduces flight time and
    affects its balance mid-flight ([81,86]). Therefore, careful choice must be made
    about which sensors to use and equip the platform with during each flight, resulting
    in the need for multiple flights when measurements from multiple sensors are required.
    All data generated as an outcome of the UAV trips need to be processed to be useful.
    Some issues arise during this stage. As sensors become better and spatial resolution
    increases, the volume of acquired data increases, and UAV use in PA is faced with
    extreme data bloat ([81,110,111]). Moreover, as mentioned earlier, data acquisition
    is not standardized, adding to the already considerable computing complexity of
    UAV images ([57,86]). On top of that, the UAV itself can do little to share the
    burden of data processing as its computing capabilities are very limited ([81,111]).
    When these ultra-high resolution data are used for machine learning (ML) training,
    it can take quite a while to complete ([72,106]), even though the final results
    are more trustworthy and useful than training the ML algorithms with satellite
    acquired images. Higher resolution is not always a panacea when it is employed
    for disease classification. The currently developed plant disease classification
    methods have maximum resolution thresholds, which, when surpassed, result in their
    algorithm underperforming. Nevertheless, the highest resolutions can be capitalized
    on in object recognition algorithms that perform disease analysis at the individual
    plant level [117]. Another issue is that if these data are to be given to some
    company or organization for processing, issues of data governance arise, as well
    as security of sensitive data ([64,72,82]). Furthermore, as the usage of UAVs
    in agriculture is still in an early stage [123], more research is needed to identify
    the costs and benefits of the implementation of this technology. For example,
    [125] recommended the actualization of more studies concerning the validation
    of low-cost sensors’ results in different conditions. Moreover, according to [71,82],
    there is a need for the development of fully autonomous UAVs. Ref. [79] also discussed
    the implementation of multiple coordinated UAVs in an individual field. Finally,
    the path optimization of UAVs, in order to monitor a whole field with adequate
    accuracy, is mentioned in [71,75]. UAVs’ application challenges exceed the purely
    technical aspects. Using a UAV for PA requires a large upfront investment from
    farmers ([118,127]), and even then, continuous use can be expensive as well [86].
    This high initial cost is a considerable risk, as remote sensing is not a standardized
    procedure for every type of crop and in every environment, and its performance
    can wildly vary depending on these parameters [86]. The need for skills and a
    proper way of handling UAVs ([58,66,132]) are further impeding factors. Knowledge
    of repair and maintenance is also a requirement [64]. Moreover, most governments
    require special licences for UAV use, and they limit certain aspects of flying,
    such as flying height ([71,93]), and flying over inhabited areas and beyond visual
    lines [88]. 4.2. Satellite Challenges The present subsection provides the results
    of the categorization of challenges for satellites. Table 4 presents the type
    of challenges for using satellites in agriculture, which are not oriented to the
    technology itself. The categories that were observed in this case were economic
    and social. Table 3 presents the challenges native to satellite technology. Of
    this type of challenges, the main categories that were identified were related
    to sensors, security, data processing, and the platform. In addition, some future
    research challenges are also mentioned and analyzed. Figure 3 presents these groups
    of challenges found in the literature that was examined. Figure 3. Satellite Challenges
    Mentioned in the Literature. An important drawback of satellite imagery is its
    lower spatial resolution compared to airborne images ([101,135]). Satellite images
    of medium or low spatial resolution are freely available but do not provide adequate
    data for a handful of different PA uses, such as disease monitoring, soil spectral
    measurement, wild weed identification, or applications that require individual
    plant identification through ML ([136,137,138]). Very-high-resolution (VHR) images
    from satellites are also available but incur a significant cost. Even then, VHR
    satellites have trouble in applications that require object identification in
    agricultural environments, as they provide less information than their airborne
    counterparts. Due to this lower spatial resolution, satellites are not optimal
    for heterogeneous environments, for example, for the size and distribution of
    most of the European olive grove systems or vineyards ([142,159]). Similarly to
    UAVs, satellites generate big data images. Their processing is a time-consuming
    and computationally intensive endeavour [144]. Processing these data under time
    constraints may affect the quality of the final result [148]. Storing and managing
    the sheer volumes of imagery is a considerable challenge on its own. Furthermore,
    satellite data, because of their low spatial and temporal resolution, are not
    great candidates for AI calibration purposes or training of ML algorithms [149].
    As with all big data applications, satellite imagery can also be leaked or be
    used by third parties for unknown purposes, so care must be taken ([72,142]).
    Another drawback of satellites is their susceptibility to cloudy weather. Depending
    on cloud coverage, a satellite may not be able to acquire images at all [151].
    The consensus in the literature is that cloud coverage reduces satellite temporal
    resolution ([83,149]). Disease monitoring in particular is highly dependent on
    high temporal resolution; thus, satellite use for this particular application
    is inappropriate [158]. Satellites as a platform have inherently low temporal
    resolution, as they cannot be used for imaging at will but rather at their particular
    revisit time, but if at that moment the cloud coverage is dense, the chance for
    image acquisition may be lost. While satellites bearing active sensors are a solution
    to cloud coverage, their spatial resolution is even lower, and hence they do not
    solve the disease-monitoring conundrum ([57,64]). The low temporal resolution
    of satellites is a problem not only for disease monitoring but for monitoring
    in general. Satellites are inflexible platforms without the ability to interchange
    sensors at will, and waiting for a satellite with a suitable sensor for the required
    measurement is another cause of low temporal resolution. When the highest spatial
    resolution is needed from VHR satellites, they may not be there to provide it
    ([64,83]), but a very small number of satellites are equipped with both MS and
    HS sensors [129]. With reference to future research challenges, there is a need
    to sufficiently integrate and connect satellites with different technologies and
    devices, as well as enhance their level of cooperation between one another [142].
    According to [121], there is also the need to perform more research for satellites
    on transforming image classification maps into application maps. Additionally,
    as the complexity of the usage of a satellite platform is a factor that hinders
    its adoption, the overall technology needs to become more approachable for farmers
    and be used as a DSS [155]. Concerning the satellite technology’s peripheral challenges
    for applications in agriculture, the cost of acquiring useful information from
    satellite imagery incorporates the costs of taking the images and processing them.
    Specialized companies gather the imagery from specific satellites and process
    them themselves before finally delivering the final product to the customer. Satellite
    data for PA have been in use for many years, more than UAVs, and the whole process
    is more streamlined. Still, the cost of the man-hours involved is high, particularly
    when data processing must be undertaken quickly [57]. All in all, access to everyone
    is still hindered due to the scientific and technological knowledge required to
    deploy an effective method that brings true and valuable results to farmers [131].
    4.3. IoT Challenges The present subsection provides the outcomes of the categorization
    of challenges for IoT technology. Table 6 presents the type of challenges for
    implementing IoT in agriculture that are not native to the technology itself.
    The categories that were identified from this case were mainly economic, social,
    and governmental. Table 5 presents the IoT-technology-oriented challenges. From
    this group of challenges, the main categories that were observed were related
    to sensors, security, networking, data processing, and future research challenges.
    Figure 4 presents these groups of challenges found in the literature that was
    examined. Figure 4. IoT Challenges Mentioned in the Literature. Each sensor in
    an IoT context comprises four parts: a sensing part, a computing part, a transmitting
    part, and a battery. The batteries are usually not rechargeable or changeable.
    Therefore, there is a pressing need for saving energy ([166,167,169,170]). Most
    of its energy is spent in transmitting sensed data back to the main station. Energy
    saving can be achieved by using operations with a low duty cycle, minimizing delays,
    or optimizing routing. Another challenge for IoT is the lack of reliable measurements
    for low-cost ground sensors [175]. For example, the measurement of soil moisture
    with ground sensors is challenging because the capacitive soil moisture sensors
    operate at low frequencies and are sensitive to the soil texture and salinity
    level [193]. The placement of sensors is another important challenge of incorporating
    IoT. Sensors have to be placed strategically to ensure maximum coverage and well-established
    communication between them ([91,175,192]). The difficulty of this task is proportional
    to the size of the field. As size increases, the placement of sensors becomes
    more difficult, and the cost of implementing a critical mass of sensors increases
    as well. This is known as the scalability problem ([168,172]). Harsh environmental
    conditions is another factor impeding ground sensors ([166,184]). Meteorological
    variables such as snow, fog, and solar radiance have an impact on both the sensor
    network and the planting [185]. The electrodes of low-cost sensors suffer deterioration
    quite quickly, and it is important to somehow ensure protection from adverse conditions
    [175]. Underground sensors constitute a solution to this problem, as meteorological
    phenomena do not affect them, and they do not impact the above-ground activities
    of machinery or animals, but at the cost of limited range due to interference
    by soil elements [191]. Another challenge for IoT is the need for sensor specialization,
    for each crop or disease in need of monitoring. They should be tailored to the
    needs of wildly different sectors in agriculture such as fruits, arable crops,
    or trees ([188,189,190]). Furthermore, all these sensors create electronic waste
    when they finally expire, and some of them contain harmful chemicals that are
    toxic to soils, crops, and stored grains [167]. Moving on, the architecture of
    the network is an important aspect of designing an IoT solution. Integrating data
    sources and distributed sensors is complicated [204]. IoT system design in PA
    is based on heterogeneous network topologies that lead to complex communications.
    IoT devices have to communicate and interact seamlessly through different platforms
    and infrastructures [168]. This is worsened by non-standardized data-communication
    protocols [166] and different IoT node synchronization [177], as communication
    protocols differ from crop to crop [175]. Another important aspect is the network
    layer itself. WiFi communications are not ideal for agricultural applications,
    which usually face extreme weather conditions and have insufficient power structure,
    particularly when devices are spread far over a field, and they work on non-rechargeable
    battery power [167]. On the other hand, cellular communication suffers in agriculture,
    as the operational area is far away from antennae of cellular networks, and thus
    the connectivity of 3G/4G is very low. Moreover, 4G cannot support ultra-low latency
    with high connectivity because it allows IP-based packet switching connectivity
    [171]. LoRaWAN has arisen as a replacement for WiFi/cellular networks in agricultural
    IoT. While it has low bandwidth, it boasts very low energy consumption and high
    connectivity across vast distances [175]. Its drawbacks are that its radio-based
    signals are affected by vegetation foliage ([175,185,186]). Another defect is
    its high latency [166], but this is not always a problem in agricultural application,
    except if a real-time approach is taken to field monitoring. From the point of
    view of the data processing challenge, reference is made to data bloat in [189].
    Existing cloud-base storage does not provide useful solutions to the problem of
    manipulating the different data patterns produced by the IoT [168]. The analysis
    of these data is another challenge. According to [188], it has to be simplified
    so that it can be easily understood by most farmers. Moreover, computational efficiency
    needs to increase on the agricultural domain, and it remains a challenge to come
    up with efficient alternatives to provide sufficient resources to IoT in rural
    environments [206]. IoT networks that use WiFi—or cellular—for their network infrastructure
    are more vulnerable to hacking attacks ([192,197]). A malicious party can infiltrate
    the network and cause a wide number of issues to the IoT network. Attacks can
    target various aspects such as the network itself, its nodes, the data it transmits,
    and the code by which nodes operate. The purpose of these attacks could be brute
    attempts to disrupt the network and cease its operation, or more subtle malicious
    attacks, such as data theft and faulty operation of sensors that lead to miscalculations
    and false measurements ([199,200,203]). Authentication, encryption, and securely
    generated passwords are required to prevent security compromise [168]. LoRaWAN,
    as it does not use the Internet and has already authentication and encryption
    systems built-in, has a higher degree of security. Furthermore, the data governance
    of IoT is another issue. Whoever processes the data extracted by the IoT has full
    access to sensitive information, and care must be taken about whom farmers entrust
    these data to [200]. Future research on agricultural IoT systems may focus on
    many different aspects. An important one is power management. Batteries of sensors
    that are self-rechargeable through solar power or other means would greatly enhance
    the capabilities of agricultural IoT ([166,190,201]). Research on an IoT capability
    to monitor crops in real time is another important characteristic of sensor networks
    that is constrained by the limited power resources [204]. Ground robots bearing
    moving sensors need improvement in guidance systems to achieve smooth navigation
    through a farming environment [212]. The technology’s approachability for farmers
    is another issue in need of improvement. The ergonomic design of sensors, so that
    they can be better integrated into the farming environment, and the facilitation
    of IoT device implementation in a “plug-and-play” manner are desirable improvements.
    Finally, there are numerous voices claiming that the 5G network could revolutionize
    the agricultural sector, but concerns have been raised regarding the absolute
    validity of those claims. To start with, there will be high infrastructure costs,
    because additional stations are needed due to 5G’s shorter range. The end users’
    device cost would be higher, as would service tariffs [171]. Moreover, there are
    doubts that 5G is an environmentally friendly technology, as widespread deployment
    would translate to higher use of computing devices and an increase in energy demand
    to power the computing devices, which would exacerbate climate change. It is also
    worth noting that certain reports have raised concerns about 5G’s high radiation
    [167]. When it comes to IoT peripheral challenges, the most commonly mentioned
    among the papers analysed was the high costs of implementation. According to [64],
    the measurement of ground-based parameters can be costly and time-consuming, as
    well as requiring large amounts of human resources. Furthermore, Ref. [166] described
    the business issue of implementing an IoT-based system with three categories,
    the setup cost, the running cost, and the upgrading cost. All of these categories
    can incur high costs for farmers, making the adoption of IoT in agriculture a
    dilemma. Besides economic challenges, there is also a lack of theoretical and
    practical knowledge about such systems [166], and there is always a problem with
    the farmers’ lack of awareness for implementing new technologies in their farms
    [192], or even hesitance of the farmers to use them [165]. Finally, as these technologies
    are still at the infant stage of development, there is also a lack of policies
    and regulations [218], as well as ownership and processing issues related to the
    generated data [166]. 4.4. Synergies Mentioned in the Literature Works that present
    substantial synergies between technologies are sparse. This subsection summarises
    the review findings. While data fusion between different sensors for agriculture
    has been explored in previous works [225,226], the particularities of fusing or
    combining sensory output originating from two or more sources as diverse as IoT,
    UAV, and satellites has not been touched upon adequately for agricultural purposes.
    Alvarez-Vanhard et al., 2021 [225] gives a thorough review of the literature from
    2021 and before, which mentions the synergical use of satellites and UAVs for
    agriculture, but it does not mention combinations of IoT and any of the two aforementioned
    technologies. The current work attempts to take the reasoning of [225] one step
    further by focusing on the particularities of each paper reviewed and dissecting
    the exact reasons that make the use of a synergy desirable. These reasons can
    be traced back to the challenges mentioned in Section 4.1–Section 4.3, as the
    complementary use of two or more technologies attempts to mitigate the limitations
    and challenges each technology faces on its own. Table 7 and Table 8 present the
    logic permeating each type of synergy encountered during the literature review
    by contrasting its complementary technological traits. Table 9, Table 10 and Table
    11, describe the use cases of synergies performed in relevant works and characterize
    them according to the particular synergy types as defined in Table 7 and Table
    8. Table 7. UAV and Satellite Synergy Types. Table 8. UAV/Satellite and IoT Synergy
    Types. Table 9. Synergies Part 1. Table 10. Synergies Part 2. Table 11. Synergies
    Part 3. Among UAV-Satellite papers, Type 3 and Type 5 synergies are the most common.
    Interestingly, only two papers have utilized the flexibility of the UAV, and only
    two papers have utilized its enhanced capacity to create 3D point clouds, while
    no work combining UAV and satellite requires the historical records of past satellite
    overpasses. Among IoT-UAV/Satellite works, Type 8 was the most common, utilizing
    the proximity of IoT measurements to clear up uncertainties in UAV/satellite remote
    sensing. Type 10 and Type 12 are the next most commonly mentioned synergies. Most
    Type 10 synergies utilise meteorological data in ML models to complement remote
    sensing predictions, while Type 12’s use of historical satellite data was quite
    common in contrast with UAV–Satellite papers. Type 9 and Type 11 are only encountered
    once, since real-time ground sensor monitoring is still in its infancy as a practice,
    and attempts to perform orthorectification through ground measurements are also
    scarce. Synergy Type 7 constitutes an exception, as it is commonly encountered
    across a very large number of scientific papers, which were not reviewed, as they
    were considered outside the scope of the current work. While synergical use can
    mitigate certain liabilities and provide solutions, there are some challenges
    that are shared by two of the technologies examined or even by all three. Therefore,
    such challenges continue to exist when a synergy is attempted. Data privacy is
    a prominent concern for all three technologies, which cannot be mitigated by combining
    them. Another shared challenge is the large data volumes, which become more cumbersome
    when we have data fused from different sources. This is coupled with the increase
    in processing time and costs. In fact, the fusion of data of different types (sensor
    data and images of different resolutions) creates further challenges to the goal
    of having them efficiently integrated. A further challenge of the complementary
    use of the aformentioned technologies is that farmers need to become acquainted
    with not just one but all the technologies that are being combined. Moreover,
    it should be mentioned that the lack of current research regarding actual synergies
    between the three technologies is both an important impeding factor towards a
    holistic paradigm involving all three and a challenge for future research and
    pilot projects. In fact, in our literature review, out of the 205 reviewed works,
    only 24 papers provided synergy use cases. Finally, the lack of standardization
    poses further challenges with reference to their complementary use. In fact, all
    use cases found by the authors miss any particular standardization procedure,
    which could be beneficial for the future of synergical use between technologies.
    5. Discussion The value of satellite imagery in PA greatly depends on the application
    it is required for, as well as the particularities of the crops and the field.
    Even VHR satellites such as World View-3 are not suitable for individual plant
    analysis. While they provide a 30 cm per pixel spatial resolution on RGB imagery,
    on MS imagery, their spatial resolution is about 1.24 m per pixel. Thus, while
    their RGB imagery resolution is good enough for distinguishing canopies, the same
    satellite MS spatial resolution is not enough to provide adequate data for further
    analysis of these canopies. Evidently, satellite use is limited in heterogeneous
    farms, meaning farms that provide imagery that combines many different textures,
    such as soil, plants, wild weeds, or farming structures. In contrast, satellites
    are more useful for crops that cover an area homogeneously, such as cereal crops.
    But even in these types of plantations, applications such as wild-weed identification
    and soil spectral analysis benefit the most from the highest possible spatial
    resolution. Therefore, UAVs have an edge in applications of this type or heterogeneous
    farms. Very-high-definition images from UAVs, on the other hand, may introduce
    data redundancy, which lowers the performance of the algorithms used to process
    the images [117]. Upscaling may be necessary to a resolution scale, which ensures
    optimal performance of the algorithm used, which is another impediment to the
    UAV standardization of procedures regarding PA. It is therefore necessary to know
    the optimal resolution scale for each use case, as different combinations of algorithms
    and crops require different optimal resolutions. An added benefit is that lower
    resolution requirements allow the UAVs to fly to a higher altitude, thus also
    reducing battery expenditure and the time needed for the image-gathering excursion
    [116]. It is less probable to obtain usable imagery during rainy weather with
    a satellite than it is with a UAV system ([57,74]), as cloud coverage greatly
    affects satellite image quality. It might even render satellite images unusable
    if the coverage is too dense. Diseases can evolve rapidly, requiring precise and
    strict monitoring to ensure results, and skipping a measurement because of cloud
    coverage might throw off the project completely. On the opposite end, UAVs, being
    able to fly at will and being unaffected by cloud coverage, have a much higher
    capability for frequent imaging. A satellite’s lower resolution does come with
    certain benefits. Wide coverage is a satellite’s inherent advantage, and, as there
    is no piloting involved, the homogeneity of data is guaranteed. In contrast, UAVs
    have to be piloted carefully, they have to be stable enough to follow their required
    trajectory, and they have to maintain the same height over crops. Covering the
    same area as a satellite requires more images, more time, an expert pilot, and
    more processing of the images to create the final mosaics. It is therefore evident
    that UAVs are optimal for small to medium farms, where they are not required to
    cover vast areas for image acquisition. Large farms are better served by satellite
    imagery, supposing that they are not very heterogeneous. UAVs, being highly modular
    platforms that come in all shapes and sizes while also being able to carry many
    different sensors, have abundant flexibility but at the cost of standardization.
    Sensor calibration is a process that is dependent on the equipment; therefore,
    each combination of UAV model and sensor requires its own calibration procedure.
    In contrast, satellites do not face such issues, as their calibration is a standardized
    procedure that has been taken care of by the platform operators. Therefore, the
    risk of obtaining unusable data due to calibration faults is higher in UAVs. Moreover,
    due to this lack of standardization, UAV images have a slightly higher processing
    complexity than satellite imagery. Still, by having a much higher temporal resolution
    and by being devices that can become part of a wider IoT network, UAVs can provide
    their data faster for processing and can even utilize edge computing if there
    is available on-field infrastructure. Nevertheless, UAVs require a large upfront
    investment, that includes the cost of buying the vehicle, as well as the cost
    of buying its sensory equipment. Following this considerable investment, the cost
    of using and maintaining the platform includes recharging costs, the cost of man
    hours for processing the images, the cost of man hours for piloting the platform,
    and any costs for repairs and spare parts. Satellites, on the other hand, do not
    require the large upfront investment, but high spatial resolution satellite images
    can only be acquired by paying a hefty price. A further cost is added due to the
    man hours and skills required to process the satellite data. Adding to the challenge
    of buying and setting up a UAV platform for remote sensing are the bureaucratic
    difficulties of acquiring a licence to fly it. In contrast, satellite data require
    almost no bureaucratic hurdle for their acquisition. The third PA technology analysed
    in this review is IoT. This may incorporate any type of sensor, from soil sensors
    that measure soil parameters, such as moisture, temperature, and the concentration
    of elements such as carbon and nitrogen, to sensors that measure water levels
    in crops for irrigation purposes, to MS sensors that measure vegetation indices.
    An IoT device can have any combination of sensors and can be adapted to the particularities
    of the farm under examination. IoT tends to be more expensive than UAVs or satellite
    data, but provides the most noise-free data out of the three technologies. Moreover,
    their capacity to capitalize on edge-computing puts them at the forefront of scientific
    research, as this allows real-time monitoring, which is an important future prospect
    for PA. Out of the three technologies analyzed, IoT is the only technology that
    has the capacity for continuous monitoring. Measurements from ground sensors are
    used as training and evaluation sets for ML algorithms for application in remote
    sensing, because their data are the most trustworthy source of measurement regarding
    soil moisture, concentrations of various elements in the soil, water plant status,
    and similar quantities that can be measured through physical contact or proximal
    sensing. The calculation of vegetation indices through ground remote sensors,
    on the other hand, is a more challenging endeavor. Ground remote sensing requires
    many sensors to be placed strategically across the field for maximum coverage,
    and even then, only homogeneous crop types can be measured safely. Image recognition
    of canopies or rows of vines in heterogeneous environments is very difficult or
    even impossible to achieve when using ground remote sensors because of the angle
    the images are taken from. IoT systems are susceptible to attacks by malicious
    third parties, as they always require a network infrastructure to operate. On
    the other hand, UAVs usually operate without becoming a part of a network. Thus,
    they are less susceptible to hacking. Satellites, as they are not operated by
    the farmer, cannot become victims of hacking attacks. Nevertheless, satellite
    data from a farmer’s field can still be used for nefarious purposes, similar to
    data extracted from IoT and UAVs. Satellites and UAVs are reusable assets, in
    contrast to cheap ground sensors. The environmental waste from an IoT system can
    be an important cause for concern. In particular, as the dimensions of the under-measurement
    field become larger, so does the number of sensors required to cover it. It can
    be safely assumed that, cost-wise and environmentally, IoT for large fields is
    not an optimal choice. Complementary use relies on capitalizing on the strengths
    of one technology while complementing its weaknesses with another technology.
    UAVs can be used to enhance the spatial resolution of satellite MS data on certain
    parts of a field in order to examine that part more carefully. UAVs are also sources
    of excellent training data for ML algorithms that will then be applied to satellite
    imagery. Similarly, IoT systems are great producers of training data, especially
    for the purposes of irrigation and the measurement of soil parameters. LiDAR and
    thermal sensors on the ground can be used to enhance remotely sensed imagery.
    UAVs and IoT can therefore provide precision when satellite information is not
    precise enough for the needed application. IoT and UAVs can act in synergy in
    a multitude of ways. The UAV can provide its remotely sensed data to complement
    data gathered by the ground nodes. A UAV can itself become another node in an
    IoT system so that its information can be processed in tandem with the information
    of the other nodes. UAVs can even help mitigate power expenditure in an IoT system,
    which is an important limitation, by serving as a carrier of data from sensors
    to the main station. 6. Conclusions This systematic review summarized the limitations
    of ground-based, space-borne, and airborne technologies for PA, as they are presented
    in recent literature. It also pinpointed and summarized works that provide useful
    synergies between these technologies. These studies, when paralleled with the
    limitations of each technology, enable certain conclusions to be drawn, which
    can be summed up in the following points: Satellite is the broadest of the three
    technologies, providing ample farm coverage and good image detail. Cost-wise,
    it is the least risky source of PA data out of the three technologies, but it
    is also the slowest to provide usable results. UAVs have great flexibility and
    the capability to provide very specific information, but they are costly when
    applied to large farms, while also requiring a risky upfront investment from farmers.
    Their ability to analyze crops in very fine detail allows them to deal with specialized
    problems such as diseases or wild weeds. Still, using them is far from a standardized
    procedure, and more research is needed to establish the UAVs as a definitive solution.
    IoT provides the most specific information, as it can be tailored to the particular
    crop and farm. Moreover, it takes the smallest amount of time for data processing
    and has the unique potential of constant field monitoring. Its high specialization
    comes at the cost of reduced flexibility and area coverage. The review process
    included reviewing 24 use cases of synergies in the domain of agriculture between
    the technologies in question. Open challenges setting the ground for future research
    include data privacy issues, large data volumes, data fusion, farmers’ acquaintance
    with the technology, and lack of standardization. Taking steps toward addressing
    such challenges could facilitate further synergies and help the agricultural domain
    advance toward the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm. As things stand, complementary use
    of the three technologies requires further research. The number of works that
    make an effort to combine them is far too small when compared with the number
    of works that have come out in PA recently. The future of agriculture relies on
    optimally using all the technological tools currently at our disposal. Author

    We use many kinds of digital technologies in our daily life and they lead to radical
    changes. These technologies are recently being adopted by agriculture and food
    industry and their use in various applications is tested. The results of the studies
    conducted with the use of these technologies, especially IoT (internet of things)-based
    systems, are quite promising for the solution of the chronic problems of agriculture
    and food industry such as food-borne diseases, mycotoxin contaminations, pesticide

    Introduction With the introduction of computer and internet technologies into
    our lives, more data are produced in every field and there is a great change and
    development in our daily life almost every day. We have become familiar with many
    new terms such as Industry 4.0, big data analytics, blockchain, machine learning,
    artificial intelligence, etc. in recent years. Among these, the internet of things
    (IoT), is a key technology that enables many beneficial applications for the sustainability
    of various areas such as health, transportation, environment, etc. Some IoT-based
    technologies are already in use for agricultural and food products. For instance,
    consumers can get detailed information about the history (the origin of the raw
    material, where it grew, storage conditions, the production date and place, etc.)
    of the product if they scan the QR code on the label using their smartphones.
    However, the use of these technologies in agriculture and food sector is relatively
    limited compared to other sectors such as electronics, automotive, banking, etc.
    probably due to the complicated structure of the agricultural products, the scarcity
    of the information about these products and the fluctuations in their supply-demand.
    Food safety is one of the major issues for agricultural companies and the food
    industry. Many precautions are taken to prevent microbiological and chemical contaminations
    during the production chain and thus to ensure food safety. Nevertheless, illnesses
    and serious outbreaks caused by various food products occur all over the world
    every year causing serious health problems and even death (Strawn et al., 2013).
    It was estimated that over 600 million food-borne illness cases occur every year
    all over the world (WHO, 2015). Besides threatening health, food-borne illnesses
    may cause economic costs related to productivity loss, treatment procedures, market
    disruption, etc. These costs were estimated at about 6.9 billion $ just in the
    U.S. (Elkhishin et al., 2017). Food-borne illnesses can be originated from a wide
    range of food products contaminated with chemical substances but more likely with
    the microorganisms or their toxins (Strawn et al., 2013; Clarkson and Strain,
    2003; Sauders and D’Amico, 2016; Li et al., 2019; Miranda and Schaffner, 2019;
    Duan et al., 2020). Even if it cannot be classified as “food-borne”, COVID-19
    pandemic, which has affected the whole world, can be considered as closely related
    with food and food production. Food sector was alarmed by pandemic and made an
    extraordinary effort to avoid any disruption in the food supply. Many precautions
    such as monitoring medical conditions of the workers, controlling personal hygiene
    and working environments, social distancing, etc. were taken in each step of production
    to ensure food safety (Rizou et al., 2020). Scientific studies showed that the
    virus can transmit to fresh food items such as fruits, vegetables and bakery products
    directly by sneezing and/or coughing of infected people or indirectly by using
    their hands (BfR, 2021). Moreover, in June 2020, it was demonstrated that the
    virus could survive in frozen salmon for a certain period of time (Hu et al.,
    2021). Defining the production and supply chains, determining the critical points
    on them and improving their operations are crucial to ensure food safety. Integration
    of IoT-based technologies in food production and supply chains minimizes the contamination
    and/or spoilage risks and thus helps to prevent the concerns about health and
    economic losses (Misra et al., 2020). Huge amount of data, created by analyses,
    sensors, etc. every day, can be inserted manually or automatically into the databases
    or cloud platforms. IoT-based technologies can process these data and extract
    the robust and conclusive information to be used for determining and reacting
    against the outbreak just at the beginning. Environmental damage and changes in
    global climate conditions caused by industrial activities (carbon emission, wastewater,
    greenhouse gases, etc.) are existential threats to all geographies of the world.
    In order to minimize the risks caused by these problems, some agreements were
    signed on a regional and global basis. One of the most recent agreements is the
    European Green Deal which aims to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent
    by 2050. The main goals of this agreement are to adopt an ambitious strategy for
    adaptation to climate change, supply affordable and clean energy, stimulate industry
    for a clean and circular economy, increase energy and resource efficiency, reduce
    pollution in air, water and soil, preserve biodiversity and ecosystems, build
    an environment-friendly and healthy food system and encourage smart and sustainable
    transportation systems. Agricultural practices and food industry require and use
    high amount of resources such as energy, water, etc. IoT-based and other smart
    technologies can present new opportunities for using the resources in a more logical
    and efficient way, lessening of waste and thus reducing carbon footprint. It can
    be foreseen that these technologies will be more widely used in agriculture and
    food industry in the near future. In this review, the use of IoT and related technologies
    in agricultural practices and food supply chains are explained, some examples
    of real-world applications are given and the potential advantages and disadvantages
    of including these technologies into the present processes for ensuring sustainability
    are discussed. The present study has three main theoretical implications. Firstly,
    it provides a holistic approach to the use of IoT and related technologies in
    agriculture and food chains. The potential of the use of these technologies in
    farming, manufacturing, transportation, etc. was presented in an integrated manner.
    Secondly, this study presents promising technological solutions to the chronic
    problems of the agriculture and food industry, so it provides a new perspective
    to the concerns related to health and environment. Finally, from a realistic point
    of view, the challenges of the use of IoT-based technologies in agri-food systems
    were addressed. 2. The concepts of industry 4.0 and IoT The introduction of mechanical
    production plants run by steam or liquid water was known as the first industrial
    revolution. Thirty years later, the second revolution, in other words mass production
    era was started when the first line powered by electricity was constructed. The
    use of the first programmable logic controller in the late 1960s was acknowledged
    as the starting point of the third industrial revolution. Since then, the automation
    of the production processes has been enabled by the use of electronics and information
    technology (Zambon et al., 2019). In 2011, the German government introduced a
    new term called “Industry 4.0” as their innovative project at a fair. The project
    basically aims to boost the interactions among the people, machines and the resources
    (Baena et al., 2017). The main principle of Industry 4.0 is the elimination of
    the separation between the physical and the virtual worlds. Industry 4.0 connects
    the machines, functions and systems by using intelligent networks created along
    the entire value chain that can control themselves and each other autonomously
    (Zambon et al., 2019). The term Industry 4.0 is used for partially and completely
    automated innovative production processes thanks to technology and for the equipment
    autonomously communicating with each other throughout the value chain (Akyazi
    et al., 2020). Many different technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing and automation take place within the flexible and complex
    systems of the Industry 4.0. Cyber-physical systems (CPS), Cyber-physical production
    systems (CPPS), mobile internet, cloud computing, big data analytics and advanced
    analysis are some of the complicated techniques used in the Industry 4.0 (Zhou
    et al., 2015). In fact, what Industry 4.0 promises are intelligent systems which
    can realize manufacturing of a product thanks to the communication of the machines
    present on the production line without any human intervention. The autonomous
    communication among the components required for product manufacturing can only
    be possible by use of IoT-based technologies. The IoT can be simply defined as
    a dynamic global network infrastructure comprised of physical elements (sensors,
    actuators, controllers, data processors, personal electronic devices, etc.) that
    are connected and can autonomously communicate with each other. This technology
    enables real-time monitoring and controlling of many smart applications in various
    environments such as transportation, cities and buildings, grids for energy management,
    medical and healthcare systems, etc. (Akyildiz et al., 2015). IoT-based traceability
    systems can monitor all stages of production, distribution and consumption processes
    and store all the relevant data (Feng et al., 2020). A typical diagram of IoT-based
    systems is presented in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (223KB) Download

    Layers of IoT When designing an IoT architecture, researchers initially considered
    a three-layered architecture. Over time, it was suggested by some researchers
    that this architecture was insufficient, and it was seen that some layers should
    be separated (Burhan et al., 2018; Hsu et al., 2020). However, there is no standardization
    of proposed layered IoT architectures and different architectures have been proposed
    in the literature (Mahmoud et al., 2015). According to the need or the problem
    addressed, different architectures have been proposed (Farooq et al., 2015; Burhan
    et al., 2018; Hsu et al., 2020). But, all of them are based on a three-layered
    architecture. So, we basically handle a three-layered IoT architecture, in this
    section. These layers are as follows: 2.1.1. Perception layer In the perception
    layer, which can also be called the sensor layer, the information of the objects
    is defined and the data is collected from the objects defined in this things network.
    RFID, sensors, cameras, etc. technological devices as well as barcodes and QR
    codes can be defined as objects in this layer. Which objects are used is determined
    by the type of problem. After objects are determined types of objects and the
    data are defined of them; the data collection part is started and data are collected
    using appropriate communication protocols according to the types of each identified
    object. 2.1.2. Network layer In the network layer, which can also be called the
    transmission layer, the data received from the perception layer is transferred
    to the application layer. At the same time, the data obtained from the application
    layer is transferred to the perception layer. That is, the network layer acts
    as a bridge that provides communication between layers. This communication can
    be done via internet cables or wireless (Bluetooth, WI-FI, etc.) technologies.
    In addition to data communication, the network layer also performs functions such
    as deciding where the data will go and selecting the appropriate devices. While
    doing all these processes, it uses different methods such as cloud computing,
    fog computing, and edge computing. At the same time, switching, and routing devices
    are also used in this layer. 2.1.3. Application layer The application layer can
    be thought of as all applications involving IoT technologies. Smart homes, smart
    cities, smart health, tracking system, supply management, etc. can be given as
    an example. Since these applications are developed on a service-based and instantaneously
    used data from other layers, the services are varied according to the application.
    The application layer ensures the accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality of
    data. In this layer, it is expected to create an intelligent environment suitable
    for the purpose of IoT. The IoT technology can also be used for agricultural and
    livestock activities. A massive amount of data can be collected from different
    sources and can be used to make critical decisions related with crop yield, animal
    welfare, etc. Some applications have been employed in animal-based production
    for various aims like the efficient use of sources in the farm, management of
    livestock welfare, early diagnosis of the diseases, etc. Some of the opportunities
    for the use of IoT-based technologies in plant-based production might be monitoring
    the growth of the crop, detection of the pests, optimizing the use of fertilizers
    and pesticides, and even the evaluation of the reasons for emerging and spreading
    plant diseases and noxious weeds. In agriculture, IoT-based technologies can be
    used for monitoring the conditions during the growing season, handling and storage,
    determining water and nutrition requirements of the crop and the soil, using agricultural
    chemicals against pests in a controlled manner. Also, connectivity obtained by
    these technologies are useful for food supply chain management coordination. By
    this means, the material (from raw to final), the processes, all the conditions
    and control actions can be traced throughout the whole supply chain. The traceability
    brings information sharing and supply chain coordination that can help take critical
    actions (transferring and marketing of the right product at the right time, etc.)
    and thus contribute to the safety of the food (Annosi et al., 2021). Food safety
    and food security have always been one of the major concerns of the consumers.
    The IoT technology is an effective tool for minimizing these concerns thanks to
    enabling the identification of the product and its traceability from farm to table
    (Akyazi et al., 2020). It is considered that IoT and similar technologies will
    cause radical changes in food supply chain (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Additionally,
    in the near future, it will be most probably in use for many applications such
    as processing of food by collaborative robots (cobots), controlling the location
    and transport conditions of the product in logistics strategies, personalized
    nutrition practices, etc. Actually, many technological tools are still being used
    in agriculture and food industry, such as robotics, 3D printers, nanotechnology,
    automation, image processing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.
    In general, these tools are used in combination with IoT-based systems. Especially,
    technologies that have been introduced by the concept of Industry 4.0 such as
    blockchain, big data analytics and sensors are indispensable partners of IoT (Qiu
    et al., 2016; L''heureux et al., 2017). All these components should be operated
    collaboratively to achieve the desired goal in agricultural and food supply chain
    applications. 3. IoT-based systems used for smart agricultural practices As the
    food demand increases, the availability of arable land diminishes. Also, the agricultural
    yield decreases due to climate change, water scarcity, etc. As a result, there
    is an urgent need for innovative approaches related with agricultural production
    to combat these problems (Misra et al., 2020). Digitalism and the use of smart
    equipment will most probably increase operational efficiencies, contribute to
    waste reduction and thus will result in economic and environmental benefits (Mastos
    et al., 2021). Smart agriculture means applying modern information and communication
    technologies in agricultural production. The use of computers and electronics
    in agriculture were initially carried out within the scope of Agriculture 3.0
    and enabled efficient performances of agricultural machineries (Zhai et al., 2020).
    Most recently, these machineries are equipped with the novel technologies such
    as IoT, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, etc. and thus transformed
    to fully-automated, communicative, remotely controlled and self-decision making
    systems. It is defined as the beginning of a new era called Agriculture 4.0, in
    other words Farming 4.0 or smart farming, that is based on high-level automation
    and data exchange in agricultural practices (Miranda et al., 2019). With its technological
    superiority and resource-efficient approach, Agriculture 4.0 has a great potential
    for more productive and sustainable production (Gorli and Yamini, 2017). Smart
    greenhouses equipped with digital monitoring systems are becoming more common
    and popular all over the world. They have numerous advantages like online water
    control and nutrition requirements, monitoring the growth of the plants and detecting
    any abnormalities, following the yield and quality parameters of the crop. It
    has been indicated that smart farming is useful for controlling quality parameters
    of the environment and resources in order to supply sufficient and safe food for
    human. For example, using modern technologies (IoT, drones, sensors and smart
    valves, etc.) in growing, production and distribution of coffee was reported to
    be useful for decreasing costs and increasing efficacy of the supply chain (Kittichotsatsawat
    et al., 2021). Some other studies on the use of IoT and related technologies in
    agricultural applications from the literature are summarized in Table 1. Table
    1. The studies on the use of IoT and related technologies in agricultural applications.

    and “heavy stress” - By this way, suggestions to farmers could be made to apply
    water/pesticides in certain parts of the vineyard - The application was useful
    for water/pest management and also for plants physiological activity IoT-based
    systems can offer useful solutions to critical problems of agricultural applications.
    For instance, many farms in India have salty soil which lowers the yield in sugarcane
    agriculture. Gopikrishnan et al. (2022) tested a model based on IoT and machine
    learning to control drip irrigation in a sugarcane field. The authors reported
    that the model improved the crop growth and increased productivity. They also
    noted that the cost of the implementation of this smart IoT-based model in the
    field was quite less than the profit gained from the application. The world population
    is expected to reach about 10 billion by 2050. Furthermore, it was estimated that
    production of major cereal crops such as maize, wheat and rice will greatly reduce
    if the current situation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change continue
    then by the year 2100. So it seems that dramatic increase in population and drastic
    climate change are the major threats for agricultural production and meeting food
    demand (Arora, 2019). For this reason, smart agricultural systems that allow efficient
    use of limited resources are needed. To ensure resource efficiency, the reduction
    of food waste, the efficient use of energy and water, and the real-time monitoring
    of the resources are necessary. Since agricultural products are highly perishable,
    virtualization (in other words modeling) can be useful to foresee unpredictable
    supply variations, unexpected food safety problems, sustainability requirements,
    etc. Likewise, virtualization can be used for monitoring, controlling, planning
    and optimizing food supply chains remotely with the help of IoT technology (Verdouw
    et al., 2016). It is clear that these actions will help save time and money, minimize
    spoilage and waste. 4. IoT-based systems used for smart food supply chain According
    to the United Nations reports, about one-third of food goes to waste and it costs
    a loss of approximately 750 billion $ each year. It means that the agricultural
    products coming from the 28% of the agricultural lands are wasted annually (Misra
    et al., 2020). The waste can occur in all steps of supply chain, i.e. agricultural
    production, manufacturing, wholesale, retail, transportation and consumption at
    home. Precautions are taken and even legislations are implemented to reduce food
    waste in many countries all over the world. For example, food safety legislations
    in European Union countries and China require the food producers to ensure a complete
    food traceability that gives useful information to consumers and acts instantaneously
    (such as re-calling products) when an unexpected problem occurs (Tagarakis et
    al., 2021). Similarly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety
    Modernization Act, signed in 2011, requires labeling of the source of all food
    items and aims to prevent the contamination rather than respond to it. All these
    efforts are for making the supply chain more electronically-controlled and transparent
    and thus ensuring the food supply is safe. It is an obligation to have an effective
    food traceability system throughout the whole supply chain to ensure food safety
    and maintain quality (McVey et al., 2021). However, for agri-food industry, it
    is quite challenging due to high dynamics and uncertainties in supply-demand (Verdouw
    et al., 2013). Therefore, in order to achieve food safety and sustainability goals
    in the supply chain management of a food company, advanced control systems for
    complications such as fluctuations in supply-demand, quality and safety of perishable
    foods, etc. are urgently needed. The European Commission Information Society indicated
    that the use of IoT-based systems in food supply chain is a promising application
    (Pang et al., 2015). These systems can play a role in production, processing,
    transportation, storage, distribution steps of food supply chain and provide solutions
    to ensure food safety from farm to table. IoT-based systems have a great potential
    not only to deal with the problems concerning traceability, controllability and
    visibility but also to create more efficient, sustainable and safer supply chains
    for food industry (Kodan et al., 2020). IoT-based technologies are useful for
    managing the undesirable cases originated from the changes that occur in food
    products. As a hypothetical example, a temperature-sensitive product is transported
    to the market in a refrigerated truck. The sensors placed in the right locations
    can monitor the temperature throughout the journey, detect any deviation and even
    react against it by adjusting the heating/cooling unit. In case of a failure to
    do so, an automatic message is sent to the supplier and thus he/she is informed
    about the situation. Eventually, marketing the spoiled or low-quality products
    can be prevented and health risks associated with food-borne diseases can be minimized
    (Xiaorong et al., 2015). IoT-based systems can cooperate with almost all kinds
    of digital sensors produced for real-time monitoring of important parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, light, etc. These cooperations were reported to be useful
    for the food industry in rescheduling, re-calling and taking appropriate actions
    (Misra et al., 2020). Some studies on the use of smart digital technologies in
    food supply chain from the literature are presented in Table 2. Table 2. The studies

    product under various conditions As can be seen from Table 2, the studies testing
    digital technologies were carried out for mainly maintaining and improving supply
    chains. However, smart digital technologies like IoT, can also be used for some
    other applications. For example in Canada, one of the pioneer countries in fisheries
    industry, wireless sensor network technologies were used to identify trends and
    patterns related with snow crab catch conditions (Coronado Mondragon et al., 2021).
    The authors collected data from the ocean (wind speed, wind direction, temperature,
    pressure, etc.) using sensors placed on buoys. These data were analyzed using
    a computer program to perform a time series-scatter analysis. The results helped
    to get critical information about the meteorological conditions in the specific
    geographic areas investigated. It has been claimed that the proposed approach
    is a tool that assists in the management of the supply chain and the adoption
    of more efficient practices in the fisheries sector which is experiencing a process
    of digitalization characterized by the adoption of IoT solutions to monitor product
    history and provenance tracking (Coronado Mondragon et al., 2021). The technologies
    like wireless sensor networks can also be used to determine the variations of
    migration seasons and routes of the fish that occurred due to the increase in
    sea/ocean temperature caused by global climate change. In another study, a smart
    device consisted of various sensors and a microcontroller was developed and used
    for monitoring temperature and humidity in a grain warehouse (Kodali et al., 2020).
    Also, the device was able to adjust these parameters by switching on/off the fans
    and cooling units via IoT. The authors claimed that their device can be used to
    detect mold/insect infestation and thus contribute to ensuring food safety and
    quality. It is obvious that food safety and security issues are quite complicated
    so they cannot be easily and quickly resolved. In addition, extra problems in
    global food supply chain can occur due to unexpected events like pandemic that
    we have just experienced. Therefore, studies focusing on using technological solutions
    -like IoT-based systems-that minimize problems caused by equipment malfunctioning
    and operational flaws and maximize traceability and transparency are extremely
    important. The technological devices produced by inspiring from the results of
    these studies can be incorporated to real-time consignment monitoring process
    and can be used for marketing the product with short shelf life relatively earlier
    than the ones with longer shelf life (Mc Carthy et al., 2018). Beside this, IoT-based
    techniques used in food waste monitoring systems were found to be effective in
    reducing waste and increasing the efficiency in water and energy use (Jagtap et
    al., 2021). Food and agriculture global value chains have been growing since 1980s
    (Balié et al., 2019). Any increase in the participation of agri-food sector in
    the global value chain results in increases in value added creation and employment
    in service sectors. Global trade data shows that agri-food value chain participation
    has an increasing trend not only in big economies, but also in developing countries
    despite their low trade share (Montalbano and Nenci, 2022). Value chain integration
    has a crucial role in increasing corporate success. It is critical for lowering
    costs, fast-responding, raising service level and making correct decisions. Furthermore,
    it provides agility via information exchange and cooperation. IoT-based systems
    are useful for global value chain in optimizing the value chain operations, enhancing
    the data transparency, integrating the production data and determining the identity
    of the products (Egwuonwu et al., 2022). Even though the proliferation of deploying
    IoT in the global value chain has increased, some security challenges might still
    lead to a lack of trust among value chain stakeholders. A complete integration
    of the IoT-based technologies in the global value chain provides safe and secure
    transfer of information about the products and services (Mishra et al., 2016).
    Companies need to keep pace with the continuous development of digital technologies
    to secure or monitor their entire value chain activities. Multinational and local
    agri-food companies are looking for various solutions to keep up with the rapid
    changes in the market. Also, food safety concerns of the consumers and their desires
    for learning the background of the product enforce the producers to improve their
    marketing strategies. Digitalization appears as an easy and effective solution
    to these problems and as a result the demand for digital technologies of the companies
    increases exponentially. Digital technologies such as IoT and blockchain offer
    promising results in terms of transparency, sustainability and safety of food
    supply chains with some special softwares and applications. Connecting-food, Genuieneway
    and Seed Trace can be given as examples of these digital platforms. On the other
    hand, another platform named IBM Food Trust claims to help food companies remove
    supply chain inefficiencies, preventing food waste, increasing food safety (Foodcirle,
    2022). Cloud computing, a new kind of commercial computing model, can be integrated
    into the design of supply chains without a need for radical changes. It can be
    used for data analyses, transportation management, supply chain planning and demand
    prediction (Bhoir and Patil, 2014). Digital transformation covers not only the
    use of new technologies but also the changes in thought, organizational behavior
    and culture. It is important for reacting against sudden changing scenarios, dynamic
    demands and innovative techniques and adapting to new challenging provocations
    (Jekov et al., 2017). Multinational companies have wide organizational structures
    often operating in more than one context, supplying products or services in a
    variety of markets. Nowadays, traditional companies build up venture arms that
    work on and invest in start-ups related with digital applications in agriculture.
    Many multinational companies closely follow digital innovations in agriculture
    and food industry by collaborating with start-ups or university-based research
    groups with venture capital firms and corporations (Prause et al., 2021). Some
    examples of the multinational companies using IoT and related technologies in
    agriculture and food supply chain are given below. The John Deere Field Connect™
    is an IoT-based system of John Deere Agricultural Machinery company which monitors
    soil moisture level, air humidity and other indicators. It sends these signals
    wirelessly to the cloud platform where farmers can view them. Knowing the moisture
    levels real time, farmers can make timely irrigation decisions and distribute
    water more efficiently. The data can also show how much the change in seasons,
    topographical layout and other factors effect moisture retention, leading to better
    farming decisions (Gheorghe, 2019). On the other hand, the proprietary technology
    of Bayer AG company, named Climate FieldView™, collects huge amount of data from
    in-field soil sensors. These data are analyzed and useful information is extracted
    to determine the need of the plant to water, nutrients and minerals. Thus, the
    farmers can decide how to apply the right pesticide, in the right place, at the
    right time, and in the ideal amount. Together with its partner, Microsoft, Bayer
    AG intends to start a great change in conventional agriculture by helping more
    farmers benefit from cloud-based tools and real-time data analytics in data science
    (Bayer, 2022). Cargill, one of the pioneer companies among agriculture and food
    sector, has constructed a system to respond to consumers’ desire for more information
    about how and where their food was grown. Thanks to the coded packages of the
    product (turkey) that the company produced for Thanksgiving, the consumers can
    get the information like the location of the farm, the name of the farmer or family,
    images, etc. (Cargill, 2018). Likewise, adopting digitalization as a driving force
    of innovation for the company, Nestlé uses digital tools for many purposes such
    as increasing visibility, predicting sales performance, shaping promotional activities,
    etc. Moreover, the company benefits from real-time tracking of trucks in transport
    hubs that allows fast rerouting in case of problems, less waiting time and fewer
    wasted truck distances (Nestlé, 2021). In order to survive in the competitive
    commercial environment and meet the requirements of the expanding and health-conscious
    population, today''s farmers and food producers need to use the power of IoT and
    related technologies. Advanced analytics and other techniques give the farmers
    and food producers the required information in the form of they need. 5. Theoretical
    implications This paper provides useful information for the public, other researchers
    and especially policymakers. It has three major theoretical implications. Firstly,
    it brings a holistic approach to the implications of IoT and related technologies
    in agriculture and food industry. In the literature, the studies on the use of
    IoT-based systems have often focused on solely for agricultural applications (Bencini
    et al., 2009; Dagar et al. (2018); Kamienski et al., 2019) or food industry (Liu
    et al., 2020; Jachimczyk et al., 2021; Yakubu et al., 2022), and the ones dealing
    with the integrated applications are very limited. However, the current food safety
    problems such as microbial toxins, pesticide residues, etc. are generally originated
    from the preharvest conditions/applications, continue during transportation and
    storage periods and still exist at the time of consumption. Therefore, food supply
    should be seen as a chain beginning in the field and ending on the table. For
    effective solutions, critical points throughout this whole chain should be determined
    and the required precautions should be taken. Our review emphasizes the need for
    the use of IoT-based systems during the whole supply chain (in both agricultural
    applications and food industry) in an integrated manner. Secondly, this review
    provides a new perspective for solutions to serious problems related to health
    and environment. Microbial contamination and pesticide residues on agricultural
    products can be directly related with human health (Valdes et al., 2009; Bajwa
    and Sandhu, 2014) whereas excessive use of pesticides and pollution caused by
    industrial waste are associated with the environmental concerns (Chowdhary et
    al., 2020). On the other hand, climate change, water scarcity and increasing carbon
    emission are global threats to humanity. Actually, all these issues are closely
    related and interact with each other. Any success in combating any of these challenges
    can spontaneously bring a useful contribution to the solution of another problem.
    The present study can be seen as a first attempt to present collectively potential
    solutions to these specific problems. Since the use of IoT-based systems in agricultural
    practices and food supply chain has just started to be adopted by global companies
    (Prause et al., 2021; Nestlé, 2021; Kraft Heinz, 2022), the implementations of
    these technologies are expected to expand dramatically in the upcoming years.
    Third, from a realistic perspective, the specific challenges of the use of IoT-based
    technologies in agricultural and food systems were addressed in the present paper.
    Since agricultural production is carried out in open places or large areas like
    greenhouses and the agricultural and food products have a non-homogeneous structure
    and also they are very susceptible to environmental factors, the use of IoT-based
    systems in practice is quite challenging. We have noticed that the other investigators
    usually tested the effectiveness of the techniques or softwares, just in the simulations
    (Ruan and Shi, 2016; Jachimczyk et al., 2021), but not in real agricultural or
    food systems. This approach has many reasons. First of all, the IoT concept is
    quite new for the agriculture and food sectors. The people from these sectors,
    also scientists from these disciplines have just been familiar with the IoT-based
    technological systems. This is one of the main reasons for the scarcity of the
    scientific studies on the subject. Furthermore, the use of these technologies
    in agriculture and food industry is quite challenging. Because agricultural and
    food products have their own non-homogeneous and complicated structure. Also,
    agricultural production is conducted in open areas that cannot be entirely controlled.
    So they can be affected by environmental factors. Another obstacle is the season-based
    fluctuations in the supply-demand balance of these products. Finally, from field
    to market, many stakeholders (people, companies, etc.) are actively or passively
    involved in the food supply chain. These stakeholders probably have their own
    valuable data related with the product and these data should completely be shared
    for the success of the supply chain. Failure to do so, also the scarcity of the
    data obtained from the rural areas and lack of educated personnel who know how
    to share all these data are the main obstacles to IoT-based systems in agriculture
    and food industry. Our implications can be linked to the social practices of multinationals
    and especially to their corporate social responsibility policies and strategies.
    The concept of corporate social responsibility relates to companies voluntarily
    integrating social and environmental concerns in their business activities and
    in their relations with stakeholders (European Commission, 2002). This definition
    of corporate social responsibility signifies that corporate performance is judged
    not just by the profits that a company makes, but also by the impacts that firms
    have on social well-being and on the environment (Kapelko et al., 2021). Investing
    in modern technologies to help the beneficiaries can be seen as an example of
    a corporate social responsibility approach. A corporate social responsibility
    project also uses the project as an opportunity for the firm to capture novel
    market opportunities by addressing environmental and social issues. By using the
    knowledge and technology, corporate social responsibility projects can lead to
    innovative ideas (Srivetbodee and Igel, 2021). Eastwood et al. (2019) found that
    there is a positive link between the technological innovation in the agriculture
    context and corporate social responsibility project performance when smart farming
    technologies were introduced. In the near future it is likely that multinational
    agri-food companies will require their stakeholders to include digital technologies
    into their present workflows to benefit from the advantages in the corporate social
    responsibility projects. 6. Conclusion and future prospects Increasing population
    and decreasing the availability of arable lands and water makes supplying sufficient
    food for human consumption quite hard. It results in the increased use of chemicals
    (pesticides, hormones, etc.) in agriculture and thus the increased resistance
    in pests and also public health concerns due to the residues. Moreover, microorganisms
    and their toxins (bacterial toxins, mycotoxins, etc.) can create health risks
    and economic losses in agricultural production conducted in open areas that cannot
    be entirely controlled. The situation is getting even more complicated due to
    the expansion of mycotoxin producing fungi and occurrence of mycotoxins in new
    geographical areas as a result of climate change. The use of IoT-based systems
    can be a reasonable solution to all these chronical problems. These systems would
    be helpful for using water and pesticides at the required places and in the right
    amounts and thus contribute to the product safety and the water efficiency. One
    of the main obstacles of employing IoT-based systems in agriculture and food industry
    is the relatively high cost of installing the required components (equipment,
    software, etc.) of the systems. Problem-specific development of IoT systems and
    the fact that the architecture of the system to be used does not have a certain
    standard also makes it difficult to establish these applications. Furthermore,
    the equipment to be used in IoT-based systems in agriculture and food industry
    is susceptible to breakdowns (probably due to disasters, power outages for a long
    time, etc.) and sabotages (stealing or modifying data) (Bogaardt et al., 2016;
    Misra et al., 2020; Hassoun et al., 2022). So, it is essential to ensure 100%
    cyber-security and technical robustness of the system when human health is taken
    into consideration. When compared, there are not significant differences between
    agriculture and the food supply chain in terms of the components of IoT systems
    (sensors, softwares, etc.) employed. However, the use of these systems is relatively
    harder in agricultural applications. Because agricultural production is usually
    carried out in open places where an entire control is not generally possible.
    The equipment of the systems can be affected by the negative climate conditions
    (rain, extreme high/low temperatures, wind, hail, etc). Also, they are defenseless
    against the attack of birds and wild animals. On the other hand, supply chain
    after agricultural production (food manufacturing, transportation, storage, etc)
    is generally carried out in closed places where total control is available. Therefore,
    the use of IoT and related systems is relatively easier in these periods. The
    quantity and quality of agricultural products are dependent on the seasonal conditions.
    Extreme weather conditions can negatively affect the agricultural yield, cause
    fluctuations in price and disrupt the supply-demand balance. For example, if a
    long drought occurs, the quantity of the product decreases and its price increases.
    Even under these unfavorable conditions, technology-based actions taken by IoT
    systems, such as real-time monitoring of product attributes, tracking of data
    related to the production, manufacturing and storage periods and constructing
    early warning systems against various hazards would be helpful for efficient use
    of limited resources (Bogaardt et al., 2016). Focusing on these evaluations, in
    the future direction of IoT-based systems the following issues are expected: (i)
    They will be more commonly used and their integration into the present agri-food
    systems will increase, (ii) They will boost the efficiency of agricultural production,
    diminish the waste and thus contribute to the sustainability of the limited sources,
    (iii) They will contribute to ease of use of devices for food production and also
    to enhance the quality of the products, (iv) They will enable companies to achieve
    great economic gains in the medium and long term, (v) They will help to raise
    environmental awareness. In the near future, it is unlikely to continue agricultural
    production and food manufacturing without using IoT-based systems. It is most
    likely that the job descriptions of the agricultural and food sector employees
    will be reviewed, probably revised and the qualified workforce definition will
    be reformed. Therefore, it would be very useful to evaluate professional skill
    requirements of today and future and develop strategies to determine new job profiles
    related to agriculture and food industry. Accordingly, training and education
    programs that meet the needs and expectations of the digitalized companies should
    be implemented. Surveys focusing on buying behaviors demonstrated that consumers
    are willing to pay higher prices for the products with a traceability system (Choe
    et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2015). It is obvious that, the use of IoT-based systems
    in agriculture and food industry, as well as in other sectors, will be promoted
    by the governments and their use will expand dramatically in a very short time.
    It is unavoidable that in the near future the agriculture and food industry will
    undergo a great change as the use of IoT-based systems increase due to the increased
    popularity of Industry 4.0. IoT-based systems and related technologies have a
    great potential for the solution of current chronic problems and this digital
    transformation should be seen as an opportunity by the stakeholders from agribusiness.

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) 1. Introduction Nowadays, several municipalities
    implement the smart city model [1] to improve the quality of life for their citizens
    and the efficient use of city resources. Intelligent services can decrease operational
    costs and resource expenditure in smart cities. They can enhance performance and
    operations in a wide variety of smart city applications (SCAs) including transportation,
    healthcare, energy, education, and many more. Smart services are provided by various
    cutting-edge technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples of these technologies
    include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data analytics,
    and robots. IoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful
    human life benefits [2]. IoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart
    things into urban environments where innovative services are offered to support
    every activity at any time and from any location [2]. Things are monitored by
    IoT applications that make direct decisions for their efficient management. Moreover,
    things state their conditions, such as battery status and fault reporting for
    prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state of the infrastructure
    and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices can also obtain physical
    environment information such as temperature. In a CPS, the computation, networking,
    and physical processes are put together to control and monitor the physical environment
    of a smart city [4]. In smart cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical connections
    between the virtual and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can be
    sustained by the ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform
    for computation and IoT data storage [5]. FogC offers reduced latency, greater
    mobility, location awareness, streaming, and real-time response for SCAs [6].
    Smart cities have dispersed vast numbers of sensors, and thus large-scale data
    processing requires a complex infrastructure. Robotics in the cloud can be an
    effective computing tool for IoT applications that require a lot of data processing
    [7]. To improve the services offered by smart cities, big data analytics is employed
    to generate intelligent and optimal temporary and lasting decisions [8]. The abovementioned
    technologies are used to implement numerous smart city services [9,10]. For instance,
    intelligent transportation services are applied to improve route planning and
    avoid jamming in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety and
    make possible self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart traffic
    light controls are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy
    management and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids
    and smart buildings. These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable
    energy. Additional smart services are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges,
    tunnels, water networks, train and subway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural
    health monitoring is also feasible using smart services [11]. Last but not least,
    there are smart services that focus on monitoring the environment, public safety,
    and security of citizens [12]. All these smart city services necessitate a reliable
    networking infrastructure to efficiently exchange messages between the modules
    of a smart city system implementing a particular smart service. In particular,
    smart city services need a variety of networking and communication technologies
    for their completion because they are proposed for dissimilar scales. For example,
    smart services for smart buildings must be implemented based on Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
    or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols. On the other hand, smart services
    for the smart grid must be mainly implemented using the WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) network
    protocol. From another viewpoint, smart city services can exploit dissimilar network
    and communication models and solutions. Until now, the networking and communication
    components of smart city systems have received little research attention. To the
    best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey of network architectures and protocols
    for IoT applications in smart cities does not exist and is the goal of this study.
    The communication and networking issues involved in smart city systems are examined
    in this study. This paper considers networking technologies, topologies, and communication
    requirements for such systems. It also examines if current network protocols are
    appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent developments
    in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active area, this paper
    is important to support new research in this field. The paper contributes as follows:
    It presents network requirements of the major SCAs including intelligent transportation,
    smart buildings, pipeline monitoring and control, smart water networks, smart
    grids, and manufacturing control and monitoring. It reviews networking architectures
    used for the above applications focusing mainly on the protocols’ suitability.
    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;
    Section 3 presents network requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;
    Section 4 and Section 5 analyze protocols and network architectures for smart
    grids, smart buildings, smart water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart
    transportation; Section 6 summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open
    research directions; lastly, Section 8 concludes the paper. Figure 1 provides
    the layout of the survey. Figure 1. The layout of the survey paper. Systematic
    Literature Review Article Selection Method: We provide a Systematic Literature
    Review (SLR) methodology [13] with particular notice to studies related to networking
    architectures or protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. The SLR was employed
    to systematically study networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications
    in smart cities. We proposed a research question to cope with the key issues of
    networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. Question
    Formalization: Key issues and challenges in the field were identified. Such issues
    were network architectures for IoT, network protocols for IoT, IoT applications
    for smart cities, and smart city applications. This study answers the next research
    question: RQ: What is the emphasis of networking architectures or protocols for
    IoT applications in smart cities? This question determines the number of studies
    focusing on network architectures and protocols for IoT applications for smart
    cities that have been published to date to emphasize its significance in smart
    cities. Article Selection Process: The article selection process is performed
    in three stages: Automated keyword-based search; Selection of the article based
    on the title, abstract, and quality of the publication; Elimination of inappropriate
    articles. In the first stage, the search process is automatically performed using
    searching on popular academic databases such as IEEE explorer, ACM, Wiley, Springer,
    Science Direct, SAGE, and Google Scholar. The following search string was defined
    by adding other spellings of the main elements to find relevant articles. The
    search string was as follows: (“IoT” OR “Internet of Things”) AND (“network architecture”
    OR “network protocol” AND “smart cities” OR “smart rural” OR “smart village” OR
    “smart traffic” OR “smart transportation” OR “smart street lights” OR “smart energy”
    OR “smart grid” OR “smart buildings” OR “smart home” OR “smart residence” OR “home
    automation” OR “smart water” or “smart waste management” OR “smart healthcare”
    OR “smart rural” AND “Cloud Computing” OR “edge computing” OR “software-defined
    networking” OR “Artificial Intelligence”). We found 264 articles from journals,
    conference proceedings, books, and patents. These articles were published between
    2013 and 2023. In the article selection based on the quality of the publisher
    stage, the search string was constrained by searching for conference papers and
    journal articles of IEEE, ACM, Sage, Wiley, Science Direct, and Springer, in order
    to guarantee that only high-quality publications and articles were selected for
    the review. Consequently, 240 articles were selected. In the third stage of eliminating
    the inappropriate articles, a Quality Assessment Checklist (QAC) based on [13]
    was developed, wherein those articles emerging from the initial search were refined.
    After reading the abstracts, we eliminated the unrelated articles. The entire
    body of the remaining papers was checked, and those which were not related to
    our concerned field were also crossed out. After eliminating inappropriate articles,
    only 226 studies were identified. 2. Smart City Applications This section discusses
    the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what type of assistance is
    needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs, their advantages and
    design problems were addressed. In the energy sector, SCAs are being used to increase
    the reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of electric energy generation
    and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart grid is a new power grid system
    that automatically collects and reacts to available information about supplier
    and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply self-monitoring and superior
    control mechanisms for power generation and consumer demand, improving grid reliability
    and efficiency. CPS systems are also used to manage the process of producing renewable
    energy from wind turbines [15]. Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings
    to monitor and manage energy consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the
    buildings, including the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems;
    appliances; and lighting systems. Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep
    track of the current state of the environment and energy consumption, are typically
    included in smart building systems. A centralized monitoring and control system
    receives observations and measurements from these sensors. Based on reported observations,
    current operational circumstances, and environmental factors, the control system
    employs intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems employed in the buildings
    to optimize energy consumption. Intelligent transportation is another SCA that
    has attracted a lot of interest in the transportation sector. Applications related
    to vehicle safety are among the most crucial types of such applications. Vehicles
    can be equipped with a variety of safety features, such as blind spot monitoring,
    emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane change warning signs.
    To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-automatic operations.
    Real-time and reliability support in detection and response are these applications’
    most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing vehicle safety must be
    dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects such as threat observations,
    decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software cannot handle
    high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices and guarantee real-time
    and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial
    SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring
    equipment to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed
    data and intelligent software that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.
    Intelligent traffic light controls, which incorporate device monitoring across
    numerous locations to precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application
    of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent
    traffic lights. Water networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase
    their intelligence, efficiency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems
    are integrated into water networks to add smart characteristics to the processes
    of water distribution [19]. Offering early warning systems to identify problems
    in water networks is one of these duties. For instance, it is simple to identify
    leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary fixes can be implemented to prevent water
    wastage and future network threats or damage [20]. WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses
    is another SCA. Such monitoring provides well-organized control for appropriate
    soil, climate, lighting, and water level in greenhouses [21]. Other smart city
    systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control, monitor, and improve
    manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare systems based on edge
    computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine the physical health of users
    [25]. Figure 2 shows some important applications including smart traffic surveillance
    and management, smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste
    management, smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart
    home. Figure 2. Facilitating networking and communication amongst SCAs. Analysis
    of Smart City Applications/Systems This subsection analyses the SCAs shown in
    Figure 2. Smart Traffic Surveillance Systems: These systems are based on centralized
    processes and may fail due to networking problems. Thus, to automate such an innovative
    system, centralized and distributed methods must be used to maintain local servers.
    Javaid et al. [26] suggested a smart traffic management system using a mixture
    of centralized and decentralized processes to optimize the flow of vehicles on
    roads and an algorithm to manage a variety of traffic conditions efficiently.
    In the context of smart cities, effective traffic management implies that a decision-making
    model identifies and quantifies traffic congestion as well as predicts traffic
    patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered a theoretical analysis that takes into account
    such effective traffic management. Notably, existing decision-making models are
    primarily devoted to urban and highway traffic management, not considering the
    closed campuses and collector roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] identified this
    weakness and proposed an IoT-based system model that collects, processes, and
    stores real-time traffic data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based traffic
    management system, various challenges emerge. These challenges include security
    issues, extremely sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required
    adjustments, and specific information fields in the protocol header and structure,
    as well as higher costs. Smart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of
    health parameters, these systems are progressively being associated with and connected
    via the Internet to numerous types of available smart wearable sensing and computing
    devices. These systems face several problems [29] that must be resolved. A security/privacy
    perspective, inter-realm authentication, interoperability issues, device-to-device
    informal communication, and collection and management of medical data are among
    the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30] addressed issues related to cyber-security
    while using IoT for such applications. They sought to examine secure techniques’
    deployment and implementation from the perspective of preventing and reducing
    cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys and reviews [31,32] on smart
    healthcare applications tackle the problem of integrating IoT systems with any
    healthcare application particularly. Weather and Air Quality Monitoring Systems:
    These systems use environmental monitoring stations, which are extremely pricey
    to acquire and maintain. For example, these stations require engineers with specialized
    skill sets and data analysts. Therefore, it is impractical to deploy such monitoring
    stations densely. Instead, they are often deployed sparsely, which creates the
    problem of limited spatial resolutions for useful measurements. Lately, cheap
    monitoring sensors have evolved in the market, significantly assisting in refining
    the granularity of monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors
    [33] emphasized the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with
    air quality monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle
    with the issue of cross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.
    Moreover, these sensors are extremely susceptible to unexpected variations in
    humidity, temperature, and wind direction, and as a result, their accuracy deteriorates
    with time. A recalibration routine might be a way to maintain and enhance such
    accuracy. However, because it would take a lot more time and work, this technique
    is highly improbable and would not work for large-scale deployments. In a weather
    monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex and involves three steps [34]:
    (1) Observing: It can be performed by monitoring satellite imagery, precipitation
    reports, surface data, and gathering data from other nearby forecasters. (2) Forecasting:
    It can be performed by forecasters as short-term and long-term forecasting. Short-term
    forecasting is carried out by evaluating the current weather conditions and projecting
    them over the next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics of the weather.
    Long-term forecasting, however, is possible through weather (numerical) modeling
    and the projection of such modeling using computer simulations. To produce these
    simulations for future forecasting, these modeling techniques use environmental
    data from satellite photography, weather balloons, and surface observations. Following
    completion of the forecasting, the forecasters translate the produced simulated
    expected output into a perceptible format for non-specialists so that they can
    respond appropriately. (3) Communicating: Finally, they communicate such output
    or forecasted information to appropriate authorities. Despite the fact that all
    of these computer models are used to forecast the weather, the success of each
    one is largely influenced by three different elements: (a) the quantity of precise
    data; (b) the length of time needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity
    of dynamic atmospheric weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data
    for a region is the placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed
    distant from rural areas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather
    enough information for desert, sea, or even rural areas to supply the computer
    models used to predict weather conditions accurately. Forecasters also use satellite
    data to combat this issue. However, because of cloud cover and significant changes
    in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, satellite data accuracy can occasionally
    be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and map information or surface/land
    features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence, it further impacts temperature
    and precipitation values significantly. This further makes things harder for a
    computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there is a need to re-evaluate and
    re-modify such models’ mathematical equations so that they can predict the changes
    more accurately. Smart Waste Management Systems: Automated smart waste management
    is crucial for the following reasons: (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure;
    (2) thin or delicate waste collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective
    waste logistics management; (4) insufficient use of cutting-edge trash treatment
    and recycling technologies; and (5) lack of workers and specialists with the necessary
    technical and non-technical skills to handle garbage disposal and the associated
    infrastructures. Smart waste management schemes include various steps such as
    (1) waste collection; (2) differentiation of waste as per their biological and
    physical properties; (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage disposal
    infrastructures/treatment plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova
    and Porras [35] identified issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing
    data from smart deployed sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some
    operational issues such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure
    and smartly managing waste vehicle routes. Smart Street Lighting Systems: This
    system is a network-oriented solution that uses streetlights fitted with specific
    actuators and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities and connectivity interfaces
    [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a mechanism that
    gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting with
    the use of smart wireless nodes (fitted out with numerous forms of sensors and
    actuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the streetlights,
    and they are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device. Zanella et
    al. [37] insist that their system could assist in gathering environmental parameters
    such as humidity, air temperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors stated
    that optimizing street lighting efficiency is a paramount concern that must be
    addressed. This monitoring system makes it possible to maximize efficiency since
    it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity in response to the time of
    day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this system is simple and
    built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns that require
    particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions and communication
    among heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right light lamp is critical
    for a power-efficient lighting mechanism. Their selection is based on how effective
    they are in terms of power usage and lifespan. The existing metropolitan system
    relies on Metal Halide (MH) or High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs,
    these bulbs are frequently seen as being inefficient in terms of power consumption
    and requiring significant maintenance, which adds significantly to the cost. In
    addition, the system should be designed following the advised design standards
    (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201) [36]. Currently, there are
    three kinds of control systems for smart lighting systems in use: centralized,
    decentralized, and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a variety
    of security assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem
    thus far. Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and
    security of its residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention,
    dealing with natural calamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data
    collection is first and foremost important for the designing portion of these
    applications. Depending on the gathered facts, the development of intelligence
    (which aids in making important decisions) and the ability to respond swiftly
    and quickly are the issues that require special attention. When it comes to gathering
    data, we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated traffic sensors. A developer
    can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will conduct predictive
    analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore, this
    kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather significant information
    that will help the relevant authorities (e.g., the fire safety department, the
    police department, and law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and
    preventive measures. The concept of widespread surveillance has important benefits
    for security and safety. However, keeping track of such vast amounts of data also
    prompts a lot of worries and issues for designers and developers, including storage;
    the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and, most importantly, the question
    of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track of each individual
    (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether this kind of
    widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such as China and
    India, where a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation. Further, Gharaibeh
    et al. [38] claimed that combining information transmission technologies with
    well-implemented data analytics models is necessary for quick and swift collaboration.
    To save as many lives as possible during natural disasters, it is imperative to
    gather, assess, and communicate vital information to the relevant authorities.
    As a result, there is currently a lot of work being done to enhance the performance
    of information exchange systems. Although this system is based on the IoT concept
    and is relatively simple, it faces important problems that need consideration,
    such as complex networking solutions and information sharing across heterogeneous
    devices on time (time-sensitive application). Smart Residence/Home Automation:
    A smart home has highly developed systems such as a control system for devices
    or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems, TVs, and other smart appliances),
    automated door openers, smart appliances that may send users remote status updates,
    smart refrigerators, and washing machines. A user can control the majority of
    smart home appliances remotely with two recently produced gadgets: Google Home
    and Amazon Echo. In a smart home, the end-user demands a high-speed internet connection,
    so they can access networking sites that control the home with HD live streaming
    services. In contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to
    computing servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence,
    data management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to
    concentrate on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than
    just recommending distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38].
    The concept of smart home automation raises serious concerns about security and
    privacy risks. A smart home includes security monitoring systems with motion sensors,
    wirelessly opening smart door locks, televisions, phones, and other smart appliances
    that are highly outfitted with cameras and microphones. Although these gadgets
    improve the system, little research has been done on their privacy and security
    features. If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we will discover
    that their manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.
    Indeed, Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully
    examining Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market.
    They argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already
    more privileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated applications.
    As a result, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this, according to a published
    document by WikiLeaks [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the
    tools to access, control, and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the
    world. Furthermore, criminal entities and hackers could seize control of smart
    personal devices, capture delicate private information, and exploit that information
    immorally typically through user tracking and profiling. Additionally, a hacker
    may break into one of these smart applications, grab vital information, and then
    use it to launch any kind of attack. For instance, based on motion sensors, security
    camera feeds, and power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where and when
    to break into the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized
    parties, they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware
    and software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard
    against all these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators, etc.,
    are impervious to such security and privacy attacks. Smart Grid Networks: The
    functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirectional (i.e., electricity
    is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers). Electricity
    has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks to the
    deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in an open-loop
    fashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures in the
    distribution sector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little or no real-time
    knowledge of the system’s operating conditions and dynamically changing load.
    There are also several technical, economic, and environmental problems with this
    conventional approach. Therefore, this conventional system must become dependable,
    manageable, and scalable, as well as flexible, secure, and interoperable [42].
    The smart grid is the next invention of the Electric Power System (EPS) that incorporates
    quicker, more secure, and reliable communication networks [43]. Smart grids supplement
    the conventional electricity grid by incorporating renewable energy sources such
    as biomass, solar energy, and wind energy. These energy sources are much cleaner
    and more ecologically friendly than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil
    fuels. However, it is important to identify the most suitable communication technology
    for the smart grid’s successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s
    overall communication style is unique compared with conventional network communication
    patterns. The communication network architecture of the smart grid must be able
    to handle information exchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,
    and numerous smart meters in such a particular environment with little to no human
    intervention. This type of communication, called Device-to-Device (D2D) communication,
    is autonomous and may be initiated in response to an event or at regular intervals.
    Notably, depending on how these smart grid applications were built, their QoS
    requirements and characteristics differ greatly in terms of delay, burst size,
    and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement of a smart meter
    event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent grid networks,
    the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the same network present
    the issues of flexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications based on the
    smart grid can be developed and implemented using the current wireless and wired
    networking infrastructure and technologies. For some devices, such as smart meters,
    designing and standardizing acceptable smart grid-based protocols is a critical
    matter [45]. Furthermore, these smart grid-based networks are too dependent on
    intelligent sensors, actuators, and other devices. This makes them extremely vulnerable
    to attacks by malicious users. These smart grids could be taken over by malevolent
    users or hackers, who could then obtain unauthorized access to many smart meters
    and alter crucial data. Moreover, as the existing electricity system is insufficient
    for establishing smart grid systems, high-level adjustments to current power infrastructure
    scenarios are required. Subsequently, these smart systems require high installation
    costs because the installation requires a large number of smart meters, sensors,
    and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efficient operation of
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free
    network channel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent
    applications. Many surveys [42,43,44,45,47] reviewed communication frameworks
    for smart grids, smart-grid-based networking technologies, traffic management,
    and the requirements of numerous smart grid applications. Further, Kansal and
    Bose [48] presented their insights on transmission grid applications regarding
    their latency and bandwidth requirements. 3. Network Requirements for SCAs This
    section considers several communication requirements including reliability, delay
    tolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security, network type, heterogeneous
    network support, and mobility support. It also studies the aptness of different
    network protocols for dissimilar SCAs. Smart city services and applications need
    robust and dependable communication support as well as an effective networking
    infrastructure, which will permit competent message-sharing procedures among the
    components of the smart city systems [49]. Every smart city system has an intricate
    networking architecture made up of various networking components. Therefore, smart
    city systems are innately required to have a variety of networking requirements.
    To access the far-off destination, which may be clouds, the network traffic from
    a broad variety of deployed diverse applications uses a common networking architecture
    and resources. These resources may consist of switches, routers, communication
    connections (links), and other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing
    faraway clouds or far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently
    brings up problems with high packet loss probability, significant delay, and constrained
    network bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered
    when developing, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart
    cities. Otherwise, users would be reluctant to approve the use of such applications
    in the absence of adequate security safeguards. Such intelligent applications
    need a high-speed networking environment where the quick reaction may be managed
    with the support of the ability of a fast-processing speed. Furthermore, a variety
    of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city, based on their usefulness
    and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have different networking
    requirements, particularly in terms of response and security [50]. For example,
    the networking requirements of smart emergency response systems are quite different
    compared to other applications such as smart healthcare systems. Emergency response
    smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick to react [50]. In contrast,
    smart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily need to be especially
    dynamic. − Network Protocols: Monitoring applications for smart cities often use
    a dense network of heterogeneous sensor nodes, including fixed sensor nodes, mobile
    sensor nodes, and crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for
    Machines (LTE-M), extended coverage GSM IoT, and fifth-generation (5G) technologies
    [52] are intriguing options to support such heterogeneous networks. First, the
    bulk of crowd-sensing nodes (smartphones) is already supported by LTE communications.
    Consequently, no further wireless communication devices are required. To save
    energy, LTE and 5G can be utilized on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads)
    to allow the data gathered by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring
    center via base stations (the backbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.
    − Zigbee [53], WiFi, and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary
    nodes to communicate within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing
    the sensor node clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network
    connectivity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes
    maintenance simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies
    also make possible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance
    of real-time monitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance, can
    accommodate video streams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.
    The fast data rates provided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous for
    the sink nodes or clusters. The use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)
    in structural health monitoring applications of bridges, tunnels, or towers is
    fairly common. The cluster heads will be able to send the vibration data in this
    situation in real time. In conclusion, practically all applications for smart
    city monitoring that demand a high data throughput and minimal delay may be satisfied
    by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there are some new sensor node standards, such as
    IEEE 802.11 ah [55], LoRaWAN [56], and Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband
    protocols offer numerous advantages: greater coverage, improved scalability, reduced
    energy usage, and increased device longevity. Researchers have tested these standards
    in more than a few applications, including street lighting, energy metering, and
    home automation, even though some are still being discussed and revised. The new
    narrowband communication standards enable the sensor nodes to run more sustainably,
    which is beneficial for applications that aim for long-term monitoring. In addition
    to these protocols and standards, the FogC architecture [58] aids in monitoring
    smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile users (the potential crowd-sensing
    providers) and the cloud are connected via fog servers. These fog servers are
    WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users are more inclined to
    participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing measurements
    to the fog server in just one hop, significantly decreasing the cost and energy
    usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the
    FogC architecture, such as the nearby traffic conditions. The service latency
    and response time are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates
    directly from the fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone
    network. Lastly, using the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is crucial
    to getting the best possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and cost. The
    networks may be hierarchical so that diverse roles and functions can be assigned
    at various layers to increase the networks’ dependability and cost-effectiveness.
    As a result, certain nodes may be able to transmit data utilizing various protocols.
    − Bandwidth requirements: Many video applications in smart cities require high
    bandwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors capture video from the physical
    environment. Moreover, video transmission is more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional
    scalar data traffic in IoT. Examples of these applications are intelligent multimedia
    surveillance systems for home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring
    systems, traffic monitoring systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based
    monitoring of an environmental system. − Delay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart
    transportation, only tolerate a small amount of end-to-end delay. For example,
    to prevent imminent danger to the vehicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data
    that are being relayed must arrive within microseconds. Therefore, the control
    systems must react in time. However, other applications have a higher tolerance
    for delays [49]. Such applications rely on data monitoring and information gathering
    for upcoming analysis. − Power Consumption: Another crucial need for applications
    is power consumption. Smart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy
    sources can tolerate protocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45]. Other
    applications have medium power needs and require energy sources with limited capacities.
    One example of such an application is intelligent transportation. Other applications
    demand protocols with low or very low energy consumption characteristics since
    they have limited energy resources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), smart water
    networks, and pipeline monitoring for gas and oil are a few examples of such uses.
    − Reliability: The majority of applications have medium reliability requirements.
    A typical example of such applications is smart water networks. Some other applications
    have high-reliability necessities such as intelligent transportation and smart
    grids [49]. − Security: The majority of applications need medium to high security.
    Applications such as production control and monitoring, for instance, need medium
    security, whilst others, such as smart grids, need high security because of the
    sensitivity of the data and the importance of the operations carried out [50].
    − Heterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city systems use networking
    protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent transportation and
    smart buildings are two examples of such systems. These protocols must coexist
    in such situations without conflicting with one another. To ensure seamless and
    effective operation, it is also necessary to correctly map the control information
    in the headers at the various networking stack tiers used by the many heterogeneous
    protocols and networks. − Wired/wireless connectivity: The majority of SCAs that
    include wireless connectivity are UAVs and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines.
    Others, including intelligent transportation and smart buildings, use wired and
    wireless connectivity [50]. In these situations, wired networking may be used
    for communication within a specific physical system (such as within a UAV), while
    wireless communication may be used to link the physical system to other such systems
    that are comparable to it or to the backbone and infrastructure networks. − Mobility:
    Some systems, such as the smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil, and
    smart water networks, have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such as
    UAVs and intelligent transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility
    smart city systems can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and
    adaptable to node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control
    messages and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.
    Table 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network
    with low, medium, or high traffic rates and supporting high or low mobility of
    devices. Each SCA is based on different protocols and requires different bandwidth
    and latency tolerance. In each SCA, the number of devices involved differs. Table
    1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements. 3.1. Additional
    Challenges − Interoperability: Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous
    networking protocols that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at
    the physical and data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated
    seamlessly, these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks,
    the IEEE 1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface
    between physical/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this
    function. Future research should focus on the creation of similar protocols to
    increase the support system for smart city systems. − Scalability: A smart city
    platform must manage many devices that are connected to the city’s infrastructure.
    Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously produced and consumed
    by devices and client applications, must be stored and processed. The platform
    must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests from users and services
    that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change depending on the features
    of the city as well as the installed applications and services. Recently, Del
    Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source smart
    city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale systems,
    apps, and services for smart cities. − Load Balancing: To maximize the usage of
    resources, load balancing assigns appropriate resources (i.e., network resources,
    storage capacity, computational resources, and energy resources) to user tasks.
    A large-scale IoT network performs better and avoids overload thanks to an effective
    load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time, cost, throughput, performance, and
    resource usage are all improved in terms of QoS parameters. − The Cloud/Edge/FogC
    Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation of smart city prototypes.
    These computing paradigms efficiently aid in the gathering, upkeep, and analysis
    of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that demand advanced processing
    and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems for smart cities
    have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time applications present
    the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently, FogC and Edge Computing
    have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing, implementing, deploying,
    and controlling such systems/applications. These paradigms bring computing resources
    closer to the IoT/device plane so that the primary computation can be done locally
    [65,66]. Each computing paradigm offers particular assistance based on the requirements
    of the application at hand. For example, to support a cloud-based SCA, ClCom offers
    centralized storage and processing capacity. For certain SCAs, ClCom can offer
    scalable processing power and data storage [5]. The features of ClCom (e.g., powerful
    processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge software services)
    can be used to provide various support services for a variety of SCAs. ClCom can
    be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The city’s ClCom services
    can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs to gather, process,
    store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes of data are gathered
    across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The sophisticated platforms
    required for storing and analyzing this massive amount of data to improve operations
    and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing. To effectively support SCAs,
    the communication between city sensors and actuators and ClCom may involve various
    communication requirements. The network architectures used in the smart city should
    meet these requirements. Smart applications require the integration of sensors,
    actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function well with a robust network
    that offers good communication services linking both sides. The fact that cloud
    services are either provided at a single central location or across numerous distributed
    platforms in various locations is another problem that occurs when adopting ClCom
    for a smart city. For many cloud applications, the distributed ClCom strategy
    can offer greater quality and dependability support [67]. However, it is frequently
    necessary to establish effective communication channels between the distributed
    ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability and
    efficiency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control
    of network resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot be
    avoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated the QoS
    requirements of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment to recognize
    QoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog) that is inspired
    by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture [69] for a
    FogC system. 3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks A smart city
    network has the following features [70]: Large Densities: A smart city network
    has a very large density as thousands of smart devices are distributed in the
    area of a city. Abnormal Traffic Patterns: Cascading or synchronization among
    smart devices produces extremely bursty or correlated traffic patterns. These
    traffic patterns differ from the regular social-generated traffic patterns on
    which most existing schemes and technology used in our society are based. Disorganized
    Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless connectivity features, smart
    city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology. The problem arises when
    smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless channels, where packet losses
    caused by wireless channel special properties are extremely common and eventually
    have an impact on the functioning of the smart city system. Therefore, it appears
    very improbable that a single high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.
    Heterogeneity: SCAs use a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,
    latency, throughput, and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates
    at a unique trade-off threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist
    on a single platform. Coexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication
    technologies used in smart cities are distributed over the same radio space. At
    the same time, independent radio infrastructures are connected through a variety
    of wireless channels. Under such circumstances, the SCA must handle interference
    issues with competence. Security and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to
    several risks from malevolent users. The majority of specialized smart sensors,
    actuators, and other intelligent devices are developed by designers without considering
    security measures. Such applications may be highly vulnerable due to hostile actors’
    ease of access to these cutting-edge technologies and potential threats to people’s
    security and privacy. The main challenges for smart city networks are as follows
    [70]: Lack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies
    for Personal Area Networks (PANs) and the IEEE 802.11 groups for wireless LANs
    adopt the concept of single-hop ad-hoc networking. These standards permit direct
    communication between two devices that are in the transmission range of each other.
    At the same time, the multi-hop ad-hoc networking paradigm enables the communication
    between any two devices which are not necessarily in their transmission range
    [71]. A problem that researchers must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous
    sets of devices (i.e., actuators, sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate
    uniformly without any standardization. Global distributors and manufacturers must
    propose and accept standardized network solutions that enable communication between
    diverse devices on homogeneous communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    is the dominant solution that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical
    Layer. This standard deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication
    range, and power consumption. Several revisions or amendments (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g
    and IEEE 802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released. The IEEE 802.15.4g
    amendment allows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing data rates and communication
    ranges compatible with neighborhood mesh (wide) networks. Then, it is followed
    by another cutting-edge modification, known as IEEE 802.15.4e, which modifies
    and enhances the method used by devices to access wireless channels while also
    using time-slotted channel hopping mode. This hopping mode further delivers low-power
    consumption and improved dependability. From another viewpoint, many researchers
    customized appropriate upper-layer protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They
    made the necessary modifications there to make smart applications compatible with
    conventional infrastructure. Since the network of low-power smart devices is confined,
    the researchers developed numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make
    them easily adaptable. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72]
    and 6LoWPAN [73], which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.
    Interference problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same
    radio space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless
    channels. Because of this, the smart application must handle interference problems
    in such situations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate
    and be compatible with one another. Vertical handover (soft): Multiple radios
    are used by the rapidly expanding number of smart devices being developed. These
    devices should be able to recognize and use the best interface that is currently
    available while balancing power usage and throughput. D2D Communications: In the
    IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication demands. Unfortunately, conventional
    network gateways cannot handle such generated messages from heterogeneous devices.
    Short Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support and recommend acceptable
    performance for longer data packet scenarios. However, smart devices communicate
    with one another using short messages (since most of them are tiny and operate
    over low-powered battery devices). To this end, short communicating messages will
    positively impact network congestion detection and avoidance policies and promote
    in-band aggregation. Local Network Traffic Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-specific
    devices frequently use the same network infrastructure. However, most cellular
    data networks are exclusively planned, implemented, deployed, and managed for
    smartphone usage. Fitting traffic from these heterogeneous devices onto a single
    platform is now the main challenge that cellular data network providers face.
    It is difficult to integrate the traffic from these two types of heterogeneous
    devices into the same network infrastructure due to several intrinsic factors
    and the specified features of this traditional network. Additionally, D2D devices
    use a more significant proportion of scarce resources than smartphones, unnecessarily
    creating a problem of unfairness in the system [74]. Therefore, we must first
    comprehend D2D traffic patterns and how they differ from traffic patterns generated
    by smartphones. Understanding traffic patterns can provide insights into managing
    and allocating shared network resources more effectively and guarantee the highest
    level of service quality for both types of devices. Security mechanisms: Denial
    of Service (DoS) attacks are a remarkable threat to the security of smart city
    networks and must be identified. Some statistical methods have been proposed to
    solve this problem. Such a statistical method is presented in [75] that is based
    on feature distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis process. Another
    security mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying users and devices
    in a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-manipulated devices.
    Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT systems such as the
    reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation attack, and the
    Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be encrypted.
    However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might be able
    to embed general-purpose microprocessors for this task. In addition, low resources
    and constrained devices can only embed application-specific integrated circuits.
    Therefore, conventional cryptographic primitives are not suitable for low-resource
    smart devices due to their low computation power, limited battery life, small
    size, small memory, and limited power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography
    may be an efficient encryption for these devices. Trust management is another
    security mechanism that detects and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure
    access control. Automated and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate
    the trust values of the participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of
    trust management schemes focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based
    access control methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large
    number of smart things storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,
    transparent, and easy access control management so that different nodes/users
    can be granted different levels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain
    technology can be used to create secure virtual zones where things can identify
    and trust each other [77]. Self-organization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can also
    be planned to set up the relationship between Blockchain and IoT, as suggested
    in [78]. Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that flow through
    the IoT system can vary to a great extent, in terms of either format, shape (in
    time and space), and semantics. Therefore, the process of separating normal from
    abnormal sensed data is extremely demanding. In the context of IoT applications,
    sensors are the real source of big data, which suggests that anomaly detection
    at the edge could be a powerful tool to address the inevitable data communication
    bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is concerned with identifying data patterns that
    deviate remarkably from the expected behavior. This is critical in the process
    of finding out important information about the IoT system’s functioning, detecting
    abnormalities that are often rare or difficult to model or, otherwise, to predict
    [79]. A timely identification of anomalies is vital to preventing IoT system failure.
    Advanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artificial intelligence (AI), machine
    learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) play a key role in the evolution
    of the smart city sectors [80]. These techniques are now being developed as solutions
    for completely automated IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal
    analysis of the big data is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing
    DRL/ML approaches can improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency;
    and increase precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality
    prediction, person detection, traffic management, etc. For example, an intelligent
    transportation system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize
    self-driving vehicles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques
    are also used to precisely monitor and estimate the real-time traffic flow data
    in an urban environment. In SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned
    techniques can enhance the safety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,
    management, and power grid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective
    use of smart meter big data for different applications such as load assessment
    and prediction, baseline estimation, demand response, load clustering, and malicious
    data deception attacks. In health intelligence, extensive use of AI, ML, and DRL
    techniques is implemented due to high-performance IoT devices, Cloud Computing,
    and an increase in data rates. These techniques can play a vital role in disease
    diagnosis, cure prediction, social media analytics for a particular disease, and
    medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role of AI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques
    is also outstanding. These techniques can be used from an advanced security perspective
    of IoT to confront security threats. Notably, the accuracy and precision of the
    aforementioned techniques can be further enhanced by increasing the amount of
    training data to strengthen their learning capabilities and hence the automated
    decision efficiencies [82]. 4. Protocols Used for SCAs Figure 3 shows a proposed
    taxonomy of networking protocols and architectures for SCAs. It also shows the
    challenges in IoT communications via TCP/IP. Figure 3. A taxonomy of technologies
    facilitating communication and networking for smart cities with IoT-enabled application
    protocols and suggested networking architectures and protocols. SCAs involve numerous
    smart things that operate on low-powered battery devices [83]. New connectivity
    solutions are being investigated in light of the following question: do the currently
    available methods, tools, and techniques—especially those for wireless networks—allow
    for the reliable handling of such a large number of smart devices? Yaqoob et al.
    [84] provided details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN technologies
    such as ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D communication.
    In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of connected devices,
    transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies (e.g.,
    WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve significant power consumption and are only partially
    applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies and communication
    strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication perspective.
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput performance
    for fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior context.
    Due to the limitations of its initial design, this standard does not support IoT
    applications. Hence, to enable IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the
    community (IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efficient protocol
    [55]. They aim to create a system that enables effective communication between
    several indoor and outdoor devices. Nevertheless, the real-time implementation
    of IEEE 802.11 ah may need to be improved by the absence of an appropriate interference
    mechanism. IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n,
    Cellular 3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of
    standards and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various
    SCAs. Smart home automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems
    require short-range communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g.,
    Bluetooth and Zigbee) from the WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by
    a lower bandwidth requirement, minimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication
    infrastructure environment. In contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used for
    SCAs that require longer-range communication. Such applications are smart transportation
    management systems. The protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular and WiMAX,
    can be adopted by applications that need wide-range communication, such as smart
    emergency response systems, weather and air quality monitoring systems, and smart
    grid systems. These features designed in terms of standards or protocols have
    enough capability that allows for both synchronous and asynchronous data connections.
    The best-effort traffic (which can effectively tolerate latency) allows the asynchronous
    data connections feature to be linked with smart city services or applications.
    Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connections is possible for those services
    or applications that generate traffic mandating strict QoS standards such as low
    latency and high accessible network capacity [49]. Since IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee)
    is a short-range (low bit rate) communication protocol that often suggests higher
    flexibility for small devices running on low power, such a protocol can significantly
    increase network lifetime. Moreover, such a protocol encourages and indicates
    support for applications and services with relatively relaxed latency and throughput
    conditions in WPANs. The authors of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4
    and proposed an intelligent system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted
    the benefits of using wireless emulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation
    and deployment, relatively easier in expanding a network, and flexibility in the
    system due to the use of wireless technology, which supports the usage of heterogeneous
    devices in the same implemented and deployed structure. Furthermore, they emphasized
    the advantages of employing the same intelligent infrastructure for a variety
    of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring, and cost-effectiveness.
    For example, by including specific smart metering devices such as water or gas
    meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established to
    target smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering applications.
    5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called BDMA and FBMC multiple
    access, which was first launched in 2015. In the case of BDMA multiple access,
    an orthogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that resources can be distributed
    in parallel to each mobile base station by dividing the antenna beam in accordance
    with the position of the mobile stations to enable multiple accesses to the base
    stations. Successively, this helps in improving the capacity of 5G networks [86].
    Specifically, the idea of moving towards 5G is based on current technology advancements
    and particularly on unique customer needs. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed
    that implemented 5G cellular networks should address noteworthy complications
    that are not successfully addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced network capacity and
    data rate, lower End-to-End (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and consistent user QoE
    provisioning. In addition, massive and rapid growth in the number of highly developed
    connected devices leads to a sharp increase in network traffic and a widening
    range of applications with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta and
    Jha [86] studied numerous facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive
    MIMO, traffic and power management policies, offloading (local), and self-configuring
    and organizing networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time
    managing and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days
    thanks to 5G. 5G ultimately targets some networking possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable
    and Low-Latency Communications (uRLLC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and
    massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC). In a smart city context, eMBB controls
    data transfer between a variety of networked user end devices, edge devices, or
    cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC aims to manage huge connected, complex devices,
    such as wearables, actuators, and sensors, through dense urban deployment. Finally,
    uRLLC takes responsibility for managing highly time-critical communication such
    as vehicular communication, base stations, and edge devices communication [87].
    Although 5G has completely brought about a new revolution in the field of networking,
    numerous unknown challenges still are possible in these cases of communication
    when 5G is deployed in the context of smart cities. One major problem is power-efficient
    communication, especially when communicating low-powered battery devices such
    as sensors and other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when two distinct
    technologies (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Specific device-level
    compatibility problems might always persist when communication infrastructures
    migrate to next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely,
    how to handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or
    difficult-to-reach places, as well as the potential high costs associated with
    building and maintaining 5G networks. Table 2 compares protocols used for smart
    cities, while Table 3 evaluates standards utilizing features and characteristics.
    Table 2. Comparison of protocols used for smart cities. Adapted and extended from
    [49,84,88]. Table 3. Evaluation of standards utilizing their features. 4.1. IEEE
    802.11 Standards Table 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features. Table
    4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features. 4.2. IEEE 802.15.1 The
    IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave time
    division duplex mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with
    a 1 Mbps data rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services
    designed to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include
    Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the
    IoT [98]. The deployment of services offered for tracking and localization devices
    is typically suggested by BLE-based devices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.
    These beacons produce a signal that other compatible devices can pick up between
    50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises greater indoor localization accuracy
    than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can be used for a wide range
    of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch of points of
    sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally, to provide
    specific services of interest, it is frequently required to combine the BLE technology
    with other technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the aim of BLE technology
    (Bluetooth Classic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous wireless connection,
    i.e., BlueTooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR). It became the perfect
    option for the IoT since it permits connectivity and audio-streaming applications
    using brief bursts of long-distance radio, which lowers the battery consumption
    of mobile devices (because they need not be connected all the time). Using the
    idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE specification, smartphones or regular
    phones can be linked to other heterogeneous devices (such as headphones) in BR/EDR
    mode. Otherwise, they can be connected to wearables in LE mode. A low-power radio
    called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends to broadcast data across 79 channels in the
    2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. Wireless audio streaming is primarily made
    possible through BCR, which has evolved into the industry-standard radio protocol
    for in-car entertainment systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims
    to transmit data over 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To
    facilitate the deployment of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks
    to provide support for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast;
    and, most notably, mesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create
    distribution and locating maps utilizing fingerprint templates for indoor device
    and user localization. Due to BLE’s greater susceptibility to abrupt fading and
    substantial changes in received signal strength, it has been proven that using
    BLE is more efficient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101]. However, Bluetooth
    technology has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly when its BR/EDR
    mode is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the master nodes
    to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered
    a variety of scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the
    BR/EDR mode reveals a lack of scalability that further restricts the performance
    of the system. 4.3. LoRA The LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications
    and operated as a low-data-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum
    that could go up to 10 km. LoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth: 125,
    250, and 500 KHz. Even while this technology can function at the largest bandwidth
    class, which further improves data rate, it still causes issues with high power
    consumption, a shorter communication range, and an increase in the likelihood
    of interference because it is free to operate in a wider frequency spectrum. This
    method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation and a CSSM variant
    with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission range will expand
    as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption will rise as
    well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby making it resilient
    to channel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not differentiate the noise
    in the channel such as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK modulation approach, which
    normally identifies signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise floor, the CSSM
    feature enables this technology to sense, perceive, and capture signals that are
    19.5 dB below the noise floor [103]. Its architecture uses a star network topology
    and includes gateways and end nodes. In this design, end nodes are referred to
    as slaves and run on battery-powered devices with limited power, but gateways
    are thought of as powerful machines that gather data from slave nodes. Furthermore,
    LoRaWAN is a communication layer that operates on top of LoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates
    the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability and suitability for
    low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over cellular technologies,
    which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice, LoRaWAN improved
    network features and functionalities by addressing the concept of a specialized
    server (network) and specifically defining numerous device types to meet the needs
    of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet filtering, and
    packet scheduling are all made possible using specialized network servers. LoRaWAN
    has also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission power and
    rate, which aids in optimizing network performance in terms of power consumption
    and throughput. This technology can be employed for a wide range of applications,
    such as smart health nursing [104], traffic monitoring [105], agriculture monitoring
    [106], localization [107], and smart grid applications [108]. In particular, this
    technology is useful for non-latency-sensitive applications and those that call
    for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al. [109] and Adelantado et al. [110]
    emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart metering, tracking, and localization-based
    applications. At the same time, it is not so feasible for real-time monitoring
    and video surveillance. 4.4. WiMAX WiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential
    peak data rate of 60 Mbps for an entire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps
    for an entirely uplink operation, based on the original IEEE 802.16 air interface
    standard (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amendment [112]. It can be done using
    two antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz. Additionally, it may provide
    support for multimedia services with different traffic characteristics and wide
    area mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety of QoS
    scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous traffic, such as Internet data
    traffic, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio traffic, and voice and video streams
    [113]. Table 5 shows the specified WiMAX standards and their operational parameters
    [114]. This standard provides a communication channel between geographically separated
    devices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges between 30
    km and 100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such as high installation
    costs and the possibility of complications and irregularities when dealing with
    high-definition multimedia traffic. Table 5. WiMAX standards and their operational
    parameters. Wireless network traffic has recently increased extraordinarily due
    to the rapid proliferation of smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators.
    These devices, along with smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based
    specialized devices, are the most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network
    environments. In such a dense network environment, interference is a critical
    issue that must be addressed if satisfactory performance and, thus, proficient
    spatial frequency reuse is required. Subsequently, the standards IEEE 802.11 were
    designed and implemented to support these requirements. Numerous international
    organizations, including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved their technologies
    in response to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance, the original
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior throughput
    performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as
    a result, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a result,
    to address the challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group
    (TG) was formed by the IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to redesign and
    extend the applicability of WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They focused on the
    critical issue of power-aware efficient schemes and protocols to extend the functionality
    and applicability of 802.11-based networks while dealing with a variety of small
    power-constrained smart outdoor and indoor devices [55,97]. 4.5. Challenges in
    IoT Communication Using the TCP/IP Protocol Suite In IoT, smart sensing motes,
    devices, and actuators share unique features such as constrained memory, power,
    and processing capabilities; the need for facilitating real-time requirements
    of smart applications; extremely vulnerable radio environments; and little to
    no human involvement after deployment [115]. By enabling communication amongst
    these devices utilizing low-power-cost technologies, a new infrastructure for
    deployed smart services has been formed. Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP
    protocol suite might provide a solution and be flexible enough for a variety of
    evolving IoT communication scenarios. Unfortunately, there were additional challenges
    that network administrators, designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers
    were searching for the best way to install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally
    use the system’s limited resources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of such
    power constraints, researchers highlighted the requirements of low-power Layer-2
    technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4) and low-power WiFi usage. In contrast
    with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies operate with smaller maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission speeds. IoT network protocol
    designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining the ideal MTU size. Another
    obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless networks and
    thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies. This vulnerability
    brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture: (1) The current IP addressing
    model cannot assist mesh communication (since it relies on a multi-link subnet
    prototype) at all. (2) In mesh communication, the multicasting and broadcasting
    communication methods are quite expensive, power-demanding, and prohibitive as
    the network nodes are extremely power constrained. Moreover, unicasting is the
    only remaining alternative method. (3) Unicasting is power intensive in and of
    itself because it may take many hops while forwarding and may wake up an excessive
    number of nodes that are asleep. Notably, idle nodes and hops can modify the radio
    state’s operation mode to save power. Additionally, a large amount of power is
    used and saved by a node during transmission, reception, overhearing, idle, and
    sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful delivery, we cannot just
    alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective coordination and intricate
    synchronization [117,118]. (4) There is a high requirement for scalable routing/forwarding
    schemes for IP communication to take place over mesh architectural systems. (5)
    For many IoT applications requiring data prioritizing and customized control,
    original TCP-suited features such as those operational on fixed MSS sizes (such
    as MTU sizes) that further lead to silly window syndrome or in-order byte-stream
    delivery to ensure dependability, are unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF
    started defining standard Internet protocols such as RPL [120] for such specialized
    environments to minimize protocol overheads that impair the computing ability
    and memory management of these specialized resource-constrained devices. WiFi-based
    infrastructure networks enable backhauling support, which helps establish and
    sustain seamless connectivity among smart IoT devices. In smart home wireless
    networks, this form of connectivity can be provided through TCP connections. The
    TCP/IP protocol suite supports dependable data delivery and congestion control
    strategies to maintain network throughput performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP
    is a protocol that has been regularly modified and improved over the years to
    effectively transport large amounts of byte-stream in-ordered data via resilient
    P2P connections with comparatively lower latency needs. IoT services deal with
    atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP protocol suite-based protocols,
    such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns adequately [119]. There are severe
    problems that TCP faces when it deals with an IoT application: (1) TCP connection
    establishment and termination (three-way handshaking) incur significant overhead
    in the system as most communication in an IoT application includes the transmission
    of brief segments and relatively little data. (2) TCP functionality needs resilient
    P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these connections in an IoT network
    environment because smart sensors and other connected devices switch their mode
    of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119]. (3) Some IoT applications
    might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns, and enabling such patterns
    via TCP will result in substantial network overhead in the entire IoT system and
    high-power consumption. (4) Some IoT services have very granular delay requirements,
    and any extra delay in the form of connection establishment or MSS creation (waiting
    for data to fill the entire MSS) is completely unacceptable for their performance.
    Thus, TCP is unable to provide much support for these IoT services. (5) IoT applications
    that rely on wireless communication scenarios must deal with critical wireless
    channel characteristics such as channel error, interference, and wireless interface
    properties that result in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer contention-induced,
    and collision-induced packet losses. When TCP operates in such a setting, its
    stringent in-order delivery requirements and retransmission policies (i.e., fast
    retransmission) may occasionally result in very serious system problems such as
    Head-of-Line (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in a
    reduction in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121,122,123,124].
    Furthermore, wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may further
    impair TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP Retransmission
    Time Out timer. Some standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement
    Layer-4 functionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed to
    utilize UDP as an underlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should depend
    on an application’s requirements, which may vary from application to application.
    However, TCP and its updated variants rely on the concept of data delivery deferment
    and try to perform retransmissions from an already created copy in the sender
    buffer. However, this is not the only approach to dealing with packet losses in
    the network. Another method is for AppL to accept packet delivery that is not
    completely flawless and proceed with its current operations. This feature will
    be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution. Additionally, retransmission
    is an additional option. However, AppL should handle this retransmission rather
    than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost
    data bits, doing so enables the source application to reconstruct them. Furthermore,
    in situations where real-time services are severely constrained, the transmitting
    application may transmit fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair”
    the effects of the initial loss [126]. Clark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these
    concepts and subsequently introduced the concept of Application Level Framing
    (ALF). Implementing Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself brings the idea of employing
    ALF into the system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF, a network can recognize
    individual Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently can offer support for
    flexible Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission procedures
    for diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using in-network
    caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails
    to provide support for the ALF scheme [119]. 4.6. Compound TCP for IoT Compound
    TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel utilization
    and fairness performances. It will play a significant role in home networks with
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128]. Pokhrel and Williamson [115]
    studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an IoT scenario involving sensors
    and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home appliances). They
    analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of connections made
    using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks in the presence
    of significant buffer-overflow-induced losses and severely degraded transmission
    channel circumstances. The authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements
    for all IoT devices as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional
    bandwidth-hungry Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated
    a thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted
    classical devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overflow-induced losses
    and significantly deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of
    [115,129] suggested models that aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion
    and flow control of several concurrently running competitive long-lived compound
    TCP connections. In evaluating and developing these models, they considered MAC-level
    retransmissions, link-layer contention, channel failures, and collision. The authors
    of [130] utilized a transient model suggesting a new queue management scheme to
    capture the interactions of short-lived TCP flows (the most workable flows in
    IoT scenarios) over conventional traffic patterns over WiFi networks. However,
    the performance of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using
    a single shared Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale
    well and provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially
    when wireless channels are often reused by several APs [131]. 4.7. Viewpoints
    of Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems The network architectures for IoT are
    heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular
    Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due to
    the large-scale production of intelligent sensing devices, survivability and self-organization
    of deployed functional networks are essential. A WSN is deployed for a variety
    of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and military applications. It
    is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which the sensor nodes communicate
    over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered, low-power sensors capable
    of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating, and regulating communication.
    Numerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2, TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have been
    suggested. Therefore, some standards were introduced to enable interaction and
    other compatibilities among these numerous heterogeneous platforms. For example,
    the IEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT.
    WSNs provide critical functionalities for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered
    battery-operated End Devices (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to
    the Internet. A WSN can be considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several
    equipped sensor nodes. Due to the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability
    must be obtained from the viewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability
    issue, various works suggested a standardized arrangement that could enable the
    usage of IP over LoWPAN. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability
    for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard outlines
    the physical and data link layers of the network and offers a low-cost framework
    for network operations. To link LPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may be used as
    an adaptation layer to enable sensors to implement an IP stack and become approachable
    by other conventional devices over the Internet. This adaptability layer also
    supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables a variety of applications and
    permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding algorithms at the Internet
    layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot be supported
    when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72] considers the
    LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained, and they
    are connected by some lossy links that only support low data rates. These links
    are thought to be extremely unstable and have poor performance in terms of packet
    delivery rates. In such specialized networks, the traffic patterns are often P2MP
    and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint (MP2MP) rather than just P2P [72]. These networks
    contain hundreds of smart devices. This makes the implementation of routing policies
    more difficult than ever. In addition, numerous existing traditional ad-hoc wireless
    network routing methods, such as DSR and AODV, cannot manage these unique situations
    and unforeseen circumstances. Designing and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking
    settings has been more difficult due to the mobility aspect and the resource limitations
    at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’ design principles emphasize QoS
    elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end latency [134,135]. The forwarding
    rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations take into account the
    increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the node energy [117,136].
    As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and maintain solely inside their
    operational infrastructure, this was very feasible. However, the interoperability
    of these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when such networks are integrated
    with IoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration with IoT needs novel routing
    policies that support scalability and assure QoS, fairness, and connectivity between
    two nodes (both in APs and ad-hoc networks) with the least amount of power consumption.
    The standard classical forwarding strategies were intended to ensure QoS between
    a pair of devices/nodes. In the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures
    should suggest enough fairness so that each node can sufficiently get enough chances
    to communicate with nearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing
    solutions are followed to decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation.
    Researchers have often raised concerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules,
    which lead to the consumption of excess energy in networks while taking into account
    mobile and static ad-hoc network scenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood
    of frequent network disconnections, route failures, and even network partitioning,
    all contributing to the system’s significant MAC-level and routing-level overhead
    problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the high-power consumption problem,
    many researchers presented numerous smart routing paradigms [118,134,135,137].
    Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the desired QoS. Cross-layer
    design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion control are
    well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless channel
    attributes. Therefore, significant work has been done in these areas. These designs
    provide support for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely variable channel
    parameters at lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing and Transport
    layers to further optimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations decisions
    [121,134,135,138,139,140]. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) indicates
    how well a device can hear a signal from an AP or router. A network layer forwarding
    policy can effectively utilize the RSSI (accessible through lower layers dynamically)
    to assess link quality. AODV and DSR are examples of the traditional ad-hoc routing
    protocols used in various smart forwarding systems designed for IoT scenarios.
    The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing mechanisms were suggested for the IoT
    scenarios and talked about node and link disjoint paths while discovering routes.
    However, the proposed schemes do not shed light and discuss anything related to
    performance issues when there is a significant level of interference in the network
    because of traffic running parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned techniques
    do not always perform well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay. Recently,
    the scheme [140] considered different critical factors such as interference level,
    link-layer contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related
    to wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution
    policies’ efficiency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,
    different possible disjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might
    be able to interfere with one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting
    behavior in wireless communication. Consequently, such separate disconnected pathways
    could be utilized to enhance the performance of the network as a whole [138,140].
    When employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend on WSN-based networking
    connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from smart things to sink nodes.
    These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes (IoT-GW). To balance energy
    usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous such static and mobile IoT-GWs
    can be deployed in the system. In the whole system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous
    types of critical data, are connected to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee
    specified three forms of devices: Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee
    End Device, and three forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh. Moreover,
    the Zigbee stack embraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the case of star
    network topology, the Reduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e., RFDs and FFDs)
    can communicate with the PAN central coordinator only. They are not capable of
    communicating with one another. Here, the PAN coordinator may be powered by mains,
    while the RFDs and FFDs run on low-powered limited battery devices. Moreover,
    in the case of the mesh network topology, any device can communicate to within-range
    devices at a point of time. Moreover, this topology contains a PAN coordinator,
    which can communicate with other RFDs and FFDs. Furthermore, this networking topology
    offers support for the usage of the integrated forwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree
    and AODV routing procedures. Lastly, the tree (cluster) network topology is a
    subset form of mesh networking topology, consisting of RFDs and FFDs (which may
    act as coordinators). However, the FFD count could be more than the RFD count
    in the network. RFDs may attach to tree (cluster) network topology as the end
    nodes in the system. The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization functionalities
    to other connected coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single PAN
    coordinator amongst these coordinators [144]. 4.8. IoT Application Protocols Each
    IoT application is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.
    These protocols can be the following: Representational State Transfer Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is the primary client/server protocol
    that adopts the request/response model. HTPP has been related to the REST architecture
    [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar entities over web-based services.
    The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices to make their status readily
    available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions
    [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE techniques
    of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build a REST model for dissimilar
    IoT devices [148]. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [149]: It is a lightweight
    RESTful protocol lately standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
    CoAP is used by IoT devices for IP-based, HTTP-like interactions. It uses UDP
    with acknowledgment messages to set up reliable communication based on a request/response
    interaction. It has reduced complexity, and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained
    IoT applications and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) [150] is established for IoT messaging. According to MQTT design
    principles, network bandwidth and device resource requirements should be kept
    to a minimum while also aiming to assure dependability and some level of delivery
    assurance. Since June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by ISO as a standard (ISO/IEC
    20922). The protocol continues to progress by formalizing popular capability options
    and adding new functionalities. The most recent version, MQTT v5.0, was released
    in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe paradigm. Clients connect
    to a centralized broker when using MQTT. Open Platform Communications Unified
    Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoperability standard is used for the secure
    and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation domain and other industries.
    It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow of information among
    IoT devices from multiple vendors. It supports two different communication methods:
    the Client/Server method as well as Publish/Subscribe (e.g., over UDP or MQTT)
    to mainly meet different industry requirements from the production systems to
    edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main IoT vendors including IBM, AWS, Google
    Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage secure, standardized information exchange
    in edge-to-cloud applications based on OPC UA. Extensible Messaging and Presence
    Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is based on text messages that
    use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which it can implement both request/response
    and publish/subscribe methods by using suitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant
    messages between clients, and this happens in real-time using a push mechanism
    to avoid increasing unnecessary network loads. XMPP also determines the state
    of an XMPP entity as online, offline, busy, etc. Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
    (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing business messages between applications
    or organizations using TCP. It connects systems, feeds business processes with
    the information they need, and reliably transmits onward the instructions that
    achieve their goals using the point/point and publish/subscribe interaction modes.
    AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of message orientation; queuing; routing;
    security; reliability; and interoperability. Data Distribution Service (DDS) [154]:
    DDS was developed by the Open Management Group (OMG). DDS is a real-time M2M protocol
    that enables dependable, high-performance, interoperable, scalable data exchanges
    using a publish–subscribe pattern. DDS provides low-latency data connectivity,
    high reliability, and scalability in publish–subscribe and request/response patterns
    over TCP and UDP. The needs of various IoT applications requiring real-time data
    exchange can be addressed using DDS. Such applications are air traffic control,
    transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart grid management. Lastly,
    Glaroudis et al. [155] provided a comparison among IoT application protocols in
    terms of well-accepted key performance indicators and discussed their suitability
    in the framework of smart farming. 5. Networking Architectures and Protocols 5.1.
    Generic Architectures Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an
    urban IoT’s enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated
    the implementation of an IoT island as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City
    of Padova. In the IoT, two methods provide data access to objects/things. The
    first involves deploying multi-hop mesh networks with short-range communication
    among network nodes using unlicensed frequency. The second involves using licensed
    frequency band long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM). Centenaro et al.
    [156] presented a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wireless connectivity)
    called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based on a star topology
    characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed
    sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide connectivity
    in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed the
    advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efficiency,
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled
    SCA that uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled
    street lighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental
    research facility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander supports
    testing proposed protocols, services, and configurations in a realistic setting
    at an appropriate scale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is a significant
    part of IoT. Vilajosana and Dohler [159] reviewed currently used smart city M2M
    technologies (i.e., sensors, data loggers, wireless modems, and gateway). They
    considered one of the most famous deployment use cases, i.e., smart parking. In
    any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount of M2M communication requests
    occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways cannot face this challenge.
    Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control model for M2M communications.
    Their model differentiates all M2M requests into delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant.
    Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant requests by routing them into one low-priority
    queue, aiming to reduce the number of requests from various devices to the access
    point in the IoT for smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up
    architecture after analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture
    has four layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each
    layer integrates security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer,
    located at the bottom of the architecture, collects data from physical devices.
    The transmission layer is located above the sensing layer. Several communication
    technologies are used to transmit data from the transmission layer to the (upper)
    data management layer. The data management layer performs data fusion, data analysis,
    data processing, and data storing. It stores valuable information that various
    applications use at the application layer to provide services. The majority of
    the above works mainly focus on a single characteristic, such as quality of service
    [162]. Marques et al. [163] proposed a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities
    infrastructure management architecture that allows the integration of physical
    objects, communication infrastructure, cloud platform, and IoT-based services
    in a pervasive way. This architecture (Figure 4) is generic and includes four
    layers: (1) Physical Objects, (2) Communication, (3) Cloud Platform, and (4) Services.
    Figure 4. Architecture design. Adapted from [163]. The Physical Objects Layer
    enables IoT sensors to collect data that will feed the smart city architecture
    with information used to offer services. After the sensors collect data, a Communication
    Device is used to collect sensor data. A communication device can implement different
    technologies (e.g., RFID, Bluetooth, and Zigbee). Sensor data are processed by
    a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing unit responsible for gathering
    information used by the application providing a service. The local processing
    unit brings elements of edge computing, as it pushes part of the computation to
    edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating all the computation in a centralized
    remote server. The Communication Layer: The architecture supports a variety of
    network access technologies. The communication layer supports the implementation
    of various wireless technologies. The local processing unit located at the Physical
    Objects Layer defines the technology to be used and relays data to the communication
    layer using the interface of a network access point. The Cloud Platform Layer
    provides three services: processing, database queries, and data storage. In the
    context of providing services for smart cities, each of these services can be
    dynamically allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably, only
    some applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation
    is optional. The Services Layer implements four groups, which are called classes
    of services: (I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III) Infrastructure,
    and (IV) Technology. In each class, different kinds of applications can be implemented
    to deal with the challenges of smart cities. This architecture is a generic solution,
    so the underlying layers are designed to offer support to the applications. Therefore,
    it can be adapted to the specific implementation of a given service. To this end,
    the authors adapted their architecture to a waste management scenario. Another
    multi-level smart city architecture [164] was built on semantic web technologies,
    and its design is mostly used in smart city wireless sensor network applications.
    Data collection, data processing, integration and reasoning, and device control
    and alerts make up its four layers. Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s
    edge, Gheisari et al. [165] suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in
    the smart city that protects privacy. Saadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer
    architecture for mobile object authentication in the context of IoT smart cities.
    Their architecture is based on the applicability of a proposed hierarchical elliptic
    curve identity-based signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167] presented
    a Fog-based smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network (FOCAN).
    To reduce latency and increase the efficiency of services among things with various
    capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through
    the smart city environment. One of FOCAN’s primary benefits is that the IoT device
    can deliver services effectively and with less energy consumption. 5.2. SDN-IoT
    Architectures Software-defined networking (SDN) [168] is an approach to enable
    flexible and efficient network configuration to enhance a network. SDN can provide
    many advantages for configuring city networks to support different applications.
    For example, SDN can improve the QoS of city networks against link failures [169]
    and meet smart city latency demands [170]. While some efforts are investigating
    this approach for supporting SCAs, there is room for developing more advanced
    management and networking mechanisms in SDN for efficient, reliable, and secure
    network configurations in smart cities. Jazaeri et al. [171] considered the advantages
    of integrating edge computing, SDN, and IoT technologies and reviewed different
    frameworks and platforms. Liu et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples
    urban sensing applications from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture,
    centralized controllers manage physical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition,
    transmission, and processing services to develop urban sensing applications. Bi
    et al. [173] proposed a scalable SDN-enabled architecture that integrates a variety
    of smart city components and provides reliable and timely scheduling for big data
    transfer to support smart city services. They also studied the time-constrained
    big data transfer scheduling (TBTS) problem under this architecture and proposed
    a heuristic with an intelligent scheme that can maximize the throughput and schedule
    the multi-flow transfer dynamically. IoT systems collect and process data vulnerable
    to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed
    a collaborative and intelligent-network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)
    architecture, namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT networks. SeArch is a security
    architecture in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS nodes, i.e., Edge-IDS,
    Fog-IDS, and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration among nodes.
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy
    in smart cities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network architecture
    for the smart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN and Blockchain technologies.
    To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, their architecture
    is divided into core and edge networks. By designing a hybrid architecture, their
    architecture inherits the strength of centralized and distributed network architectures.
    “PrivySharing” [177] is a Blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving
    and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. This framework protects
    data privacy by segmenting the blockchain network into different channels, consisting
    of a limited number of approved businesses and handling a certain category of
    data, such as health, smart auto, smart energy, or financial information. Additionally,
    smart contracts contain access control rules that regulate who has access to the
    users’ data within a channel. In addition, private data gathering and encryption
    are used to further isolate and safeguard the data within a channel. Islam et
    al. [178] designed a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT ecosystem
    that addresses the existing challenges through the use of the technologies Blockchain,
    SDN, and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architecture
    confronts the problems of scalability, flexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats. 5.3. Architectures
    for Smart Grid The automated and intelligent management of the next-generation
    electric power systems determines their effectiveness and efficiency. Smart Grid
    (SG) is the name given to the next generation of electricity systems, which are
    anticipated to offer various benefits over the current systems in terms of digitization,
    flexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustainability, and customization [179].
    Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies to improve power quality.
    Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric devices remotely in
    real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate their local devices.
    The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented by using the electrical
    and communication infrastructures that connect the transmission and customer domains.
    The distribution domain includes distribution feeders and transformers to supply
    electricity. It interacts with much different equipment, such as distributed energy
    resources (DERs), plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure
    (AMI), and sensors with communication capability. The distribution domain is responsible
    for delivering electricity to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability.
    To provide quality electricity, the stability of this domain is monitored and
    controlled. Typical applications [44] of the smart grid communications network
    are automatic meter reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and
    DERs/microgrid. DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked
    to the distribution system. Distributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS),
    or a combination of renewable and non-renewable sources are all possible sources
    for DER. Solar panels, wind turbines, combustion turbines, fuel cells, battery
    storage systems, etc., are a few examples of DER. An electric power system with
    one or more DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid. The communication
    infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities of the smart grid and
    complies with performance standards. This infrastructure connects a huge number
    of electric devices and manages complex device communications. As a result, it
    is built in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected individual sub-networks,
    and each sub-network is responsible for separate geographical regions. The extremely
    dispersed smaller area networks that support the power systems at various locations
    are connected by WANs, which act as the communication’s backbone. When the control
    centers are located a great distance from the substations or the end-users, the
    real-time measurements made at the electric devices are transported to the control
    centers through the WANs, and in the opposite direction, the WANs carry out the
    instruction communications from the control centers to the electric devices. The
    authors of [43] present a communication architecture in an SG. This architecture
    includes (1) an energy smart house with electric appliances connected to the smart
    grid, (2) a residential complex with AMI, (3) a residential subdivision installed
    with solar panels, (4) a PEV charging station, (5) a power substation, and (6)
    power transmission lines. In this architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as
    the backbone in connecting the distributed sub-networks. Demertzis et al. [180]
    presented and categorized the communication network standards that have been established
    for smart grids and should be considered in planning and implementing new infrastructures.
    Such standards are IEC 61850 for substation automation. This standard is based
    on open architecture and incorporates sampling and timing synchronization specifications
    based on IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181]. Notably, IEEE 1588 is the standard
    for a precision clock synchronization protocol for networked measurement and control
    systems [182]. Due to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)
    throughout the power grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution
    networks in smart grids would undergo significant changes to accommodate the nature
    of non-radial power flow. For the most part, the low-voltage distribution networks
    where RERs (such as solar cells) may be attached are not monitored by the majority
    of the present supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for power
    grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control, Abdrabou [183] presented
    a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse structure that may
    supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage distribution networks.
    A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also presented as a useful method
    for prioritizing data transfer across the newly introduced network architecture.
    HetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network design with a specific QoS routing method
    for power distribution grid applications. It delivers QoS assurances across the
    network while taking into account three factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability.
    The authors created two components to accomplish this: A multipath routing mechanism
    that compensates critical applications for their high-reliability requirements
    by using end-to-end physically disjoint paths, and Altruistic resource allocation
    with the QoS routing mechanism that targets communication with QoS guarantees
    for applications with strict QoS requirements. The findings in [184] show that
    the HetGrid overlay network architecture enables extremely effective, trustworthy,
    and QoS-aware communication in heterogeneous networks. The major characteristics
    that set SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are the ability to execute
    two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time pricing. The present
    SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to be protocol independent.
    Therefore, global communication network management and monitoring approaches have
    been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network administrators may more
    efficiently manage their networks by separating the control plane from the data
    plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication networks. SDN
    implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efficiency and resilience.
    SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and protocols by virtue
    of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity capabilities to
    cope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185] presented SDN-based
    SGC architectures, along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for
    SDN-based SGC and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied
    to SDN-based SGC. Alam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication
    networks in terms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,
    and applications. They proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication Network
    for Smart Grid. CR is a software-defined radio (SDR) platform that can quickly
    reconfigure its operating parameters, such as modulation/demodulation, compression
    algorithm, and error coding techniques, according to changing circumstances and
    requirements, through cognition. In such an SDR platform, radio transceivers can
    switch functions and operations on demand only. Molokomme et al. [187] reviewed
    architectures that aim to accomplish the various and strict QoS requirements in
    SG communication systems. Wireless communication networks have been motivated
    to harvest energy from ambient environments and run energy-efficiently for economic
    and ecological benefits through improvements in the smart power grid and the advocacy
    of “green communications”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments in energy
    harvesting, redistribution, trade, and planning for future wireless networks integrating
    with smart grids. The authors considered the optimization of various energy-harvesting
    wireless systems as well as traditional models of renewable energy-harvesting
    technologies. Moreover, they discussed how to distribute redundant (unused) energy
    generated by cellular networks, plan for energy under dynamic pricing when smart
    grids are in place, and engage in two-way energy trading using smart grids. From
    a different viewpoint, including IoT devices and providing connectivity, automation,
    and monitoring for such devices enables SG systems to sustain multiple network
    operations during the generation, distribution, transmission, and expenditure
    of energy. Numerous IoT-aided SG systems have been proposed in the literature.
    The survey [189] on IoT-aided SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures,
    uses, and prototypes. 5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings There are various
    building applications such as heating, cooling, load control, air quality, ventilation,
    lighting, water management, and cooking gas management. A smart building incorporates
    the major building systems on a common network and functionality to provide operational
    efficiency, fire safety, and security. A smart building architecture (SBA) manages
    several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation, air cleaning,
    HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation and monitoring);
    smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management); a smart fire
    detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart building [190]
    has security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality system, a fire alarm
    system, a water management system, and an energy management system. Moreover,
    it can detect intrusion and supports HVAC services. Diverse SBAs include complex
    operational systems, sensing, and communication technologies. Such architectures
    have converged into an IP-based architecture. This convergence is occurring rapidly
    with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices driven through IoT concerning
    conventional building management and smart buildings. Traditionally, numerous
    building systems utilized varied forms of networking protocols and cabling systems.
    This variety makes the whole system more complex and highly infeasible from both
    a deployment and a system administration standpoint [191]. SBAs entail making
    plans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational technologies that improve
    the application’s, service’s, or provision’s operational steps while also boosting
    the well-being of its users. Researchers, policymakers, and implementers should
    pay attention to several crucial issues, such as reliable communication/connection
    procedures, power-efficient measures, competent security measures, efficient sensors
    and actuators, and data analytics procedures. Amalgamating new systems and technologies
    with conventional (base) technologies to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes,
    but is not limited to, WSN deployment; advanced power-aware traffic engineering
    policies; cloud, edge, and fog computing paradigms; big data engineering and analytics;
    and human–computer interaction procedures [192]. The rapid development of ICT
    technologies has enhanced the connectedness of intelligent sensing, actuators,
    and communication devices to real-time physical entities. Recently, smart sensing
    mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology have boosted the area of
    SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies for a particular smart
    building domain poses significant difficulties, including heterogeneity of IoT
    devices and applications, workable networking protocols and architectures, power
    efficiency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One solution is the SDN paradigm,
    which manages the network more efficiently than a customary one. SDN also assists
    network services, including storage, routing, dynamic bandwidth management, and
    QoS. Hence, these simplifications offer a creative environment through the implementation
    of proper software tools for smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation
    for intelligent infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home
    automation and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing
    based on SDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that
    improves critical SB parameters such as bandwidth efficiency, energy efficiency,
    latency, security, and reliability. Silva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things
    (WoT) SBA that is integrated with the representational state transfer (RESTful)
    application programming interface (API). The RESTful API employs HTTP requests
    (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT data. Regarding network
    performance and smart building power management, the authors showed how their
    recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance. Smart sensing
    devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or modifying
    vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.
    These systems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms, power,
    and transceiver modules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based SBAs for
    assessing and regulating air quality, smart lighting systems, fire detection systems,
    power management, and other basic building operations. An indoor-air-quality-based
    SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for monitoring and regulating
    air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing system was initially
    suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature, and relative humidity.
    Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198]. Considering smart
    indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed in the literature.
    In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system to satisfy the users’
    needs. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption reduction via energy-efficient
    smart lighting systems. Today’s smart building employs low-power usage LED-based
    light sources that last longer than Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In
    reality, the development of control technologies, heterogeneous networks, and
    embedded systems has made it promising to create smart innovative lighting systems
    that can effectively address the problem of energy conservation. Researchers have
    recently begun testing by integrating different power-saving techniques in a single
    illumination system for improved energy efficiency while enhancing lighting performance
    without sacrificing user satisfaction. According to the authors of [201], using
    several cheap detectors, as opposed to a single expensive sensor, would result
    in improved performance and higher power savings. Considering the same motivation,
    various authors [202,203,204] have suggested similar types of smart lighting systems
    for several room types, such as classrooms and offices. In [205], the authors
    provide a deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing on
    power savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration
    of visible light communication technology [206]. Recently, researchers focused
    on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work performance and thermal comfort, to
    propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented Technologies (OOT) have
    been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal comfort while conserving
    energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the drawbacks of the
    automatic control used today. In practice, thermal comfort analysis is based on
    parallel objective and subjective evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises
    monitoring, assessing, and recording the status of environmental parameters through
    dedicated sensors and instruments following standardized guidelines. Subjective
    evaluation involves monitoring, assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal
    sensation, and thermal environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor
    results as the cumulative method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found
    in [193]. Green building refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that
    adjusts to predetermined circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation,
    the system makes full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather
    data and subsequently allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The
    ambient intelligence concept aims to conserve natural resources with limited and
    efficient use of them to offer comfort to the occupants. Through unconventional
    energy sources, it also meets some of the conventional energy requirements [207].
    Many aspects of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and power efficiency, are
    the subject of extensive study. However, one of the most important functions of
    an SB system is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by HVAC
    systems [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial buildings
    for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for this
    context. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of rated fan
    energy can be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect on a building’s
    indoor temperature. The method of computational control for passive and active
    sources was used in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized the problem that
    the ambient and active sources of lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling, and
    shading are not synchronized in buildings. Such a computational control scheme
    is also suitable for reducing daily power usage. Similarly, numerous methods [211,212,213]
    considering HVAC systems have been proposed with respect to frequency regulation,
    predictive control, and smart controller. An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks
    environmental situations. It also notifies when measurements exceed thresholds
    and provides data on energy usage and consumption. In addition, it can autonomously
    turn equipment intermittently at programmed times. As individuals spend more time
    indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed spaces) than outdoors, the air quality
    inside buildings should be improved along with that of the external surroundings.
    This is the task of indoor Air Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS). The basic parts
    of an AQMS (Figure 5) are a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal
    conditioning circuit, a small amount of external memory, and a communication module
    that is typically wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors
    that can detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2,
    CO, and O3, as well as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity
    and temperature. These sensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values
    of the real-time indoor air quality parameters and an external memory used to
    store real-time data [214]. When deploying such systems, various communication
    (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and LoRAWAN technologies, are considered.
    Figure 5. Air Quality Monitoring Sensor System. Adapted from [215,216]. Figure
    5 shows a typical sensor system for an indoor environment for air quality monitoring.
    Figure 6 shows an SBA architecture [217]. The system of this architecture collects
    vital information about the various air quality parameters, including CO2, CO,
    particles (Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5), and some other crucial parameters
    such as humidity and temperature. By using gas sensor boards and wasp motes, the
    authors created a method for collecting and monitoring the indoor atmosphere.
    For monitoring CO2 and CO parameters, they also used TGS 4161 and TGS 2442 gas
    sensors. These sensors usually work using the resistive heating principle. The
    TGS 2442 sensor has excellent sensitivity to fluctuations in CO gas concentration.
    This sensor’s internal resistance, or “IR”, is inversely proportionate to the
    amount of CO present. As the CO content rises, the IR falls. While TGS 4161 also
    offers low power consumption and suggests better performance in detecting changes
    in CO2 gas concentration, the TGS4161 is ideally suited for indoor air control
    applications as it can measure 350–10,000 ppm carbon dioxide. The authors used
    the DustTrak DRX, a specialized aerosol laser photometer that simultaneously measures
    mass and size fraction, for PM1 and PM2.5 monitoring purposes. To define and create
    an interface to the deployed sensor for wireless transmission of gathered aerosol
    data, this photometer is connected to a base station device via LAN. The authors
    also set up ZB (ENs) at each location that was taken into consideration, which
    sent updates on the air quality and aerosols at regular periods to BS (ZBC) that
    had already been set up. Figure 6. IAQMS architecture. Adapted from [217,218].
    This system assesses the indoor air quality to assess the current state of the
    indoor environment while simultaneously providing real-time inputs for HVAC system
    management. The authors also designed a toolkit that analyzes real-time air quality
    data and displays them through meaningful representations to service the SBAs.
    Likewise, Lozano et al. [216] proposed another IAQMS technique that considers
    a star topological architecture [217]. The ZB (ENs) in this technique is based
    on the XBee and XBee pro-version modules. Nevertheless, the suggested scheme [216]
    considers a single pollutant only, i.e., suggesting using a GAC sensor. Conversely,
    the authors of [215] further claimed that they considered seven pollutants in
    their proposed implementation. IoE for Smart Building: To achieve optimal functionality
    and energy-efficient performance, Kim et al. [218] offered an overview of the
    design and implementation of energy-related SB technologies, including energy
    management systems, renewable energy applications, and current advanced smart
    technologies. Undoubtedly, the electricity sector of smart cities is impacted
    by the Internet of Energy (IoE), which aims to increase energy efficiency, prevent
    energy waste, and enhance environmental conditions by integrating IoT technologies
    into distributed energy systems. Two examples of IoE technology are intelligent
    sensor use and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. As a result, the
    IoE is becoming a tool for legal science to support the goals of a smart city.
    Metallidou et al. [219] discussed the factors that prompted the European Union
    to create regulations to make it easier to transition current towns into smart
    cities, starting with existing structures. To achieve energy efficiency, the authors
    suggested a smart building template that uses IoT technology to manage the performance
    of all technical systems. In addition, they suggested an automated remote-control
    technique supported by a cloud interface to enhance the certification of existing
    buildings for energy performance. This technology reduces time-consuming processes
    and stores the energy performance of each building on a cloud platform to make
    decisions and put measures in place. A review of current tactics in the field
    of active building energy management systems (BEMS) was offered by Mariano-Hernández
    et al. [220]. The authors reviewed articles on several BEMS management techniques
    for residential and non-residential buildings, including Model Predictive Control
    (MPC), Demand Side Management (DSM), Optimization, and Fault Detection and Diagnostics
    (FDD). MPC predicts building response to control requests, while DSM is an agreement
    of actions to improve the energy system on the user side. FDD is an automatic
    procedure of detecting and separating flaws in BEMS to protect a system from additional
    harm. Moudgil et al. [221] examined cutting-edge academic and industrial research
    to discover significant technological solutions that improve the integration of
    IoT in building infrastructure (BI). Their review also identifies key technical
    and non-technical problems that must be resolved through extensive research for
    BI to fully incorporate IoT. The authors contend that IoT in BI is still not operationally
    capable. IoT and BI stakeholders must make a concerted effort to give modern BI
    access to a generic IoT framework with cognitive intelligence and context-aware
    computing capabilities. 5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring Retrofitting
    the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some benefits,
    including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert
    utilities to pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network, allowing
    them to remotely adjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224]. Automation
    can be used for both operational procedures and components that provide functionality.
    For instance, when a water problem occurs during operation or with the element
    itself, the smart components inform the system center and then take action to
    avert a crash. The water utility can also determine a sensor’s requirement for
    maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic self-verification mechanism
    [225]. In [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid architecture
    that includes technical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework. Moreover,
    this smart water system (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms, simulation
    procedures, diagnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control mechanisms.
    Although an SWS incorporates offline performance, real-time performance is defined
    by online procedures such as online data monitoring, online data assimilation,
    online modeling, online charting, and online results output. An SWS must have
    real-time functionality to implement the necessary smart features [227]. Researchers
    put a lot of effort [228] into developing water systems that operate intelligently.
    Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time controlling, etc., which seek
    to reduce the lag between system input and system output, should be added to the
    smart performance of SWS. It was discovered that using SCADA would considerably
    increase the data transfer efficiency [229]. A smart water architecture [230]
    often includes five layers: (1) the physical layer; (2) the sensing and control
    layer; (3) the communication layer; (4) the data management layer; and (5) the
    data fusion layer. Within the framework of the GST4Water project, the authors
    of [230] presented a system that allows for receiving consumption data sent by
    a generic smart meter installed in a user’s house and transferring them to a cloud
    platform. The consumption data are saved and processed to characterize leakage
    at the district meter area and the individual user level. Meanwhile, the processed
    data are returned to the Water Utility and can be used for billing. On the other
    hand, they provide regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness of
    their consumption behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework
    based on FIWARE that aims to realize a highly flexible standards-based open-source
    software solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting
    of various FIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis
    et al. [232] considered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding
    conventional water metering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted
    bi-directional (whenever required) data exchange between water flow devices, metering
    equipment, and end-users. The authors’ ultimate objective is to design, implement,
    and deploy more sophisticated infrastructure offering improved performance in
    bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit the amount of data that needs to be
    shared between the various system layers, their approach makes use of the FogC
    paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water grid model. The Information
    and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the Efficient Water Resources
    Management project was funded by the European Commission under the auspices of
    the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the Smart Water project is to
    examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively managing urban water systems,
    with a focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues
    such as leakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.
    Kulkarni and Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,
    proposed a framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost
    of ownership, and highlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’ Smart
    Water case studies. Pipelines are used to transport water, gases, and oil. Since
    they are frequently underground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes them, which
    may result in leaks. In addition, water in the pipelines may get contaminated
    by infectious agents or substances that are mistakenly or purposely introduced
    into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline networks is crucial for maintaining
    public health and protecting the environment. The sensor node deployment profoundly
    impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline network monitoring, including
    coverage area, coverage population, and detection time. The sensor nodes should
    typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s junctions [234]. Given the
    design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor node deployment challenges
    are therefore formulated as integer optimization problems, where the integer variables
    represent the maximum amount of sensor nodes that must be placed at each junction.
    The deployment difficulties for pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging
    to solve because of the integer decision variables. Pipeline network flows are
    not predictable. As a result, depending on the flow pattern, the sensing performance
    of a deployed sensor node may vary. As a result, the flow pattern is taken into
    account in [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to decide
    how to deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a
    branch and bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify the
    ideal answer, the time complexity is typically significant. This means that large
    pipeline networks cannot be used with the method. Similarly, the study in [236]
    considers the various demand patterns of water flows through pipes. The authors
    used a genetic-based method to find the best deployment locations to increase
    coverage under various monitoring station demand patterns. The global optimum
    of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach. The performance of
    the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices. Consequently,
    we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks. Singapore’s WaterWise@SG
    program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate burst incidents [237,238].
    PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to find pipeline leaks, where
    three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure. To reduce
    water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track water consumption
    for businesses. A Steamflood and Waterflood Tracking System [240] has been created
    to find irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks and bottlenecks. With
    the aid of all these technologies, the investigators had the opportunity to evaluate
    the efficiency of the monitoring algorithms. However, these technologies rely
    on fixed sensors, and we still need to put innovative testbed models and systems
    built around crowd sensing and mobile WSN into place. 5.6. Architectures for Smart
    Transportation The Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce
    traffic congestion and accidents. It also enables information exchange involving
    the vehicle and all entities that may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking
    and vehicle intelligence are the two technologies that underpin IoV implementation.
    The three components that compose vehicle networking are the onboard information
    service, VANET, and mobile network. VANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range
    communication. Providing remote location, remote diagnostics, navigation, and
    other information services is referred to as an onboard information service. Every
    car can be utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks to mobile networks. Vehicle
    intelligence is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence
    (AI), big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing (CogC),
    to facilitate information sharing among people and vehicles, as well as between
    vehicles and the environment, infrastructure, or other vehicles. Vehicular networks
    consist of data-gathering sensors and inter-vehicle communication systems. Such
    networks require an open and flexible layered architecture to handle characteristics
    such as interoperability, scalability, dependability, and modularity. Recently,
    the research community proposed efficient vehicle network architectures. For example,
    the Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture [241] includes seven layers. Offering services
    and choosing messaging protocols are tasks that fall within the application layer.
    Data preprocessing, big data processing, and intelligent transmission are all
    tasks that the multimedia and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems,
    the cloud service layer’s ClCom and cloud virtualization technologies offer hardware
    computing platforms, infrastructure, and software services. In the UIoV architecture,
    the communication layer and the intra–inter devices layer are merged to accomplish
    the connectivity of many heterogeneous objects and networks. Notably, there is
    no intra–inter devices layer in classical architecture. The UIoV system’s physical
    objects layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter devices layer
    for additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are
    identified using the Identification Layer. Liu et al. [242] suggested another
    IoV network architecture to increase the flexibility of application management
    while enhancing the scalability and dependability of information services. This
    architecture has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety of
    nodes with various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of
    IoV is frequently changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced
    and transmitted at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the
    underlying resources, the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes
    and the network, computation, communication, and storage resources in IoV. To
    execute applications such as road safety management and data sensing, the control
    layer’s SDN controller is responsible for scheduling the abstraction resources
    of the virtualization layer and interacting with the application layer. A difficult
    topic in network architecture design is dealing with diverse networks. Interoperability,
    scalability, dependability, and adaptability are some of its network features.
    The design seeks to increase layer separation and network architecture’s total
    number of layers. In addition to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture
    should facilitate the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other
    communication devices. By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving
    systems, the learning ability of autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved.
    Utilizing both physical and network data space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles
    (CIoV) paradigm [243] improves network security and transportation safety. CIoV
    enables IoV to bear more accurate perceptive ability through cognition in the
    intra-vehicle network (driver, passengers, smart devices, etc.), inter-vehicle
    network (adjacent intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network (road environment,
    cellular network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture includes
    a cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road
    condition investigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture of
    CIoV. The gathering and preprocessing of big data from several sources are done
    by the sensing layer. As opposed to the previous communication layer (of other
    architectures), the architecture’s communication layer uses a cloud/edge hybrid
    structure to accommodate various application schedules. The data cognition engine
    at the cognition layer processes and interprets heterogeneous data streams (machine
    learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety of cognitive analysis approaches.
    The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in charge of allocating and scheduling
    network resources with the aid of technologies such as NFV, SDN, network slicing,
    and self-organized networking (SON). There are primarily two categories in the
    application layer (i.e., usual application services and intelligent transportation
    applications). Efficient message authentication and integrity are required to
    guarantee vehicle privacy and safeguard vehicular communications. To protect V2V
    and V2I communications in the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber
    threats, Karim [244] provided a cryptography-based routing solution. This solution
    includes a data encryption and decryption mechanism based on attributes and identity
    that has the lowest computational overhead while keeping the optimum level of
    security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245] suggested a seven-layer network architecture.
    The user interface layer, which controls information exchange between the user
    and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units (RSUs) and onboard
    sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing and filtering
    layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data before sending
    the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission. Making
    choices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities of control
    and management. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing layer
    to create the pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop assaults,
    the security layer directly manages each of the layers above. A unique network
    architecture with enhanced throughput, reduced latency, higher security, and widespread
    connectivity was recently proposed by Ji et al. [246]. This architecture consists
    of four layers: Security authentication layer: The RSUs on the road may monitor
    traffic environment data in real-time after setting several sensors, surveillance
    footage, and radar. This layer determines the legality of the car and RSU that
    are requesting to join the network. Perhaps an illegal vehicle or an RSU that
    has been installed unlawfully will attempt to steal or alter the information of
    a real vehicle. Data acquisition layer: This layer collects and categorizes many
    types of data from various networks. To ensure that the data can be sent to the
    edge layer securely, it digitizes the data. Edge layer: Edge devices produce several
    data streams. As a result, processing and analyzing data in one go using ClCom
    will result in significant delays. As a result, we must process data more closely
    related to the data source. The edge node, a physical device situated closest
    to the data source, is used by the edge layer to carry out basic processing and
    analysis on the acquired local data. It releases data analysis findings for nearby
    traffic incidents and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a local
    decision-making plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud data
    center’s computing power. Cloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses
    the information it has collected about global traffic in this tier, develops a
    plan, and rationally distributes traffic resources. This layer, having the ability
    to implement connection management, data management, aided autonomous driving,
    intelligent navigation, path planning, and information security, is the “smart
    brain” of the IoV. A blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)
    for the smart city was presented in [247]. Building innovative distributed transport
    management systems is made possible by the robust and secure Block-VN architecture.
    The authors considered how the network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused
    on networking and vehicular information. To handle real-time transportation data,
    Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing transportation data using Spark
    and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four layers: data collection and
    acquisition, network, data processing, and application. Each layer is built to
    process and manage data in a structured manner. On the data processing layer,
    Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing the suggested event and
    decision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249], the data are made available
    to a smart community member. The suggested approach was examined using transportation
    datasets from some reliable sources. The outcomes demonstrate data processing
    and real-time distribution to citizens in the shortest amount of time. Spark with
    the Hadoop environment produces findings that are quite accurate. From another
    viewpoint, Social IoV (SIoV) are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks
    [250], where vehicular nodes share/exchange information with different entities
    and are thus forth comparable with traditional social networks. Kerrache et al.
    [251] proposed a trust-aware communication architecture for social IoV (TACASHI),
    which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication architecture
    for SIoVs. 5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart Villages The smart village
    paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities using IoT technologies.
    In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried out, including smart agriculture,
    waste management, irrigation management, livestock management, smart energy, smart
    healthcare, and smart education. A smart village or smart rural area can enable
    real-time data analytics and automate decision-making for local villagers regarding
    healthcare, agriculture, environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from
    a smart city as there are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and
    sustainability) between urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart
    village goal, The European Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in
    which it proposed to interfere ICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254]
    addressed the meaning of “smart” in rural contexts as well as its link with sustainability.
    The European Commission-funded Smart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the
    ultimate goal of encouraging and motivating communities to create and execute
    smart village methods and tactics throughout Europe as a tool for rural development,
    serving as the authors’ primary source. IEEE Smart Village [256] also supports
    the world’s energy-impoverished communities by providing a complete solution combining
    renewable energy, community-based education, and entrepreneurial opportunities.
    Malik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart villages with
    different technologies. They concluded that digitization is only possible if a
    reliable and robust network and communication infrastructure are installed in
    the village environment. Shrestha and Drozdenko [258] proposed a Smart Rural framework
    to mitigate the effects of climate change using IoT and the Cloud, building a
    prototype on the Louisiana Tech University campus. Their framework is an energy-efficient
    monitoring system for observing the environmental conditions that affect agricultural
    production and human health. It consists of the following subsystems: Wireless
    Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud Services, and a Web Dashboard. The dashboard converts
    raw sensor data into meaningful information from which public officials and residents
    can adapt to or frustrate the effects of climate change. Monzon Baeza and Alvarez
    Marban [259] proposed a flexible and scalable Smart Rural system for gathering
    and processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional communication
    coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in separate
    segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS). Their
    proposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs of the
    system in the collection of IoT data from these remote rural areas, its coverage
    by space vehicles, and its processing and storage through 5G terrestrial networks
    and cloud services. Their proposal includes the deployment of IoT sensors and
    the development of Amazon Web Services. Conversely, the part of the space segment,
    considered by HAPS, has been simulated for different space channels. This method
    provides a complete and automated smart rural system that allows access to these
    IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet. To provide secure services
    close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored the integration of a Distributed
    Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with IoT in improving security and privacy
    solutions for villagers and consumer electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,
    the authors designed and evaluated the performance of an Intrusion Detection System
    (IDS) in a DFC-based smart village environment. Moreover, they discussed open
    security issues and challenges regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages.
    Rohan et al. [261] proposed a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering
    the resource constraints in a smart village. The authors illustrated the concept
    of collaborative edge computing as applicable to reduce cost and better manage
    the existing infrastructural facilities. Collaboration occurs between the multiple
    IoT edge devices (e.g., the edge data centers or edge routers) for data processing
    and storage. For example, in times of high computational load demand, one village’s
    edge devices can collaborate with another village’s edge devices. 6. Summary Various
    SCAs have different network requirements such as bandwidth, delay tolerance, power
    consumption, reliability, wireless connectivity, mobility, security, and privacy.
    Therefore, they need different protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network architectures
    for IoT are heterogeneous and include various network technologies such as WiFi,
    WSNs, Mesh Wireless Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile Communication
    Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these architectures must
    allow interoperability, while cross-layer design-based recommendations for power
    consumption and congestion control are well-suited proposals. State-of-the-art
    generic network architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm and are
    based on FogC to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.
    Fog and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in
    the future to fulfill QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efficiency.
    The CR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this technology
    can quickly reconfigure the operating parameters of the SG communication system
    to the changing requirements through cognition. By extracting usable data from
    both the physical and network data space, it is possible to increase network security
    and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures will become cognitive.
    These architectures will include cognitive data engines that will conduct cognition
    of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis,
    emotion analysis, and road condition investigation. The networking performance
    of SDN is better than the customary networking of smart buildings (SB). However,
    as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been facing some challenges such as
    network management in terms of maintenance, east–west interface, southbound interface,
    traffic management, energy, ML-based SDN networking for SB, and the network resources
    issue of SB SDN-based networking. 7. Open Research Issues −Network slicing management
    is required: IoT services such as smart transportation and smart energy have diversified
    requirements. To accommodate diverse IoT services, the network slicing paradigm
    is suggested because it enables multiple independent logical networks running
    on the same physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented an architecture
    for intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT) focusing
    on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).
    The authors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing
    management in this field. −NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The
    ETSI Industry Specification Group proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions
    that were before performed by some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the flexible
    provisioning of software-based network functionalities on top of an appropriately
    shared physical infrastructure by separating the network functions from the underlying
    hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing inexpensive commodity servers, it solves
    the issue of operating costs associated with administering and controlling this
    closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is used in conjunction with NFV (the
    software-defined NFV architecture), it can overcome the difficulties associated
    with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic resource management [263].
    SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service environment through NFV. As a
    result, the need for specialized hardware and labor-intensive effort to fulfill
    a new service request is avoided. In conjunction with the use of SDN, NFV also
    allows real-time and dynamic function provisioning along with flexible traffic
    forwarding. The SDN-IoT network may be improved and secured with NVF. It enables
    the software-based deployment of network devices as virtualized components. Throughput
    is increased because of NFV integration in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances
    network performance. To this end, Sinh et al. [264] proposed a practical model
    for hosting IoT services and building SDN controller applications to show that
    SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services. Recently, Mukherjee et al. [265]
    proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV implementation for smart
    cities. −Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology can
    address the bandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can be enabled
    with cognitive functionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum accessing,
    circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs and services can be based
    on CR technology because it can do dynamic sensing and cognition of the surrounding
    environment. For example, in smart grid applications, cognitive IoT can achieve
    the objective of enabling users to know their energy consumption at any time and
    anywhere [267]. In smart home applications, cognitive-radio-equipped sensors can
    handle potential heterogeneous network interference [268]. At the same time, cognitive
    IoT can help with smoother real-time monitoring over longer distances in the healthcare
    industry without worrying about spectrum availability [269]. The complete utilization
    of cognitive radio technology in IoT demands extensive research in spectrum optimization,
    standardization, hardware design, privacy protection, heterogeneous network fusion,
    scalability and flexibility problems, etc. [270]. For this reason, many CIoT-based
    smart city network architectures must be proposed to solve such problems. In this
    regard, Park et al. [271] suggested a CIoT-based smart city network architecture
    that outlines how data collected from SCAs may be analyzed using the CogC paradigm
    and manage the scalability and flexibility challenges. −Challenges in IoT communication
    through TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access Points (APs) can utilize identical
    WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interference problems that can
    significantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many APs can provide
    support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with the DownLink
    multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY layer technology
    (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the capacity of WLANs
    by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations. As a result,
    it is possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to the number of antennas
    on APs. Thus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel and Singh [131] stressed
    the employment of CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods with many APs to improve
    the Compound TCP’s performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL
    method can accelerate the learning processes of the transport protocols such as
    Compound TCP. In FL, training data are dispersed across a large number of clients,
    each having unreliable and comparatively slow network connections, with the aim
    of developing a high-quality centralized model. The authors of [131] insisted
    on using these specialized strategies to coordinate numerous APs with regard to
    losses caused by unique wireless channel characteristics and WiFi downloading
    and uploading dynamics. Through the use of FL and CR approaches in dual AP settings,
    it is now possible to improve the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions. Another
    study [274] assumed TCP Cubic [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the
    FL approach for IoVs. The authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting
    the FL technique, which enhances the efficiency and privacy protection for the
    case of IoVs. −Digital Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources,
    personnel, procedures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital
    twin. Digital twin technology can be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including
    humans, IoT devices, aircraft engines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original
    vehicle is created, for instance, when an automobile business creates a virtual
    representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car model. If a manufacturer creates
    a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the replicated process
    is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a profile of the
    actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this virtual graphic,
    the dynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation are depicted.
    The digital twin can offer the location, state, and/or status of physical assets
    in real-time due to continual learning and advancements. This fusion of the real
    and digital worlds enables organizations to monitor systems, set strategies, and
    anticipate problems before they occur. Digital twins are created using digital
    twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure graphs, AI, software
    analytics, and the IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is demonstrated.
    This technology can efficiently administer the city, from urban planning to the
    optimization of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before
    putting them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.
    If a digital twin is in place, government organizations can only fully assess
    what might be achieved with the data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic
    opportunity, and establish a more cohesive community. Although the idea is currently
    novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few years [277]. −The 6G Network
    for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense and AI-centric
    city because massive device connectivity with vast data traffic is estimated in
    the future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted to the concept
    of Internet of Everything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart cities should have
    a huge bandwidth, low latency, and AI integration. Such networks should also provide
    ubiquity, high QoS, and on-demand content for thousands of interconnected devices.
    The 6G network [278] is the problem-solving network of futuristic cities, with
    huge bandwidth and low latency. It is under development for wireless communications
    technologies supporting cellular data networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks
    will probably be broadband cellular networks, in which the service area is divided
    into small geographical areas (cells). It is expected that 6G will be supported
    by existing 5G infrastructures such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing, together
    with new infrastructure. The network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:
    (1) ultra-fast data rates as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than
    1 ms; (3) increased mobility and coverage; (4) flexible and efficient connection
    of trillion level objects; (5) peak spectral efficiency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very
    high system reliability; and (7) improved network security [279]. However, the
    main problem of 6G is that transmitting at a higher frequency spectrum is prone
    to high path loss, making the distance for transmission limited [280]. The expected
    6G of the radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the capability
    of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability
    of carrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks, such
    as short-range and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can introduce
    complications and hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore, such complications
    of THz waves must be considered, and efficient AI-centric multilayer physical
    network architectures of 6G must be proposed for futuristic smart cities. Farooq
    et al. [280] considered the expectations from a network of futuristic smart cities
    and the problems of THz waves and proposed a conceptual terrestrial network (TN)
    architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a scalable multilayer architecture
    designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart cities. It provides an on-ground
    cloud network that helps smart devices to run AI applications partially on their
    own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore, the distributed and edge computing-oriented
    infrastructure of Bee Hive provides security and reduces traffic load on the upper
    layer of the network. Undoubtedly, pervasive AI is the main enabling technology
    in 6G, while some forms of AI are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples
    of using AI on wireless communications have been proposed, from physical layer
    designs (e.g., channel estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation
    (e.g., traffic control and cache storage management), to security and authentication,
    to dynamic cell and topology formation and management, to fault prediction and
    detection, etc. However, DL-based solutions require high computational complexity,
    which might not fit in current mobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity,
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based RL algorithms must be carefully designed
    to decrease the computational resources required on these devices [282]. Quantum
    communication [283] offers a promising approach to avoiding the challenge of limited
    computational resources and energy efficiency. Applying Artificial Neural Networks
    in IoT also comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy and computational/energy
    requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above issues and envisioned
    6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous systems. Apart
    from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important enabling technologies
    of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies are as follows: Reconfigurable
    Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reflect signals and help in places where
    maintaining Line of Sight (LoS) is difficult. RISs will be mainly deployed on
    doors, windows, and buildings. Cell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology
    is introduced in 5G with a more dense network of access points (APs), and this
    is further developed in 6G to include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287].
    Cell-Free Massive MIMO improves spectral efficiency in communication networks,
    but there are some health risks associated with such a dense network of APs. CubeSat
    communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class spacecraft)
    is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up to 6U, and
    U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units. UAVs/satellite communication. Terahertz communication
    and Optical Wireless Technology [289]. Blockchain technology [290] and quantum
    communication [283]. The development of futuristic smart cities keeps up with
    the development of energy-efficient 6G communication. Kamruzzaman [291] presented
    the key trends in the IoT for energy-efficient 6G wireless communication in smart
    cities. He argues that the application of IoT devices to 6G in smart cities will
    provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency rate, up to 1000 km/h mobility rate,
    100 bps/Hz spectral efficiency, and 1000 GHz frequency. This will resolve the
    issues of energy inefficiency and other concerns in conventional communication
    networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efficient 6G in smart cities via IoT devices
    probably will solve various problems that are encountered by existing smart city
    systems. In futuristic smart cities, residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer
    interface (BCI) technology [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on
    the signals and information that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable
    headsets and devices. It uses human consciousness more than external sources for
    better interaction. As humans have five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell,
    and taste), BCI comprises five datasets, comprising features of human senses that
    are used for human interaction with the machine [292]. 8. Conclusions Utilizing
    resources efficiently, reducing operating expenses, and enhancing city dwellers’
    quality of life are the objectives of the smart city paradigm. This goal is obtained
    by combining various technologies including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big data
    analytics, and robots. For this model, the effective networking and communication
    between the many components required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving
    its objectives. The ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic
    and manageable platforms for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings,
    smart home, smart water, and smart transportation systems. The networking needs
    of the key SCAs were examined in this research, and the appropriate protocols
    that can be applied at different system levels have been identified. Additionally,
    we provided examples of networking protocols and smart grid, intelligent building,
    smart residence, and smart transportation system architectures. We concentrated
    on key criteria for a variety of networking designs, such as energy savings, routing,
    security, dependability, mobility, and support for heterogeneous networks. In
    addition, we presented open research issues. This survey can assist researchers
    to recognize research gaps/problems working in the networking architectures for
    smart cities, and it provides an overview of available protocols and architectures
    for SCAs. Author Contributions Conceptualization, D.K.; methodology, D.K. and

  description: Security is one of the major concerns in IoT networks which consists
    of a huge number of objects that have given an alarm with the risen number of
    threats in our day-to-day life. Mobile IoT users are dynamically categorized into
    multiple social groups based on their velocity, directions, and accelerations.
    In each group, all IoT nodes broadcast their collected content bundles in a short
    range of communication and share a dynamically updated group key negotiated by
    all of them. To make the whole IoT infrastructure secure, efficient, robust cryptographic
    techniques are developed and required to handle data authentication, data privacy,
    confidentiality, integrity, etc. Furthermore, with the large-scale connectivity
    and group key management policy, cryptographic processes like Signcryption techniques
    used for authentication and confidentiality increase the overhead complexity of
    the network resources. To reduce this overhead, numerous research has been conducted
    on Certificateless Aggregate Signcyption Schemes (CLASC) to reduce the time complexity,
    computational and communication overheads. Keeping the effectiveness of CLASC
    in mind, an attempt has been made to provide a detailed review of the security-related
    challenges and issues in IoT applications using CLASC hoping that it will provide
    a good insight to the current researchers, practitioners, and relevant stakeholders
    to carry out further research.

    (CLASC)Pairing and pairing-free CLASC Introduction The Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    has rapidly moved from hype to reality; Gartner''s estimation has come true by
    proving the number of deployed IoT devices has grown up from 5 billion to 25 billion
    from 2015 to 2020 [2]. Mostly, sensors are the heart of modern IoT devices which
    enables a large number of user-friendly applications. Undoubtedly, the use of
    sensors in IoT devices sustains seamless connectivity between the devices and
    the physical world. The sensing ability of sensors to the physical world has made
    changes in IoT devices to make autonomous decisions, whereas, IoT devices have
    become very popular in various application areas due to efficient communication
    between the devices and the physical world. These IoT network applications are
    listed on a large scale that has promoted the tag “smart” such as smart cities,
    smart agriculture, smart education, smart health care, smart waste management,
    smart surveillance, logistics, supply chains, and so on [1], [2], [3], [4], [5],
    [6], [7]. In the next few years, IoT is expected to employ not only the productive
    markets but also manufacturing, automation [4], agriculture [5], Energy [6], and
    Industries which are already known as Industrial IoT 4.0 (IIoT 4.0)[7]. With the
    billions of interconnected IoT devices, applications, and services in use, future
    online upcoming devices with huge numbers, IoT security issues deserve rethinking.
    Like any other disruptive technologies, such as AI techniques, smartphones, and
    cloud computing, IoT has proved its large-scale potential impact on society by
    transforming many industries, institutional organizations as well as our daily
    lives. Poorly secured IoT devices and services can provoke entry points for cyberattacks,
    using data as a weapon, and revealing confidential data, which are the biggest
    threat to the safety of individual users. IoT foresees an age where billions of
    things (devices) will be connected through the Internet and communicate with each
    other, and this implies that a large amount of data will move across the network,
    it will be processed, and exchanged between the devices. For real-time applications,
    technologies like IEEE 802.15.4, 6LoWPAN [8], and Routing Protocol for Low Power
    and Lossy Networks [RPL] [9] make possible the connectivity and communication
    among the IoT devices. However, with the increased number of intelligent devices
    and along with the added features of mobility, IoT is exposed to several vulnerabilities
    detected in a variable communication infrastructure. We present a pictorial representation
    of cloud-based IoT architecture for a better understanding of the real meaning
    of IoT infrastructure as shown in Fig. 1. This pervasiveness of IoT infrastructure
    raises many challenging concerns like availability, reliability, interoperability,
    mobility, cloud computing, big data analytics, modular sensor design, etc. [10].
    Billions of objects involved in distributing the information must be protected
    and encrypted with a high level of security including their keys and password
    [11]. In heterogeneous network systems as used in IoT, it is difficult to guarantee
    a high level of privacy and security for the users and the security policies/mechanisms
    must be reviewed again and again to develop better key management techniques in
    order to detect and prevent the networks from different types of attacks. Thus,
    the security issue has brought a global concern among researchers, developers,
    industrialists, and communication experts as there is no common standard for security
    policy in IoT in the context of global infrastructure. Download : Download high-res

    of IoT. In recent years, many surveys are presented based on the current advancements
    of IoT frameworks where security issues are discussed as part of the IoT survey,
    or in some places, security and privacy are discussed jointly as a single topic
    [31]. But this survey differs slightly by diverting the study towards the application
    areas of IoT where data authentication and privacy are of utmost importance and
    that can be achieved through various Aggregate Signcryption techniques. Motivation
    IoT devices are resource-constrained and comply with the store-carry-forward technique
    to forward the packet with limited storage and generate a large amount of data
    that provides an open surface for attack. Computationally intensive tasks are
    not tolerable in IoT networks and must be outsourced to the cloud which has both
    abundant storage and computational resources. Based on the information provided
    in [22], authentication and data tracking, mutual trust, and data integrity are
    the most important security requirements in IoT. Apart from this, privacy is another
    important feature that builds confidence among the users to rely on a system.
    As the authors are interested in IoT applications and cryptographic techniques,
    this survey paper has resulted with the motivation of addressing the current security
    policy that lags in handling the moving IoT objects and group key management policy
    dynamically. So, there is a need for developing more Certificateless Aggregate
    Signcryption Schemes (CLASC) to handle network dynamics for essentially important
    applications in bandwidth-constrained IoT networks. Search criteria for the study
    The search criteria of this study are discussed as follows. • First, high-quality/highly
    impact factors journals like IEEE, Elsevier, ACM, and Springer have been referred
    in the context of IoT frameworks, Security structure, and Signcyption techniques
    in IoT. • Second, a few highly cited conference papers in the related areas are
    preferred. Second, few highly cited conference papers in the related areas are
    preferred. • Third, very specific good-quality research papers discussing aggregate
    signcryption techniques to solve authentication and privacy problems have been
    taken into consideration. Last, we have adopted some inclusion and exclusion criteria
    as IoT scales large in topics. Our inclusion criteria focus on IoT security issues
    w.r.t authentication and privacy and some other security issues are excluded due
    to page length constraints. Paper contribution Many researchers have presented
    security issues in IoT applications considering from various angles. Many security
    issues have been resolved using Signcryption and Aggregate Signcryption, which
    satisfy both the committed agreement of digital signature and public-key encryption
    in a single logical structure with noticeably lower cost, but these applications
    are not discussed in a common platform. • To our knowledge, this is the first
    paper, which surveys and extensively focuses on IoT security issues using Certificateless
    Aggregate Signcryption Schemes that handle authentication and privacy issues in
    IoT networks. Certificate-less Aggregate Signcryption Schemes are discussed in
    a comprehensive way to present a solution to privacy preservation in IoT models,
    protocols, and architecture. • This paper also discusses the advantages and disadvantages
    of Pairing and Pairing-free Certificateless Aggregate Signcryption Schemes and
    their usage in IoT applications. Further, we have measured the performance of
    Aggregate CLASC schemes and plotted them graphically for better understanding
    and clarity. • Furthermore, future insights are directed to guide the current
    researchers to think and develop new aggregate CLASC techniques on a large scale
    that will be helpful to maintain data authentication and data confidentiality
    in future IoT-based infrastructure. Organization The remainder of the paper is
    organized as follows. Section II presents the overall security issues in IoT applications.
    Section III discusses the preliminaries of Cryptography, the evolution of Signcryption,
    and Aggregate Signcryption techniques. In Section IV, the usage of pairing and
    non-pairing Certificateless Aggregate Signcryption Schemes for IoT applications
    and their performance are briefly discussed. Section V concludes the paper with
    future insights. IoT security background: in-depth discussion The rapidly growing
    Internet-connected devices, ranging from small sensors to cloud servers bring
    the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) where things refer to small objects
    such as vending machines, electronic appliances, cameras, smart bulbs, smart locks,
    thermostats, and many more. The IoT transforms these objects from conventional
    to smart by exploiting the underlying principle of ubiquitous computing, communication
    protocols, and applications. Protocols are meant for guiding the IoT devices in
    terms of exchanging the data, selecting the correct boundaries of data, by complying
    with the various functions of each device required for different applications.
    Applications determine the levels of coarseness and territory of the IoT device,
    and the size of the data that enters for analytics purposes. Further, the notion
    of an IoT framework demands a standard structure at a global level that will coordinate
    and control the processes being handled by various IoT components. This structure
    comprises a set of rules, regulations, and protocols that establish a platform
    to process the data and exchange messages between all engaged collaborators such
    as embedded devices, cloud, end-users, etc. Also, it should boost the implementation
    of high-level IoT applications and suppress the complexity of infrastructure protocols.
    Several methodologies can be pursued to build an IoT framework based on the requirements
    of the target application [21]. There are many areas of IoT applications, where
    security issues must be addressed and handled by using different cryptography
    techniques. Critical application areas of IoT need security • Smart Environment-
    Smart environments are aimed to exploit the properties of small, distributed sensing
    nodes that interact and exchange information with the environment to identify,
    and deliver personalized services to the users [23]. Such types of environments
    impose highly secure solutions to the users that can be secure, private, and reliable.
    Security is provided through cryptographic techniques over common communication
    channels by maintaining data privacy in the context of encompassing trust and
    risk involved while interacting with the users. The trust legalizes the amount
    of information to be disclosed, and risk analysis persuades the users to participate
    in these interactions by providing the opportunity to evaluate the expected benefits.
    • Smart Cities- Smart cities are intended for enriching the overall quality of
    human life by drilling the usage of emerging computation and communication extensively
    [12]. It comprises smart homes [17], smart traffic management, smart disaster
    management, smart utilities, e-healthcare, etc. To make cities smarter, there
    is a push from governments worldwide and developments are taking place through
    various incentives [13]. Even though the purpose of smart applications is to enhance
    the overall quality of human life, they still bring a threat to the privacy of
    human life. Smart card services allow the users to purchase the provisions by
    scanning their card details and it makes the citizens at risk. Similarly, smart
    mobility applications may lead toward revealing the locations of the users. There
    are specific applications like child monitoring by the parents, areas like the
    chemical industry, etc. if such applications are hacked, then the safety of the
    children/employees is a big challenge. • Smart Metering/ Smart Grids- Smart metering,
    comprises measuring, metering, and management techniques that fall under smart
    metering. Some threats and risks are discussed here for smart metering. Smart
    grids are examples of smart metering where the electricity is monitored, and electricity
    consumption is measured through smart meters. But, on many occasions, smart metering
    leads to reporting the electricity theft problem [14]. Water monitoring, oil,
    and gas level monitoring in storage tanks and reservoirs also use smart metering.
    ○ In solar energy plants, smart meters are used to monitor the performance of
    the solar plant. In many cases, the angles of the solar panels are adjusted dynamically
    to harvest the maximum possible solar energy to solve the optimization problem.
    ○ In water transport systems, smart meters are used to measure the water pressure
    or to measure the weight of goods. These smart meters are vulnerable to both physical
    and cyber-attacks whereas analog meters face only physical attacks, not cyber-attack.
    ○ The use of the Advanced Metering System (AMS) provides several advantages over
    generic energy metering systems. In a smart home area network (HAN), all-electric
    equipment at home is connected to smart meters and these meters keep the record
    of the energy consumption via electronic appliances. This is treated as the load
    and cost management for the users. In such a communication system, if an adversary
    alters the collected data that leads to monetary loss for both the service providers
    and consumers [15]. • Smart Retails- Smart retails are connected to supply chains
    and the retail market is expected to grow from 14.5 billion $ to 35. 5 billion
    $ by 2025 through the extensive use of IoT applications. IoT is also being used
    to monitor the storage conditions of the goods, control, and track the warehouse
    products, stock management, etc. Various intelligent shopping applications have
    been developed to assist the customers based on their feedback and choices. Augmented
    reality Mechanisms have also been developed based on the experience of online
    shopping with offline retailers. Various reputed companies in the trade like Apple,
    Home Depot, JP Morgan Chase, and Sony [16] are encountering security issues while
    implementing and using various IoT applications. In these companies, adversaries
    may try to compromise the IoT applications in two ways. Either it tries to hack
    the information associated with the storage conditions of the goods and or it
    may spread wrong information to the customers about the products to deduce the
    products. If security establishments are not accomplished in smart retail, the
    debit and credit card information of the customer, phone numbers, email addresses,
    etc. could have been easily stolen leading to monetary thefts for both the customers
    and retailers. • Smart Agriculture- Smart agriculture is intended to monitor soil
    moisture, humidity, temperature, microclimate conditions, select irrigation in
    dry zones, and many more by using IoT networks. Using this advanced technology
    in agriculture, the farmers can predict the quality of the product, get support
    in achieving high profits, and recover from monetary losses. Various grains and
    vegetable production can be enhanced by preventing fungus and other microbial
    contaminants through temperature and humidity control. The vegetable and crop
    yield quality can be increased by controlling the climatic conditions. Some IoT
    applications also help to monitor the movements, of farm animals, their health
    conditions, etc. If such types of applications are targeted to be compromised,
    then it may lead to damaging the crops and theft of animals from the farm [18,98].
    • Emergency and Security- Security and emergencies are other important aspects
    of IoT applications. It incorporates applications like detection of leakage of
    hazardous gasses in industrial areas, permitting only authorized people in restricted
    areas, chemical factories areas, etc. In some areas, radiation levels can also
    be measured around cellular base stations or nuclear power reactors and alerts
    can be produced when the radiation level crosses a threshold value. There are
    some applications where some buildings contain confidential data or house sensitive
    goods. Security violations can also have various serious outcomes in such applications.
    For example, if the criminals enter confined areas, and damage the liabilities
    in such applications, the false radiation level alarms can bring serious immediate
    and long-term effects. It may cause serious life-threatening diseases in the long
    run if the children are unprotected from high-level radiation [19], [20]. Fig.

    Threats in IoT Applications. IoT layers security issues: an overview Security
    applications can be deployed to protect sensitive data and goods. Security violations
    in such applications can also have various serious penalties. IoT framework consists
    of four layers i.e., Sensing Layer, Network Layer, Middleware Layer, and Application
    Layer [32]. Each layer depends on the other layer to operate in the same way as
    TCP/IP protocol stack does. While communicating with the other layer, each layer
    is vulnerable to many types of attacks. This subsection discusses the major types
    of attacks in each layer and subsequent existing measures. • Sensing Layer/Perception
    Layer- The physical layer is also known as the sensing layer/ perception layer
    consisting of a huge number of sensors that are characterized by limited processing
    power, computational capacity, and memory [24], [25]. Physical layer senses the
    physical parameters of the environment (e.g., temperature, humidity, location,
    speed, etc.) through the sensors by using different types of sensing technologies
    (e.g., RFID, NFC, GPS, etc.). Several security issues and attack risks rise due
    to many constraints such as device constraints, bandwidth constraints, and deployment
    scenarios. a) Denial of Service (DoS) Attack- DoS attack is one type of attack
    that blocks the system or network resources and prevents authorized users from
    accessing them. This could be achieved by overwhelming the system or network by
    sending many spam requests all the time. Thus, it overloads the system and prevents
    it from delivering normal services [26]. The large-scale variants of DoS attacks
    are known as Distributed Denial of service attacks [35], [36]. b) Node Capture-
    In this attack, IoT nodes either source nodes or gateway nodes can be easily controlled
    by hackers. Ripping a node empowers an adversary not only to take over the cryptographic
    keys but also protocol limitations. The hacker can replicate or redistribute the
    malicious nodes in the network, which in turn disturbs the security of the entire
    network [27], [28]. c) Sybil Attack- This is one category of attack where the
    attackers try to create fake identities through fake nodes. The attacker uses
    this fake node to transmit data to legitimate nodes so that legitimate nodes consume
    their energy. Finally, the whole service goes down in the network. The presence
    of a Sybil node causes the whole system to generate wrong data and lose its privacy
    [29], [30]. d) Replay Attack- A replay attack aims to store the information and
    re-transmit the same information number of times without having permission to
    do that job. This type of attack is mostly exercised against authentication protocols
    [32]. e) Denial of Sleep Attack- In IoT networks, each sensor node senses small
    data, such as temperature, humidity, etc., at a particular time interval, then
    the nodes switch to a sleep mode for another time interval aiming to operate for
    a long time. The main goal of the denial of sleep attack is to prevent the node
    from going asleep after sending the appropriate sensed data so that it cannot
    operate for a long period by consuming more energy [33], [34]. f) Side Channel
    Attack- This type of attack tries to collect the secret keys employed during the
    encryption process by gathering the hardware information in the context of power
    consumption, power dissipation, time of execution, electromagnetic interference
    produced between the devices, etc. [37], [38], [39], [40]. • Network Layer- The
    main function of the network layer is data routing. The network layer receives
    the data from the application layer and processes it to the application layer
    through various network technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zig-Bee, 3 G/ 4
    G/ 5 G, etc. This layer also performs the data management task with the support
    of middleware technology such as cloud computing. Several threats and risks on
    the network layer are identified and discussed as follows. a) Routing Attack-
    Network Layer, by default prone to routing attacks. In this type of attack, malicious
    nodes redirect, misdirect, or even drop the packet while forwarding the data packet.
    Blackhole [41], Gray hole [42], [43], wormhole [44], [45], and hello flood attacks
    [46], [47], [48] belong to this category of attack. b) Denial of Service Attack-
    Denial of service attack occurs at the network layer by jamming the transmission
    services or creating a fraud node to route the data packets between the nodes
    [49], [50]. c) Access Attack- This type of attack is also termed an advanced persistent
    threat (APT), in which an adversary gains access to the IoT networks and stays
    undetected for a long time. The main intention of the attacker is to steal valuable
    information instead of damaging the IoT network [51]. d) Eavesdropping/ Sniffing
    Attack- This type of attack belongs to passive attacks that allow the intruder
    to listen to the private communication channel over the communication link [52].
    The intruder can extract useful information like usernames and passwords, and
    node identification, which could lead to other types of attacks, e.g., fake node,
    replay attacks, etc. e) Phishing Attack- The purpose of a phishing attack is to
    compromise a few IoT devices with minimal effort. First, the attacker compromises
    the user ID and password of a few IoT devices so that it takes the control over
    whole IoT environment [53]. f) Data Transit Attack- In an IoT network, there is
    a lot of data movement that occurs between the sensors, actuators, cloud, etc.
    The data stored in a local server or cloud have always a security risk. But the
    data when it moves from one location to another has always been vulnerable to
    cyber-attacks. • Support Layer/ Middleware Layer a) (Man in the Middle (MITM)
    Attack- As the name implies, a MITM attack aims to establish a connection between
    two nodes by using different techniques. Once the attacker gains control over
    the communication link of his victims, he can act as a proxy. For instance, this
    type of attack in the IoT network occurs through the MQTT Protocol. The MQTT protocol
    uses an MQTT broker that operates on a publish-subscribe model to communicate
    between the clients and subscribers. This MQTT broker acts as a proxy and facilitates
    dissociating the publishing and the subscribing clients from each other. If the
    broker gets compromised by the attacker and acts as a man-in-the-middle, then
    it acquires complete control over the communication without the knowledge of the
    clients. In another way, most IoT applications rely on SSL/TLS protocol that creates
    two-way authentication for encrypted connections in the application layer. The
    main drive of the SSL/TLS protocol is to establish two-way authentication between
    the trusted parties. But unfortunately, in order to mitigate managerial complexity,
    SSL/TLS operates when one participant validates the connection which poses a weakness
    to be exploited as an attack. One may refer to [158] for a detailed IoT MITM attack.
    b) Flooding Attack in the Cloud- A flooding attack in the cloud is similar to
    a DoS attack and hampers the quality of service (QoS) of the network. The attacker
    sends multiple requests continuously to a server to deplete the cloud resources
    by increasing the load on the cloud servers. c) Malware Injection in Cloud- In
    cloud malware injection, the attacker pretends as a valid server by injecting
    a malicious code or a virtual machine into the cloud and gains access to service
    requests of the victim''s machine. Later, the attacker could be able to capture
    the sensitive data and modify it as per the requirement. d) Signature Wrapping
    Attack- In the middleware web services, XML signatures are used [54]. In a signature
    wrapping attack, the attacker exploits the vulnerable properties of the Simple
    Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and destroys the signature algorithm or modifies
    the eavesdropping messages [55]. e) SQL Injection Attack- In an SQL injection
    attack, SQL Injection (SQLi) is executed at the middleware. In such attacks, the
    attacker tries to embed malicious SQL statements in a program [56], [57]. At the
    same time, the attacker obtains the private data of any user and alters records
    in the database [58]. SQLi is listed as the top ten threat by the Open Web Application
    Security Project (OWASP) and presented in their OWASP web security 2018 document
    [59]. • Application Layer- This layer takes the responsibility for delivering
    application-specific services to the users. The significance of this layer is
    that the application can cover various fields such as smart cities, smart homes,
    health care, smart metering, building automation, etc. [60], [61]. Conventional
    application-layer protocols were not designed for IoT platforms and so, they do
    not operate perfectly on IoT platforms. Further, IoT does not contain any International
    standards. So, the application layer needs to handle several security issues [62].
    a) Data theft attack- In IoT applications, data movement activities are more vulnerable
    than data in rest. It carries crucial users'' private data along with IoT data.
    Few protocols with privacy management, data isolation, and encryption techniques
    are used against data thefts for secure IoT protocols. b) Access Control Attack-
    A Wireless Access Point (WAP) is a gateway device (used in a network) that allows
    wireless capable devices to connect to the Internet. With the increasing demand
    for IoT networks, Wi-Fi devices are widely used in home areas, institutes, airports,
    shopping malls, social areas, etc. In an access control attack, the attacker aims
    to compromise the access points, then captures the data flowing over the network.
    The main intention of this type of attack is to steal the information of the network
    not to destroy the IoT networks. One of the most security threats is the rogue
    access point. This access point is installed by the inside employee or outside
    intruder without the notice of the system administrator and remains in the network
    unnoticed for a longer period. c) Service Interruption (SI) Attack/ DDoS Attack-
    A service interruption attack causes the network resources inaccessible or unusable
    to the users either temporarily or permanently. Most such attacks deprive the
    authenticated users to use the services of IoT applications by making the servers
    or network too busy exaggeratedly. SI attack is also referred to as one type of
    DDoS attack. There have been various incidences of such attacks on IoT applications.
    For instance, the attacker manipulates the processes on a mail server in which
    the database runs in order to achieve a DDoS attack and prevent access to the
    data it contains. d) Reprogram Attack- In an IoT network, the programming process
    is very critical. If the development of the program is not protected, then there
    is a chance for the attackers to reprogram the IoT objects remotely which can
    take control of the IoT network [63]. e) Sniffing Attack- The attacker gains access
    to the user''s confidential data by monitoring the network traffic through the
    sniffer application [64]. f) Malicious Code Injection- In this attack, the attackers
    try to inject some malicious script into a trusted website by using cross-site
    scripting (XSS). A successful XSS injection in a trusted website can cause the
    hijacking of an IoT account, thus paralyzing the whole IoT system. Fig. 3 shows

    4. Layer-wise Attacks and Countermeasures in IoT. Security issues in cloud-based
    IoT infrastructure For converging IoT with Cloud, Fog, and Edge computing, the
    security and privacy issues must be specially considered. We aim to discuss here
    the basic threats and countermeasures in cloud-based IoT infrastructure. • Identity
    Privacy/Location privacy- Identity privacy and Location Privacy are very critical
    issues in IoT infrastructure. Besides the traditional confidentiality and unforgeability,
    the cloud-based application requires unique privacy and security. The identity
    of the mobile users must be protected from the public. Any dispute in an emergency
    case can be traced out by the authority. The techniques of pseudonyms have been
    widely used for identity privacy and location privacy. But the periodic update
    in pseudonyms brings huge computational costs which are intolerable in resource-constrained
    IoT nodes. Furthermore, it cannot resist a physically dynamic tracing attack for
    the location identity of the user. • Node Compromise attack- In a node compromise
    attack, or target-oriented attack, the adversary extracts all the private information
    including the secret key used to encrypt the packets, the private key to generate
    signatures, and so on, from the IoT devices and then reprograms or replaces the
    IoT devices with malicious ones under the control of the adversary. • Layer Removing/Adding
    Attack- The layer removing attack occurs when a group of selfish IoT users removes
    all the forwarding layers between them to maximize their rewarded credits by reducing
    the number of intermediate transmitters sharing the reward. • Forward and Backward
    Security- Forward and backward security means the newly joined IoT users must
    decipher the encrypted message after joining the cluster not before joining. Similarly,
    the already joined IoT user must decrypt the message after leaving the group.
    • Semi-Trusted Model/ Malicious Cloud Security- Semi-trusted model means the cloud
    would faithfully comply with the protocol execution and at the same time, try
    to extract the information from IoT users through the interaction. So, overall
    IoT-based cloud security can be achieved by protecting the data from an individual
    owner, the computational results should be decrypted by the authenticated receivers,
    and the underlying processing must be protected from malicious IoT users. Blockchain
    in IoT Blockchain was originally developed to record financial transactions, where
    the transactions are encoded and kept by all the participants (Bitcoins and Cryptocurrencies)
    to make the transactions transparent so that any counterfeit can be easily traced.
    Blockchain is also applied to IoT security. For instance, a block is created when
    any transaction is made. The block is broadcast to all the nodes in the network.
    The nodes can add the block to their chain of blocks if the block is verified
    and notice correctly the previous blocks. Security policies There have been many
    Intrusion detection/prevention methods discussed in the literature against different
    types of attacks in IoT infrastructure [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72],
    [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85],
    [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98].
    In reference to [65], security policy has been categorized into two parts such
    as proactive and reactive approaches. Further, the reactive approach is classified
    into three categories such as IDS based techniques, collaborative security techniques,
    and predictive techniques. IDS/IPS Techniques- Modern-day cyber attackers or malware
    are innovative by nature and constantly monitoring the IoT networks to do some
    mischievous activities instead of existing measures. Most of the Intrusion detection
    (IDS) techniques or Intrusion prevention (IPS) techniques are designed to detect
    or prevent DDoS attacks and unauthorised attack attempts. Furthermore, the IDS
    techniques have been classified into three categories according to the network
    applications, structures, and approaches (See Fig. 5). These techniques are briefly
    summarized in the following section. • IDS Techniques based on Approaches- In
    [66], multi-layered security solutions are discussed for cloud computing. The
    first layer was designed to give access control to authorized users using firewalls.
    The second layer was meant for the identification and prevention of malicious
    users. The third layer was provided with encryption that delivers a top-down security
    policy. A penetration testing was conducted on 10 PB data of data centers and
    it is concluded that recovery time from unauthorised access takes 125 h. In [67],
    the authors have discussed a five-layer cloud service model. The work in [68]
    has used the KDD99 Cup dataset and NSL-KDD data set to implement the DoS prevention
    technique using firewall and IDS-based data mining techniques. In [69], the authors
    have proposed a simulation-based prediction mechanism by considering full account
    prediction errors and residual traffic. The simulation result concludes that the
    security analysis can be done with minimal delay. The authors of [70] have presented
    an IPS against cybersecurity and botnet malware. The research in [71] provides
    geo privacy protection against mobile devices using virtual private networks (VPN)
    and global positioning systems (GPS). The evaluation results of the proposed model
    have shown the accuracy of 99.29% and 92.96% over longitude and latitude, respectively.
    In [72], a Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) architecture is designed for
    Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) to improve the speed of FPGA compared
    to the speed of the central processing unit (CPU). • IDS Techniques based on Network
    Structures- There are many security systems are designed based on the network
    structures such as Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) [73], [74], Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSNs) [75], [76], Local Area Networks (LANs), Wi-fi [77], honeypots,
    etc. [78]. The authors of [73] use an encryption technique that combines RSA and
    a digital signature algorithm to achieve high throughput and security in MANETs
    with fewer overheads. The research in [74] has presented a hybrid encryption technique
    for MANET using public key infrastructure (PKI), Firewalls, and IPS. Every node
    contains a similar security model and the routing data packet is encrypted and
    signed. The nodes are authorized to send and access the service as per the specified
    instructions and control the network condition through the PKI and firewall. The
    authors of [75] used a pattern matching technique to develop an IDS for WSNs that
    describes a set of signatures to identify unwanted incidents. When the pattern
    is matched with an event, a certain action is performed as per rules amended in
    the signature. Then, the gathered data is investigated and compared by the IDS
    using a large signature set. A continuous deviation between existing and previous
    patterns produces an alarm. In [76], an entropy method was developed and evaluated
    at Intel Berkeley Research Laboratory for an anomaly detection system by using
    a real-time dataset of distributed sensor networks. The findings suggested that
    the entropy method can detect the scattered abnormalities regardless of the patterns.
    In [77], the proposed model uses IDPS for ZigBee-based home area networks without
    any prior knowledge about the attackers. It uses dynamic machine learning-based
    prevention techniques that result from a low false-positive rate. The research
    in [78] presents an IDS technique in a telecommunication system against active
    attacks. In [79], a dynamic proactive multipurpose threat response model is proposed
    that uses a weighted attack graph to calculate the threats in a network by minimizing
    the threats and costs. • IDS techniques based on Applications- Several studies
    have shown their dedication in proposing various smartphone applications. In [80],
    an anomaly detector is proposed by considering the multilevel behavior of android
    devices. The main purpose is to analyze and correlate several features at different
    android levels such as kernel level, application level, user level, and packet
    level. The research in [81] shows an intelligent IPS trained with a system-on-chip
    computer that combines image processing and voice identification technology to
    discriminate between legitimate guests and invaders for home systems. The work
    in [82] has focused on implementing an IPS for the Voice Over Internet Protocol
    (VoIP). But the use of snort produces significant overhead even if the proposed
    system is efficient and simple. The authors in [83] have developed a security
    system for the Electronic Health Record System (EHRS) considering all preventive,
    detective, and corrective security measures that guarantee the security and privacy
    of the system. A hybrid cloud-based model proposed in [84] used snort to implement
    an IDPS system to detect anonymous attacks. For unidentified attacks, new signatures
    are forwarded to the behavior mobile devices, such as smartphones. Collaborative
    Security Techniques- In recent years, there has been an increased interest to
    develop collaborative security techniques due to their healthy detection and prevention
    measures in a broader range of attacks. Different collaborative security methods
    have also been proposed in the literature to preserve privacy and authentication.
    For example, the research in [85] presents a privacy-preserving protocol using
    the homomorphic encryption technique to measure the comprehensiveness of data
    quality i.e., consistency, uniqueness, authenticity, and accuracy. In [86], the
    proposed system called a locality-aware collaborative IDS is used to monitor the
    sensors by distributing the alerts. The proposed model performs well to preserve
    local communication privacy by exchanging alert data. In [87], a controlled data
    sharing approach is proposed for collaborative threat mitigation based on collaborative
    predictive blacklisting. The proposed distributed model in [88] was designed for
    collaborative Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to monitor and protect against prefix/sub-prefix
    and edge-based attacks. The proposed algorithm in [73] also uses a hybrid encryption
    technique for MANET by combining the RSA and a digital signature algorithm. Various
    studies use the game theory approach for implementing collaborative IDS. For instance,
    a randomized, non-deterministic, and game theory approach is used in [90] for
    IDS in collaborative peer-to-peer networks to reduce the possibility of successful
    attacks. The study in [91] employs collaborative intelligence to present a collaborative
    lightweight client application for preventing the chances of active attacks. •
    Predictive Security Techniques- Predictive security concepts are very new research
    in this area. Very few articles discuss predictive security as it is quite hard
    to predict probable future attacks in a network. In [92], the authors gathered
    information related to human behavior in cybersecurity by correlating social sciences
    and psychology. This study was designed based on prediction models to analyze
    the usefulness of audit requirements and password security in a standard customer-based
    organization. To demonstrate the customer representatives'' behavior service,
    a case study was prepared with the help of Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN)
    to illustrate the interaction between workers and the security policy of the organizations
    [93]. The research work of [94] presents a cybersecurity strategy for critical
    infrastructures to predict and protect from external threats and to decrease the
    correlated risk associated with it before it gets compromised. A Common Vulnerability
    Scoring System (CVSS) which is an open vulnerability scoring structure is employed
    to address all complex exploitability characteristics such as access vector, access
    complexity, authentication, etc. to provide powerful actionable insight [95],
    [96], [97]. The existing security policies are depicted in Fig. 5. Download :

    of IoT security policy. Shortfalls within traditional IT approaches Table 1 summarizes
    the shortfall with traditional IT approaches and challenges involved in IoT that
    require enhancement of new policies, learning signatures, and enforcement [99].
    • Types of Policies- IoT devices are self-organizing by nature and operate in
    an open environment through an implicit channel. They communicate with each other
    through an explicit channel. So, compromised devices can affect both the applications
    and environment through implicit/explicit channels due to cross-device dependencies.
    As a result, security policy must be complex enough to adopt the dynamics of the
    environment and cross-device dependencies. • Learning Signatures and Anomalous
    Behaviours- The heterogeneous IoT devices and vendors certainly follow the customary
    approaches of detecting attack signatures through honeypots that are not inadequate
    for IoT frameworks and raise the scalability issue. Additionally, there might
    be inherent dependencies between device interactions and indirect connections
    through the environment. Thus, new mechanisms are needed to learn signatures and
    to handle cross-device dependencies while adopting security policies. • Enforcement
    Mechanisms- IoT devices are resource-constrained and typically require low power
    consumption. They do not require complete-mature operating systems to work. Moreover,
    they are manufactured in bulk with default ID and password, and remain deployed
    for a long time till vendors stop producing or supporting the devices. So, conventional
    or device-centric mechanisms like antivirus, patches, etc. hosts are unrealistic
    to foresee in an IoT orbit. Table 1. Factors need attention for IoT security.

    rapid change in environmental circumstances, device behaviors are also changing
    rapidly. One needs to promptly reassess and update the system''s security position.
    Unluckily, today''s security administration schemes are built upon a fixed mindset
    and are unfeasible to handle such dynamics. Cryptography: evolution of signcryption
    and aggregate signcryption schemes The interconnected objects in IoT pose many
    challenges in human lives and bring security issues to life-threatening. The smartness
    integrated with home, city, healthcare, grids, etc., can lead to a harmful scenario
    when exposed to Intruders/attackers. The increased number of IoT applications
    that deals with sensitive information at the personal, social, industrial, as
    well as government level have led to different hacking scenarios in the recent
    past [100]. The major IoT security concerns are authentication, privacy, authorization,
    confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, availability, and access control
    [101], which are briefly discussed here. • Authentication- It is defined as the
    process of confirming and ensuring the identity of an object. In the context of
    IoT, each object must be capable enough to detect and authenticate all other objects
    in the system with whom they communicate. • Privacy- Although there are many definitions
    of privacy, it can be simply defined as the process of ensuring fair and authorized
    access to personal information only through legitimate users, not by public or
    malicious objects [102]. • Authorization- The process of allowing permission to
    an object or entity to do some activities [103]. • Integrity- It is the method
    of maintaining the consistency, correctness, and trustworthiness of information
    over its whole period of the lifecycle. The modification of basic information
    or even the infusion of invalid information in IoT could trigger major problems.
    For instance, little violation in smart health systems could lead to the death
    of the patient [104]. • Non-Repudiation- The process of guaranteeing the competence
    that a task/event has been ensued by the authorized source and destination. With
    this goal, the source and destination object cannot deny the authenticity of a
    specific data transferred. • Availability- The process of guaranteeing the required
    service available anywhere, anyplace, and anytime for the intended users defines
    the process of availability. In the context of IoT, the availability of the objects
    includes themselves. • Access Control- Access control comprises all three components
    like authentication, authorization, and accountability plays a major role in managing
    the IoT infrastructure. It strictly allows legalizing the viewers to use the resources
    in a computing environment and helps to mitigate the risk of a business or organization.
    To accomplish these security service constraints, human has adopted long-term
    cryptography protocols to secure the data over a communication channel. The source
    node uses an encryption technique to hide the original data over the communication
    channel and the destination node recovers the original message using only decryption
    algorithms. To do so, there are many symmetric/asymmetric algorithms, hash function,
    MAC function, and digital signatures are used by IoT networks [105]. Such cryptographic
    techniques are the backbone of secure infrastructure and must be robust enough
    to withstand any type of attack. In general, the two schemes such as encryption
    and digital signature are processed separately. Over time, a new cryptographic
    tool named “Signcryption” was evolved which provides confidentiality, authentication,
    integrity, and non-repudiation in a single logical step with fewer overheads [106],
    [107]. Numerous signcryption algorithms have been industrialized in the recent
    past. But many of the signcryption schemes are designed based on Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) cryptography that falls under public-key cryptography. The main purpose
    of Public Key Cryptography (PKC) is to exchange the session keys and to maintain
    message (M) confidentiality and authenticity by providing encryption and a digital
    signature. As of our knowledge, Public Key Cryptography is categorized into three
    different classes such as PKI-based, Identity-based, and Certificateless-based
    cryptography (See Fig. 6), and their usage have been realized depending on the
    applications. The below sections discuss them briefly. Download : Download high-res

    full-size image Fig. 9. Certificateless Cryptography. PKI-based cryptography In
    Public Key Infrastructure-based cryptography, each user creates his/her own private
    key as well as the public key and sends the public key to the third party known
    as a certificate authority (CA). Then CA maintains the database of all the public
    keys of all the users and authenticates the users by providing the digital certificate.
    The digital certificate comprises the user identity along with the user''s public
    key. Using this PKI setting, signcryption scheme has taken birth [106]. There
    are few authentication schemes discussed in [160], [161], [162] but they have
    applied different mathematical techniques like lattices, chaotic maps, elliptic
    curves, etc. In [164], the author has discussed about a public key cryptography
    for smart card authentication. Over the years, many signcryption schemes have
    been executed and discussed in the literature. But most of these studies show
    their complexity in terms of generating the certificates. Moreover, the complexity
    increases proportionally to the increased number of certificates. • Advantages
    of PKI ○ There is no need of exchanging the session keys. ○ Every user has their
    own private and public keys. ○ It provides confidentiality and authenticity of
    the message at the same time. • Disadvantages of PKI: ○ The certificate authority
    is managed by a third party, who authenticates the user by providing a certificate
    and combines it with the public key of the user.Certificate management is a big
    challenge for large networks that leads to scalability issues. Identity-based
    cryptography (IDBC) Over the period, Identity-based cryptosystems [108] became
    popular that could be able to overcome the certificate management problem. Each
    user (sender, S, and receiver, R) creates the public key by using his/her unique
    identity like phone number, Aadhaar number, or pan number, etc. But the main limitations
    of these schemes are key escrow problems caused by the secret keys generated by
    PKG and lack of support for a fine-grained revocation of identity • Advantages
    of IDBC: ○ There is no need to issue digital certificates to the users for their
    authenticity. ○ There is no need to manage digital certificates which combine
    public keys with the user''s identity. • Disadvantages of IDBC: ○ PKG knows the
    secret keys of all users so, he can change the cipher text, modify the message,
    or he can do anything with the original message. This problem is addressed as
    Key escrow problem in the literature. Certificateless public key cryptography
    (CL-PKC) As PKC schemes suffer from the key escrow problem as well as certificate
    management problem, researchers introduced a certificateless setting in PKC to
    solve these problems [109]. CL-PKC plays a crucial role in PKC that stands in
    between traditional certificate PKC and ID-BC for the usage of public-key cryptography.
    In CL-PKC, PKG does not have access to the user''s private key but Key Generation
    center (KGC) produces the user''s partial private key and public key . The user
    creates his full private key and public key by considering two things, e.g., the
    partial private key provided by KGC and by selecting a random number as per his
    choice. The advantages and disadvantages are discussed here briefly. • Advantage
    of CL-PKC: ○ It does not require maintaining certificates. ○ There is no need
    to provide an authentication certificate. ○ It eliminates the inherent key escrow
    problems. ○ Third-party does not have access to the full private key of the user.
    • Disadvantages of CL-PKC: ○ It is not possible to evaluate a user''s public key
    by using his/her unique identity and pubic key of KGC but it is feasible to check
    the corresponding public key of the user. Certificateless signcryption schemes
    (CLSC) The combined features of certificateless cryptography with the signcryption
    technique have resulted in a new technique called “certificateless signcryption
    scheme” in 2008 [110]. The major benefits of this algorithm are as follows. •
    It sends a confidential message by binding the authentication through signcryption.
    • It avoids the certificate authority (CA) to distribute public keys of the user
    and digital certificate. • It eliminates the key escrow problem inherent in IDBC
    by adopting the ID-based setting. Elliptic curve plays a crucial role in reducing
    the length of the key size [111]. Over the years, rapid growth has been taken
    place in the field of certificateless signcryption in Elliptic curve cryptography
    era [112], [113], [114],165]. For more clarity, a few variants of Certificateless
    Signcryption techniques are depicted in Fig. 10. Subsequently, many new signcryption
    schemes have been developed in certificateless environments. These are: Proxy
    signcryption [115,116], Multi signcryption [117,118], multi-Recipient signcryption
    [119,120], Online/offline signcryption [121,122], Hybrid signcryption [123], [124],166],
    Ring signcryption [125], [126], [127], [128], Generalized signcryption [129, 130],
    threshold signcryption [131,132], group signcryption [133] and blind signcryption
    [134,135,163], Aggregate signcryption schemes, etc. [136], [137], [138], [139],
    [140], [141], [142], [143], [144], [145], [146], [147], [148], [149], [150], [151].
    As our objective is to focus on the aggregate signcryption techniques and their
    application on IoT, other techniques are not discussed in this paper. One may
    refer to [89] for detailed information. Download : Download high-res image (517KB)

    Certificateless aggregate signcryption schemes (CLASC) Signcryption has further
    been processed by gathering the signatures and allowing multiple signatures (generated
    by multiple public keys) for multiple messages to be aggregated in a single signature
    and to be verified accordingly. Thus, it reduces the computational and communication
    cost. Mobile IoT users are self-organized by nature, send and receive the packet
    bundles within a short communication range of each other. Due to both mobility
    and short-range communication, there is no guaranteed path between the source
    and destination. Moving IoT users through vehicles and mobile electricity consumers
    are dynamically categorized into multiple social groups based on their velocity,
    directions, and accelerations and assumed to be uniformly distributed. All IoT
    nodes in each group are in communication range of each other, broadcast their
    collected content bundles on-demand, and share a dynamically updated group key
    negotiated by all of them. Significant use of Aggregate Signcryption techniques
    in IoT groups is discussed in section IV. In this section, a formal model of the
    CLASC scheme, security objectives, and attack model of CLASC schemes are briefly
    discussed. • Formal Model of CLASC In general, CLASC schemes follows certain procedure
    to operate and generate the keys [151]. It comprises four players. These are:
    KGC, Senders an aggregator (AG), and receiver R. Initial setup operations are
    accomplished by KGC followed by others. ○ Setup: KGC runs the setup algorithm
    to generate the system parameters and master secret key Then it keeps this as
    a secret key and publish the parameters. ○ Extract-partial-keys: To generate the
    partial private key and public key of users, KGC run this algorithm by selecting
    a random number and using the identity of the user . ○ Set- private-key: Users
    execute this algorithm to set up their private key ○ Set-public-key: Users run
    this algorithm for the setting of their full public key ○ Signcryption: To generate
    the signcryption text , each sender run this algorithm by taking the inputs message
    , the full public key of the receiver whose identity is , a full private key of
    the sender whose identity is . ○ Aggregation: AG executes this algorithm by taking
    the inputs of each and generates aggregate signcryption text σ. ○ Verification:
    Anyone can check the validity of signcryption text σ by using a full public key
    of the senders and receiver whose identities are and respectively. ○ Unsigncryption:
    The receiver executes this algorithm to retrieve the message from valid signcryption
    text by using , full public keys of senders and receiver, the full private key
    of the receiver. • Security Objectives of CLASC The security objectives which
    are satisfied by the CLASC scheme are defined as follows [151]. ○ Data integrity
    and confidentiality: The signcrypted data must not be disclosed to an unauthorised
    user, and the message should not be altered. ○ Mutual Authentication: Sender and
    receiver follow a certain procedure to authenticate each other. ○ Key escrow resilience:
    The adversary will not be able to acquire the full private key of a user even
    if Key Generating center (KGC) gets compromised. ○ Privacy-preserving: Even though
    the system parameters are generated by KGC and the signcrypted data is transferred
    through KGC, it cannot acquire valid information due to the lack of knowledge
    about the private keys of the sender and receiver.Public verifiability: It is
    a desirable property that one can verify the validity of signcryption without
    the information of private keys and messages. ○ Attack model where CLASC Schemes
    provide security In general, the CLASC scheme encounters two types of attacks
    [113]. ○ Type-1 adversary (AI): This is the first category of intruder/malicious
    user (normally treated as an outside intruder) who does not have access to the
    master key, but the intruder can replace the user''s public key to retrieve the
    confidential message or forge the signature by applying challenging game in the
    attack model [145]. ○ Type-2 adversary (AII): This is the second category of intruders
    (normally considered as insider intruder) who have access to the master key, but
    the intruder cannot access/replace the user''s public keys to capture the authenticity
    and confidentiality using the attack model [145]. CLASC used in IoT applications
    This section emphasizes Certificateless Aggregate Signcryption Schemes (CLASC)
    applied in IoT applications. As discussed above, Certificateless Aggregate Signcryption
    Schemes allow multiple users to send a signcrypted message to either a single
    user or multiple users by aggregating multiple signatures in a single signature
    that reduces the huge number of data exchanged and overall computational cost.
    So, it''s suitable for resource-constrained tiny mobile devices, forming different
    groups dynamically in low bandwidth networks like Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs),
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), different types of IoT Networks, cloud, etc.
    There are two categories of certificateless aggregate signcryption techniques
    discussed in the literature showing their efficiency on IoT networks; one category
    is Pairing CLASC and the other category is Pairing-free CLASC. Pairing certificateless
    aggregate signcryption schemes (Pairing CLASC) vs. Pairing-free certificateless
    aggregate signcryption schemes (Pairing-free CLASC) In Pairing CLASC, the IoT
    users create bilinear pairing independently to generate single signcryption and
    to verify the signcryption text respectively using hard problems like Computational
    Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (CBDH), Gap Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (GBDH), Decision Bilinear
    Diffie-Hellma (DBDH) assumptions which leads to high computational overhead in
    resource-constrained IoT devices even though it provides desired level security
    with small parameters as used in elliptic curve cryptography [141]. On the other
    hand, in Pairing-free CLASC, users need not perform bilinear pairing operations
    and use hard problems like Computational Diffie Hellman (CDH), Gap Diffie-Hellman
    (GDH), Elliptic Curve Discrete Algorithm Problem (ECDLP), thus reducing the computational
    overhead [146]. It is worthy to note that even though numerous researchers discuss
    pairing-based aggregated certificateless cryptosystems highlighting the overall
    complexity of pairings and procedures to speed up the pairing computation, still
    these schemes suffer from heavy computational overhead due to the usage of pairing
    [146]. Both the Pairing and Pairing-free aggregate signcryption schemes have shown
    their potentiality in different areas of IoT like Smart Homes, MANETs, WSNs, VANETS,
    Smart grids, E-health care, etc. Given the potentiality of authenticity and confidentiality
    in each application, there is a need to analyze CLASC schemes and share them on
    an open platform for the betterment of societal life, which is presented in the
    next section. Thus, from the large pond of CLASC, we have selected a few CLASCs
    (both pairing and pairing-free) and evaluated their performance independently.
    Pairing CLASC in IoT applications In [144], an aggregate signcryption scheme was
    introduced for the first time in order to reduce the quantity of data exchanged
    but the scheme was based on the ID-BC. In 2001, the researchers introduced a concrete
    CLASC scheme based on Bilinear Diffie Hellman (BDH) principle and proved secure
    against Indistinguishability against adaptively chosen cipher text attack (IND-CCA2)
    and Existential Unforgeability Chosen Message Attack (EUF-CMA) but it could not
    provide the formal security model [136]. The authors of [137] have also developed
    a new CLASC scheme by addressing Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) problem and Computational
    Diffie-Hellman (CDH) to defend against IND-CCA2 and EUF-CMA attacks which prove
    its efficiency in WSNs but suffers from achieving the target security model. The
    work in [138] presents a CLASC scheme that improves computational efficiency by
    reducing the number of bilinear pairings and defends against IND-CCA2 attacks.
    In [139], the authors proposed an improved CLASC scheme over pairings by applying
    Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) problem that was needed for existing
    aggregate signature verifications and unsigncryption features. In this work, a
    privacy preservation protocol was designed taking the features of the CLASC scheme
    to enhance the security in data transmission of vehicular crowdsensing monitoring
    systems using fog computing. But the proposed model lags behind the formal security
    proof. The authors in [140] proposed another CLASC scheme with pairings that addresses
    CDH and DBDH problems to enhance the security for road surface monitoring using
    fog computing but it has more pairing exponentiations and lags with a formal security
    proof. Recently, a CLASC scheme is proposed to address the CDH problem for the
    vehicle to everything (V2X) communication in 5 G mobile networks where roadside
    units are considered as edge nodes and these nodes are capable of communicating
    with the vehicles on the roads [141]. This scheme works efficiently against an
    effective adversary and reduces the communication cost, but it suffers from computational
    cost because of bilinear pairing operations. The study in [142] has proposed a
    CLASC scheme by addressing CDH and DBDH problems for an IoT infrastructure where
    the experimental setup has been made with the help of Raspberry Pi, minicomputers,
    mobile phones, and one desktop to establish the infrastructure. This experimental
    study favors the proficiency of utilization of resources like memory and bandwidth
    but lags behind the efficiency in terms of computational and communication costs.
    In [143], the proposed CLASC scheme is used for mobile crowd sensing applications
    to address the security and privacy issues i.e., to keep secret the sensitive
    location information of users by addressing the CDH problem in pairing operations.
    Even though a lot of research focuses on certificateless aggregate signcryption
    schemes, most of the schemes follow the bilinear pairing operations. Since bilinear
    pairing operation is time-consuming, it is not practical for lightweight applications
    like MANETs, WSNs, VANETs, IoT, and other low bandwidth networks which have motivated
    the researchers/practitioners to develop pairing-free CLASC schemes. For instance,
    in security-critical applications like VANETs, the multi-factor authentication
    scheme is essential in order to maintain privacy, ensure vehicle identity, and
    preserve the integrity of messages exchanged [159]. Pairing-free CLASC in IoT
    applications In 2017, the authors of [145] initially proposed a CLASC scheme without
    using pairings. Later, they executed a pairing-free CLASC scheme based on the
    Elliptic Curve Discrete Algorithm Problem (ECDLP) in IoT applications where the
    smart cameras are used as smart sensors to capture highly sensitive information
    from home to city scales. First, the authors used 15 images on each raspberry
    pi and applied signcryption. Second, they varied the number of devices, and at
    the same time, they initiated the aggregate signcryptions, and measured the total
    computational/communication overhead but the proposed model lags with a proper
    security model in many-to-one scenarios [146]. The research in [147] shows the
    pairing-free CLASC scheme concerning CDHP and DLP which has been proved to be
    secured against unforgeable and provides confidentiality under the random oracle
    model but it suffers from communication cost. The work in [148] shows smart grid
    applications where a large amount of data is transmitted from smart meters to
    the power company, which poses user privacy leakage issues. To avoid this issue,
    the authors have proposed a CLASC model by considering CDH but there was a lack
    of formal proof in the security model. Subsequently, the authors in [149] implemented
    pairing-free CLASC (for authentication purposes) using CDH and DLP to monitor
    safe road conditions on fog computing architecture. Further, in [150] the authors
    have implemented the CLASC scheme using Multi-Decisional Diffie-Hellman (MD-DDH)
    problem on massive NB IoT devices in 3GPP 5 G network to defend against replay
    attacks and man in the middle attack. Later, a Pairing-free CLASC scheme has been
    proposed using the One-sided Gap Diffee-Hellman (OGDH) problem in [151] to secure
    sensitive information of a patient in WSNs healthcare applications. Table 4 summarizes
    the CLASC schemes and their usage in IoT applications considering both pairing
    and pairing-free computations. To make it more clear, we have taken a few references
    and plotted the comparison results graphically in terms of various performance
    parameters based on the author''s experimental results. Performance analysis of
    CLASC used in IoT applications (Both pairing and pairing-free) This section discusses
    the performance of various CLASC schemes in terms of computational and communication
    costs. The running time of CLASC schemes is compared at various levels as discussed
    in Table 5 and Table 6. Moreover, computational efficiency is measured by calculating
    the running time of various algorithms such as signcryption, aggregate verification,
    and unsigncryption. The communication efficiency is calculated based on the length
    of the signcryption text of corresponding schemes. To evaluate the computational
    and communication efficiency of various schemes, the results are referred from
    [152], [153], [154], [155], [156], [157]. For a better understanding of the reader,
    we have plotted the results in terms of computational and communication efficiency
    by considering various performance parameters as shown in Fig. 11 to Fig. 15.
    First, the performance of Pairing-based CLASCs is discussed. Later, the performance
    of Pairing-free CLASCs is discussed. The running time of numerous elliptic curve
    operations is given in Tables 2 and Table 3. • Pairing CLASC (Performance Analysis)-In
    this section, we aim to compare the performance of various Pairing-CLASC for IoT
    applications as discussed in [137], [138], [139], [140], [141], [142], [143],167]
    to provide better understanding and clarity. The schemes are compared by the running
    time for the generation of single signcryption, aggregate verification, and unsigncryption
    of a ciphertext. We have also analyzed the algorithms from different perspectives
    that include running time for single signcryption, single verification, and single
    unsigncryption as shown in Fig. 11. Even though the proposed scheme in [140] has
    less computational cost in signcryption but it has a more computational cost of
    single unsigncryption. The graphs of existing CLASCs in terms of running time
    for unsigncryption, and aggregate verification as per the number of users are
    shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 respectively. The total running time of various CLASC
    is shown in Fig. 14. The number of users has varied from 1 to 70. The running
    time for the aggregate verification scheme [143] is only 2320 which is the lowest
    computational cost among all the CLASCs. Even though the scheme in [143] uses
    bilinear pairings, it has a low computational cost in terms of aggregate verification.
    Also, it gives better performance in terms of total computational cost such as
    8729.24 for 70 users. The schemes in [137], [138], [139],[141], [142] have communication
    costs concerning all CLASC with pairings such as 16,088 bytes for 70 users. The
    pairing scheme in [143] has the highest communication cost among all other schemes
    but the scheme used in [167] provides the best performance by introducing the
    least communication cost i.e., 12,620 in pairings. But it is observed that the
    scheme in [140] has more computational and communication costs due to linear pairing
    and pairing exponentiations as shown in Fig. 15. The computational cost of aggregate
    verification, unsigncryption, and the total running time are presented in Table
    7 considering the number of users 70 i.e., n = 70. Download : Download high-res

    spirit, the efficiency of distinct pairing-free CLASC used in IoT –applications
    is compared in terms of computational and communication costs [145,149,151]. The
    scheme in [149] has less time for the generation of single signcryption i.e. 145.24
    as shown in Fig. 11. The schemes in [145,149] require only 4060 running time for
    the unsigncryption stage for 70 users, which is very less compared to all other
    CLASCs. It is observed from Fig. 12 that even though the proposed schemes in [145],
    [149],151] are pairing-free CLASC, they need more computational cost in terms
    of total running time than the pairing-based CLASC discussed in [143]. The scheme
    discussed in [149] requires 9840 bytes for signcryption text which shows less
    communication cost among all CLASC schemes as depicted in Fig. 15. Download :

    work With the rapid convergence of IoT with Cloud, Fog Computing, Edge Computing,
    Blockchain, and Machine Learning technology, many performance and security issues
    are yet to be resolved. These diversified security requirements demand the development
    of adaptive, context-aware, and user-centric security solutions. In this work,
    we have taken a novel look at the overall security issues, security policies on
    IoT applications, and notions of Certificateless Aggregate Signcryption Schemes
    (CLASC) security in IoT networks. We have identified and formalized the threats
    in critical applications of IoT and extracted the layer-wise attacks and countermeasures
    in each layer of the IoT network. Furthermore, we have directed our survey on
    Certificateless Aggregate Signcryption techniques focusing on Pairing Statementng-free
    techniques which have been applied in different types of IoT networks to deal
    with data privacy issues in tiny embedded networks. It is observed from our survey
    that out of several CLASCs used in IoT, more CLASCs have been developed considering
    bilinear pairing operations and a few CLASCs are developed using pairing-free
    operations. Even though the pairing operations are costly, the scheme proposed
    in [158] has low computational cost than any other pairing-free scheme, on the
    other hand, it has more communication cost compared to others. This can be the
    basis for future reviews on different notions for CLASCs security to investigate
    what exactly they achieve in each application scenario. This is very important
    as it helps to understand the importance of security inside the IoT networks and
    strongly supports considering it as the standard notion. The future work directs
    the current researchers to provide CLASC based efficient solutions to the major
    problem areas:1) secure and authenticated key establishment in one-to-many communications
    or many-to-many communications 3) secure ATM networks 4) efficient authenticated
    key recovery process and 5) secure and lightweight electronic transaction protocols,
    etc. The work can be further extended to design many new CLASCs to resist different
    types of quantum attacks. We expect that the researchers would find innovative
    applications in many application areas of IoT that include digital cash payment
    systems, RFID lock systems, personal health cards, etc. CRediT authorship contribution

    1 Introduction Water is what keeps the world alive, even though it seems to be
    the most abundant resource on earth, but in reality, statistics from the Food
    and Agriculture Organization FAO [1] show that freshwater accounts for only 2.5%
    of all terrestrial water in the world. The remaining 97.5% is unavailable for
    human use because they are found as seawater or brackish water, snow, or ice.
    In each year, 66% of the worldwide populace (4 billion individuals) live in states
    of extreme water shortage for at least a month [2,3,4], while serious water shortage
    affects a half billion people [2] in the world. For example, in Northern African
    countries, the severity of climate, nature of geography, lack of rainfall, and
    over-exploitation degrade the naturally available water resources to an alarming
    extent. However, the extension of the irrigation process in agriculture is one
    of the primary main impetus for the rising worldwide interest in water [5],because,
    as illustrated (Fig. 1), it consumes 70% of freshwater withdrawals globally compared
    to other sectors such as domestic and industry [6]. Fig. 1 Global water withdrawal
    over time by FAO Full size image In order to optimize the irrigation process consumption,
    it was necessary to adopt new technologies in agricultural fields such as Global
    Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), embedded sensors on agricultural machinery,
    satellite imagery, and agricultural drones [7], which has leaded to the birth
    of Precise agriculture(PA), which is defined as the good management of agricultural
    parcels to optimize the yield production, while preserving natural and financial
    energy resources, taking into account inter-plot variability and differences between
    growing plants in the same yield [8]. The PA aims first to optimize the use of
    available resources to increase the profitability and sustainability of agricultural
    operations, to reduce negative environmental impact, and to improve the quality
    of the soils and the social aspects of farming, ranching, and relevant professions
    [9]. In addition, the new technologies applied in PA have presented specific solutions
    for different problems in the agricultural process. For instance, in soil monitoring
    [10], detection of diseases [11], application of fertilizers [12], and precise
    Irrigation [13]. However, in the case of precise irrigation, the automated irrigation
    process can ensure the water needs of crops, but the newly adopted technologies,
    besides watering the crops, take into consideration several constraints such as
    the variability of time and place factors, the differences in the required irrigation
    techniques depending on the type of crop. For example, tomatoes require buried
    irrigation pipes [14]while sugar beet [15] require localized irrigation ramps.
    Another constraint is the needed amount of water which changes from one plant
    to another. For this reason, it was necessary to add intelligence to the automated
    irrigation systems by adopting monitoring techniques that allow the irrigation
    systems to provide the precise amount of needed water at the appropriate time
    for crop growth; as remote sensing [16], processing of satellite and drones images
    [17],and the IoT technology [18]. However, the internet of things technology (IoT)
    was recently applied in precise agriculture in order to enable various monitoring
    and selection applications for crop growth or as decision support in the irrigation
    process. It is described as a shared network of objects in interaction with each
    other and it offers the ability to remote systems via the internet; so as in irrigation
    systems based on IoT it can avoid human errors and other errors that appear during
    system operation by controlling sensors and the pumping motors with a remote area
    [19]. In addition, these systems can incorporate sensors, robots, or drones that
    are associated through the internet in order to work consequently. With the Business
    Insider Intelligence service estimation of increasing the systems based on IoT
    number with 20% annually by 2020, there are organizations with the 5th generation
    mobile network technology that can provide adaptable and productive answers by
    using minimal labors [20]. For, the 5G bandwidth allows the connection of billions
    of devices [21, 22]. In precise irrigation systems, data is one of the most important
    features, so as in IoT-based irrigation systems, collected data is stored in cloud
    repositories. With the appearance of the 5G innovation, real-time data processing
    can be achieved with cloud computing while the host-to-host communication is ensured,
    the thing that will bring great development in precise irrigation systems based
    on IoT. Moreover, even though the application of an efficient water resource system
    based on IoT is an effective solution, yet, in order to manage it, several intricacies
    are involved such as a large number of equality and inequality constraints, discrete
    variables, nonlinear and discontinuous functions, a wider range of uncertainties,
    integration of large system components, etc. So, it is a hard problem to be solved
    with classical algorithms. For that issue, the stochastic multi-objective optimization
    methods, as the heuristic and meta-heuristic ones, have proven their efficiency
    for those systems of optimization, and for multi-objective problems. In this study,
    we were interested in the evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which can deal with very
    complex problems such as precise irrigation based on IoT [23]. In addition, we
    were concentrating on EAs because of their high performances such as the flexibility
    to be adapted to the task at hand, their global search characteristics, and because
    they can solve difficult problems [24] with a large number of parameters in relation.
    The EAs have expansive applicability since, with a similar strategy, they can
    be applied to any difficult issue that can be communicated as an optimization
    task. Even for real-world problems, they can also offer a set of solutions with
    multi-modal functions. Unfortunately, despite their great ease of implementation
    in various problems in which their use easily allows effective solutions to be
    found, their application in real-world problems, as in the industrial case, forces
    the execution time to become increasingly important. Therefore, to deal with this
    problem, a new notion of parallelism has appeared. It allows both to reduce the
    research time and to improve the quality of solutions. This latter is currently
    manifested in several ways such as the use of new appropriate development environments
    available and the faster cheaper parallel computers which makes it possible to
    apply EAs to very large complex populations and complicated problems. The process
    of artificial evolution can be implemented on parallel hardware platforms in various
    ways, where the basic idea is about individuals in the population, who are independent
    of each other, and only a few stages from the algorithm which require interaction
    between them, mainly crossbreeding and population reduction [25]. During recent
    years; EAs have been implemented on several hardware platforms such as, systems
    on chip and their variants(System on Chip, Multiprocessor System on Chip), the
    Field Programmable Gate array architecture, the clusters of computers, grid, and
    cloud computing environments, and multi-core computers, multi-kernel computers,
    and Graphic Processing Units) [26]. The increase of the applications of systems
    based on IoT and wireless sensor networks in the field of agriculture, and the
    need to optimize the functioning of these systems, attracted us to provide an
    updated classification state of the art of EAs combined with IoTs in precise irrigation
    systems and to present examples of their real-world applications and their recent
    hotspots. Therefore, this paper aims to present the direct and indirect applications
    of EAs in optimizing IoT-based irrigation systems, their challenges, and the hardware
    solutions developed in the literature to decrease EAs execution time. We will
    organize this paper as the following plan. In the first section of this paper,
    we will present the research problem and explain our choices. Second, the evolution
    of irrigation systems will be in the next section which describes the traditional
    irrigation systems, the automated irrigation systems, and the precise irrigation
    systems with the ones based on IoT. In The third section, we define the use categories
    of EAs in precise irrigation by IoT. Then, we will describe some parallel computing
    tools to optimize the execution time of EAs. 2 Irrigation system evolution Water
    is a necessary element for plantsćultivation, but it is not always available for
    farmers as in the case of excessive drainage or groundwater drop especially in
    arid areas. So, they need an artificial irrigation operation which allows bringing
    the water to the crops, and to bring in parallel fertilizing elements either in
    the soil by gravity irrigation [27], sprinkler irrigation [28], drip irrigation
    [29] or by suction on the leaves [30]. Artificial irrigation also has disadvantages
    as in the case of not planned irrigation at a fixed rate, which negatively affects
    the production of plants because they need varying amounts of watering and in
    well-defined periods. In the following sub-parts of this section, we will discuss
    the evolution of the irrigation systems. 2.1 Traditional irrigation systems Irrigation
    seems to have been used in the history of mankind since the earliest beginning.
    Different techniques were developed in the past in order to reduce climatic uncertainty.
    For example, the perennial irrigation which was employed in the Mesopotamian plain
    by coaxing water through a matrix of small channels formed in the field, the basin
    irrigation using the flooding of the Nile to inundate land plots which had been
    surrounded by dykes and which was practiced by ancient Egyptians [31]. The pulley
    system method which consist of pulling up water from a well with a moat, the chain
    pump method where two large wheels connected by a chain are used with buckets
    to pick up water, and the method that uses the animal labor where a wheel is turned
    by ox or cow to draw the water from the well. In history, a very old system called
    Foggara was applied, according to [32], the Foggara originated in Iran under the
    name of qanat, and so it was applied in Morocco under the name of khettara and
    in Tunisia under the name of ngoula or kriga. In addition, in Algeria it was introduced
    by El Malik El Mansour at Tamantit near Adrar in the Algerian Sahara (Fig. 2),
    between the eleventh and twelfth centuries [33]. This technique aims to horizontally
    collect the subterranean water, it comprises of a few progressive wells conveying
    variable profundities, consolidated at the base by a waste exhibition typically
    called Ennfad. The water assembled by the channels which follow a light slant
    is depleted from there on by auxiliary water system channels to flood the palm
    ranches [34]. Fig. 2 Foggara, a traditional irrigation system used in Algeria
    taken from [35] Full size image Another example of a traditional irrigation system
    is the flooded fields. It is a particular case for the irrigation of rice. As
    it was described by the FAO, the flooded fields irrigation system consists of
    the main pumping station (or a mane intake structure station ) which directs water
    from the source of supply (such as a reservoir or a river) into the irrigation
    system, a conveyance system that assures the transport of water from the main
    intake structure station up to the field ditches, a distribution system which
    assures the transport of water through field ditches to the irrigated fields,
    and a field application system that assures the transport of water within the
    fields (Fig. 3) [36]. Fig. 3 Irrigation system described by [36] Full size image
    2.2 Automated irrigation systems Traditional irrigation systems require human
    intervention to work. However, automated irrigation systems provide routine water
    supply for plants in a certain time without human intervention or with minimal
    contribution. In most cases, watering is made by sprinkling as in (Fig. 4), but
    also, it can be done by surface irrigation, or with the drip irrigation system,
    whose automation is dedicated to the timing and movement of the jets and sometimes
    to fix the pressure of the water flow too. In other words, any irrigation system
    can be automatically scheduled with the help of timers, actuators, calculators.
    Fig. 4 Example of a sprinkler automated irrigation system Full size image The
    automated irrigation system timers use a clock controller to regulate the amount
    of water according to a predefined timing. The volume-based automated irrigation
    system uses automatic metering valves to control irrigation according to the volume
    of water in the reservoirs. However, The Open-loop systems regroup the timers
    and the volume-based systems. In this type, the farmer has the ability to select
    the timing to start the irrigation operation and the threshold volume of water
    [37]. Another type of irrigation system is the closed loop irrigation systems,
    where the irrigation process is controlled with feedback systems from the field.
    And it’s up to these sensing systems to control the starting, stopping and the
    amount of irrigation. It’s also known as the smart irrigation system. For example,
    the precise irrigation systems based on IoT as the system described in [38], uses
    real-time environmental parameters as soil moisture level, ambient temperature
    and tank water level in order to control the irrigation system, because these
    lasts have continuous influence on the irrigation operation. Other automated irrigation
    systems based on IoT [39] uses the WSN to monitor the environmental conditions,
    and actuators to control water level of agricultural land, while the real-time
    data are processed by treatment units for example servers in cloud computing cases,
    in order to develop a decision making system. As a result, the differences between
    the Open loop systems and the Closed loop systems based on IoT, can be described
    in the number of connected objects, in the Closed loop one a huge number of sensors
    and objects is used to control automatically the irrigation without human intervention.
    2.3 Precise irrigation systems Knowing where, when, and how much to irrigate helps
    to minimize yield losses due to water stress and preserve water in return. Precise
    Irrigation (PI) is a very important axis in precision agriculture. Unlike open-loop
    control (without feedback) irrigation technologies, which operate according to
    a program and timers already preprogrammed [40]. PI (surface or buried irrigation)
    monitors weather conditions, soil conditions, evaporation, and exploitation of
    plant water [41] to automatically adjust the watering schedule according to the
    actual conditions of the agricultural land. In addition, this greatly improves
    the efficiency of water use. However, water needs can be determined by different
    factors such as the availability of water in the soil, the amount of rain, etc,
    of which there are several approaches to quantify them such as soil moisture [42]
    or evapotranspiration [43]. So, the autonomous irrigation systems use automatic
    learning algorithms in order processing the various data quantified by real-time
    surveillance techniques, to extract information and subsequently make control
    decisions of irrigation or to make previsions about water needs in the future.
    Different real-time surveillance techniques can be applied in PI in order to detect
    useful information for irrigation, such as the calculation of evapotranspiration
    by remote sensing [44, 45], PI using robots [46] and smart irrigation system based
    on IoT, using WSN [47]. 2.4 Precise irrigation systems based on IoT In order to
    save water, it is better to irrigate only when there will be an intense requirement
    of water. For that, specified sensors have to be used in order to measure the
    exact needed amount of water. The sensed data has to be processed with an electronic
    instrument (in the majority of cases they use a micro-controller), whenever there
    is a change in temperature and humidity of the surroundings. These sensors sense
    the change in the field, and give an interrupt signal to the microcontroller,
    which according to these data, operates the application system (Fig. 5a). Fig.
    5 Irrigation automated system based on IoT Full size image In order to provide
    the energy needed to power the system, battery panels are used to charge batteries
    using the solar power, while the used microcontrollers have to be low power ones
    in order to minimize the consummation, as the systems described in [48,49,50].
    In [51], a precise system of irrigation was developed using IoT, which by checking
    the moisture level if it is less than a fixed criteria, the irrigation will be
    started by using a microcontroller, in addition the connection with the system
    was by an android application on a mobile phone. In [48], Shiraz Pasha and al,
    created a precise irrigation system using a micro-controller. This system consists
    of a moisture sensor, analog to digital converter, microcontroller, Relay driver,
    solenoid valve, solar panel and a battery. The dampness sensor is covered in the
    field at required depth. In the event that the dampness content in the field gets
    reduced to a lower edge limit, the sign is delivered from the miniature regulator
    to turn ON transfer. The transfer in turn opens the solenoid valve at that point
    water from the source is supplied to the field. Dampness level detected from the
    sensor will be shown in the LCD show. After reaching the upper edge limit, the
    sensor offers a corresponding signal to the miniature regulator and the transfer
    is turned OFF and consequently the solenoid valve gets shut. Nowadays, IoT technology
    is already deeply incorporated in most of the environmental monitoring applications.
    So, as in precise irrigation systems based on IoT, soil sensors can provide physical
    parameters values such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture [52]. These
    parameters can be used in decision support systems that analyze large amounts
    of data to improve efficiency of irrigation operation. So as in [53], an alert
    system for the control of water pressure of plants using IoT innovation was introduced.
    This model was applied for accuracy cultivating using a remote sensor network
    with cloud processing. The decision support system was designed to estimate the
    amounts of water needed in an agricultural local area. While to controthe irrigation
    operation, a char obtained from a dashboard programming is used by farmers to
    monitor in real time the varieties of the soil conditions and to avoid water stress,
    when a basic water level is reached, a notice by SMS will be sent to a mobile
    destination. Recently, the IoT and Cloud Computing have become the two most associated
    internet technologies, in a way that IoT obtains powerful computing tools through
    cloud computing, and cloud computing finds the best practicing channel based on
    IoT. The Cloud computing systems are a processing paradigm that proposes on-request
    administrations to the end-users through a pool of processing assets that incorporates
    storage capacity, computing resources, etc [54]. Unfortunately, Cloud computing
    is experiencing some constraints, like high latency, low Spectral Efficiency (SE),
    and non-adaptive communication machines. Inspired to tackle these const-raints,
    another innovation was born, Edge computing [55]. Edge computing is used to deal
    with real-time information because the data process is done near the sensors,
    while Cloud computing is used to handle information that isn’t time-driven because
    the process in this case is done in the cloud. Otherwise, Edge computing is liked
    over Cloud computing in remote areas that require local storage and computing,
    because it permits processing assets and application administrations to be circulated
    along the communication path, via decentralized computing infrastructure, while
    Cloud computing rotates around huge, concentrated servers stored in data centers
    to process the transmitted data [56]. However, Edge Computing cannot create direct
    network connections between two terminals or between a terminal and an IoT gateway
    on its own, and also it cannot process a large number of data when the number
    of sensors used becomes very large. For this, a new innovation was born, which
    is Fog Computing. Fog computing comprises different fog nodes masterminded in
    a network, these lasts are placed as close as possible to users, which allows
    the data to be handled locally inside fog nodes, instead of relocating them to
    a away located cloud server [57, 58]. The fogging presents a distributed computing
    environment which deals with latency-sensitive applications, and has shown good
    performances with massive data processing problems. As a result, the fog computing
    maintains a strategic distance from an extreme abuse of Cloud, and so decreasing
    computational loads. 2.4.1 Precise irrigation systems based on Cloud computing
    With the contribution of IoT and Cloud computing, the irrigation systems monitoring
    turned out to be exceptionally quick and simple to keep up. And they can be processed
    with input information, such as temperature and moisture values of sensed fields
    and Multiprocessing operation can be accomplished with cloud computing. In other
    words, the precise irrigation systems based on IoT use Cloud computing to process
    the sensed data while the micro-controllers were used in order to assure data
    transmission as shown (Fig. 5c). In [59], a microprocessor reads the values from
    sensors and posts the information to the cloud server, this last compare the sent
    value with a threshold values to command the motor via a relay. In [60], different
    sensors like humidity, temperature, light, etc, were used. This equipment gives
    signal to the microcontroller, while these last transmit the given data to the
    isolated server through a serial communication. According to the sensor values,
    a graph will be displayed on the PC side and Smartphone side, and by using this
    graph, users can turn on or off drip devices. While threshold values were kept
    for each sensor, the data is sent and processed on an isolated server, which stores
    the information from the sensors in a data-base, allowing further interpretation
    of data in a simple and flexible way. 2.4.2 Precise irrigation systems based on
    edge computing Precision farming is rapidly becoming a source of data production,
    where farmers must collect and evaluate a huge amount of information from a diverse
    number of devices such as soil sensors, in order to become more efficient in production
    and communication of appropriate information. The irrigation systems based on
    IoT and Edge computing (Fig. 5b) coordinate computational information, applications,
    and administrations from Cloud workers to the edge of the network, by offering
    the users services closer to them. These systems have several advantages such
    as, high transmission capacity, super low latency, and real-time access to the
    network data [61]. With the advent of open source systems, [62] aimed to use a
    controller and sensors to provide an automatic irrigation system that turns a
    motor pump by detecting the moisture content of the soil through the application
    of IoT. This system used a server to store the sensed values, which allowed the
    farmer to access the details about the condition of the field anywhere at any
    time. In [63], a smart Multi-Crop Irrigation System using IoT was developed by
    using a controller to decide whether the moisture value sensed by sensors is below
    or over a threshold value. The farmers can see the status of moisture content
    in a web page using a modem or in a mobile application. They can also check the
    sprinklers status and operate the water motors. However, 5G and edge computing
    will empower the quick exchange of information to the cloud, so that real-time
    examination and machine-to-machine correspondence can smooth out and computerize
    the cultivating cycle. With a 5G cell organization, only one cell tower can associate
    a monstrous number of sensors which it can go up to 1,000,000 in each square kilometer,
    with this advantage, farmers will be able to use more IoT sensors to monitor other
    tasks. In addition, the quality of anticipating and predicting different changes
    in the farms and the chance of having quicker and better choices gets better with
    increasing the number of used IoT sensors. These IoT sensors exploit 5G innovation’s
    low force transmission and dependability [64, 65]. 2.4.3 Precise irrigation system
    based on Fog computing Precise irrigation systems based on IoT, are recently widely
    used in order to preserve water especially when the world is facing water scarcity
    issues. And From day to day, the number of sensors and objects connected in this
    field has become more and more important, the thing that caused the computational
    leads problems, so the Fog computing paradigm could solve this problem with moving
    a piece of processing capacities both to the fog getaways and sensor nods. In
    [66], a precise irrigation system based on IoT, was developed to be used in urban
    regions where it’s difficult to admittance to the Internet or to the electrical
    matrix, and where remote interchanges are troublesome because of the presence
    of significant distances and various obstructions. So in order to assure a good
    area coverage with fast answers and low energy consummating system. The proposed
    architecture used a group of IoT nodes to gather the sensors sent data and transmit
    them to a local Fog computing node or to a remote cloud. This framework, decide
    a water system plan that considers factors, for example, the climate conjecture
    or humidity sensed in the field. As a result, precise irrigation systems based
    on IoT is an efficient smart irrigation system which contains different components
    such as sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and it processes a huge amount of
    information of which several functions are involved. Therefore, to optimize these
    systems, the classic optimization methods such as analytical or deterministic
    resolution cannot deal with this kind of problem. In revanche, heuristic and meta-heuristic
    methods have shown efficient and relevant solutions for these problems such as
    bioinspired algorithms based on an iterative procedure of a set of population-like
    evolutionary algorithms [67], Which have shown high performance in optimizing
    precise irrigation systems based on IoT and have had wide application in water-related
    problems [67]. In the next section, we will disscuss different works based on
    direct and indirect uses of EAs in PI systems based on IoT. 3 The use of EAs in
    precise irrigation by IoT 3.1 Evolutionary algorithms A learning algorithm is
    an algorithm that has the function to learn to perform a task from a dataset.
    This set contains a finite number of learning examples of the task to be learned.
    The development of the learning system involves the use of tools or techniques
    of learning found in the field of artificial intelligence. We can then establish
    a list of summary tools according to the following methods as evolutionary methods,
    neighborhood methods, hybrid methods [68]. The researchers have inspired biology
    to create bio-inspired evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that serve to evolve a set
    of solutions to a given problem to arrive at an optimal solution. They are called
    stochastic because they use random processes in their evolution; they are usually
    used to solve optimization problems, so that to find an optimal solution to the
    problem with a group of solutions. Their first appearance was since 1951 [69],
    where there was early work to use stochastic methods in optimization. In 1965,
    Rechenberg devised the first algorithm using evolutionary strategies [70], then,
    in 1975, Holland formed the original ideas of genetic algorithms [71]. since the
    work continues to evolve in this area as the appearance of evolutionary calculus
    (published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in 1993 that is used
    in several areas. EAs operate to find good solutions to very complex problems,
    or they must simply determine between two or more solutions which is the best,
    in order to operate their selections. They are used in areas where a large number
    of parameters are involved, and where good solutions are needed in various iterations.
    EAs evolve a set of solutions in the form of an initial population according to
    the objective functions, then according to the values obtained by the evaluation,
    the individuals are classified and only the best solutions are chosen to participate
    in the offspring of the next generation by applying the genetic operators such
    as crossing and mutation. Concerning the end conditions of the algorithm, it is
    either we set a from the start the number of generations to be reached, or we
    have an optimal solution that we seek to obtain. Once we reach it, the algorithm
    stops as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 General scheme of EAs Full size image Since their
    emergence, EAs have been used in different fields that require large scale calculations
    as in aerodynamic optimization [72], Automation and robotics [73], Engineering
    design [74], etc. So as in precision agriculture where different decisions have
    to be taken to better manage agricultural plots, we found in the literature that
    EAs have been used with different techniques PI in order to find an optimal solutions
    as illustrated for example in [75, 76]. In PI systems based on IoT, the nonlinearity
    and changing dynamics nature of physical parameters values as soil, plant and
    weather variables obliges the use of EAs in order to adjust irrigation controllers
    while guaranteeing ideal accuracy water system for improvement of water system
    innovation. For example, in [77] a genetic algorithm (GA) was successfully applied
    in setting controllers such as PID controller, the Kp, Ki, and Kd parameters are
    hard to adjust, but with use of a GA which provides faster response time, better
    stability, and robustness it was achievable. However in 2019, [78] an improved
    genetic algorithm (IGA) based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection
    algorithm for ELM classifier (IGA-ELM) was used to develop a decision support
    system, the IGA-ELM was integrated with an IoT-based DSS. The calculation intricacy
    of most development controllers can be sufficiently overseen using the EAs in
    the optimal regulation of controllers, which can improve the use of regulator
    for watering systems. EAs have been used directly in the determination of the
    topology of WSNs, because this last has several intricacies that influences the
    nodes deployment, such as the case of WSN lifespan, which is influenced by the
    node clustering model which is based on geospatial constraints like distance to
    the base station, the distance between the nodes, and the choice of the group
    leader that is made according to various factors such as the initial energy of
    the node, the data processing capacity and the ability to be a group leader. The
    latter has the responsibility to take the data from the sensor nodes and send
    them to the base station. in this case, EAs have the ability to choose the best
    topology to the network by taking into consideration the different constraints.
    The EAs can also be used in irrigation planning that is itself based on geospatial,
    economic and crop type constraints in order to find the best irrigation plan.
    In addition, the EAs were used indirectly to combine them with other automatic
    learning algorithms in order to improve their results such as with the decision
    trees algorithms and with the artificial neural network algorithm which are a
    regression and a classification algorithms, as in the case of irrigation problem
    (irrigate or not and how much irrigate). For more explications, Fig. 7 shows how
    we can apply directly and indirectly the EAs for precise irrigation system based
    on IoT. Fig. 7 Direct and indirect uses of EAs for precise irrigation systems
    Full size image By the following, we will describe different literature applications
    of the direct and the indirect use of EAs in the field of precise irrigation by
    IoT. 3.2 Direct use of EAs in precise irrigation by IoT 3.2.1 EAs for PI systems
    based on IoT scheduling The allocation of water needs to be optimized over time,
    to meet the different environmental requirements such as climate change, high
    cost of water supply for the fields, stochastic nature of the water resources,
    complexity of natural and artificial hydraulic systems, etc. Mathematical models
    and new irrigation management methodologies are needed for optimal planning of
    irrigated areas, so in order to solve these multi-constraint problems, EAs have
    presented very good performances in multiple works in literature, which we will
    present some of them in the following. In [79], GAs were used for irrigation planning
    integrating reservoir operation and canal planning whose goal was to maximize
    the advantages of the connections to ensure the water needs, the capacity of the
    channel, and the tank storage restrictions. In Australia, the use of water resources
    must be limited in order to cultivate a variety of crops while respecting environmental
    needs which has been a problem for researchers. In [80], Montgomery and al demonstrated
    that differential evolution variant is able to find new solutions to a multi-objective
    problem of crop planning and water management, in a relatively small number of
    population assessment solutions, the two alternative solutions representations
    allow the algorithm to produce different sets of solutions,which demonstrate the
    limitation of search space for solutions that plant the entire area which allows
    very protable activities and that certain spaces must be left fallow if environmental
    objectives have to be approached while maximizing the profit. In [81], a study
    was established to examine the influence of the entropy and resilience indices
    in the indirect measurement of water reliability, which is explained by the ability
    to meet users demand of water in a specific period at a water distribution network
    design (WDN). Therefore, a variant of the multiobjective genetic optimization
    algorithm called the Non Sorting Generated Algorithm of the second generation
    (NSGA II) has been applied to minimize network total cost and maximize the reliability
    indirect index at the same time. However, Sirsant et al. [82], have used NSGA
    II algorithm in order to show the influence of conventional hydraulic and mechanical
    reliability metrics on water reliability in WDN. The NSGA II in this case was
    applied to maximize the proxy measures by taking them one at a time such as resiliency,
    entropy, network resilience and at the same time minimize the cost of the design.
    Moreover, in [83], another approach including morphometric perspectives obtained
    from geospatial innovation is utilized to upgrade watershed prioritization. For
    that purpose, the differential evolution algorithm combined with classical dynamic
    programming was applied for obtaining the ideal delivery strategy to take care
    of the reservoir optimization issue. Also in [84], to decide the measure of water
    to be delivered from a repository, it is important to know accurate and solid
    estimating of supply inflows. So, a GA was used to determine the ideal repository
    discharges for the water system and the region of irrigation. Furthermore, economic
    and environmental constraints are not taken into account when planning short-term
    irrigation. Therefore, the study presented in [85], proposed an IoT-based irrigation
    and fertilization system which aims to plane long and short terms irrigation plannings.
    A model is created for apportioning restricted assets among different yields with
    the objective of augmenting the monetary benefits and ecological advantages and
    a GA was used to optimize this model (Table 1). Table 1 Application of EAs for
    precise irrigation scheduling Full size table 3.2.2 EAs for network optimization
    Fig. 8 EAs application for network optimization Full size image It is necessary
    to guarantee the transmission of data from one node to another in the WSN (Quality
    Of Service). Therefore, different constraints must be taken into account in order
    to optimize the WSN (Fig. 8) such as lifetime, coverage, connectivity, cost, etc.
    However, environmental assessments have been applied in the literature in order
    to optimize the WSN deployment. The consideration of these assessments have shown
    impeccable results, which will be discussed below. In [86], a multi-objective
    genetic algorithm (MOGA) was used to increment the lifetime of the network. This
    algorithm was used to ensure the routing of data and the reliability of the end-to-end
    service, by choosing a group leader which has the highest energy rate in order
    to relaying and routing the data to the receiver. The choice of the topology of
    the sensor network depends on several parameters such as the initial energy of
    the nodes, the data processing capacity, etc. An optimal network structure increases
    its lifespan. For this reason, several sensor clustering strategies have been
    proposed. In [87], a method was proposed for dynamically grouping sensors in a
    heterogeneous WSN using GAs, which provides a framework for integrating different
    aggregation and heterogeneity factors. This method uses the remaining energies,
    planned energy expenditures, the locality of the network, and the distance to
    the base station in order to structure the network. In the same year, [88] used
    a centralized GA to define a clustering approach that limits the energy consumption
    of nodes in order to optimize the locations and the number of Cluster Head (CH).
    Once a CH is selected at the end of the turn, it is with less energy. In this
    case, another node that has the highest energy level is selected as a CH to perform
    the same job as the previous CH. In [89], a hierarchical clustering model using
    a GA was proposed to efficiently use energy without unnecessary waste in WSNs,
    with the focus on balancing the load obtained to form the groups through a fitness
    function. The evaluation function serves to increase both the lifetime and the
    stability period of the network, of which different metrics have been used in
    the observation of lifetime of the network that depends on the first node (FND)
    and, the half node (HND), then the last node die (LND). The location of the sensors
    at the monitored surface must ensure the optimal coverage of this surface. For
    this reason, [90] presented a diagram concerning the coverage of the sensor network
    to ensure the network reliability to maintain the surface monitoring. The improvement
    of this reliability is done by disjunction of the entire coverage and by optimizing
    the object of the variance. In this scheme, the nodes live or work was kept in
    active mode and the remaining nodes were in sleep mode to save power. Ghosh et
    al. [91] presented an optimal optimization scheme based on GAs for the location
    of the base stations for maximum coverage in the network. The scenario was applied
    in an ad-hoc deployment of sensor nodes, who have the ability to send data to
    the nearest base station or the base station has been assumed to represent the
    region of indifference (ROI). ROI is the region of intersection between transmission
    ranges represented by base stations. To maximize the lifespan of a WSN, another
    method can be applied which is the use of a multiple base stations to facilitate
    data acquisition and minimize the distance between the nodes and the stations
    to conserve energy. Jian et al. [92] suggested a random deployment model of multiple
    base stations and densely deployed sensor nodes, and assumed that the sensor nodes
    are stationary. The sensor nodes are connected to the base stations by a single
    hop. The connectivity of the nodes with the base stations is determined by the
    energy of the nodes and their transmission capacity. The distance between a node
    and the base stations is defined by the euclidean distance formula: $$\\begin{aligned}
    Dij=\\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2} \\end{aligned}$$ (1) Table 2 shows the different
    aims of using EAs in network optimization according to their fitness function.
    Table 2 EAs direct use for network optimization in WSNs Full size table 3.3 Indirect
    use of EAs in precise irrigation by IoT A presented study in [93], have shown
    that learning algorithms especially decision trees (DT), Systematically Developed
    Forest (SysFor) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) algorithms are the most
    suitable for predicting irrigation water demand than other machine learning techniques.
    But only DT and ANNs were hybridized with EAs in the previous studies. That’s
    why in the following, part we will be interested in studying only these two techniques.
    3.3.1 Optimization of decision trees for irrigation control A decision tree (DT)
    is a classifier that is depicted in an organizational chart tree structure, which
    has been widely used to represent classification or regression models due to its
    comprehensible nature that resembles the human reasoning. Most DT induction algorithms
    are based on a greedy top-down recursive partitioning strategy for tree growth.
    However, a new approach has been increasingly used recently is the induction of
    DTs through EAs. Instead of local search, EAs perform a robust global search in
    the space of candidate solutions. As a result, EAs tend to cope better with attribute
    interactions than greedy methods [94]. In [95], research has been established
    to find a model that captures the unstructured decision-making process of the
    agronomist in order to find the predicted irrigation recommendations. This goal
    was achieved by applying automatic decision tree learning to an integrated dataset,
    including sensor-based moisture data, meteorological data and irrigation plans
    defined by the agronomist in the past in order to learn its decision-making process
    of irrigation. Different regression and classification algorithms were applied
    on this dataset to develop models that were able to predict the weekly irrigation
    plan as recommended by the agronomist. The models were developed using eight different
    subsets of variables to determine which variables consistently contributed to
    prediction accuracy. By comparing the resulting models, it was shown that the
    best regression model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees with 93% accuracy,
    and the best classification model was the Boosted Tree Classifier with 95% accuracy.
    3.3.2 Optimization of neural networks for irrigation control The interest of the
    hybridization of ANN and EA is based on the observation that a local search by
    a gradient descent method is replaced by a global search carried out by an EA.
    Gradient descent methods which determine a set of parameters that minimize the
    difference between expected value and the model output are subject to variations
    in performance due to the initial position of the ANN sometimes leading to convergence
    to local minima. In addithion, evolutionary methods provide research in the complete
    domain. It is forthmenioning here that as the number of generations grows, the
    research space is becoming more refined into potentially performing subspaces.
    However, it is common for an EA to find a solution close to the best without ever
    reaching it. The optimal number of sensors, and the best node locations for automatic
    valves control in a regional irrigation system, can be determined using heuristic
    algorithms. Studies in which decision makers and heuristic algorithms are used
    typically focus on soil moisture estimation and / or evaporation of irrigation
    planning [96, 97]. In the field of agricultural and biological engineering, researchers
    and engineers have developed fuzzy logic methods, ANNs, GAs, DT and support vector
    machines for study soil and water regimes related to crop growth, analyze the
    functioning of food processing, and support decision-making in precision agriculture
    [98, 99]. These studies assume that farmers water the land evenly and that the
    water requirements of each plant are uniform. However, the calculated water requirements
    for irrigation planning do not always correspond to cons-umption (ie consumer
    demand) due to changing field environments, such as weather and crop behavior,
    which may influence the actual amount of water used [100, 101]. In [102], a study
    developed a regional irrigation system based on a sensors system in which sensor
    data is evaluated in real time and irrigation is controlled accordingly. The number
    and appropriate location of sensors to be placed on a plot planted with dwarf
    cherry trees was determined using an ANN hybridized with a GA. The ANN was used
    for moisture distribution and the GA was used to determine the location of the
    sensors. ANNs and GAs have the most applications in agricultural and biological
    engineering compared to other learning machine algorithms [103, 104]. However,
    DT induction algorithms present several advantages over other learning algorithms,
    such as robustness to noise, low computational cost for the generation of the
    model, and ability to deal with redundant attributes. Besides, the induced model
    usually presents a good generalization ability [105]. In [93], a study has been
    presented in order to compare the effectiveness of different data mining methods
    and the traditional Evapotranspiration (ETc) methods. Evaluating the performance
    of these models to predict irrigation water demand using a preprocessed dataset
    took place here. The results showed that the model predicted of decision trees
    was better than the one predicted by ANNs. Table 3, shows a comparison between
    the functioning principles of DTs and ANNs for irrigation prediction. Table 3
    Indirect use of EAs for network optimization in WSNs Full size table 4 Hardware
    implementations for EAs EAs have improved their efficiency in optimization of
    precise irrigation systems based on IoT, in different ways. However, the nature
    of these systems which contain several equipment and deal with huge amounts of
    data, considered as NP-hard for CPU resource consumption and/or memory, which
    forces the execution time to become more and more important and may have a bad
    influence on the solutions qualities [106]. In addition, EAs have an architecture
    which allows several data and instructions to be calculated and processed simultaneously
    in each step of the algorithm. It is remarkable that the parallelism in EAs is
    very clear in many stages, especially in the evaluation stage which is the most
    consumer stage in an EA, where the evaluation of all individuals can be done at
    the same time as these solutions are independent of each other. Furthermore, we
    can’t apply the parallelism on only one stage of EAs, which is the replacement
    stage, where parents can’t appear several times in generations, in order to keep
    diversity in the population to avoid reducing the algorithm’s power of exploration
    [107]. So in order to benefit from this feature of EAs parallelism, the researchers
    were inspired to use hardware platforms as the ones of distributed computing,
    to optimize the execution time of the EAs. In the following, we will present under
    a table (Table 4), 71 works of computing time optimization of EAs and the types
    of used hardware platforms. We found that from 71 study, only 1.40% used Multi-Processor
    System-on-Chip, 8,45% used Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and with same
    percentage of 8,45% they used Cloud computing environments, 12,67% used Grid platforms,
    28,16% used Multicore Manycore systems and Graphics Processing Unit) GPU, and
    the clusters computers and Massively Parallel Processor were the most used platforms
    with percentage of 42,25%. As showed the Fig. 9. Fig. 9 Number of hardware platforms
    used for optimizing EA computing time Full size image Table 4 Hardware platforms
    used for optimizing EAs computing time Full size table Using the same works (71),
    we will present in a table (Table 5) the evolution of works related to the hardware
    platforms used to optimize the computing time of EAs per a year during the period
    (2000–2018), which we will describe in a graphic (Fig. 10). We will also present
    the type of the hardware platforms used in each year, and the distribution of
    works using the same hardware platforms during the period 2000–2018. Table 5 Number
    and type of hardware platforms used for optimizing EAs computing time per a year,
    between 2000 and 2018 Full size table Fig. 10 Evolution of works for optimizing
    EAs computing time, between 2000 and 2018 Full size image 5 Conclusion As the
    world is undergoing water scarcity, the precise irrigation systems have to be
    optimized the most possible. As in the case of irrigation systems based on IoT,
    which are part of the closed loop irrigation systems of which they use components
    connected via the internet to have feedback on the plots characteristic. So, the
    EAs were used to optimize these systems functioning based on multi-objective constraints.
    These lasts were applied directly to optimize the WSN network and the scheduling
    of irrigation, and indirectly to optimize the functioning of other ML algorithms
    used in the PI systems. However, in the case of PI, the use of EAs in combination
    with IoT requires strong computational and communication skills. The new communication
    techniques as 5g technology for example, will allow the number of connected components
    used in the processed plot to be expanded, and also will facilitate the real-time
    processing of data on the cloud. Another method that facilitates calculations,
    is the use of specific hardware computation platforms, given that the nature of
    EAs allows a parallel calculations in several stages, as in the stage of evaluation,
    in the random creation of the initial population, in the crossing and even in
    the mutation stage. Finally, we like to attract the attention of researchers in
    the field of EAs combined with IoT for PI systems to the various advantages of
    the 5g technology that can be brought to these systems, as well as the use of
    a specific hardware computation platforms that can reduce the systems cost, execution
    time and also the quality of solutions. References Burles D (1995) Dimensions

    Agent Based Modelling 1. Introduction The exponential increase in the human population
    has had a direct impact on food, resulting in increased demand for agricultural
    resources. It has been estimated that by 2050, the world’s population can hit
    around 9.7 billion [1]. However, due to food scarcity, more than 10 million people
    will die from hunger every year [2]. Therefore, to handle this crisis situation,
    improving the crop production from already available land is necessary to fulfill
    the growing need [1]. Technological advancements in IoT have already helped farmers
    to manage their crop production effectively [1]. Many farmers have adopted the
    IoT-based network for crop management [3]. In the existing system, wireless sensors
    are used to gather real-time crop data; however, due to limited capacity and energy
    constraints, the system faces several limitations. Further, recharging sensors
    or changing the batteries of the devices deployed in vast and humid fields is
    an unfeasible solution. Moreover, it also requires technical expertise to operate.
    Therefore, there is a need for the efficient utilization of battery-operated sensors/devices
    for the sustainable network. The energy consumption of a sensor is directly proportional
    to its active mode, data processing, transmission, and reception [4]. Notably,
    the sensors are also used for ad-hoc communication, and act as a relay node which
    also impacts their energy [3]. The efficient utilization of sensors for large-scale
    farming has not been explored in detail. The work mostly focuses on sensor deployment
    without considering the data transmission strategy; this makes it unsuitable for
    large-scale farming because of cost and administrative reasons. In large-scale
    farming, the covering of the entire area with a large number of interconnected
    devices is required [5]. Thus, deploying sensors with efficient communication
    enhances network lifetime. Recent developments in wireless sensor networks and
    their applications have created a big demand for bandwidth and power resources
    [6]. In order to collect a large amount of data from the fields, the deployment
    of a large number of sensor nodes spanning a large area is required. However,
    deploying a massive number of sensors communicating over an ad-hoc wireless sensor
    network triggers channel access, organization, and interference problems [6].
    Moreover, in precision agriculture, increasing agricultural productivity techniques
    is proposed to improve the precision farming field, due to which additional delays
    occur in providing farmers with the correct information. Additional energy consumption
    is created as well [7]. From one point of view, wireless sensor networks are a
    technological advancement, but on the other hand, the acceptance rate of wireless
    sensor technologies is strongly affected by the perceptions of farmers who are
    the significant adopters of the latest technologies in the wireless network domain.
    Yet, the way WSN technology is perceived has been poorly studied [8]. The authors
    argue on the reasons for which presently, WSNs are not integrated in precision
    agriculture on a larger scale [9]. In the existing work, smart farming has been
    considered either on small-scale fields where sensors are deployed in a single
    farm [10]. Considering a single farm reduces the data dissemination issues that
    require additional energy for relay purposes. Thus, applying the same approach
    to large-scale connected farms raises serious energy issues. Moreover, the other
    contribution on a large-scale focused on data gathering to perform analytics or
    predictions without considering the underlying network [11]. Thus, for every IoT-based
    system deployment, a comprehensive networking model is required to support the
    best possible deployment scenario for large-scale farming. There are numerous
    ways for data to be transmitted in a wireless network; however, machine learning/AI-based
    algorithms complement the system by predicting and adopting the best possible
    method based on the available resources. The IoT-based network is data-driven,
    and more context and situation-aware [3]. The sensor data helps in crop monitoring
    and is also used for dynamic network management. The paper is concerned with improving
    wireless sensor communication in large farms that have utilized IoT technology
    to monitor the crop conditions. This is performed with the help of machine learning
    algorithms, more specifically reinforcement learning, applied on a large network
    of sensors, with the purpose being to improve communication with the control station.
    The proposed solution manages to find successful path to the base station with
    a lesser delay than the shortest path transmission model. We propose finding the
    optimal set of paths using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The aim is to achieve
    sustainability for the farming network. The main features of the proposed system
    are listed below: The model provides network connectivity for static sensor nodes
    deployed in large-scale fields. Multi-hop communication is provided by sending
    data towards edge nodes (deployed on the edge of each field), which forward data
    to the base station. We add a reinforcement learning [12] algorithm at the edge
    node that finds a set of suitable paths with the geographic reference to each
    node. These paths are used to transmit data. This paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 covers the existing smart farming methods. Section 3 covers the system
    model and proposed technique. The experimental details and evaluation are covered
    in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 have conclusions and the future prospects for
    the work conducted, respectively. 2. Related Work Some of the literature reviewed
    focus on low-power wireless sensor networks, due to the fact that data transmission
    is often energy-consuming, and sensors rely on batteries or researchable power
    which is limited. This is performed by using specific node-based transmission
    or sampling rates, with different algorithmic approaches. Other studies focus
    on network configuration or lifetime optimization to avoid network congestion.
    Srbinovska et al. [13] proposed a wireless sensor network, which is deployed to
    capture the information about environmental parameters that affect the crops.
    The objective was to develop a low-power wireless sensor network that can live
    a longer life to collect information about the crops. They investigated the wireless
    sensor network and power consumption of nodes in detail to achieve longer network
    life and lower power consumption among the nodes that reside in the network. Their
    aim was to develop a low-cost non-robust wireless sensor network that can be used
    for data collection of crops in greenhouses. They collected data from their deployed
    network, conducted a theoretical analysis of the power consumption from their
    network, and it compared with quantitative analysis from their deployed wireless
    sensor networks. According to Srbinovska et al., the sensors should keep it in
    sleeping mode as long as some external event triggers them to keep it in the processing
    mode where the sensors are about to sense, collect, and compute the data from
    the environment they are deployed in. The power consumption results from their
    deployed network were similar to the estimated theoretical analysis that they
    made. Jain et al. [14] proposed an energy-efficient data collection from the wireless
    sensor network that involves a gateway in an agricultural environment. The sensor
    network optimizes itself to collect data from the nodes, and in this way is energy
    efficient. The gateway of the wireless sensor network adapts itself for the parameters
    that need to be sensed, and the data is collected by the sensor nodes. The adaptive
    learning of the gateway depends on the spatial and temporal crop characteristics
    that may change during the complete season. The gateway was introduced with supervised
    learning principles that were meant to set specific parameters for the sensor
    nodes. According to Jain et al. energy efficiency can be improved by specifically
    setting the sensing parameters at the gateway beforehand, and having them communicate
    with the sensor nodes so that they can sense and collect data about the very specific
    parameters needed. They analyzed the model and compared it with non-adaptive models
    as well. In non-adaptive models, the data transmission occurred at a continuous
    rate. The adaptive model had successfully shown the classification of data points
    for diseased and non-diseased crops whose parameters were set by supervised learning
    at the gateway. With different variations in the data set, the model was able
    to dynamically set the parameters for the crop. Results showed that the proposed
    adaptive sampling model based on random forest can significantly reduce energy
    consumption by varying the sampling rate of the sensor nodes. The adaptive model
    which was set on the basis of the random forest algorithm gave 22 percent to 30
    percent energy efficiency for the sampling rates kept more frequent than other
    techniques. Future work includes deployment of the adaptive model. Sathiya et
    al. [10] designed a wireless sensor network with nodes and a base station using
    zigbee. The wireless sensor network had seven nodes comprised of six sensor nodes
    and one coordinator. The wireless sensor network was aimed at small-scale fields
    to sense and collect data about the crop. They successfully implemented the model
    collector results from the model. As their future work suggests, the nodes should
    be placed properly to achieve efficiency. Power consumption is also suggested
    as an extended work. Zhang et al. [11] developed a wireless underground sensor
    network. They had a fully operational network and were able to collect data on
    the website server. The network had a back-end system, a base station, and a set
    of sensor nodes. Each sensor node had two sensor components which were meant for
    collecting data for four crop properties: temperature, soil moisture, volumetric
    water content, and electric conductivity. As a result, they collected a great
    deal of information, and analyzed it at the back end. The network was meant for
    small-scale fields, and in future work, they left it for larger-scale work and
    networking; energy efficiency parameters were also to be considered. Similarly,
    most of the previously-preformed experiments and simulations were conducted either
    on a small scale or, if undertaken on a large scale, there was no network optimization
    for network performance. The summary of related work is given in the Table 1,
    where the comparison is conducted based on the required parameters of network
    performance optimization. This study aims to propose a sustainable wireless sensor
    network from all perspectives (energy, communication, configuration), by training
    agents through reinforcement learning to find an optimal path based on specific
    rewards (such as the shortest path from sensor node to edge node), taking in consideration
    the energy spent when transmitting data (also ‘rewarding’ agents with units).
    Reinforcement learning is an unsupervised type of machine learning [15] where
    the agents learn by trial and error. Generally, machine learning algorithms work
    well in congested networks by locating high-quality links [16]. Mainly reinforcement
    learning has been applied to make big data analysis from the crop data. Algorithms
    have also been applied to sensors to gather data to make optimal resource usage.
    Reinforcement learning has also proven successful in sampling data for crop fields
    from fully autonomous aerial scouting methods [17]. Reinforcement learning has
    been applied to agricultural wireless sensor networks for various reasons. Routing
    is one of the biggest problems, and a solution is given using a reinforcement
    learning meta-routing strategy [18]. Similarly, reinforcement learning has been
    applied to make smart decisions for irrigation [2], and also to determine crop
    production for a season. Table 1. Summary of work related to wireless sensor network
    incorporated in smart agriculture.      There are several challenges that occur
    in wireless sensor networks; for example, complex routing algorithms share information
    with the neighboring nodes, which is a cause of congestion. Therefore, in order
    to increase the network’s lifetime, traffic must be decreased [16]. In a large
    area, coverage is the main issue that occurs for wireless sensor networks [29].
    The communication range also needs to be prolonged by adopting multi-tier ad-hoc
    techniques [30]. Similarly, fault tolerance is also needed in far-away deployment
    areas because several network failures occur due to physical damage, radio interference,
    blockage, and collision. The performance of a wireless sensor network also depends
    on the sensor’s size and placement. Random deployment should be used in large-scale
    areas, while the deterministic placement approach is better for small-scale deployment
    fields. [31] 3. Proposed System An agent is composed of properties and characteristics
    based on which they interact with the environment; the characteristics are individual
    and independent based on the information from its surroundings. Agent-based modeling
    (ABM) is a holistic approach to view an environment with the combination of agents
    with a set of interaction rules. Agents have five characteristics: perception
    of the environment including other agents, communication and interaction with
    the environment and other agents, memory of previous actions, knowledge of a policy
    comprising a set of rules, and heuristics or strategies. Computer-assisted decision
    support systems are an emerging area to increase agricultural production with
    efficient resource usage [3]. Traditionally, such farm management systems are
    knowledge-based, using rules and guidelines to achieve goals and to define constraints
    for a particular farm or producer [32]. The proposed solution is implemented using
    an agent-based model in an AnyLogic environment. The IoT sensor nodes are deployed
    in multiple farms (roughly 370 × 330 m). The sensor nodes are static, they can
    be deployed at multiple locations. Sensor nodes have varying energies, and other
    than sensing the nodes, also act as a relay node to forward data towards the base
    station. The base node is deployed at the edge of the farm which is depicted below
    in the block diagram (Figure 1). The base node gathers all the data and provides
    a platform for prediction or analysis. The network connections between farms and
    base stations are through deployed sensor nodes. The deployed sensor node sends
    the data to the base station through the optimal path selected based on the residual
    energy. The residual energy is calculated for each node, and path decision is
    made on the basis of that residual energy. The main aim is to provide sustainability
    for data dissemination in a large-scale farm. Figure 1. Large-scale farming scenario,
    base node is deployed at the west region. 3.1. Basic Elements In the proposed
    work, we have used the reinforcement learning algorithm (Algorithm 1, defined
    below) to establish multiple data dissemination paths based on the residual energy
    of the deployed IoT sensor nodes. The residual energy information is used to select
    the path that shows more stability for data transmission from the sensory data
    towards the base station. The details of the main agents/components used in the
    proposed work are listed below; main agent is the entire simulation environment
    that includes all simulation operations. It is like the main class of any program
    that holds all core functionalities of the program. This agent has all the basic
    functions of simulation, and all other agents are either defined in this class
    or initialized in this class. We initialized farms, parameters and basic machine
    learning state charts as well as code in the main agent. The message agent is
    designed to hold the messages that contain the sensor id, sensor time, and energy
    consumption, as well as the field parameters such as pH and temperature. The type
    of data a message contains is a floating point of number values. This agent is
    meant to take information from the sensors and direct it towards the base station
    by travelling hop by hop through the network. In order to perform the experiments
    in real life for future reference, the partition is a 370 × 330 m field/farm agent
    that is created for equal-sized fields which contain the sensor agent. Figure
    1 represents the block layout of the model. This agent represents the field properties
    that held sensors deployed in it, including the edge node placed at one of its
    corners. Refer to Figure 1 for edge node where the number represents the farm
    number having sensors deployed. The sensor is defined to simulate the behavior
    of sensor nodes. It resides inside the partitioning agent. The sensor agent resembles
    a real-life sensor because it has sensor cycles e.g., sleep, read, transmit, and
    dead states, including a battery that is consumed while performing its cyclic
    functions. The Algorithm 1 explains the algorithm used in the model while sensor
    cycles are explained in Algorithm 2 below. The sensors have contained a population
    of equal battery size and have their own specific Id. All sensors are initialized
    with same sensing capabilities and parameters such as pH and Temperature. The
    sensors are randomly placed within the connection range of each other. Since they
    are wireless, the connection range is up to 100 feet. A pathfinder agent is responsible
    for path finding using a reinforcement learning algorithm. This agent checks the
    presence and availability of sensors, and connects them with the target node for
    successful attempts. This agent moves from sensor to sensor in search of path
    that can be connected with the edge node. If there is a success, the reinforcement
    algorithm gives an award and saves the path. In case of failure, punishment is
    given. Mathematical details are shared in Section 3.1. A base station agent is
    defined to gather all the messages for prediction or analysis purposes. There
    is only one base station defined for the entire large-scale farming system. This
    agent has a database that stores all sensing data coming from the fields and exports
    it as an excel sheet to further analysis. 3.2. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
    There are four main concepts in reinforcement learning, namely the state (s),
    action (a), reward (R), and discount factor (γ). In Algorithm 1, the current situation
    of an agent is called the state (s). In our model the state (s) is the position
    of deployed nodes and pathfinding. Whatever an agent does is taken as an action
    (a). There are defined sets of actions that an agent can take. In any given state
    (s), the pathfinder can try to connect to the nodes lying in its proximity and
    try to find a path connected with the edge node. Upon taking any action (a) the
    agent receives an award (R), either positive or negative. For example, in our
    model, the pathfinder tries to find a path between edge node and deployed nodes.
    If there is a connected path found between several nodes, then the pathfinder
    is given green bars connecting those nodes as success. If there is no path or
    longer routes available among the nodes and the edge node, then that path receives
    red bars as a penalty. After several iterations there is a mesh of an optimal
    set of green paths and also a set of red paths. The discount factor (γ) tells
    us how much a feedback is given back to the subsequent movements of the learning.
    Because we will also be using the previously developed paths, we have set the
    discount factor up to a 0.8 value. The developed paths are saved in the Q table
    maintained by every node; therefore, later lookup can be performed. The Q table
    helps to find desired future rewards against every action an agent performs. The
    reward helps in choosing the best available option. The Q table learns values
    through iterative processes by using a Q-learning algorithm, which uses Bellman’s
    equation: V (s) = maxa(R(s, a) +γ V (s′)) (1) Algorithm 1 Reinforcement Learning
    Algorithm 1: procedure REINFORCEMENT –LEARNING 2: while (reward = 0): 3:  a =
    chooseActionByEpsilon(s) 4:  track.add(<s,a>) 5:  s = s.takeAction(a) 6:  s =
    environment.act(s) 7:  reward = getReward(s) 8: EndWhile 9:/* update Qs with track
    and reward */ 10: index = track.length 11: end procedure After gradual iterations
    and rewards are achieved, the Q value is updated and the agent uses more of the
    developed policy for optimizing its policy in less time. For example, the value
    of any given state equals max action i.e., V (s) = maxa (2) The action with maximizing
    value will be taken. The reward of optimal action a in any state s is taken and
    added with a multiplier of γ which is a discount factor that reduces the reward
    by time. Each time an agent takes an action, it gets the next state to proceed
    i.e., s′ As it is a recursive model, it takes s’ and puts it into V(s). This is
    how the number of passes is counted and the Q table is updated each time an agent
    takes an action. The actions with maximum reward towards the target node are stored
    as the paths towards the destination (from each sensor individually). Hence, a
    mesh of optimal paths is developed as a result of our reinforcement algorithm
    training process. The training is conducted individually for each field. As soon
    as the pathfinding process is complete, we use these paths to send data from each
    sensor from the field to the base station. Algorithm 2 Sensor Duty Cycle Algorithm

    end for 9: end procedure 3.3. Dynamics Algorithm 2 shows the sensor cycle adopted
    for the smart farming framework. The sensors have multiple stages such as read,
    sleep, and transmit. The sensor has a predefined energy model which is consumed
    during active mode. The transition between states is defined to gather the data
    at discrete points. Battery dynamics: In AnyLogic, every single entity is taken
    as an agent, and for battery life there are agents or units; we set 1000 battery
    units for each sensor. The sensors were set to use 4 units for reinforcement algorithm
    execution. Sensors used 3 units for send state, 2 units for read state and 0.5
    units for sleep state. The threshold level was set to 10 units and the sensor
    node was considered dead at less than 4 units left in the battery. The typical
    formula used for energy consumption is [33,34]: x − (suse + stransmission) (3)
    where: x = battery units, suse = energy consumed for sensor cycles (send + read
    + sleep), stransmission = energy consumption during path finding and transmission
    of the data. 4. Evaluation In this section, we describe the experimental setup
    and evaluation of the proposed framework. The proposed framework is implemented
    using AnyLogic. Table 2 lists the simulation parameters along with the input variables
    and system specifications used for the evaluation. The performance is evaluated
    in terms of delay, sensor battery, and amount of data transferred, by comparison
    with the traditional approaches (which are based on broadcast strategy—consuming
    high energy—and the shortest path first model). The experimental setup contains
    6 fields with a range of 22 to 72 sensors each, randomly places, and located to
    the west of the base station. The benchmarking process is performed by increasing
    the sensor nodes to observe their impact on the proposed framework. In the proposed
    work, the farm’s layout is shown in Figure 2, and the base station is placed at
    one end. The main objective is to disseminate the data to the base stations for
    more informed decision-making on the received data. The sensors have a limited
    battery; therefore, the communication or data relay reduces their life. Thus,
    the broadcast is not a viable approach in this scenario, as it can rapidly deplete
    the energy. The comparison is performed alongside the traditional approach which
    is based on broadcast strategy, the shortest-path first model, and the reinforcement
    learning-based work. In the evaluation, the same configuration setting is used
    for all three approaches. Figure 2. Geographic layout of the farm fields marked
    with numbers. The base station is located at the west side, and collects all the
    data for the decision. Table 2. Simulation configuration and specification. The
    entire data flow from farms to base stations is relayed on the ground sensors;
    therefore, the system is evaluated with a various number of sensors. Thus, six
    sets have been created with a different number of sensors. In the first set, 22
    sensors have been deployed on each farm. In every set, 10 additional sensors have
    been added, this is performed to find the acceptable network life for the data
    transfer in farming. Thus, set 6 contains a total of 72 sensors. For every set,
    a random deployment model is used. 4.1. Transmission Delay The transmission delay
    is a crucial parameter used to gauge system performance. Figure 3 shows the transmission
    delay in different sets of sensors. The machine learning approach proposed in
    the paper shows a smaller transmission delay in all fields, lower energy consumption
    than broadcast, but worse for all except field 6 which has the most sensors (72).
    The machine learning approach also has the best message delivery rate. These experiments
    and results are indeed very relevant to the field. The communication path relies
    on the deployed sensors having limited energy. The transmission delay is computed
    for all the experiments performed with S1 to S6. Thus, the average value of the
    entire simulation run is reported here. In all these experiments, the proposed
    techniques have shown considerable improvement compared to the broadcast and shorted
    paths. Figure 3 below for visual representation for average transmission delay
    per message for different sensor sets. Figure 3. Average transmission delay per
    message for different sensor sets. 4.2. Energy Consumption The energy consumption
    is an indicator to measure the lifespan of a network. It is directly related to
    the involvement of intermediate sensors; the frequent message exchange can deplete
    the energy and result in disjoint networks. Figure 4 for visual representation
    for average energy consumption for different sensor sets and while Figure 5 shows
    the energy consumption for all three techniques compared on S1 to S6. Figure 4.
    Average energy consumption for different sensor sets. Figure 5. Average residual
    energy after sending messages for different sensor sets. Thus, an increasing number
    of sensors provide an alternative route for data transfer that results in reduced
    energy consumption. The shortest path approach utilizes the same path, and thus
    saves energy by avoiding frequent path searching. On the other hand, in broadcast,
    all sensors are involved, thus having maximum energy consumption. The proposed
    work relies on the reinforcement model which selects the path based on the given
    features; therefore, it lies between the two extremes. 4.3. Average Residual Energy
    The plot below shows the residual energy for different sensor sets after they
    sent a specific number of messages. This calculation was performed on a battery
    having 1000 units; for each field average, residual energy was taken. It can be
    seen that no matter how much we increase the field scale and number of sensors,
    there is not much energy conservation seen in broadcast and shortest path transmission
    techniques. However, in our proposed transmission technique, it conserves energy
    as we increase the number of sensors over a large scale. This trend, however,
    was seen only after sensor set 5 and sensor set 6. 4.4. Packets Delivered This
    parameter is used to see the network reliability. Figure 6 shows the comparison
    of all three techniques in terms of delivery rate. The proposed work shows a better
    delivery rate among other approaches due to the optimal path selection based on
    the residual energy. Further, it constructs many different paths to the base stations,
    and switches to them based on the optimal use of these resources. However, the
    other two approaches show a lesser delivery rate compared to the base station.
    Figure 6 shows packet delivery rate for S1 to S6 deployment. Figure 6. Packet
    delivery rate for S1 to S6 deployment. 5. Conclusions Our main goal pursued in
    this research work was to develop an efficient transmission system in terms of
    energy and time. Efficient energy consumption is an emerging area of research.
    In previous work, researchers have mostly focused on sensor technology rather
    than the scaling and performance of the sensors when deployed on a large scale.
    Some of the work was conducted to test performance, but on small-scale networks
    including less than 20 sensors in the network, our work mostly focuses on transmission
    delays and energy-hole problems. The performance results of the machine learning-based
    method on a large scale are better than the traditional broadcasting and shortest-path
    message-sending techniques. The proposed system shows the energy-efficient transmission
    of sensory data in large-scale farming by using paths created through reinforcement
    learning. The proposed model is based on reinforcement learning that uses random
    deployment topology for sensors as an input parameter, and creates several optimal
    paths for data transmission, fundamentally intended to reduce the energy consumption
    in a wireless sensor network meant for precision agriculture on a large scale.
    The objectives of the proposed transmission model are energy consumption minimization,
    reduction in average transmission delay, and ultimately to reduce the management
    process for large-scale wireless sensor networks, especially by increasing the
    network lifetime. Some of the gaps in this research are pointed out as future
    work, and include the fact that to implementing this system in large-scale farming
    networks accompanied by artificial intelligence would be helpful in increasing
    efficiency. Implementing and experimenting with more topologies to test energy
    efficiency is also necessary. The proposed model also has room for optimization
    in terms of how data is being processed, including the sensor cycles. Moreover,
    it might be possible to make this model adaptive in precision agriculture after
    added work is conducted. The model can also be extended with minor modifications
    to ad-hoc networks and vehicular networks. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Chapter © 2018 1 Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely regarded
    as one of the most promising emergent technologies of the twenty-first century,
    with the potential to dramatically revolutionize our way of life by enabling interaction
    among inanimate objects to carry out human activities [1]. The Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) is a critical component for enabling various applications in the
    IoT environment. It is made up of many autonomous, heterogeneous devices or sensors.
    Each sensor in a WSN is associated with a distinct network node; for example,
    data transmission, processing, and reception to and from a server or ubiquitous
    cloud computing service host are all handled by separate sensors node in the network
    [2]. For data encryption and decryption, these nodes/sensors typically include
    a microprocessor, radio transceiver, and antenna. A signal conditioner circuit
    in the form of an analog-to-digital converter is also added to convert the sensor
    data signal into a digital format that the microcontroller can read. To power
    the node for data processing, batteries, supercapacitors, or energy harvesting
    systems can all be used [1]. A gateway collects the data from the sensor nodes
    and transfers it to a server or ultimate host. The limited power sources made
    routing data in a complicated environment problematic. Low-Power Lossy Networks
    (LLN) have encountered numerous obstacles in terms of processing power, routing
    issues, energy, and memory, which can lead to network failure owing to excessive
    usage of limited resources [2]. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created
    routing protocol to efficiently tradeoff between performance and resource harvesting.
    RPL is Internet Protocol Version Six (IPv6) [3], which also consider the overall
    routing behavior for low-power lossy network e.g., low rank (child) and high rank
    (parent) and consider suitable path from source to its desired destination. Each
    sending node can negotiate a path to the sink node with neighboring nodes via
    ambient communication. Additionally, LLNs are naturally limited networks, they
    have high packet loss, low throughput, absence of IP service, and high latency
    [2]. WSN routing protocols are classified according to their behavior, such as
    reactive and proactive. Reactive protocols only function if a network requires
    a path-by-path routing for data; otherwise, they do not transport data [4, 5].
    Because it takes so long to find routes when data are needed, this would consume
    more energy [6]. Some of these protocols are ADOV [7], DSR [8], and TORA [9].
    Proactive protocols, on the other hand, are prepared to offer data transmission
    methods well in advance of their actual need. The RPL Routing Protocol is an example
    of this category of protocols. Therefore, RPL is a set of protocols for routing
    that uses IPV6 as a standard in WSN [10]. ITEF created it as a routing protocol
    for routing over Low Power Lossy networks (ROLL) [11]. So, one of the most significant
    challenges and parts is deciding on the objective function that will be utilized
    to identify the best path to the sink node. Similarly, the objective function
    is defined as a metric that helps choose a parent node from among those that are
    close to a particular node. The Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function
    (MRHOF) and Objective Function Zero are the two primary objective functions in
    RPL (OF0) [12]. The batteries employed in these LLNs to power the limited number
    of on-board devices (energy constrained) quickly lose their charge. However, changing
    these batteries on a regular basis is difficult, especially in remote areas with
    multiple sensor nodes [13]. As a result, energy harvesting for WSN is seen as
    a viable method of converting ambient energy into electricity for use in powering
    low-power devices and extending battery life. Energy harvesting, also called \"energy
    scavenging,\" is the process of using energy from the environment, such as wind,
    heat, vibration, radio frequency (RF) signals, and sunlight, to power sensor nodes
    in a WSN [14]. In WSN, rechargeable batteries, and supercapacitors are common
    energy storage devices [15]. The energy harvesting (EH) module is developed in
    the Contiki Cooja simulator to model the RPL network [16]. This module is an improved
    form of PowertraceK; it enables the neutral operation of the node with the lowest
    energy consumption in energy-harvesting environments. Contiki14 offers numerous
    examples that can be executed in the Cooja simulator [17]. For those who are unfamiliar
    with Contiki, these examples are especially useful because they can be quickly
    modified to fit the needs of their projects. As an illustration, the RPL routing
    protocol is used in conjunction with the UDP protocol at the network layer to
    create a network of numerous motes [18]. C language syntax is used in the *.c
    files that make up Contiki applications and programs. A binary file was created
    after these source files were compiled [19]. It transforms the C language syntax
    into binary so that it can be utilized with a specific hardware target or run
    in the Contiki simulator to test the program’s efficacy. The key motivation behind
    this research study is to find out how adding an energy harvesting (EH) module
    affects the lifespan of a network using the RPL routing protocol. Our designed
    module integrates three sub-modules into a single module. All three of these functions
    are sub-modules: consumption, storage, and harvesting. This EH module was designed
    to harvest real data on solar energy collected by Colombia University [20]. In
    addition, this research offers a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of RPL
    standard goal functions for energy harvesting. To the best of our knowledge, this
    is the first RPL evaluation to compare OF0 with ETX with and without energy harvesting.
    Following are main objectives of our research study: To analyze the efficiency
    of RPL metrics in terms of extending network lifetime, three network populations
    or scenarios of 100, 50, and 25 nodes are created. Each network scenario includes
    ETX and OF0 [21], both with and without energy harvesting as a power source. Throughput,
    Network Connectivity, energy consumption and Packet delivery ratio is measured
    in all three scenarios. The rest of the article is organized as follows: Sect.
    2 presents the related work while Sect. 3 focuses on the module implementation
    for energy-traced harvesting simulation. Section 4 presents the network simulation
    and modeling; Sect. 5 illustrates performance evaluation, whereas Sect. 6 explains
    EH module implementation challenges. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes this work. 2 Related
    work Several research have proposed energy harvesting modules with the goal of
    improving the lifespan of remote sensing nodes in WSNs. These works’ harvesting
    modules differ in terms of both the renewable energy source they use and their
    design. We discovered that all earlier proposed modules were completely based
    on either experimental or theoretically generated power traces [22,23,24]. In
    this research, we analyzed an experimental circuit layout to create a simulation
    model for a solar energy harvesting module. A simulation module of the Cooja simulator
    can be coupled to a sensor node to simulate real WSN scenarios [25]. Our research
    is most obviously linked to those that propose a solar energy harvesting module
    to extend the lifetime of WSNs. However, there have been numerous other articles
    on EH integration in WSNs, each covering a different aspect of the larger subject.
    The author in [26] proposes a set of network protocols optimized for energy-harvesting-enabled
    WSNs; among the results reported by the authors is a comparison of the suggested
    stack’s power consumption with that of the network when employing the standard
    set of protocols. Greener RPL protocols have been proposed by [27,28,29,30]; these
    protocols reduce energy waste at nodes and are thus well-suited to autonomous
    and EH-enabled WSNs. Since the RF module in WSN nodes has the largest power consumption,
    our work may be related to that of [31], all of whom presented ways for harvesting
    RF energy. This study makes a major contribution in three stages. An actual model
    of an energy harvesting module based on a PV supercapacitor battery circuit has
    been added to the widely used Cooja simulation environment. The developed module
    can be incorporated with any sensor node in the Cooja simulation environment.
    An implemented simulation module is analyzed, along with its effect on sensor
    node battery life. This energy harvesting module was created due to the lack of
    such a module in the Cooja simulator, the difficulty of altering the Cooja source
    code, and the Contiki operating system. The key advantage of the proposed module
    is that it provides a framework for future studies that will use the Cooja simulator
    to model energy harvesting-enabled WSNs. 3 Module implementation for energy-traced
    harvesting simulation For the energy estimate tool “PowertraceK,” we created an
    energy harvesting model to simulate a wireless LLN system using RPL routing protocol
    and energy harvesting. In this section, we describe the energy harvesting module’s
    design and implementation. The comparative analysis of energy harvesting modules
    is illustrated in Table 1. Table 1 Comparative analysis of energy harvesting modules

    of the energy-harvesting module (Fig. 1). The previously published PowertraceK
    [32] has been improved by our module. Fig. 1 Architecture module of energy harvesting
    Full size image An energy storage component in the form of a supercapacitor is
    integrated into the model and charged by a renewable’s module. The sensor node’s
    RF module, which handles packet transmission as well as reception, would be powered
    by a hybrid energy source. The RF module would get its power from a combination
    of the supercapacitor battery and the major source [33]. Here is how a sensor
    node could progress through its life cycle. The following circuit would allow
    for state transitions: Pin 3 of the micro-controller is configured as an input,
    sensing the voltage of the super capacitor; pin 4 is configured as an output,
    operating a MOSFET transistor switch, connecting the capacitor to the charging
    module (see Fig. 2). The node Rf module’s power supply is selected using the multiplexer,
    and its selection Pin 5 is configured as an output. Fig. 2 Sensor node with hybrid
    energy source Full size image The Cooja simulator was used to model the circuit
    in Fig. 2 using two pre-existing modules, the C-Timer call back timer module and
    the PowerTrace module. Power usage at each sensor node is monitored by the power
    trace module. With Cooja, the power consumption that may be modeled comes in three
    different types. Node power usage can be categorized into three categories: during
    transmission of packets, reception of packets, and when idle. In order to encapsulate
    the supercapacitor battery power drain, we cloned the original power trace module.
    Time-triggered events are communicated to the proper power trace module via the
    Cooja return calls timer module. The return calls timer module requires two parameters:
    A timeout value, which indicates how long the timer should wait before executing
    the callback function set when it was initially called. The timer’s end will trigger
    the execution of the function pointed to by the call back function parameter.
    The supercapacitor’s charging or discharging status has been programmed with this
    module. Using the following formulas, we can calculate the charging and discharging
    times of the supercapacitor battery. $$ {\\text{Tcharging}} = \\;{38} \\times
    {\\text{R}} \\times {\\text{C}} $$ (1) $$ {\\text{Tdischarging}} = \\;{4}0 \\times
    {\\text{ R}} \\times {\\text{ C}} $$ (2) 4 Network simulation and modeling With
    various RPL network populations, we must assess the effectiveness of our built
    module. To assess the efficacy of the energy harvesting module, we have chosen
    to evaluate the RPL routing protocol. This is done to see if energy harvesting
    can extend the life of RPL LLN, which is the best routing protocol for LLNs in
    the Internet of Things [30]. In addition, to our knowledge, RPL measures have
    not been examined in energy-harvesting LLN environments. 4.1 Simulation and network
    setup The Cooja simulator is used to construct and test several networks using
    the RPL routing protocol, allowing for analysis of the energy harvesting component.
    Inside each group of network motes, is a collection of clients and a single server.
    In a DODAG configuration, each client node can be either a child or a parent node,
    while the server motes serve as the root node [34]. This study employs the Contiki
    udp-rpl case study in its experiments. In this scenario, UDP is deployed over
    RPL, with a UDP server acting as the hub for incoming packets. Client nodes are
    sender nodes that represent UDP clients and send packets to servers regularly
    using a single hop or several hops. Moreover, the UDGM radio channel on Contiki
    is utilized. Path loss calculations are provided by this radio model based on
    transmission distance and rate of success. As a result, the RPL protocol’s multiple
    objective functions are used to conduct in-depth analyses of the network from
    a wide range of perspectives. The network was initially configured using the ETX
    (expected transmission count) objective function and later changed to the OF0
    objective function. Each simulated node communicates with every other node via
    an established connection and periodically transmits packets to the sink node.
    Every 30 s, the client nodes transmit a packet with a 240-bps payload to the server
    node. On the network grid, there is an equal distribution of three network populations
    consisting of 100, 50, and 25 mote populations. With the Contiki Cooja simulator,
    the network in Fig. 3b has 100 nodes. Different RPL objective functions and battery
    simulations are used in each of the four experiment simulations for each network
    population. Within a space of 200 square meters, each network only uses a grid
    topology. Each simulation test determines the parameters in Table 2. Fig. 3 Objective-function
    (ETX) network lifespan Full size image Table 2 Simulation parameters used in this
    work Full size table 4.2 Battery powered method Batteries are typically used as
    the source of power for low-power devices or limited sensor nodes because of a
    variety of reasons. These batteries must have the longest operating life and be
    appropriate for embedded devices’ compact size. Because of this, the focus of
    our study was on employing energy harvesting to charge these batteries. We compared
    the different populations of network nodes that were either powered just by batteries
    (non-energy harvesting) or by batteries and energy harvesting. 1. No energy harvesting
    mode: Each node uses its own battery while the network is no energy harvesting
    mode. Powertrace system 27 is used to calculate the amount of power consumed by
    low-power devices in Cooja simulator. Power consumption and battery node residual
    energy are estimated using the PowertraceK system, an extended version of Powertrace.
    The Powertrace tool was upgraded with the addition of the PowertraceK, which included
    the Kinetic battery model. The state of charge (SoC) of a battery is modeled using
    the various parameters calculated by the kinetic battery model (KiBaM), which
    provides an estimate of the battery’s useful life. It considers that the battery
    can either store a charge that is immediately available or one that is chemically
    bound. Setting a maximum charge as necessary will change the battery’s capacity.
    In this study, Zolertia motes with an 800 mAh battery are used. As a result, the
    residual energy is a measure of the battery capacity, which drops over time as
    the motes use up their supply. 2. Energy harvesting mode: This setting indicates
    the KiBaM model’s harvesting sub-module, which is used to periodically boost battery
    residual energy. This method relies on the assumption that the charge in the battery
    model is constant and represents the battery’s capacity. Mote components, such
    as the central processing unit and the transceiver, regularly drain this amount
    of battery capacity during operation. However, the data values used by the energy
    harvesting module come straight from the indoor PV energy trace file. The residual
    energy increases when these numbers are added to the KiBaM model’s available charge.
    Energy harvesting modules usually need to establish a time to contribute harvester
    value to the battery. In this study, the timer was configured to add the collected
    values to the storage battery every minute. The data trace file indicates that
    the values were obtained at 30-s intervals. To be reliable, setup time must be
    greater than harvester time. 4.3 Measuring performance metrics In this section,
    we detail, step-by-step, how to determine the values of the performance parameters
    that comprise RPL metrics. Three RPL network populations were created in the Cooja
    simulator and thoroughly tested to complete the benchmarking and assessment of
    RPL with and without energy harvesting capability. Because of this, every network
    in the Cooja simulator is always fully connected, with a transmission interval
    of 30 s (the same for all nodes). The behavior of the network at each node with
    a different ID is demonstrated using the output from a Cooja terminal. The timestamp
    at which a packet was transmitted by each node ID is displayed, and the root node
    is notified when the packet has been successfully received. Basically, the lifespan
    of a network is the duration of a simulation analysis from the time it is initiated
    to the period the entire network is terminated. As a function of the three rounds
    that make up the simulation time, it has been calculated. The first round, which
    lasts until the first node dies (FND), the second round, which lasts until half
    of the population dies (HND), and the final round, which lasts until the last
    node dies (LND). With our created module, the battery’s remaining power is monitored
    by the energy consumption submodule at periodic intervals. Every minute, the residual
    energy of every individual mote is calculated and updated. If a node has less
    than 10 uWh of residual energy, it is dead. A network’s throughput is the rate
    at which data may be sent from one node to another inside the network at a given
    simulation time, measured in bits per second or packets per second. Hence, the
    throughput parameter of each node in an RPL network is determined by using Eq.
    (3). $$ {\\text{Throughput}} = \\;{\\text{PSR}} \\times {\\text{Packet}}\\;{\\text{size}}/Ts
    $$ (3) where PSR represents the number of packets successfully received, and Ts
    represents the simulation time. In this scenario, we add up all the packets that
    made it to the root node throughout the simulation time, subdivided into as many
    time intervals as you choose. Throughput is measured in both packets per second
    and bits per second in our UDP client architecture, the default value for the
    packet size among all transmitter nodes is 30 bytes. The packet delivery ratio
    (PDR) is calculated by dividing the root node’s PSR by the transmitter nodes’
    total packets. In this scenario, nodes regularly send packets at regular intervals
    determined by the send interval parameter. Hence, the packet delivery ratio is
    calculated as follows. $$ {\\text{PDR}} = \\;{\\text{PSR}}/\\left( {\\text{Total
    Sent Packets}} \\right) \\times {1}00 $$ (4) The power consumption of a sensor
    motes’s sensor actuator, transceiver, and CPU. And the designed EH module is the
    one that typically calculates it. So, the concept of estimating energy consumption
    is just the process of determining the current that is drawn by the mote that
    was utilized in the simulation. Current consumption in various states, such as
    standby, low power, and sleep, was calculated using information from Zolertia’s
    datasheet. The battery voltage is also provided to show how the node is powered.
    In our case, the voltage for the Zolertia mote is 3.7 V. Moreover, calculations
    of energy usage are made over a given time frame. Energy consumption is calculated
    using the following equation. $$ {\\text{Energy Consumption}} = \\;{\\text{I }}
    \\times {\\text{ V }} \\times {\\text{ time}} $$ (5) In above equation, I represents
    the total amount of current drawn by the mote components during each mode, V represents
    the voltage provided by the battery, and time is the amount of time the node is
    actively receiving power. In addition, residual energy is determined by subtracting
    the total amount of energy utilized in each condition from the total amount of
    residual energy stored in the battery. 5 Performance evaluation 5.1 Lifespan of
    lossy low-power networks Coverage and connection metrics as well as node battery
    drain can be used to estimate the potential lifespan of a network. As a result,
    we were able to calculate the expected lifespan of the network by analyzing the
    residual battery life of each node. In this scenario, the battery is assumed to
    be fully charged at the beginning and gradually discharges as the session progresses.
    The position of a node in the network can have a major impact on its behavior,
    which can vary from node to node. The result is that the batteries in each node
    behave differently. As simulating the drain of an 800 mAh node battery would take
    too long, we only used 1% of the maximum capacity for all the nodes. This will
    reduce simulation time, memory, and computational load and speed up battery depletion.
    Figure 3 shows the lifespan of the network when the RPL protocol is used with
    the ETX objective function in a simulated test of a network with 100 nodes. The
    first node in a network with no energy harvesting exhausted its battery at 29:44
    (29 min and 44 s). While, the first node in a network using energy harvesting
    has exhausted at 41:27 (41 min and 27 s). Energy harvesting definitely extends
    the battery life of a network, allowing for a marginal increase in network lifespan.
    In addition, the ability of numerous nodes to transfer its data into the sink
    node is dependent on the central parent node. Nevertheless, if the central parent
    node’s battery is depleted, these nodes lose coverage. Therefore, around 87 network
    nodes lost their connection during the first hour caused to battery depletion,
    and other nodes went out of coverage. Because both networks only have a relatively
    little battery capacity of 1%, the first round (FND) reveals a tiny difference
    in network lifespan. Half of the network’s nodes have been eliminated in the second
    round, represented by (HND). The lifespan of a network that makes use of energy
    harvesting looks to be greater than that of a network that does not utilize energy
    harvesting and instead relies only on battery power. In the energy-harvesting
    network, half of the nodes have run out of power at 0:51:44, but in the non-harvesting
    network, it happened at 0:42:30. The network’s connectivity graph was then continuously
    updated and stabilized between the first and second hours. At this time, there
    were only about 18 nodes connected to the network before a series of outages reduced
    that number down to just three. Until the last node (LND) died at 4:01:26 with
    no energy harvesting and at 6:28:08 with energy harvesting, this had been going
    on. Energy harvesting using the battery shows a promising benefit of over two
    and a half hours during a simulation duration that is only 1% of the battery’s
    maximum capacity. If energy harvesting was 100% of node battery capacity, this
    would mean several days of continuous operation. The ETX routing objective function
    results in a 2:26:42 (2 h, 26 min, and 42 s) extended network lifetime at LND.
    However, in the last round of network survival, the fewest nodes operate (HND ≥ LND),
    resulting in lower energy consumption owing to communication and routing despite
    the network’s low amount of harvested energy. However, when the routing objective
    function of the RPL protocol is changed to (OF0), a new set of results is realized.
    The performance of an LLN with just a battery and with a battery that also incorporates
    energy harvesting is compared in Fig. 4. Initially, the network was powered only
    by batteries, without any energy harvesting; all nodes were linked until the FND
    ran out of power at 38:17 (38 min 17 s). The FND is the node that initially connected
    a large number of nodes to the sink, much to the ETX results shown in Fig. 3.
    After a node died, the grid topology made it difficult for it to reconnect to
    the sink since it was out of range. Many nodes lost network connectivity when
    they were unable to identify a different route. The simulator will then assume
    that their power source is drained and will no longer allow them to take part
    in the simulation. After that, the network worked with fewer nodes until 8:12:25,
    when the last node died. However, the network life duration is increased by around
    3 h when a harvesting energy module is integrated into the battery model. The
    graph in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates that the initial battery node is drained
    after 50:55, while the last node is drained at 11:19:22. Fig. 4 Objective function
    zero (OF0) network lifespan Full size image The majority of battery nodes for
    both objective functions energy harvesting and no energy harvesting exhaust and
    lose network connectivity within the first and second hours. Figures 5 and 6 show
    clearly that the network using energy harvesting will outperform the network using
    only batteries in terms of both ETX and OF0. Also, for all network node populations,
    OF0 had a longer lifespan ETX. This is mostly due to the fact that the ETX requires
    a greater amount of energy due to the numerous operations that are required to
    identify the most suitable parent for each node. Fig. 5 Without energy harvesting,
    ETX and OF0 networks’ lifespans Full size image Fig. 6 Energy harvesting, ETX
    and OF0 networks’ lifespans Full size image Furthermore, if the central parent
    node’s battery expired, the network could abruptly disconnect, leaving the child
    nodes unable to interact with the root node. As a result, the child node must
    undertake additional calculation and communication activities in order to locate
    a different preferred parent. These procedures have longer duty cycle periods,
    which necessitates more power consumption. This is especially true for ETX, which
    is always looking for the best path to the root node. Furthermore, ETX has a high
    rate of packet duplication and loss, increasing overall network overhead and shortening
    its lifetime. In addition, the least total ETX to the root node must be determined
    using the ETX Objective Function. This is because there is a high rate of packet
    loss, which results in additional retransmissions, which take longer time and
    require more energy. In uniform node populations, ETX is better for network lifespan,
    whereas OF0 routing in an RPL-enabled network is better in populations with a
    wide range of node types since it requires less operations to compute the hop
    counts to the root node to identify the optimum path. Because of this decrease
    in duty cycle, the battery can be used for far longer. 5.1.1 Throughput The throughput
    is measured in bits per second, and a reading is taken at a rate of once every
    five minutes. A comparison was made between ETX and OF0. The objective functions
    of the RPL routing protocol will be optimized by measuring their performance in
    terms of throughput with the use of an energy harvesting module. The throughput
    was calculated without including the first 5 min of simulation time to improve
    the reliability of the results. Throughput performance for an ETX-enabled network
    with 100 nodes is shown in Fig. 8. Using an objective function, the ETX will search
    for the most efficient way for data transmission and reception. An OF0-enabled
    network’s throughput in energy harvesting and without energy harvesting power
    modes is shown in Fig. 8. As a result, the throughput rates of ETX and OF0 are
    shown to have been improved by the energy harvesting network. ETX and OF0’s network
    performance started high but fluctuated due to surrounding nodes sending and receiving
    packets. Moreover, the network was initially fully connected, but nodes gradually
    lost contact as their batteries ran out, and now the network functions with only
    two nodes. This makes it clear that network connection quality affects throughput.
    The higher the throughput rate, the greater the number of connected nodes. Network
    throughput for OF0 was higher than that for the ETX objective function, as illustrated
    in Figs. 7 and 8. At the beginning, OF0 can only provide up to 508 bps of throughput
    with energy harvesting enabled, and 585 bps without. Throughput of 191 bps is
    seen while using only the battery, and 301 bps is seen when using the energy harvesting
    module in the ETX Objective Function. Finally, with just two nodes linked, the
    throughput is reduced to 11 bps. Fig. 7 Throughput for objective function (ETX)
    Full size image Fig. 8 Objective function (OF0) throughput Full size image Figure
    9 shows the results of our analysis of network performance across 3 different
    populations of network nodes for ETX and OF0, providing a full analysis of standard
    objective functions in the RPL protocol. In a network with 100 nodes, the throughput
    performance of OF0 is often higher than that of ETX Objective Function. This is
    because OF0 has better performance in dense networks, but it also has a lower
    success rate because it does not have to wait as long to transfer data. ETX, on
    the other hand, is more dependable and requires more retransmissions to convey
    reliable data. As a result, packet loss and network congestion may increase. When
    energy harvesting is implemented, the throughput of the ETX goal function increases.
    Because of the extra time offered by energy harvesting, ETX can transport more
    packets in a more reliable manner. When compared to OF0, both the battery strategy
    with energy harvesting and the battery method without energy harvesting exhibit
    extremely comparable throughput patterns. Fig. 9 Round-by-round network throughput
    with three node populations Full size image OF0 outperforms ETX Objective Function
    with and without energy harvesting for the first two rounds on a network of 50
    nodes, but both functions perform similarly during the third round. This is due
    to the network’s last two nodes. Energy harvesting mode increases the network’s
    lifetime since ETX operates in networks with low density and reduced radio overlap.
    Surprisingly, energy harvesting mode does not perform better than any other mode,
    because a high throughput can be achieved in a short amount of time with many
    packets being received. Yet, when comparing networks with 25 nodes with and without
    energy harvesting, ETX and OF0 show identical throughput performance. This is
    likely the result of a lack of available battery capacity throughout the network’s
    nodes, which we have been using. Surprisingly, lower network density results in
    the best performance for most network measures. As a result, as network status
    changes over time, metrics are frequently changed in a similar manner. The PDR
    is shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10 Packet delivery ratio Full size image 5.1.2 Packet
    delivery ratio (PDR) As a result of physical network topology instability, the
    PDR is observed to be quite low in dense networks, when 100 nodes are installed
    in a 200 square meter area. As network density diminishes, as shown in Fig. 11,
    PDR improves considerably by the third cycle of ETX routing. By the third round,
    there are fewer nodes in the network connecting to the sink, resulting in less
    radio disturbance and data traffic congestion, allowing sender nodes to transfer
    packets directly to the root node without any for-warding or packet loss. By increasing
    network lifetime, energy harvesting improves packet delivery ratio. Figure 11
    shows that in a crowded network, the packet delivery ratio for OF0 is higher than
    that of ETX, which benefits from frequent delays and collisions. Packet drops
    can also be caused by excessive network density, short transmit intervals, weak
    radio interface or ETX, as well as numerous recipients with the same minimal rank.
    Hence, OF0 routing may be better than ETX for dense networks with poor connection
    quality. Fig. 11 ETX and OF0 periodic energy consumption during initial node failure
    Full size image Therefore, the packet delivery ratio improves when the size of
    the network is reduced. This is valid for both 50-node and 25-node populations.
    However, in a less dense network, the behavior of ETX and OF0 is comparable, with
    ETX having a slight edge due to its consistency in low density networks, which
    enables it to transmit packets periodically with extremely few packet drops. For
    the same objective function, a 100-node PDR network with and without energy harvesting
    performs differently. Energy harvesting extends the lifetime of the network, and
    this has a somewhat beneficial effect on PDR performance across the board for
    all population sizes of the network. However, LLNs are severely constrained by
    the 30-s interval at which packets must be sent from each child node to the parent.
    With energy harvesting, OF0 performs similarly to ETX objective function for packet
    delivery ratio in low density networks (e.g., during the FND cycle) and may reach
    close to 100% during the LND round. 5.1.3 Energy consumption Energy consumption
    is a very important problem that needs to be addressed in LLNs because this type
    of power source is referred to as restricted in WSNs. As a result, energy consumption
    study is helpful for optimizing the RPL routing protocol in LLNs. In this study,
    per minute energy consumption is estimated. The Energest module of the Contiki
    OS was crucial in achieving this goal. Figure 11 shows the energy consumed by
    the initial failure node. The amount of energy that was used by the ETX and OF0
    objective functions is shown in the figure. When there are several nodes in a
    network, the power consumption can rise to 60.4 uWh. It drops dramatically, though,
    as there are fewer nodes in the network. It is interesting to observe that energy
    harvesting essentially has no impact on a node’s energy consumption. This is predicted
    as energy harvesting simply lowers a battery’s capacity and increases its residual
    energy, extending its operational time. When switching from an ETX to OF0 objective
    function, energy usage decreases at the FND node. In a similar manner, though,
    the amount of energy that is consumed by OF0 reduces as the population of the
    network decreases. Energy harvesting makes OF0 somewhat more efficient at using
    energy nodes than ETX. This is mostly due to the demanding computations in ETX,
    which lead to higher power consumption by demanding greater TX, RX, and CPU duty
    cycles. Hence, OF0 is a good solution for energy-intensive applications regardless
    of network population. However, in order to estimate the network’s longevity,
    it is critical to be aware of the level of leftover energy in each battery node.
    Furthermore, it can be utilized as a vital measurement for any RPL routing protocol
    objective function that is dependent on energy consumption. Figure 12 depicts
    the FND residual energy in a network of 100 nodes. When employing the RPL routing
    protocol, the ETX objective function is compared to the OF0 objective function
    in the figure. Each objective function’s efficiency is compared between the energy
    harvesting approach and the no energy harvesting method. The residual battery
    node’s value is shown to drop until it reaches 10 uWh, at which time it is pronounced
    dead. In both scenarios of energy harvesting and without it, OF0 outperforms ETX
    objective function in terms of increased network lifespan. The residual energy
    curve rapidly decreases for both objective functions in energy harvesting mode,
    then recovers somewhat, creating a notch on the graph, before declining smoothly
    again. As expected, this is what happens when harvested energy is added to the
    battery’s residual energy. There is no notch for ETX or OF0 when a battery is
    utilized without energy harvesting. The LND, HND, and FND rounds are synonymous
    with the overall performance because they all reflect the population size of the
    network. Figure 12 shows that energy harvesting increases residual energy, extending
    OF0’s lifespan. ETX networks that do not use energy harvesting tend to have shorter
    lifespan because their residual energy is quickly consumed. In other words, ETX
    requires more power to operate than OF0. Fig. 12 Residual energy at the 100-node
    network’s last dead node Full size image Energy consumption for both ETX and OF0
    are listed in Table 3 both while using simply battery power and when utilizing
    energy harvesting. Total energy refers to the sum of all the energy that a node’s
    operations use up throughout the course of the node’s lifespan. The table clearly
    shows that ETX always used more energy than OF0 at the start time. It used 5.712
    mW per hour, for instance, at 4:01:26, while OF0 used 6.501 mW per hour at 6:11:29.
    As a result, OF0 has a longer operational lifetime while using less energy than
    ETX. Table 3 ETX and OF0 total energy consumption Full size table 6 EH module
    implementation challenges Several difficulties arose during the implementation
    of the EH module in the Contiki OS, and these should be discussed among the developers.
    As a result, certain difficulties were overcome with success while others require
    more research. The following is a summary of the difficulties: Since Contiki OS
    does not provide full support for the \"Printf\" function, the system only shows
    the integer portion of a floating-point number. However, the calculation is not
    finished. This required the use of small energy units with less precise estimates
    of residual energy. Due to memory constraints, the error “.data” will not fit
    in region \"rom\" frequently occurs. The reason for this is an overflow in the
    ROM of the Z1 motes by a random number of bytes. For this reason, updating to
    the most recent version of the msp430-gcc compiler is the best solution. Therefore,
    it is essential to minimize the amount of computer code fat. Alternatively, the
    debug code can be disabled with #define DEBUG DEBUG PRINT. As a result of a memory
    overflow, using a compact trace file is required. The harvested values stored
    in CFS arrays are limited to 770 bytes. Only one hour at most may be provided
    by this size for the battery. Code developers must find a solution to this open
    problem. To charge the battery, we directly used the information from the trace
    file. Furthermore, we neglected the PV panel’s energy efficiency. An efficiency
    model must be included in the simulation to accurately represent an actual solar
    panel. Although various external resources exist nowadays, like vibration, RF,
    and temperature, etc., this study only addressed solar energy to charge the battery.
    In addition, the kinetic battery model is utilized in order to provide a representation
    of the energy that is being stored. However, a supercapacitor-based energy storage
    model would offer a practical answer to the problem of neutral energy functioning
    in low-power gadgets. When trying to simulate a high-density network automatically
    in the Cooja simulator, things can get complicated quickly. For instance, we implemented
    a script editor in order to eliminate nodes that had an insufficient amount of
    battery power. On the other hand, if the simulation operates for too long, the
    Cooja java simulator breaks because of the network’s density. The KiBaM battery
    model also considers a battery to be dead if the accessible charge is zero, regardless
    of bound charge. The shift from the bound charge to the available charge can take
    a long time depending on how the KiBaM mechanism operates. In our scenario, the
    battery is not being used to its full capacity since one percent of its maximum
    capacity has not had enough time to transition from bound charge to available
    charge. This can be rectified by increasing the current duty cycle level in the
    ContikiMAC. 7 Conclusion This work aims to demonstrate how an actual dataset of
    indoor sunlight was used to simulate battery energy usage in an energy harvesting
    simulation module. On a simulated RPL-routing-enabled network with three node
    populations, the ETX and OF0 objective functions were investigated in battery-only
    and battery-plus-harvesting setups. OF0 has been shown to help extend the lifespan
    of networks with varying node densities. Because ETX expends more energy selecting
    which parent each node chooses, the network lifetime is less than that of OF0.
    Energy utilization, packet delivery ratio, network connectivity, and throughput
    performance variables were also assessed. It has been observed that the throughput
    rate provided by OF0 is 511 bps without the use of harvested energy and 586 bps
    with its use, a 12.7% increase. There is a 36% increase in throughput from 189
    bps when only the battery is used to 296 bps when the energy harvesting module
    is also used, as measured by the ETX Objective Function. Regarding PDR, a high
    packet drop rate was seen in a high-density network; however, the PDR was very
    high in a low-density network and nearly reached 100%. In three different populations
    of network nodes, we determined that ETX consumes more energy than OF0. When the
    battery on a parent node responsible for numerous child nodes dies unexpectedly,
    the network’s stability may rapidly decline. Energy harvesting has dramatically
    increased the lifespan of RPL networks of all sizes. OF0 surpasses ETX regarding
    network reliability in battery mode and without the energy harvesting module.
    When compared to ETX, OF0 outperformed in almost all network characteristics.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION Agriculture
    and healthcare are two industries that have grown dramatically as a result of
    rapid technological improvements. The Internet of Things (IoT) and fifth-generation
    (5G) wireless technology have revolutionized these businesses'' operations and
    created new prospects. This research paper will look at how 5G and IoT are being
    utilized in healthcare and agriculture to address significant concerns and improve
    productivity and quality of life. The agriculture sector has recently faced a
    number of challenges, including the need to increase food production to meet the
    demands of the world''s rising population while minimizing resource consumption
    and environmental impact. Traditional farming approaches usually rely on physical
    work and experience-based judgement, which leads to inefficiencies and less-than-ideal
    results. However, the introduction of 5G and IOT technologies has enabled agricultural
    practices to transform significantly. The merging of IOT''s network of linked
    equipment and sensors with 5G''s high-speed, low-latency communication enabled
    smart farming systems. Similar to other industries, the integration of 5G and
    IoT has drastically revolutionized the healthcare sector. Remote patient monitoring
    and individualized healthcare are now possible because of the ability to connect
    medical equipment, wearables, and health monitoring systems. Healthcare providers
    can remotely monitor patients'' vital signs, detect anomalies, and take appropriate
    action. This technology has proven to be particularly beneficial in delivering
    healthcare services in off-the-grid or underserved areas, expanding access to
    healthcare, and relieving pressure on healthcare facilities. Furthermore, due
    to 5G''s high bandwidth and low latency, considerable amounts of medical data,
    such as real-time video consultations and high-resolution pictures, can be transferred.
    SECTION II. APPLICATION DOMAIN Agriculture: In the realism of agriculture, the
    integration of 5G and IoT has given rise to the concept of smart farming, enabling
    precision agriculture practices. That emphasizes how the integration of sensors
    and 5G connectivity facilitates real-time monitoring of various parameters, including
    soil moisture, temperature, and crop health. By utilizing these data, farmers
    can optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, resulting in increased
    crop yields and resource efficiency. Healthcare: Through remote patient monitoring
    (RPM) and telemedicine, in particular, the combination of 5G and IoT in healthcare
    has transformed patient care and management. Real-time data transmission is made
    possible by 5G''s low latency and high bandwidth, allowing for quicker patient
    treatments and better patient outcomes. Despite the obvious advantages of 5G and
    IoT in healthcare and agriculture, there are still a number of difficulties. To
    enable the secure and efficient application of these technologies, it is imperative
    that legislative frameworks, security and privacy concerns, and network infrastructure
    requirements are all given careful consideration. SECTION III. INTRODUCTION TO
    5G AND IOT 5G: 5G stands for fourth-generation (4G) communication network. The
    market for the next generation of telecom networks began to expand towards the
    end of 2018 and will continue to do so. By the end of 2018, the first 5G iteration
    had been developed and was in widespread use. As cellular operations, IoT security,
    and network difficulties develop, 5G networks are projected to push the Internet
    to its limits. Cells are distinct geographic areas into which cellular networks,
    particularly 5G networks, are split. 5G''s increased capacity allows it to connect
    a broader range of devices. From the first generation (1G), an analog signal with
    few applications, to the fourth generation (4G) and LTE, which is an evolution
    of mobile technology and is credited with overcoming many limitations of previous
    generations, such as low bandwidth and low data rate, mobile wireless communication
    networks have traveled a long journey. The International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU) presented the 5G road map in 2015. IOT: In the coming years, technology
    will have a tremendous impact on education. The Internet of Things (IoT) maintains
    its significant place in the context of information and communication technology
    and the evolution of civilization. The phrase \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) refers
    to the point at which the Internet evolved and created a global infrastructure
    for machine-to-machine communication. Without a doubt, IoT has evolved as a powerful
    technique with appliances in a variety of industries. IoT is rapidly spreading
    and becoming a global problem that elicits both excitement and trepidation. Technology
    enables these things to collect and share data. The Internet of Things allows
    for the remote sensing and control of items using pre-existing networks. Because
    of network infrastructure, there is the prospect of more direct integration of

    that is managed with the use of smart technologies and advanced communication
    methods. Smart farming is a modern technology and management concept that provides
    the best way to boost the quality and quantity of agricultural products on your
    farms by utilising IOT Sensors, robots, location systems, and artificial intelligence.
    Climate change, soil types, water scarcity, and other challenges can be recognized
    through communication networks. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to Internet-connected
    equipment that operates autonomously to undertake operations and collect data
    in order to improve efficiency and predictability. Agriculture uses robots, drones,
    remote sensors, and computer imaging, as well as ever-improving machine learning
    and analytical tools, to monitor crops, survey and map fields, and send data to
    farmers for farm management plans, saving both time and money. Farmers may now
    easily monitor field conditions from anywhere and at any time. With the help of
    such technology, it is possible to make farming smarter and easier. Farmers may
    access information on the soil, plants, weather, and other aspects via a smartphone
    and the internet by placing sensors across the fields. At various stages of smart
    farming, farmers can obtain comprehensive information regarding soil analysis
    and mapping, irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides, disease detection, harvesting,
    and yield prediction and monitoring. Some IoT applications in agriculture include:
    Sensors for monitoring and tracking the status of crops and insects Drones to
    monitor livestock such as hens Automated water pumping systems to irrigate crops
    at appropriate times Machines to perform route operations and maintain system
    correct operation Using IoT-enabled devices, the chemical composition of fertilizers
    and soil, such as phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and other chemical contents
    essential for plant productivity, is computed. Agriculture equipment can be automatically
    modified by combining information such as crops/weather and equipment to auto-adjust
    temperature, humidity, and other parameters. An Internet of Things-enabled drone
    in large farms aids in getting crop status reports and providing live photographs
    of the field. By examining farmland using its Solutions, you will be able to learn
    about the current state of fields and crops. Fig. 1 5G Technology In Agricultural
    Sector [4] Show All IOT USE CASES IN SMART FARMING: 1. Monitoring of climate conditions
    Monitoring climate conditions is crucial in various fields, including agriculture,
    meteorology, environmental research, and disaster management. Monitoring climate
    conditions involves the collection and analysis of data related to temperature,
    humidity, rainfall, wind patterns, atmospheric pressure, and other relevant parameters.
    Weather stations are equipped with instruments to measure and record various weather
    parameters. These stations typically include sensors for temperature, humidity,
    barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, solar radiation, and precipitation.
    Weather stations can be automated and transmit data in real time, providing continuous
    updates on local weather conditions. Satellite observations help track large-scale
    weather patterns, monitor climate variability, and contribute to climate modeling
    and forecasting. Remote sensing can provide information about land cover, vegetation
    health, soil moisture, and other relevant parameters. It aids in monitoring changes
    in land use, detecting drought conditions, assessing crop health, and mapping
    environmental variables. 2. Greenhouse Automation Greenhouse Automation System
    is a technical technique that will aid farmers in rural areas by automating monitoring
    and controlling the greenhouse environment. It takes the place of direct human
    monitoring. Farmers typically utilise manual intervention to control the greenhouse
    climate. They may obtain accurate real-time information on greenhouse parameters
    such as illumination, temperature, soil condition, and humidity by using IoT sensors.
    Weather stations can automatically modify the conditions to match the supplied
    parameters in addition to gathering environmental data. A similar idea is used
    by greenhouse automation systems. A greenhouse is a structure in which plants
    are grown in a controlled environment. Due to urbanization and a scarcity of available
    land, there is a tremendous need to build Greenhouses that will be used mostly
    for crop cultivation. We can now control and monitor several greenhouses wirelessly
    from a central location thanks to technological advancements. 3. Crop Management
    Crop management refers to the practices and strategies employed by farmers to
    ensure the successful growth, development, and productivity of crops. It involves
    a range of activities aimed at optimizing plant health, maximizing yields, and
    managing resources efficiently. Crop management devices are another sort of IoT
    product in agriculture and a component of precision farming. They, like weather
    stations, should be installed in the field to capture crop-specific data, such
    as temperature and precipitation, as well as leaf water potential and general
    crop health. As a result, you can efficiently prevent illnesses and infestations
    that can impair your production by monitoring crop growth and any irregularities.
    4. Cattle Monitoring and Management Cattle monitoring and management involve the
    use of various techniques and technologies to track, monitor, and optimize the
    health, behavior, and productivity of cattle. Sensors placed in the environment
    can monitor factors like temperature, humidity, rainfall, and water quality in
    cattle-relevant areas such as barns, pens, and water sources. Real-time monitoring
    of these environmental parameters helps ensure the comfort, health, and productivity
    of cattle. Various technologies are available to monitor the health of cattle.
    For example, wearable sensors can track vital signs such as body temperature,
    heart rate, rumination patterns, and activity levels. This data can be analyzed
    to detect signs of illness, heat stress, or calving difficulties, allowing for
    early intervention and improved animal welfare. Technologies like ultrasound and
    hormone monitoring can aid in the reproductive management of cattle. Ultrasound
    can be used for pregnancy diagnosis, monitoring fetal development, and assessing
    reproductive health. 5. Precision Farming Precision farming, also known as precision
    agriculture or site-specific farming, is an approach to agricultural management
    that utilizes advanced technologies and data analysis to optimize the efficiency
    and sustainability of farming practices. It involves the use of various technologies,
    including GPS, sensors, satellite imagery, and data analytics, to collect and
    analyze data about soil conditions, crop growth, and other factors influencing
    agricultural production that is, precision farming is all about efficiency and
    making accurate data-driven decisions. It’s also one of the most widespread and
    effective applications of IoT in agriculture. Precision farming relies on the
    collection of accurate and detailed data about the farming environment. This includes
    data on soil composition, moisture levels, nutrient content, pest and disease
    prevalence, weather patterns, and crop performance. Data is collected using sensors,
    drones, satellites, and other monitoring devices. Advanced data analytics tools
    process this information to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that can
    inform decision-making. GPS is used to precisely locate agricultural equipment
    and map fields. Technologies such as aerial drones, satellites, and aircraft-mounted
    sensors provide high-resolution imagery and data about crop health, plant density,
    and nutrient status. 6. Agricultural Drones Also known as UAVs (unmanned aerial
    vehicles), or agricultural quadcopters, are unmanned aircraft specifically designed
    for use in agriculture and farming. These drones have gained popularity in recent
    years due to their ability to assist farmers in various tasks, such as crop monitoring,
    mapping, spraying, and data collection. Agricultural drones equipped with sensors
    and cameras can capture high-resolution aerial images of crops. These images can
    be used to monitor plant health, detect diseases, identify nutrient deficiencies,
    and assess overall crop conditions. Farmers can then make informed decisions regarding
    irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. Agricultural drones collect vast
    amounts of data during their flights. This data can include aerial imagery, sensor
    readings, and GPS coordinates. Farmers can analyse this data using specialized
    software to gain insights into crop health, growth patterns, and potential issues,
    enabling them to make data-driven decisions. B. HEALTHCARE: Smart healthcare delivers
    healthcare services using networks (such as Body area networks, wireless local
    area networks, and wide area networks) and smart devices (such as smartphones,
    smartwatches, wireless smart glucometers, and wireless blood pressure monitors).
    The intelligent devices analyse health data gathered from a variety of sources,
    such as sensors and biomedical systems (i.e., the application with knowledge of
    medical science such as diagnosis, therapy, and illness prevention). In short,
    smart healthcare enables people from various backgrounds and occupations (such
    as doctors, nurses, patient carers, family members, and patients) to access the
    appropriate information and find the appropriate solutions, which are primarily
    to reduce medical errors, increase efficiency, and cut costs when necessary. During
    the COVID-19 (pandemic) period, smart healthcare also played a significant role.
    1. Telehealth for Patients Telehealth refers to the delivery of medical services
    remotely through the use of communication technologies. The broader range of services
    is defined by these services, which also include remote clinical healthcare, health-related
    education, public health, and health administration. Telemedicine is the technique
    of providing clinical services remotely, such as healthcare delivery, diagnosis,
    consultation, and treatment, to patients who are located far away from the provider.
    The term \"telenursing\" describes the use of telecommunications technologies
    to carry out nursing practice and provide nursing care. The term \"telenursing\"
    describes the use of telecommunications technologies to carry out nursing practice
    and provide nursing care. The term \"tele pharmacy\" refers to a service that
    provides patients who do not regularly interact with chemists with remote pharmacological
    care via telecommunications. (For instance, remote prescription medicine delivery).
    Due to a scarcity of medical resources (such as hospital space, staff, and protective
    gear), all of these telemedicine services came in very handy during the pandemic.
    For appropriate functionality, these telehealth services frequently have stringent
    prerequisites and are also referred to as sophisticated underlying technology.
    2. Communication Technology for Smart Healthcare For data to be transferred between
    devices and servers in smart healthcare, a variety of communication protocols
    are required. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and many other short-range wireless technologies
    are commonly utilized in smart healthcare applications like BAN (Body Area Network)
    for short-range communication. To move data from local servers to base stations,
    wide-area technologies including GPRS and Mobile Communication (GSM), LTE Advanced,
    and Long-term Evolution (LTE) are employed. Fig. 2 Telehealth Networking [12]
    Show All 3. 5G Network Architecture for Smart Healthcare Solutions: The fourth-generation
    (4G) wireless mobile networks will be replaced by the fifth-generation (5G) networks.
    This subsection''s remaining text describes the 5G architecture, features, and
    performance improvements. The 5G smart healthcare architecture is shown in Figure
    3. Small cells are radio access nodes with modest power and a range of a few meters
    to a mile. Numerous 5G smart healthcare applications can benefit greatly from
    the various sorts of tiny cells. One approach is tiny cells since smart healthcare
    applications need high data rates. Small cells come in three different sizes and
    are known as femto, pico, and microcells. When compared to the macro cell, which
    has a range of around 20 miles, these are regarded as little cells. Femtocells
    are used to boost coverage and capacity in a constrained area, like a hospital,
    a house, etc. It can accommodate 30 users at a distance of 0.1 kilometers. Picocells
    have greater capacity and coverage, supporting up to 100 users over a distance
    of 1 kilometer. Picocells are often used to expand wireless and cellular coverage
    in a constrained area. Although it can be difficult to tell a microcell apart
    from a pico cell, the primary differences are the coverage area and user support.
    Fig. 3 5G smart healthcare architecture. [5] Show All 4. Objective for Smart Healthcare
    4.1. Optimization of resources Methods for resource optimization are employed
    to reduce energy consumption while enhancing network longevity. The use of resource
    optimization methods is crucial in 5 G-based smart healthcare networks. Smart
    healthcare is made possible by a vast array of IoT devices, which can generate
    enormous amounts of data and use up more network bandwidth. Numerous network problems
    can result from improper resource optimization. 4.2. Enhancing QoS The ability
    of a network to handle large amounts of bandwidth as well as other network performance
    indicators like error rate, latency, and uptime is referred to as quality of service
    (QoS). Making healthcare safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient,
    and equitable is a key component of improving quality. Giving the individuals
    closest to issues that affect care quality the time, permission, knowledge, and
    tools they require to address such issues is key. There has never been a stronger
    emphasis on raising the standard of healthcare services in the history of the
    NHS. Managing and optimizing network resources for various forms of data (audio,
    video, and files) on the network is another aspect of quality of service (QoS).
    4.3. Reducing interference The smart healthcare system can leverage the idea of
    frequency reuse to achieve optimal resource utilization. Additionally, user throughput
    densification and network traffic capacity can also be enhanced. Therefore, there
    can be more improvement in terms of effective load sharing between macro cells
    and local access networks with densification and frequency reuse. 4.4. Enhancing
    energy efficiency Due to environmental considerations as well as the characteristics
    of the IoT devices utilizing the network, energy efficiency has emerged as the
    primary criterion for creating smart healthcare networks. The network uses more
    energy as a result of the density of its access points. Therefore, it is crucial
    for network operators to reduce a network''s energy usage in order to save operational
    costs. 5. Future Scope of Healthcare: There is no denying that 5G has had a huge
    impact on the healthcare industry. The emergence of various applications, including
    connected inhalers, remote heart rate and breathing analysis, smart insulin delivery,
    and depression and mood monitoring, has radically transformed the way medical
    services are provided. Future possibilities as well as current work are covered
    under 5G smart healthcare. Thanks to the flexibility and expansion of computer
    networks. The healthcare industry is facing enormous new potential, yet medicine
    is changing slowly as seen by the lack of cutting-edge new applications based
    on this ecosystem. SECTION VII. CONCLUSION The integration of fifth-generation
    (5G) wireless technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to
    revolutionize the agriculture and healthcare sectors. The integration of 5G and
    IoT in agriculture and healthcare offers immense potential to address critical
    challenges and transform these sectors. By leveraging real-time data analysis,
    remote monitoring, and high-speed connectivity, 5G and IoT enable precision agriculture
    practices, leading to increased crop productivity and sustainability. In healthcare,
    these technologies enhance patient care, improve access to medical services, and
    enable remote diagnostics and surgeries. However, it is crucial to address the
    challenges associated with security, infrastructure, and regulations to fully
    realize the benefits of 5G and IoT in agriculture and healthcare. Further research,
    development, and collaboration among stakeholders are necessary to unlock the
    full potential of these technologies and drive positive change in these sectors.

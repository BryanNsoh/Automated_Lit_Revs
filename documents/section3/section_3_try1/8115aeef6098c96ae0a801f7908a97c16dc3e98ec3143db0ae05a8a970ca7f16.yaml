  description: Agriculture is one of the most important production sectors in the
    world. Water and energy are two essential inputs for food production. The agricultural
    sector is influenced by climate change the most. In this regard, this research
    aimed to present a new mathematical programming approach to studying the effects
    of climate change on the water–energy–food (WEF) nexus. A sustainable WEF nexus
    was developed for the basin of Kashfrud in Razavi Khorasan province, Iran for
    2019–2020. The present approach was modeled in several climatic-hydrological-economic-environmental
    sectors. Analyzing the outcomes of a hydrological model in the context of climate
    change scenarios reveals that, given the current state of irrigated land, there
    will be a 45% increase in net water demand in the future, accompanied by a 13%
    decrease in crop yields. Consequently, by embracing a holistic approach that considers
    the nexus of water, food, and energy, the net water demand drops to 71%, the energy
    allocation to agriculture decreases to 41%, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced
    by 32%, and farmers’ overall profits decrease by 73% in the face of climate change.
    This approach would also be effective in avoiding the undesirable effects of single-sectoral
    development policies in addition to improving resource use efficiencies. Since
    most non-renewable resources are consumed by the agricultural sector, the development
    of the nexus approach is also important from an environmental perspective in addition
    to the sustainability of resource use.

    sectors in the world. Water and energy are two essential inputs for food production.
    The agricultural sector is influenced by climate change the most. In this regard,
    this research aimed to present a new mathematical programming approach to studying
    the effects of climate change on the water–energy–food (WEF) nexus. A sustainable
    WEF nexus was developed for the basin of Kashfrud in Razavi Khorasan province,
    Iran for 2019–2020. The present approach was modeled in several climatic-hydrological-economic-environmental
    sectors. Analyzing the outcomes of a hydrological model in the context of climate
    change scenarios reveals that, given the current state of irrigated land, there
    will be a 45% increase in net water demand in the future, accompanied by a 13%
    decrease in crop yields. Consequently, by embracing a holistic approach that considers
    the nexus of water, food, and energy, the net water demand drops to 71%, the energy
    allocation to agriculture decreases to 41%, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced
    by 32%, and farmers’ overall profits decrease by 73% in the face of climate change.
    This approach would also be effective in avoiding the undesirable effects of single-sectoral
    development policies in addition to improving resource use efficiencies. Since
    most non-renewable resources are consumed by the agricultural sector, the development
    of the nexus approach is also important from an environmental perspective in addition
    to the sustainability of resource use. Highlights 1. A new multi-objective programming
    model based on WEF nexus management was developed. 2. The application of the proposed
    model was used to as a case study in Iran. 3. This model could increase the gross

    Introduction Population growth and food regime diversification have changed the
    demand for food and consequently the demand for water and energy for food production
    (Teutschbein et al. 2023). Water, food, and energy are the necessary elements
    for human needs, and the sophisticated and boundless links of these three systems
    reflect their dependence on one another and their interaction in the production
    cycle. As projected by the UN, 1 developing countries including Iran will witness
    a population growth of about 50% by 2050 (Shang et al. 2018). Global food production
    by the agricultural sector accounts for about 90% of freshwater consumption, and
    food production and its supply chains consume 30% of energy (FAO 2014). As the
    population increases and economic growth accelerates, it is projected that global
    water demand will increase by 55%, and energy and food production by 50% and 70%,
    respectively, by the year 2050 (UNEP 2021). It has been forecasted that Iran will
    enter the list of countries suffering from water scarcity by 2025. Given the environmental
    and water crises that threaten Iran’s food and energy security, if no effective
    action is taken for the optimal use of limited water resources, this country will
    undoubtedly have problems in achieving sustainable development (Samadi-Foroushani
    et al. 2022). The UN put a list of sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2 on the
    agenda in 2015 to accomplish long-term sustainable development in human communities
    by ensuring the availability of water, food, and energy for the sustainability
    of the next generations (EL-Gafy et al. 2017). Given the close links between water–food–energy
    systems and their interactions, the nexus approach has emerged as a new concept.
    The water–energy–food nexus (WEFN) was first proposed at the Bonn Conference in
    2011 held with the collaboration of the German Federal Government and the World
    Economic Forum to deal with such problems as the shortage of resources (Zhang
    et al. 2022). By providing a clear framework, this approach investigates the links
    between these three fields to give a better understanding of the actions and reactions
    in the relationships between the environment and human activities by performing
    an integrated analysis (Hoff 2011). The lack of coordination and poor interaction
    of the economic, social, and environmental sectors will lead to unsustainable
    use of other resources including water, energy, and land, posing a threat to food
    and water security and the achievement of SDGs (Emamzadeh et al. 2016). it is
    necessary to create a nexus network to provide modern knowledge of planning and
    policymaking in the water, energy, and food sectors and lay the ground for the
    exchange of ideas to develop technical knowledge, especially in the interactions
    of the actors (Schlenker and David 2010). “NEXUS approach” management aims to
    ensure the security of water, food, and energy through integrated approaches or
    tools for analyzing exchanges between different sectors, efficient production
    planning, and strategy and policy management (Nkiaka et al. 2023). In today’s
    world, due to the critical nature of these three essential resources and the swift
    global population growth, the notion of the interconnectedness between managing
    water, food, and energy resources has become a focal point of research for many
    scholars on an international scale (Peng et al. 2022). In the past few decades,
    the need for water, energy, and food has risen alongside the increasing world
    population, the industrialization of communities, and the expansion of urban areas.
    Human actions have a dual impact. They contribute to the release of pollutants
    into the environment, causing disturbances in water resources. Simultaneously,
    the growing population and the subsequent surge in demand for non-renewable energy
    sources lead to an overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions (Lee et al. 2020).
    Additionally, safeguarding food safety is another challenge that has been underscored
    in the effort to ensure the “preservation of the Earth.” As a result, sustainability
    initiatives, practical research, and the strategies employed by regulatory and
    scientific organizations strive to both optimize resource utilization and diminish
    environmental difficulties (Lalawmpuii and Rai 2023). Nonetheless, individualistic
    methods do not possess adequate and comprehensive information. Hence, an analysis
    was done to study the use of the Water–Energy–Food (WEF) Nexus as a means to monitor
    environmental effects and oversee the use of resources, as discussed by Wang et
    al. in 2021, within various climate conditions and in pursuit of Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs). Enhancing the efficiency of irrigation management to produce the
    highest amount of food possible, while also taking energy usage into account,
    can serve as a meaningful initiative in pursuing these objectives (Bieber et al.
    2018). Considering that the interaction between various elements and their long-term
    effects holds considerable importance in the integrated approach to water–energy–food
    in irrigation management, it is essential to thoroughly examine the performance
    and enhance the understanding of the connections among water, food, and energy
    components. Alternatively, one can make more inclusive decisions concerning network
    management to ensure the security of existing resources for sustainable development
    (Lee et al. 2020). In recent years, numerous researchers have employed the integrated
    approach of water, food, and energy to enhance the management of these resources,
    either separately or in combination, yielding valuable research outcomes. Lalawmpuii
    and Rai (2023) done an assessment of the Water–Energy–Food (WEF) Nexus. They used
    cognitive methods and modeling techniques within a unified framework, combining
    insights from different sectors and the economic standpoint. This evaluation covered
    aspects such as water resource management, energy use efficiency, food production,
    waste reduction, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Yue et al. (2021)
    introduced a fresh comprehensive modeling framework aimed at achieving sustainable
    agricultural management. This framework is based on the Energy–Water–Food–Nexus
    (EWFN) and strives to maximize economic and social well-being, efficiently distribute
    water resources, optimize crop production, and reduce environmental impacts and
    agricultural land usage in response to changing climate conditions. As previously
    noted, the nexus of water, food, and energy forms a guiding principle for shaping
    sustainable development policies within the country, with the goal of navigating
    future environmental and water-related challenges. As part of their commitment
    to environmental protection, Cui et al. (2023) systematically and quantitatively
    examined the interconnections between water, energy, food, and carbon (WEFC) to
    evaluate resource management strategies, especially in the agricultural sector.
    They conducted this assessment while considering the integrated impact of virtual
    water flows on agricultural production. In this context, Cao et al. (2020) conducted
    an evaluation of water usage, the water footprint of various products, and water
    utilization efficiency in diverse climate scenarios. They accomplished this by
    presenting a comprehensive framework for the effective management of water resources.
    The water footprint serves as an indicator of the real water consumption associated
    with products, categorized into three parts: blue, green, and grey. Nowadays,
    it has garnered significant attention within the framework of contemporary, integrated
    water resource management. Overall, the research done by Cao et al. (2023) showed
    that although each of the productivity indicators can independently represent
    the impacts of different scenarios in various networks, depending solely on a
    single indicator is not sufficient to make a conclusive decision about the overall
    effectiveness of scenarios, considering the different aspects of water consumption,
    energy usage, and food production in the networks. This implies that considering
    a collection of indices plays a crucial role in determining suitable scenarios.
    Therefore, for a thorough examination, it is essential to use a composite index
    that combines water, food, and energy connections. This underscores the significance
    and impact of decision-making metrics in shaping managerial policy development.
    Namany et al. (2019) discuss how a one-dimensional view when tackling water resource
    problems can result in a type of conflict termed sectoral conflict. Fragmentation
    also signifies limited attention to problem-solving, and the comprehensive perspective
    in it is often disregarded as a fundamental principle in water resource management.
    As an illustration, directing attention exclusively towards lowering water usage
    without considering the facets of food production and energy consumption may indeed
    have positive outcomes in some interconnected components of a system. However,
    it’s essential not to overlook the consequences of such a strategy on the production
    and consumption of resources in various sectors (Cui et al. 2023). Yue et al.
    (2020) assessed the management of EWFN in Chinese irrigation systems by using
    a non-precise multi-objective optimization model. Management strategies for those
    responsible for decision-making in this context have been reviewed through the
    utilization of a hierarchical method concerning the distribution of water resources,
    land, energy consumption, the application of fertilizers and pesticides, and the
    assessment of economic advantages. In the proposed model, climate change scenarios
    were assessed, and integrated solutions for this recommended approach were provided
    to work towards achieving sustainable development goals within the EWFN agricultural
    system. Ultimately, the model proposed could be implemented in other agricultural
    areas grappling with resource crises. Ji et al. (2020) suggested a multi-stage
    optimization approach for managing EWFN links, which considers the uncertainty
    conditions and incorporates the risk factors of decision-makers. Furthermore,
    Lodge et al. (2023) examined the quantity of water allocated to the agricultural
    sector in the context of climate change by implementing different scenarios and
    employing water irrigation efficiency strategies. Kaddoura and El Khatib (2017)
    and Chen et al. (2020) presented a model based on the WEAP hydrological model
    and the MABIA agronomic module to check the effects of climate change on crop
    yields and water requirements. Esteve et al. (2015) and Wolfert et al. (2017)
    investigated the effect of climate change and determined the cropping pattern
    based on multi-objective stochastic programming criteria. Ikram et al. (2020)
    and Nie et al. (2019) used the WEAP-MABIA model to analyze and simulate agricultural
    water demand in the basin of the Uver River. Esteve et al. (2015) and Emamzadeh
    et al. (2016) integrated the field-based nonlinear mathematical programming model
    of WEAP with the MABIA module to explore the effects of climate change and methods
    to adapt to it. Forni et al. (2016) employed hydrological-economic modeling to
    predict farmers’ economic measures to respond to the variations in available water
    in the San Joaquín basin over the historical period of 2013–2099. Therefore, managers’
    overemphasis on farmers’ economic welfare in recent decades has resulted in ignoring
    the environmental consequences of policy implementation (Du et al. 2022). In other
    words, policies have been implemented unidimensionally. Therefore, it seemed necessary
    to present a model based on mathematical programming models that can model the
    coherence and links of the economic, social, and environmental sectors in an integrated
    manner. In this regard, Kaddoura and El Khatib (2017) and Liu et al. (2017) addressed
    environmental-agronomic-economic modeling by using single-objective programming
    models irrespective of environmental consequences and the water–energy–food nexus
    in the water resources management of basins. Kalbali et al. (2021) and Zhang et
    al. (2022) analyzed profitability and welfare by using hydrological-economic models
    with the objective of optimal water allocation and cultivation area at the level
    of counties or different regions of basins. Rezaei Zaman et al. (2016) and Zhang
    and Vesselinov (2016) addressed the optimal management of water resources in the
    agricultural sector in uncertain conditions using the nexus approach by multi-objective
    mathematical programming models with the objectives of maximizing profit and minimizing
    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nie et al. (2019) focused on optimizing crop cultivation
    areas by the water–food–energy–land nexus approach to achieve sustainable economic,
    social, and environmental development. White et al. (2018) and Emamzadeh et al.
    (2016) employed a hydrological-economic model of WEAP and MABIA module to assess
    the potential effects of climate change and the adaptive scenario of irrigation
    efficiency enhancement on agriculture. Peng et al. (2022) and Ding et al. (2023)
    estimated crop yields and water requirements by this method in different scenarios.
    Presently, most studies at the basin level on the WEF nexus have been single-sectoral
    (Fabiani et al. 2020) and have modeled only one objective, i.e., increasing farmers’
    profits (Kalbali et al. 2021). This research adopted a different perspective and
    provided a proper mechanism to model the effects of climate change on the WEF
    nexus using new mathematical programming methods. Then, the model was assessed
    for the 2019–2020 crop year and a simulation was made for the 2021–2040 period
    for the agricultural region within the Kashfrud basin. The present research mainly
    aimed to explore the effects of climate change on the WEF nexus using a new mathematical
    programming approach in the Kashfrud basin. The minor objectives included economic
    goals (increasing farmers’ profit and increasing calorie generation from agricultural
    products) and environmental goals (reducing GHG emissions, reducing irrigation
    water use, and reducing energy use). As expected, farmers’ profits, calorie generation
    from agricultural products, GHG emissions, irrigation water, and energy will be
    reduced by climate change in the coming years. So, the application of the nexus
    approach clearly highlights the links and coherence of the economic, environmental,
    and agricultural fields. This approach can hopefully provide useful information
    to formulate proper strategies for alleviating environmental effects and increasing
    farmers’ revenues under climate change for the sake of the development of the
    agricultural sector. The innovation in this approach had two dimensions: theoretical
    and practical. On the theoretical side, it involved modeling in various areas
    such as climate, hydrology, economics, and the environment. The practical dimension
    focused on applying a new mathematical planning approach in the specific study
    region. Consequently, the modeling in this study didn’t introduce any distinct
    innovations by itself. As mentioned earlier, the most notable innovation lay in
    combining mathematical methods, using multi-objective and climate patterns, and,
    uniquely, designing the model for the first time under restricted conditions and
    in critical regions in Iran, where specific resource limitations are a factor,
    which distinguishes it from other studies. The Kashfrud basin in the Northeast
    of Iran has an area of 16,787 km2 and a mean precipitation of 270 mm/year. The
    main river of the basin is the Kashfrud which originates from the Hari River and
    flows to the central desert of Karakum in Turkmenistan. The study site of the
    research is the northern part of the basin with an approximate area of 9900 km2
    of which 6133 km2 is located in the elevated lands with a mean precipitation of
    325 mm and 3776 km2 is plain with a mean precipitation of 239 mm Fig. 1. Binalud
    and Chenaran counties completely and 47% of Mashhad County are located within
    the study site. The surface water resources of the site include dams, rivers,
    canals, and channels, which mainly have a rain-snow regime. Presently, permanent
    streams of the river do not reach its main branch and are consumed for agriculture
    in the lands within the basin, and the main branch is only fed by floods. This
    is mainly related to the land-use changes on the banks of the rivers from grain
    cultivation to horticulture (anonymous). Fig. 1 The location of the Kashfrud basin
    in Iran Full size image Materials and Methods Assessment of Climate Change Scenarios
    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a report on the
    status of the climate, its impacts, adaptation to climate, and reduction of vulnerability
    at the global and regional scales every other time. In these reports, the GCM
    climatic models provide simulations of climatic components for a historical and
    future period under different emission scenarios. The output data of the Sixth
    Report models are under new scenarios, which present Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
    (SSP) and different GHG concentrations (Representative Concentration Pathway,
    RCP). The Sixth Report scenarios, which are composed of five main subgroups, emphasize
    quantitative indices (population, urbanization, regional and trans-regional economic
    development, and so on) and extended scenarios (impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability
    reduction), energy programs, land-use changes, and so on. The Conceptual Framework
    of the WEF Nexus Model The optimization of the WEF nexus was modeled by studying
    the effects of climate change in several economic-environmental sectors based
    on Liu et al. (2017) and Nie et al. (2019). The research proposes a mathematical
    programming model using the (MOP) 3 technique for the WEF nexus. Figure 2 displays
    the conceptual framework of the WEF nexus model under different climatic scenarios.
    Fig. 2 The framework of the research system in the water–energy–food nexus in
    climate change conditions Full size image The WEF nexus optimization model is
    a multi-stage climatic-hydrological-environmental model that is based on mathematical
    programming principles (Forni et al. 2016). Separate assessments were made for
    the climatic (temperature rise and precipitation decline), economic (using MOP),
    and hydrological sectors (WEAP-MABIA). The outputs of one of the models were used
    as the input of the other model, and finally, they were analyzed within climatic
    simulation scenarios. The yield, crop water requirements, GHG emissions, electricity
    consumption, and finally, farmers'' profits were simulated within different climatic
    scenarios for the 2021–2040 period for which the studied basin was first modeled
    by WEAP and then, the agricultural, climatic, soil and hydrological data of the
    region were inputted into the software as required. WEF Nexus Modeling Steps of
    the Conceptual Model of WEF Nexus In general, the WEF nexus model was simulated
    for the Kashfrud basin by integrating climatic-hydrological-environmental-economic
    (CHEE) models composed of the following three steps: Step 1. Then, using two approaches
    of Raisanen weighting and observational mean temperature and precipitation (MOTP)
    4were used to weight and ensemble multiple models. The effects of climate change
    were simulated on the parameters of temperature and rainfall in the Kashfrud basin
    through the weighted combination of the four models of AOGCM 5 from the Coupled
    Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CIMP6) under three scenarios of SSP1-2.6,
    SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 as the optimistic, pessimistic, and very pessimistic scenarios
    for the base period (1993–2012) and future period (2021–2040), respectively. Step
    2. The hydrological section was modeled by the WEAP software package and its agronomic
    module, MABIA. The WEAP model calculates components of the hydrological cycle
    by simulating rainfall-runoff processes at the basin level and using the time
    series of climatic data. In the MABIA module, the simulation of the hydrological
    processes was used. The method proposed by Jabloun and Sahli in the National Agriculture
    Institute of Tunisia simulates crop yields and water requirements by using various
    agronomic, hydrological, and meteorological data. In the MABIA module, plant evapotranspiration
    is calculated by the FAO Penman–Monteith model presented by Allen et al. (2005)
    The calculation of evapotranspiration needs data on meteorological parameters
    including maximum and minimum temperature, maximum and minimum relative humidity,
    wind speed at the height of 2 m, and daily sunny hours (White et al. 2018). The
    available water capacity was calculated based on the water retention capacity
    of the soil at the saturation point, field capacity, and wilting point. To estimate
    the amount of irrigation water requirements of crops in the region, the model
    should be provided with data on the irrigation schedule and irrigation depth (Kalbali
    et al. 2021). The MABIA module uses Eq. 1 to simulate crop yields. $${1}-\\frac{{\\text{Y}}_{\\text{a}}}{{\\text{Y}}_{\\text{m}}}\\text{=}{\\text{K}}_{\\text{y}}\\left({1}-\\frac{{\\text{ET}}_{\\text{a}}}{{\\text{ET}}_{\\text{c}}}\\right)$$
    (1) in which Ya is the actual crop yield, Ym is the maximum yield, Ky is the response-yield
    factor, ETa is the actual evapotranspiration, and ETc is the evaporation in actual
    similar conditions but with no water limitation. The model was validated in the
    WEAP software using the PEST tool (Rezaei Zaman et al. 2016). Table 1 A list of
    symbols used in the model to define sets, variables, and parametersa Full size
    table Step 3. In this step, the results of Steps 1 and 2 were used to analyze
    the sustainable WEF nexus and the interactions between the WEF system, such as
    water supply-demand, energy supply-demand, land demand, crop yields, and water
    and energy allocation in different climatic scenarios. The main mathematical programming
    for determining the cropping pattern under the WEF nexus approach in climatic
    conditions included parts of the objective functions, including maximizing profit,
    maximizing calorie production, minimizing GHG emissions, minimizing irrigation
    water consumption, and minimizing energy consumption by considering water, land,
    fertilizer, pesticide, and energy constraints, which are presented below. Before
    the mathematical programming model used in the research is presented, since the
    sets, variables, and parameters are abundant, a summary of the components, as
    well as their symbols and definitions are given in Table 1. In a nexus cycle,
    water, food, and energy play key roles in each step of energy development including
    the extraction, generation, and processing of fossil fuels, electricity generation,
    and treatment of waste produced during energy activities. On the other hand, water
    and energy are involved in food production and processing, and irrigation. Energy
    is also required in water management for water pumping, collection, treatment,
    distribution, mechanization, land preparation, fertilization, and food packaging,
    processing, and storage. Research shows that about 30% of total global energy
    consumption is related to food production and supply (Emamzadeh et al. 2016).
    On the other hand, the consumption of non-renewable sources, which entails GHG
    emissions, is higher in the agricultural sector than in other sectors. Therefore,
    it is important to substitute them with biofuels and green energies in this sector.
    Multi-objective Programming (MOP) Modeling Decision Variables The decision variables
    of the MOP model for the WEF nexus include the amount of energy allocated to water
    extraction in each region (kWh), which reflects the energy–water relationship,
    the amount of energy available for food production and processing in each region
    (kWH), which describes the energy–food relationship, the net amount of surface
    and groundwater allocated to crops for food production in each region (million
    m3), which reflects the water–food relationship, the total electricity consumption
    for extracting surface and groundwater resources or pumping groundwater for crops
    in each region (kWH), the amount of electricity consumed for food production and
    crop processing in each region (kWh), and lands allocated to each crop for food
    production in each region (h). Objective Functions Since different economic, social,
    and environmental dimensions are investigated in the WEF nexus approach, modeling
    in this research includes various objectives based on the three systems of water,
    food, and energy and their different aspects. Equations 2–6 present the algebraic
    form of the objectives (Li and Ma 2020; Nie et al. 2019). $${\\text{Max}}: Obj1Profit\\_V=\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\left[\\left({Price\\_{\\text{p}}}_{k}

    (6) The objective functions are subject to the following constraints. Constraints
    The amount of electricity consumed for allocating and distributing surface water
    and pumping groundwater cannot exceed its allowed level for each region. This
    constraint is represented by Eq. 7. $${Ecsw\\_P}_{i}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{k}Nswf{\\_V}_{ik}}{Rsw\\_{P}_{i}}\\right)+{Ecgw\\_P}_{i}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{k}Ngwf{\\_V}_{ik}}{R{gw\\_P}_{i}}\\right)\\right]\\right]
    \\le Ew{\\_V}_{ik}$$ (7) The amount of energy consumed for food production and
    processing cannot exceed the amount of energy allocated to food production and
    processing in each region. The constraint is represented by Eq. 8. $$\\sum_{k=1}^{k}({Ecf\\_P}_{ik
    }.Yield\\_{P}_{ik}) .{Area\\_\\_V}_{ik}\\le Ef{\\_V}_{ik}{\\forall }_{i}$$ (8)
    The energy available for the allocation and transmission of surface water, the
    pumping of groundwater, and food production and processing cannot exceed the total
    energy available for agriculture in each region, except for the access to the
    total energy consumption of the domestic and industrial sectors. Equation 9 represents
    this constraint. $$Ew{\\_V}_{ik}+Ef{\\_V}_{ik}\\le {Ea\\_P}_{i}-{Eci\\_P}_{ik}{\\forall
    }_{i}$$ (9) The amount of surface water allocated for all crops in each region
    cannot exceed the water supplied by water supply projects, such as water transmission,
    storage, and recharge projects. Equation 10 represents this constraint. $$\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{k}Nswf{\\_V}_{ik}}{Rsw\\_{P}_{i}}\\le
    Sw\\_{P}_{i} .{\\text{R}}sw\\_{P}_{i}{\\forall }_{i}$$ (10) As with the surface
    water resources, the amount of groundwater allocated to all crops in the regions
    cannot exceed the amount of groundwater pumped (Eq. 11). $$\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{k}Ngwf{\\_V}_{ik}}{Rgw\\_{P}_{i}}\\le
    Gw\\_{P}_{i}.{\\text{R}}gw\\_{P}_{i}{\\forall }_{i}$$ (11) The amount of water
    allocated and effective rainfall for each crop in each region should supply the
    water required for food production (Eq. 12). $$Nswf{\\_V}_{ik}+Ngwf{\\_V}_{ik}+(Ep\\_{P}_{ik}.Area\\_{V}_{ik})\\ge
    Wrc\\_{P}_{ik}.A{\\text{rea}}\\_{V}_{ik}{ \\forall }_{i}$$ (12) The maximum and
    minimum arable land for the studied crops is determined by Eq. 13. $$A{\\text{rea}}\\_{P}_{ik}^{min}\\le
    A{\\text{rea}}\\_{V}_{ik}\\le Area\\_{P}_{ik}^{max}{ \\forall }_{i},k$$ (13) The
    amount of each crop produced must not deviate from the maximum and minimum demand
    for it. This constraint is represented by Eqs. 14 and 15. $$\\sum_{i=1}^{I}A{\\text{rea}}\\_{V}_{ik}.Yield\\_{P}_{ik}\\le
    Deman{\\_P}_{ik}^{Max}{ \\forall }_{k},i$$ (14) $$\\sum_{i=1}^{I}A{\\text{rea}}\\_{V}_{ik}.Yield\\_{P}_{ik}\\ge
    Demand\\_{P}_{ik}^{Min}{ \\forall }_{k},i$$ (15) It should be noted that Eq. 15
    is involved in food security by applying a minimum crop requirement. In other
    words, in addition to maximizing calorie production by food consumption (Eq. 6),
    this equation deals with the issue of food security, too. Eventually, the nonnegative
    set of the model variables is determined by Eq. 16. $$\\begin{gathered} Nswf\\_V_{ik}

    (16) Table 2 presents the initial data of the research. In Mashhad, Corn had the
    highest yield of 55 t/ha, and barley had the lowest yield of 3.6 t/ha. The highest
    electricity consumption (9057 kWh) was for sugar beet and the lowest (2492 kWh)
    was for barley. Wheat, barley, alfalfa, and corn were less costly in terms of
    the consumption of other inputs including fertilizers and pesticides (Table 2).
    Table 2 List of basic data for crops Full size table Results To evaluate the performance
    of the global-climatic models of GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, and MRI-ESM2-0
    in generating temperature and rainfall data, the historical periods of these models
    were compared with the observed data in the reference period on a monthly basis
    for three stations that were close to the basin for which the statistical parameters
    of MAPE, 6 RMSE, 7 MAD, 8 NSE 9 and, R, 10 as well as their correlations, were
    calculated. Table 2 presents the results for the mean performance of the models
    for the variables of rainfall and temperature in the studied stations. As it can
    be seen in Table 3, the elevated levels of the correlation coefficient and Nash–Sutcliffe
    coefficient, along with the diminished values of the RMSE, MAPE, and MAD metrics
    for precipitation and temperature variables, demonstrate the model’s strong efficiency
    in replicating weather data in the drainage basin throughout the period spanning
    from 1993 to 2012. Table 3 The mean performance of the models for the variables
    of rainfall and temperature in the studied stations Full size table Generally,
    the statistics suggest that the models perform reasonably well in the study area
    and the surrounding drainage basin. Since the choice of models is based on their
    ability to estimate the basin’s average performance, considering the results in
    this section, it was determined that all four global-climate models would be utilized
    for the study, investigating temperature and precipitation trends in future periods
    under different scenarios. The mean yearly rainfall in this region ranges from
    about 220 to 298.45 mm on average. The analysis of monthly precipitation data
    observed and simulated during the baseline period (1993–2012) indicates that the
    most significant decrease in precipitation occurs in the months of June and August
    (Table 4). In broad terms, there is more rainfall in the western region of the
    basin and at higher altitudes, and this precipitation gradually diminishes as
    you head eastward and southeastward. Therefore, this element significantly influences
    the variety of plant coverage, erosion, and, ultimately, the region’s flexibility.
    Table 4 The annual average precipitation totals during the base period and under
    various scenarios for the period from 2021 to 2040 in millimeters Full size table
    Figure 3 shows a monthly comparison of average precipitation across various climate
    scenarios spanning from 2021 to 2040, relative to the reference period. In all
    scenarios, there is a projected decline in precipitation for January, September,
    and November, whereas an increase in precipitation is anticipated for March, June,
    and December. The average precipitation in adverse climate conditions is approximately
    24.08 mm. Fig. 3 The variations of the mean monthly rainfall under different scenarios
    for the period of 2021–2040 and the reference period Full size image The highest
    increase is related to September in which it is 1.65, 1.91, and 1.97 °C for SSPI1-2.6,
    SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively Table 5. Table 5 Monthly Maximum Temperature
    Changes (2040–2021 vs. Baseline) Full size table The mean maximum temperature
    of different months increases versus the reference period in the period of 2021–2040
    in the studied scenarios (Figure 4). Fig. 4 The variations of the mean monthly
    maximum temperature under different scenarios for the period of 2021–2040 and
    the reference period Full size image It is evident that there has been a rise
    in the average air temperature, averaging 6.18 °C, from the years 2021 to 2040
    in comparison to the baseline years. The most substantial temperature increase
    was recorded in unfavorable conditions, with a 1.97 °C rise noted in September,
    while the smallest temperature increase, at 0.69 °C, was observed in May. Additionally,
    the mean temperature increases in the ssp5-8 scenario stood at 6.95 °C, surpassing
    other scenarios. Crop Yields in Different Scenarios Figures 5, 7 display the mean
    crop yields in the agricultural areas. The results for the effect of climate change
    on the current cropping pattern over the 2013–2040 period showed that the greatest
    variations in the yield in the studied counties were related to the pessimistic
    scenario. Fig. 5 The comparison of crop yields in Mashhad between the base year
    and different scenarios Full size image By adopting a negative outlook in Mashhad,
    Chenaran, and Tarqabeh-e-Shandiz, the products experienced an average reduction
    in performance of 14.5%, 13.2%, and 13.5%, respectively. The rise in temperature
    and reduction in rainfall in the lower parts of the drainage have led to a greater
    impact on the performance of specific crops in Mashhad compared to other regions.
    In contrast, the response to these changes in performance has been minimal in
    the upstream areas, specifically in the highlands and western regions of the drainage,
    particularly in the Chenaran and Tarqabeh-e-Shandiz regions. The mean yield of
    alfalfa in Mashhad was 10.33 t/ha in the base year, which decreased to 8.5 t/ha
    with climate change (pessimistic scenario). It should be noted that the yields
    of onions and potatoes in Mashahd decreased in the optimistic scenario (40.38
    and 27 t/ha, respectively) versus the base year (40.64 and 27.13 t/ha, respectively)
    slightly, i.e., 0.64%. According to Figs. 6, 7, the greatest decrease in crop
    yields in Chenaran, Targhabeh-Shandiz under the pessimistic scenario was related
    to cucumber, sugar beet, potato, and tomato, respectively. Fig. 6 The comparison
    of crop yields in Chenaran between the base year and different scenarios Full
    size image Fig. 7 The comparison of crop yields in Targhabeh-Shandiz between the
    base year and different Full size image Crop Water Requirements in Different Scenarios
    Figures 8, 10 display the results of the simulation of the crops’ net water requirements
    in the studied counties. Fig. 8 The comparison of water requirements of crops
    in Mashhad in the base year and different Full size image Potatoes, on average,
    receive the largest share of water demand among the crops, with a reduction of
    61% in the drainage basin when a pessimistic scenario is implemented. In contrast,
    sugar beets have the smallest allocation, with a 19% decrease. Wheat, barley,
    and onions, in that order, had the highest water demands among the various products
    in relation to the prevailing conditions within the drainage. In the lower areas
    and the concluding part of the drainage basin, there was an average irrigation
    demand of 49.5% for the cultivation of crops in Mashhad (Fig. 8). In an unfavorable
    climate change scenario, the Chenaran area in the upper drainage requires the
    highest amount of irrigation water, constituting around 50% of the total demand,
    whereas the central region, including Shandiz, has the lowest irrigation water
    requirement at approximately 34% (Figs. 9 and 10). Forage corn and tomatoes have
    been assigned the lowest irrigation demand in these regions. Fig. 9 The comparison
    of water requirements of crops in Chenaran in the base year and different Full
    size image Fig. 10 The comparison of water requirements of crops in Torgabeh-Shandiz
    in the base year and different scenarios Full size image Since Mashhad is located
    at the end of the basin, water scarcity is more eminent in this region than in
    other regions. So, the decrease in yields and the increase in water requirements
    of the crops in Mashhad are quite understandable given the limitations of the
    groundwater resources in this region. Since Chenaran is located at upstream, the
    yields of some crops were less affected by climate change. However, since water
    transmission from this region to the end of the basin is greater, its crops need
    more irrigation. Shandiz is located in the middle of the basin, so it is less
    affected by climate change and the yields and irrigation needs of its crops did
    not change significantly. In other words, this region can supply its water requirement
    better than Mashhad and Chenaran. WEF Nexus Modeling Figures 11, 13 depict the
    results of the multi-objective nonlinear programming model based on the variations
    of cultivation area in the counties within the basin versus the current pattern
    (SSP0) under climate change conditions for the agricultural region of the Kashfrud
    basin. Fig. 11 (Source: Research findings) The cultivation areas of crops in Mashhad
    under climate change conditions Full size image The current cultivation area in
    Mashhad is 34,390 ha, which decreased by 14,443 ha (58%) in the MOP model. Also,
    the cultivation areas of the crops in this region decreased by 14.36 and 26% in
    the SSP1-2.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios, respectively. The farmers’ net profits decreased
    by 14.2, 27, and 31% in the SSP1-2.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively, and
    the calorie decreased from 34,389 ha in the current pattern of calorie maximization
    to 26,394 ha in the pessimistic scenario. GHG emissions in Mashhad decreased by
    63, 73, and 57% in SSP1-2.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. Considering
    that one of the important policies of the water–food–energy integration approach
    in improving the economic role of the agriculture sector, reducing greenhouse
    gas emissions or environmental impacts, and implementing suitable cultivation
    patterns, reducing this variable in the optimal model has been a reason for this
    important reason. It should be noted that in climate change conditions, water
    consumption increased by – 14.3, 7.35, and 10.06%, and electricity consumption
    increased by – 7.12, 7.5, and 6.5% in the SSP1-2.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios,
    respectively Fig. 11. The current cultivation area is 29,446 ha in Chenaran, which
    was reduced by 53.13% to 13,798 ha in the MOP model. The cultivation area of the
    crops was reduced by 81, 66, and 80% in the SSP1-2.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios,
    respectively. Farmers’ revenues in the MOP model decreased by 47% in no climate
    change conditions and by 61.3, 67.11, and 68.5% in the SSP1-2.5, SSP3-7.0, and
    SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. GHG emissions in Mashhad decreased by 60.6,
    62, and 60.4% in the SSP1-2.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively
    Fig. 12. Fig. 12 (Source: Research findings) The cultivation areas of crops in
    Chenaran under climate change conditions Full size image The cultivation areas
    of the crops in Torgabeh-Shandiz decreased from 15,505.6 ha in the current pattern
    to 9261.5 ha in the pessimistic climate change conditions (a 42% decrease) for
    profit maximization. Also, the maximum calories derived from crop production decreased
    from 19,867 ha in the current conditions to 19,153.2 ha in the optimistic conditions
    (a 3.5% decrease). The highest decrease in this factor was to 15,176 ha (a 23%
    decrease) happened in the pessimistic scenario Fig. 13. Fig. 13 (Source: Research
    findings) The cultivation areas of crops in Torgabeh-Shandiz under climate change
    conditions Full size image GHG emissions in the agricultural regions of Mashhad
    decreased from 14,443.5 million tons in the current pattern to 7921 million tons
    in the pessimistic conditions (a 45% decrease). It decreased from 13,798 million
    tons in the current pattern to 11,643 million tons in the pessimistic conditions
    (a 15% decrease) in Chenaran. In addition, it was found that the agricultural
    regions that were studied with different economic and environmental objectives
    granted the farmers economic advantages, e.g., calorie production and profit increase,
    in addition to the environmental dimensions (water use, energy consumption, and
    GHG emissions). So, the cultivation area must be decreased in the agricultural
    regions with higher environmental impacts, or crops must be selected with more
    environmental considerations. In contrast, the strategy of production increase
    in the agricultural regions must be changed toward crops with lower environmental
    impacts and higher economic advantage. Since an important policy in the WEF nexus
    for improving the economic role of the agricultural sector is to reduce GHG emissions,
    i.e., the environmental impacts, and to implement a proper cultivation pattern,
    the reduction of this variable in the optimal pattern is a reason to explain this
    important fact. WEF Nexus Analysis in Different Climatic Scenarios Table 4 presents
    some important variables and the percentage of their variations along the WEF
    nexus versus the current year. The results for the agricultural region of Mashhad
    showed that this region had been most vulnerable to climate change in terms of
    the decline in the cultivation area so the application of the climate change scenario
    in the irrigated area of Mashhad reduced the cultivation area by 63%. Under the
    current circumstances, Chenaran County received an energy allocation of 2.97 kilowatt-hours.
    However, when considering the interplay of water, food, and energy in climate
    change scenarios, this figure decreased to 2.08 kilowatt-hours, representing a
    29% reduction. Under a multi-objective approach focused on solidarity, the energy
    allocation to the agricultural sector in the Mashhad region will decrease from
    5.94 kilowatt-hours to 3.37 kilowatt-hours, which represents a reduction of 43%
    in response to climate change conditions. The energy allocated to the Shandiz-Tarqobeh
    region has been reduced by 50%, going from 14.4 kilowatt-hours in current conditions
    to 7.1 kilowatt-hours. This reduction follows the holistic approach of prioritizing
    water, food, and energy, which assigns the highest allocation during climate change
    conditions. It should be noted that the greatest decrease in GHG emission was
    25% in Chenaran from 365.14 million tons to 272.23 million tons versus -30% for
    Mashhad and -42% for Torgabeh-Shandiz. The lowest calories derived from crop production
    were for Mashhad, which was 13% of that of other regions. Finally, owing to climate
    change, crop production. The application of the climate change scenario led to
    a reduction in the average production output via the water–food–energy nexus in
    the regions of Mashhad (62%), Chenaran equivalent (68%), and Torqabeh-e-Shandiz
    equivalent (72%). The Shandiz district in the area has experienced the most substantial
    decline in production. Farmers'' net profits will be reduced by 75% for Chenaran
    and Torghabeh Shandiz and 68% in Mashhad compared to the base year. Hence, the
    most significant decrease is attributed to the Chenaran and Torqabeh regions in
    Shandiz, primarily because of increased water requirements and a decrease in production
    levels. Therefore, the proposed WEF nexus is advantageous for farmers and the
    sustainability of their farm activities in addition to its positive environmental
    effects and optimal resource management. The selection of a cultivation pattern
    with no regard to the WEF nexus will only emphasize economic goals, but the application
    of this approach in the agricultural sector analyzes environmental impacts and
    interactions of water, food, and energy resources quantitatively in addition to
    attention to economic goals (Table 6). Table 6 Important variables proposed for
    crops in the water–energy–food (WEF) nexus approach Full size table Discussion
    Based on the results, the negative effects of temperature rise and rainfall decline
    are evident across the basin. The annual mean maximum temperature over the reference
    period of 1966–2018 stood at 18.66 degrees Celsius. However, when considering
    climate change scenarios for the years 2021–2040, it is estimated to rise by 6.5
    degrees Celsius, reaching a projected 24.5 degrees Celsius. The alteration in
    climate conditions had a notable effect on crop productivity in the eastern and
    central regions of the country, which aligns with the findings of Kalbali et al.
    (2021) and Li et al. (2019) in the drainage basin. According to the studies by
    Ikram et al. (2020) and Nie et al. (2019), it has been found that, on average,
    crop yields in the drainage basin have declined by about 13.5%, while the demand
    for irrigation water has seen a significant increase of 44% due to the influence
    of climate change. According to the results Wolfert et al. (2017) and Zhang et
    al. (2022). The values for the net water requirements showed an increase in this
    variable for all crops under the pessimistic climatic conditions versus the base
    conditions. This increase was not unexpected given the increase in temperature
    variables over the growth period and higher evapotranspiration in the pessimistic
    climatic conditions. In addition, it was inferred from the comparison of the results
    for the effect of climate change on yields and net water requirements of the crops.
    According to the results Samadi-Foroushani et al. (2022) whose yields were influenced
    by severe climate change the most had an elevated level of water requirement.
    According to the findings of (Kalbali et al. 2021), when transitioning from the
    western regions of the basin to the eastern areas, the water requirements for
    crop irrigation increase due to rising temperatures and decreasing humidity. As
    a result, the Torqabeh-e-Shandiz area, situated in the central and western portion
    of the basin, has assigned itself water needs that are 34% lower compared to Mashhad,
    which is equivalent to 49%. In Chenaran, given its position in the upper basin
    area and the predominant water transfer to the middle and lower basin regions,
    there is a requirement for a higher level of irrigation, approximately constituting
    50% of the water needs for crops. The cultivation area for crops decreased in
    climate change scenarios when compared to the current conditions (Nie et al. 2019;
    Mardani Najafabadi et al. 2019) as observed in the MOP model. Through the application
    of pessimistic scenarios, the most significant decrease in cultivated land area
    to reach a minimum 28.31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has been observed
    within the basin. The rising temperatures in Iran are in line with the findings
    of studies by Li et al. (2019) and Fabiani et al. (2020), both in historical contexts
    and in future projections. This temperature increase is a consequence of significant
    factors, including population growth, alterations in land use, and the heightened
    concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Hence, given Mashhad’s geographic
    position at the lower end of the basin, the most significant influence of the
    optimized model’s outcomes concerning reducing pesticide and fertilizer usage
    and greenhouse gas emissions in this area has amounted to around 45%. Hence, in
    this current investigation, the release of greenhouse gases stemming from the
    prolonged use of resources (including pesticides, fertilizers, water for irrigation,
    electricity, and diesel fuel) has been reduced using the water–food–energy nexus
    strategy (Li et al. 2019). In total, the exploration of the total cultivation
    areas. According to the results Peng et al. (2022) and Chen et al. (2020) of the
    crops for maximizing farmers’ net profit in the agricultural regions revealed
    a decrease in their revenue under climate change conditions, so farmers would
    gain lower profit from each ha of their lands (economic objectives). In the pessimistic
    conditions, the net profit per ha decreased by 31, 68.5, and 42% in the agricultural
    regions of Mashhad, Chenaran, and Torgabeh-Shandiz, respectively. Regarding the
    objective of GHG emission minimization, energy consumption and irrigation water
    (environmental objectives) According to the results, Wicaksono and Kang (2019)
    and Mardani Najafabadi et al. (2019) decreased for all regions in all climatic
    scenarios. Regarding planning for crop cultivation, Forni et al. (2016) and Mahlknecht
    and Samadi-Foroushani et al. (2022) revealed that climate change and producers’
    goals played significant roles in selecting crops and their cultivation areas.
    Therefore, the cropping pattern was planned based on economic and environmental
    goals. Since crops play a key role in the food security of societies, arable lands
    will be impacted by climate change the most in the future and will limit food
    production in the world more than other resources (Emamzadeh et al. 2016). In
    light of the declining productivity of agricultural products due to changing weather
    conditions, it is crucial for policymakers and planners in the agricultural sector
    to give special consideration to climate change and its impact on crop yields.
    Based on the research done by Lawford et al. (2013) and Wolfert et al. (2017),
    implementing appropriate strategies for crop risk management can both mitigate
    the production risks faced by farmers and, with the provision of effective mechanisms
    for accurate climate change predictions, strategically stabilize crop production
    fluctuations (Samadi-Foroushani et al. 2022). One of the essential strategies
    for advancing the agricultural sector involved a government support policy directed
    toward enhancing water utilization efficiency and agricultural product performance.
    The implementation of this policy not only addresses the shortfall in agricultural
    production but also significantly benefits the income of farmers. One of the essential
    strategies for advancing the agricultural sector involved a government support
    policy directed toward enhancing water utilization efficiency and agricultural
    product performance. The implementation of this policy not only addresses the
    shortfall in agricultural production but also significantly benefits the income
    of farmers. From one perspective, given that the investigation of climate change
    is a topic that transcends regions, it is crucial to implement regional and sub-regional
    protocols at the country’s drainage basins. This will enable stakeholder groups
    to enhance their protection against climate change and make necessary preparations
    to counterbalance production fluctuations. These preparations might involve increasing
    imports, reducing exports, or, if needed, resorting to subsoil cultivation. Limitations
    Doing this study in the drainage basin required a substantial amount of data,
    which encountered significant obstacles in its acquisition. However, this model
    cannot present a comprehensive indicator that encompasses all potential elements
    and processes, focusing only on the primary components of water resources, energy
    resources, land use, food production, socio-economic factors, and CO2 emissions
    in isolation. The most significant constraint in modeling the interplay between
    water, food, and energy was the absence of information regarding supply–demand
    systems for both water and energy. In the studied region, several dams or reservoirs
    were present but not applicable for agricultural irrigation and power generation.
    Therefore, when examining the intricate connections between energy and water supply
    and demand, we only considered energy consumption for tasks such as water collection,
    pumping, transportation, and electricity generation for food processing, while
    we did not analyze water consumption in electricity generation within the context
    of the water-energy supply and demand process. Another constraint of this study
    within the food-energy supply–demand system is related to the utilization of waste
    generated from food production. Apart from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions,
    this waste can be used to generate electricity. This process results in the production
    of methane gas and biogas, which were not thoroughly investigated in the supply–demand
    system for energy and food due to data limitations. Policy Implications As previously
    described, Iran’s climate conditions create a situation where its agricultural
    industry heavily relies on irrigation for food production. This dependency is
    so substantial that, despite a relatively consistent annual cultivation area for
    rainfed and irrigated crops across the country, an average of 90% of agricultural
    products are derived from irrigated farming. Given these circumstances, the climatic
    repercussions resulting from droughts and excessive rainfall events can exert
    considerable influence, either positively or negatively, on Iran’s agricultural
    output and food security. To reduce their susceptibility to these factors, farmers
    must gain a sufficient understanding of these phenomena and align their practices
    accordingly. Consequently, educating farmers and stakeholders about climate change
    and its impact on water usage in the agricultural sector has a significant role
    in ensuring the nation’s food security (Kalbali et al. 2021). The climate changes
    affecting the Kashafrood drainage basin have posed a severe threat to the water
    resources in this area in terms of both supply and demand. Consequently, operational
    policies have been implemented with the goal of averting the detrimental consequences
    of rising temperatures, such as the expansion of greenhouse gases and measures
    like efficient water and energy resource management, as well as equitable resource
    allocation. These policies aim to safeguard the agricultural sector from the adverse
    effects of climate-related phenomena. Comprehending the WEF connection provides
    opportunities for improved planning, development, policy formulation, monitoring,
    and the evaluation of effectiveness. Consequently, it is crucial to highlight
    the establishment of this holistic approach at various levels, including local,
    regional, national, and educational programs. The current global and regional
    focus on this subject by the Nexuse Global Network underscores the potential for
    leveraging these experiences to accelerate and enhance education and the process
    of effective institutionalization. According to (Ding et al. 2023), using an efficient
    optimization model for the water–food–energy nexus assists decision-makers and
    stakeholders in a specific area in evaluating the shortcomings within the intricate
    relationships among the water, energy, and food sectors. Consequently, this enables
    them to make well-informed decisions that align with sustainable development for
    the integrated management of water, food, and energy resources. Suggested Improvements
    to this Work and Future Generally, modern energy production using agricultural
    residues is expected to play a vital role in agriculture, following the water–food–energy
    perspective. This aspect was not covered in this study and warrants further investigation
    in future research endeavors. Assessing the feasibility of using renewable energy
    sources, considering the unique potential of each region and employing advanced
    methods, not only aims to decrease the consumption of fossil fuels but also strives
    to ensure sustainability for future generations, ultimately resulting in a reduction
    in greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, incorporating renewable and non-renewable
    energy sources into future studies modeling the interconnection of water, food,
    and energy can contribute to reducing modeling inaccuracies. According to Cui
    et al. (2023), evaluating risks within the framework of the water–food–energy
    nexus under climate change scenarios using a fuzzy approach in irrigation networks
    will yield more precise and comprehensive outcomes. The analysis of research in
    this study highlights significant concerns expressed by water resource experts
    regarding the increasing demand for water in agriculture and the escalating pressures
    on freshwater sources worldwide due to heightened agricultural product demand
    and climate change impacts. Therefore, based on the findings from Cao et al.’s
    study in 2023, it is crucial to adopt a fresh perspective and employ a more comprehensive
    and effective measure or indicator, such as the water footprint, to accurately
    assess the actual water usage in agricultural product production. This is important
    for efficient and sustainable water management in agriculture and should be integrated
    into future studies examining the interconnectedness of water, food, and energy
    resources. The proposed model in this study was carried out under specific conditions.
    Thus, based on the research conducted by Mardani Najafabadi and Ashktorab (2022),
    to handle data uncertainty in the proposed model, it is feasible to utilize the
    robust optimization approach under uncertain circumstances, such as robust optimization
    (RO). This method establishes a framework that ensures that the solutions of non-deterministic
    models remain stable and optimal even when parameters change, and the problem
    remains complex (Shirzadi Laskookalayeh et al. 2022). Consequently, the model
    presented in this study is primarily suitable for comparing changes in water,
    food, and energy dynamics within agricultural production systems. Furthermore,
    this study did not investigate farmers’ adaptation strategies to climate change,
    but according to the findings of Kalbali et al. (2021), applying adaptation scenarios
    in hydro-economic models in drainage basin could provide valuable insights for
    future research. In this study, unlike the studies done by Li et al. (2019) and
    Nie et al. (2019), the modeling of the water–food–energy nexus was examined using
    a multi-objective mathematical programming method in an integrated manner. While
    other algorithms for solving multi-objective problems and fuzzy methods, such
    as metaheuristic algorithms, can be potentially employed in future studies. Additionally,
    the use of the water–food–energy nexus in different areas with hydroelectric power
    generation dams will be simulated separately in various climate scenarios through
    the WEAP_LEAP modeling. Therefore, the emphasis in this research is placed on
    the efficiency of the LEAP system being used in the analysis of the energy sector
    in future studies. Thus, it will be crucial to exploit them wisely. The implementation
    of the proposed WEF nexus pattern allowed farmers to emphasize environmental considerations,
    optimal and sustainable use of renewable resources, and the use of green energies
    in addition to economic incomes in selecting the best policy based on climate
    change. So, independent policymaking for water–food–energy systems and the environment
    will be incorrect and will have serious consequences for global communities. A
    policy will be sustainable if it is founded with the integrated framework of water–food–energy
    and the environment. In general, the lack of political solidarity and low resource
    productivity in the unidimensional approach have been effective in proposing and
    highlighting the nexus approach. To cope with improper unidimensional policies,
    this approach promotes sustainable and fair access to resources in addition to
    ensuring the simultaneous security of water–energy–food resources. Since the main
    cause of global and national challenges is the inefficiency and disorientation
    of water–food–energy systems, the policymaking and planning for sustainable development
    should be based on the integration of the nexus approach. In this regard, it is
    recommended to use the nexus approach as a new and effective solution for dealing
    with economic, environmental, and social problems of policymaking. Conclusions
    Since this basin is severely struggling with a water crisis and the depletion
    of groundwater tables on the one hand and the temperature rise and the decline
    in precipitation are the dominant phenomenon in the region on the other. This
    study calculated the amount of water allocated to the agricultural sector and
    crops yeild will be significantly affected by climate change in different scenarios
    in Kashfrud basin province from 2021 to 2040. Farming in the Kashafrud River drainage
    basin is heavily dependent on irrigation, and a rise in temperatures in this region
    directly results in increased energy and water usage for irrigation. Additionally,
    it indirectly causes disruptions in energy and water systems due to climate-related
    changes. As a result, applying the FEW (Food, Energy, Water) nexus patterns in
    the context of climate change not only decreases performance but also brings about
    a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases and the use of pesticides and
    fertilizers in the areas of Mashhad, Chenaran, and Torqabeh-e-Shandiz. Using this
    method and applying different scenarios has shown that the irrigation needs for
    products in the drainage basin have decreased by an average of 70%, while energy
    consumption has also been reduced by 40%. As a result, when this approach is applied
    to incorporate renewable resources into the production process, resource consumption
    will become more optimized compared to the current practice, leading to notable
    resource conservation. The cultivation area for crops in the basin experienced
    a moderate 53% reduction, leading to a 67% decrease in crop production. Broadly
    speaking, the research findings have indicated that the impact of diminishing
    water resources on crop yield or water sensitivity is far more pronounced than
    the influence of increasing usage and cultivation area. The cause for this situation
    stems from factors beyond just the significance of water as the primary resource
    for production. It also involves constraints on the capacity to boost energy usage
    and the utilization of groundwater, along with agricultural land expansion. Due
    to the constraints on water resources and their substantial influence on production,
    it is advisable to prioritize scenarios related to water management within the
    nexus framework of water–food–energy. Considering the water scarcity problem in
    Iran, especially in the Kashafrood drainage basin, which is known for having one
    of the most severe shortages of precipitation and groundwater resources, it presents
    a challenging task for researchers to address the need for increased water efficiency
    in this area. To tackle this issue effectively, a focus on proper water management,
    enhancing irrigation effectiveness, implementing water-saving practices, and optimizing
    water consumption becomes crucial. By adapting agricultural practices to prioritize
    environmental preservation, agricultural sustainability, self-sufficiency, and
    food security, it marks a significant step forward in coping with the impact of
    climate-related factors and decreasing rainfall in the country. Given the decrease
    in product output as per this approach, it is suggested that comprehensive food
    security for the community be ensured by means such as extraterrestrial cultivation
    or implementing a land improvement plan with careful implementation. Additionally,
    adopting a strategy of substituting cultivated crops or, in simpler terms, adjusting
    the crop selection according to the compatibility and resource utilization (such
    as water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides) considering the resource availability
    in each region helps safeguard the requirements of local communities. According
    to the results, it can be said that although temperature rise and precipitation
    decline are severely threatening the water resources of the basin in terms of
    supply and demand, policies to prevent the damages of the temperature rise, e.g.,
    the development of greenhouses, and measures for the optimal management of water
    and energy resources and their balanced allocation will significantly contribute
    to increasing farmers’ profits and reducing the costs of the negative effects
    of this phenomenon on the agricultural sector. Availability of Data and Materials

  description: The use of advanced resource conservation techniques is the need of
    time for higher crop production under the challenges of water scarcity and climate
    change. The present study was planned (1) to evaluate different plant spacing
    of corn, sown under raised bed planting (RBP) for higher productivity, (2) calibrate
    APSIM model for experimental treatments and (3) simulate future (2022–2100) crop
    response under different scenarios of climate change. The two-year research experiments
    were conducted on corn with four different plant spacings (S1:15 cm, S2:17.5 cm,
    S3:20 cm and S4:22.5 cm) under RBP. The crop response was evaluated in terms of
    leaf area index (LAI), plant height, flowering date, grains per cob, grain yield,
    biomass yield, harvest index (HI) and water productivity. The S1 treatment produced
    the highest productivity in terms of grain yield (7.16 Mg/hm2), biomass yield
    (16.57 Mg/hm2), HI (0.44) and water productivity (1.33 kg/m3). APSIM model was
    calibrated and its ability to simulate crop response during validation was confirmed
    from the values of RMSE, NRMSE, R2, CRM and NSE as 0.4, 0.21, 0.83, 0.04 and 0.68
    for grain yield. The RMSE and NRMSE were 0.79 and 0.14 for biomass yield. The
    value of R2 ranged from 0.69 to 0.85, CRM from –0.03 to 0.005, NSE from 0.69 to
    0.86 for biomass yield, plant height and LAI. During scenario simulations, the
    model run was performed against different plant spacing for optimization and results
    revealed that 10 cm plant spacing produced highest corn yield and growth parameters.
    Further simulations (2022–2100) were performed using climatic data, acquired from
    different general circulation model (GCMs) for two rcps (4.5 and 8.5) and results
    revealed the reduction in grain and biomass yields by 8–14 % and 10–28 %, respectively
    against different data sources (GCMs). Optimized plant spacing (10 cm) under RBP
    produced 35.5 % more grain yield and 29.3 % more biomass yield than that under
    control treatment (ridge-furrow system). Based on the research findings, it is
    recommended that conservation technique like RBP needs to be adopted in semi-arid
    regions to mitigate the impact of climate change in terms of future temperature
    rise for better corn production.

    model) 1. Introduction The global food demand is expected to be increased 80 %
    till mid-century (WB, 2020). With rising population, the world is facing the challenges
    to produce more food for ensuring the human food security and it is projected
    that the annual production of cereal crops must be enhanced at the rate of 2 %
    to meet this food demand (Ray et al., 2013). Water is the most influential identity
    in the agricultural sector, and it is crucial for food production. It is claimed
    that the 70 % of available fresh water is used in agriculture (FAO, 2012, Kiprutto
    et al., 2015). The limited global water resources are under huge pressure due
    to low water productivity of crops at farm level (Dhakal et al., 2015, Pastor
    et al., 2019). It is true to say that agriculture sector is both the cause and
    victor of water scarcity as a significant portion of irrigation water is loosed
    due to traditional agricultural practices and the cultivation is affected due
    to unavailability of required water for entire cultivable area (Hellin and Fisher,
    2019, Levidow et al., 2014). The problem of water scarcity is even more severe
    in most of the developing countries like Pakistan, having the huge potential for
    agricultural production subject to availability of water in required quantity
    to meet actual crop water needs (Makate et al., 2019). To prevent water losses,
    water conservation practices like raised bed planting (RBP) is the key to grow
    crop in better way with significant water saving compared with other surface irrigation
    methods (AbdelRahman and Arafat, 2020). The RBP technique has proved to be the
    best for raising field crops in specifically semi-arid regions of developing countries,
    where the other advanced sowing techniques i.e. drip irrigation and sprinkler
    irrigation have not been adopted yet at large scale (Peries et al., 2001). Under
    RBP, the water applies only in furrows and wetting of bed is allowed by lateral
    movement of water from furrows to beds; causing significance water saving due
    to less percolation but enough moisture is available in bed soil for proper crop
    growth (Jat et al., 2016). Compared with flood irrigation, RBP has potential to
    save irrigation water up to 40 % and produced up to 20 % more crop due to availability
    of favorable conditions for crop growth (Buttar et al., 2006, Hassan et al., 2005).
    The planting of high delda crops including corn under RBP is even more beneficial
    in terms of productivity than the crops with less water requirement (Ahmad et
    al., 2011, Khubna et al., 2021, Singh et al., 2017). Under RBP, bigger beds and
    wider furrows are preferred for corn sowing to receive more water for retaining
    enough moisture, but the management guidelines regarding plant spacing on wider
    beds need to be optimized for highest possible productivity under RBP. Corn is
    an important food crop that is not used only for human needs, but it is an important
    source of animal feed (Khaliq et al., 2008). Globally, it is a commercial crop
    with its several uses at subsistence level and it occupies 24 % of farmland that
    shows its demand all over the world (El Sabagh et al., 2020, Iqbal et al., 2017).
    The lower corn yield is the major concern of the day that is mostly due to the
    inappropriate sowing methods, irrigation practices and climate change effects,
    compromising the economic viability of existing production technologies and human’s
    food security (Ghosh et al., 2020). Overall, the behavior of corn is sensitive
    towards its production technology and field inputs, while the plant spacing is
    one of the influential factors, affects crop growth significantly (Ciampitti,
    2016, Haegele et al., 2014). The optimization of plant spacings is the key to
    get maximum corn growth with better marketable yield (Feng et al., 2019, Raza
    et al., 2019). The dense plant geometry of corn produces comparatively more yield
    than widely spaced crop but the optimum spacing should be clarified for higher
    production (Al-Naggar et al., 2015, Borghi et al., 2012). Researchers categorized
    plant spacing as prominent factor among other agronomic factors towards better
    corn growth (Haarhoff and Swanepoel, 2019, Jia et al., 2018a). Dias et al. analyzed
    different plant spacings and reported 71,000 plants per hectare as optimum density
    for better crop yield (Dias et al., 2019); whereas Gou et al. reported reduction
    in LAI with decrease in plant spacings after an optimum limit (Gou et al., 2017).
    The sowing methods and the irrigation applications are not the only factors that
    effects the corn production, but this crop is very much susceptible to climate
    change due to the sensitive response of existing genotypes towards weather effects
    (Mubeen et al., 2016). The element of climate change greatly affects the corn
    growth and yield, results gradual decrease in its productivity (Ahmad et al.,
    2019a; Bonelli et al., 2016; Hussain et al., 2016; Yasin et al., 2019). This phenomenon
    constitutes the threat of food security on a global scale (Ahmed et al., 2019).
    Huge variations in temperatures, shifting of sowing seasons and unpredicted rainfall
    patterns are affecting the crop growth in a serious way and the quality parameters
    are also being compromised due the adverse effects of climate change especially
    in arid to semi-arid regions (Abbas et al., 2017; Ahmad et al., 2019b; Shafqat
    et al., 2021; Ullah et al., 2019). The study regarding corn production under future
    climate prospects using crop models is essential to understand the future crop
    production for adopting conservation technologies to mitigate the adverse effects
    of climate change. The crop models are the tools used to identify the response
    of management techniques on crop agronomic behaviors and biomass production (Chauhdary,
    2018, Chauhdary et al., 2020, Chauhdary et al., 2019, Ragab, 2010, Ragab, 2002).
    These models are enough sophisticated to deal with varying environment factors
    and their impact on crops (Asseng et al., 2015, Saddique et al., 2020a, Saddique
    et al., 2020c, Saddique et al., 2020b). Different modules of these crop models
    help to check the sustainability of newly developed management practices in short
    and long-term future prospects (Aurbacher et al., 2013). The APSIM (Agricultural
    Production System Simulator) is versatile crop modeling tool with the furnished
    track history to simulate the diverse crop systems, optimal crop rotation, soil
    dynamics, environment impact responses (Carberry et al., 2002, Gaydon et al.,
    2017, Hochman et al., 2014, Keating et al., 2003, Robertson et al., 2002, Robertson
    and Lilley, 2016, Verburg and Bond, 2003, Whitbread et al., 2010). It is a comprehensive
    package with a system analysis approach for evaluating crop management practices
    in relation to soil-crop-water-environment nexus. APSIM analysis footprints follow
    the crop resource supply rather than crop resource demand, which make it different
    from most of the other crop models (McCown et al., 1996). The APSIM has ability
    to simulate the long-term soil dynamics associated with variable cropping practices
    and its impact on future crops (Holzworth et al., 2014). Different modules of
    APSIM allow user to establish detailed algorithm tree in simple ‘if-then-else’
    logic to account the necessary management decision, taken by the farmer to grow
    crops (Keating et al., 2003, Robertson et al., 2002). Reasonable research work
    on APSIM has been conducted in Australia and Africa, which is documented in well-established
    way but the use of APSIM in Asia is new and still research gaps regarding different
    aspects of APSIM are present for its development as per the Asian working condition.
    Therefore, the APSIM has been selected in present study to develop simulations
    led by its successful calibration. Via summarizing the above preview and discussion,
    the present study was planned with the objectives; (1) to evaluate the different
    plant spacings of corn, sown under RBP technique for higher productivity and (2)
    to calibrate APSIM model for experimental treatments followed by (3) scenario
    simulations for optimization of plant spacings, and corn response using future
    climatic data acquired from different GCMs (general circulation model) for assessing
    the long-term impact of climate change on corn in semi-arid regions of Asia. 2.
    Material and methods 2.1. Study area The field experiments were conducted in Faisalabad,
    having flat topography and the coordinates of 31.42 ºN, 73.08 ºE with 184 m ASL
    (Chauhdary et al., 2019). It represents mixed cropping zone of Punjab, Pakistan
    and almost all the major crops are being cultivated in the area. The corn is grown
    in two seasons; first called spring corn (February-May) and second called autumn
    corn (August-November). The experiments were conducted in the autumn seasons of
    two consecutive years (2020–2021). The study area having semi-arid conditions
    and receives mean annual rainfall of about 350 mm, out of which 70 % occurs in
    the third quarter of the calendar year (Ansari et al., 2019). The overall climate
    of the area is hot in summer and dry cold in winters with the mean temperature
    varied from 26.9 oC to 45.5 oC in summer and 4.1 oC to 19.4 oC in winter (Iqbal
    et al., 2023). The illustration of the study area is given in Fig. 1. Download

    Illustration of Study area. 2.2. Methodology of the study The overall framework
    of the methodology for the study is given in Fig. 2. The experiments were designed
    for different plant spacings of corn, sown under RBP to identify the crop response
    against each treatment. Secondary, the development of APSIM model was performed
    using the field data from the experiments. The model development was performed
    in a systematic way of execution including the steps of model parameterization,
    model simulations, model calibration and model validation. Simultaneously, the
    future climatic data was acquired from different GCMs and validated the same using
    data downscaling and bias corrections techniques to make it usable for model run.
    Lastly, the scenario simulations using APSIM were performed to optimize the different
    plant spacings and future crop response using the future climatic data acquired
    from different GCMs to draw the conclusion of the study. All the components of
    the methodology have been discussed in subsequence sections. Download : Download

    The raised bed planting (RBP) for different crops has been promoted by Water Management
    Research Centre, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad for last two decades due
    higher productivity of crops, sown on beds. The geometry of beds has recently
    been improved by increasing the size of bed and furrow to accommodate more water
    in furrow for retaining enough moisture in beds till the next irrigation. So,
    there was a need to optimize plant spacing for new bed geometry. Therefore, the
    experiments were designed for corn sowing with different plant spacings i.e. S1:
    15 cm, S2: 17.5 cm, S3: 20 cm and S4: 22.5 cm. The size of the bed was 75 cm and
    it was 45 cm for furrow. The description of crop geometry is shown in Fig. 3.
    The experiment was placed under randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four
    treatments and three replicates. The experimental treatments were T1: 15 cm plant
    spacing, T2: 17.5 cm plant spacing, T3: 20 cm plant spacing and T4: 22.5 cm plant
    spacing. There was a control treatment in which the corn was sown on ridges as
    per the farmer practices of study region for comparison purposes. The plant spacing
    on ridges under control treatment, having ridge-furrow sowing method, was 22.5 cm
    and the width of the ridge and furrow was 37.5 cm each. Download : Download high-res

    2.4. Crop production technology and irrigation scheduling The land was prepared
    using standard tillage procedures including one operation of rotavator, two operations
    of cultivator and one operation of planker. Prior to corn sowing in autumn season,
    the wheat crop was sown during spring season in 2020, whereas the field was fallow
    during the spring season of 2021. The fertilizers were applied during land preparation
    as a baser dose including 50 kg Urea, 100 kg of DAP (Diammonium phosphate), 50
    Kg SOP (Sulphate of potash). Later, the 100 kg of Urea was applied in splits during
    irrigation at crop development stages. The amount of fertilizer compounds (Urea,
    DAP and SOP) were calculated to meet the recommended doses of N:P:K for corn production
    in the study region (Chauhdary et al., 2017). The hybrid seed was used for crop
    sowing as recommended by many researchers (Chauhdary et al., 2019, Chauhdary et
    al., 2017, Konuskan et al., 2022). Crop was sown, when the enough moisture was
    present in the soil (Dehghanisanij et al., 2006). The sowing dates were 12th August
    2020 and 17 August 2021 and harvesting dates were 02nd December 2020 and 07th
    December 2021 in both seasons, respectively. The desired plant protection measures
    were adopted including all the applications of necessary weedicides and pesticides
    for proper plant growth. The irrigation was applied on weekly basis keeping in
    view the fixed irrigation rotation system of Punjab Pakistan, which allow farmers
    to get their irrigation turn after one week (Arshad and Oad, 2017). The irrigation
    depth was calculated using soil-based irrigation scheduling technique (Bakhsh
    and Malone, 2017, Chauhdary et al., 2019). The final volume of water applied was
    calculated using cut-throat flume, installed in field watercourse. Under control
    treatment, the fertilizer amount and the method to calculate irrigation requirement
    were the same but the net amount of water was unalike due to different sowing
    method. 2.5. Data collection and analysis As the crop model (APSIM) was used in
    this study, therefore a range of parameters regarding crop, soil and climate were
    measured. The climatic data was not used directly in experimentation, but it was
    used in model run and its calibration. The description of climatic data is given
    in subsequence sections. Soil samples were taken from four different locations
    in field at two depths (0–15 cm and 16–30 cm) to form a composite sample for identification
    of bulk density, soil texture using standard procedures (Chauhdary, 2018). The
    bulk density was also measured using separate samples, taken from three locations
    in the field, due to different protocols for analysis. The composite sample (0–30 cm
    depth) from field was analyzed in laboratory of Ayub Agriculture Research Institute
    (AARI) to check the fertility status (Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium) of
    the soil. As the conjunctive water from two different sources (canal water and
    tubewell water) was used for irrigation, therefore, water samples were taken from
    field water course for true representation and analyzed in laboratory to determine
    pH, hardness, EC, SAR and RSC. To measure crop parameters, 8–10 plants were tagged
    from every replication of each treatment after 25–30 days after sowing (DAS).
    Later, the average of these plants was used as a single value for each replicate.
    The crop parameters were leaf area index (LAI), plant height, flowering date,
    grains per cob, biomass yield and grain yield. The harvest index and water productivity
    were calculated using measured data. Later, this crop data was analyzed using
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and least significant difference (LSD) test
    at P < 0.05 to identify the significant influence of plant spacing on crop yield
    and growth parameters. The same techniques were adopted by other researchers,
    who conducted their research in same region (Bakhsh et al., 2018, Chauhdary et
    al., 2017, Chauhdary et al., 2015). 2.6. Climatic data and data downscaling The
    climate parameters were selected keeping in view the input data requirement of
    APSIM model. The selected climate parameters were maximum temperature (oC), minimum
    temperature (oC), rainfall (mm) and solar radiations (MJm-2d-1). The observed
    data was acquired from the observatories, installed at (1) University of Agriculture,
    Faisalabad (UAF) and (2) Ayub Agriculture Research Institute (AARI), Faisalabad.
    The duration of the observed data was from 1994 to 2022. Future climate data sets
    from general circulation models (GCMs) were acquired from the website of CMIP5
    project (Taylor et al., 2011). The GCM models were selected by considering the
    research work of other scientists regarding the reliability of model parameters
    in study area’s conditions (Haider et al., 2020, Xiao et al., 2020). These parameters
    are given in Table 1. Caesar et al. also reported reliability of these models
    for acquiring the climate data projects at high spatial resolution (Caesar et
    al., 2013). Each GCM has four rcps (representative concentration pathways), accounting
    for different trends of radiative forces for climate change. In current study,
    two rcps i.e. rcp 4.5 and rcp8.5 were selected as used in many other studies (Jones
    et al., 2013, Xiao et al., 2020). The recp4.5 represents the positive impact of
    effective control strategies to control the level of greenhouse gases (GHGs) while
    rcp8.5 shows the uncontrolled emission of GHGs and its gradual increase till the
    end of century (Jones et al., 2013). Table 1. The description of the selected
    GCMs. Sr# GCM Name Institution Country Spatial Resolution rcp 1 ACCESS1-3 CSIRO-BOM

    acquired from an GCM model need to be downscaled using observed data from field
    station to remove the biasness of satellite data (Haider et al., 2020). In current
    study, data downscaling was performed using distribution mapping (DM), which is
    efficient technique and recommended by many researchers for said purpose (Berg
    et al., 2012, Mbaye et al., 2016, Olsson et al., 2015, Tschöke et al., 2017).
    Climate Model Data for Hydrologic Modeling (CMhyd) software was used for DM, having
    the option to upload the GCM data directly in netCDF format. The historical climate
    data from observatories was used from 1994 to 2017. As per software guidelines,
    the CMhyd needs at least ten years of overlapping data with GCM data to downscale
    future climate data with precision. The downscaling was performed for each GCM
    under both rcps till 2100 to project refined datasets. 2.7. Model applications
    APSIM model is a daily time step simulator uses dynamic running algorithms to
    combine management and biophysical modules to simulate cropping system (Holzworth
    et al., 2014, Keating et al., 2003). The model has the ability to simulate the
    interaction of moisture, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous in soil with crop growth.
    It incorporates the daily climatic data, field management practices and stresses
    in the cropping system to provide the true picture of crop behavior under real
    field conditions. APSIM has recently been used and developed for corn simulation
    using the experimentation from twelve countries across the Asia (India, Pakistan,
    Bangladesh, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Japan, Cambodia, China, Laos, Bhutan, Philippines
    and Nepal) (Konuskan et al., 2022, Xiao et al., 2020). The model has the ability
    to simulate more than twenty crops including corn. Now some newly developed built-in
    data sets have been incorporated in model modules but still there is need to test
    model under variable management scenarios coupled with climate change. APSIM requires
    climatic data (rainfall, upper and lower temperature limits, radiation) on daily
    basis. Several soil parameters are required by APSIM to develop simulation; some
    of them are recommended to be measured in field while some are available in model
    databases to run a simulation. 2.8. Model calibration and evaluation The process
    to minimize the difference between the simulated results and the measured values
    of different crop parameters using same field conditions is called calibration.
    It is done by adjusting those input parameters during model run, which were taken
    from literature without changing the measured parameters (Chauhdary et al., 2020).
    In the present study, the model calibration was done using field data taken in
    2020 season. During calibration, the fine tuning of the parameters was done using
    comprehensive knowledge of cultivar (crop phenology, growing stages, crop physiology
    and morphology), soil (soil type, soil moisture and salts, soil nutrients) and
    climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall etc.). After successful calibration,
    the next step is to validate the model. Validation means the model run for other
    season using the same values of input parameters, which were taken from literature
    and finalized during calibration process. In current study, the model validation
    was performed for next year crop data (2021). The accuracy of the model calibration
    as well the validation was examined using statistical indicators, recommended
    by other researchers for crop models (Ahmed et al., 2016, Bakhsh et al., 2004,
    Chauhdary et al., 2020, Loague and Green, 1991, Rahman et al., 2018, Soler et
    al., 2007, Yasin et al., 2022). These indicators included R2 (Coefficient of determination),
    RMSE (Root mean square error), NRMSE (Normalized root mean square error), %D (Percentage
    of difference), CRM (coefficient of residual mass) and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency).
    The R2 (Eq. 1) refers to the proportion of variation in observed values that is
    assessed by predicted values. Its value is assed to be best as near as possible
    to one. The cumulative difference between predicted and observed values was determined
    by RMSE and NRMSE using Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 respectively, whereas, the absolute difference
    was determined by %D using Eq. 4. In general, the over or under estimation of
    the model was checked by CRM using Eq. 5 and “NSE” using Eq. 6. (1) (2) (3) (4)
    (5) (6) In Eq. 3-8; ‘Pi’ is the predicted value, ‘Pavg’ is the average of all
    predicted values ‘Oi’ is the observed value, ‘Oavg’ is the average of all observed
    values and “n” is number of observations. 2.9. Scenario simulations After successful
    calibration and the validation of APSIM, the scenario simulations were performed
    in two steps. In first step, model run was performed to simulate the crop response
    under varying plant spacings ranged from 5 cm to 27.5 cm (5 cm, 7.5 cm, 10 cm.
    12.5 cm, 15 cm, 17.5 cm, 20 cm, 22.5 cm, 25 cm, 27.5 cm) to optimize it for highest
    economical crop output. In second step, future scenarios (2022–2100) were simulated
    for control treatment and best performing plant spacing under RBP, using climatic
    data from five GCMs. For future scenarios, only climatic data of GCMs was used
    whereas, the values of the input parameters were kept same as finalized during
    the calibration process. 3. Results and discussion Daily weather conditions during
    both years of experiment period are illustrated in Fig. 4. The daily temperature
    varied from 45.33 OC to 2.17 OC during the crop period of 2020 and it was 42.73
    OC to 5.05 OC in 2021. The annual rainfall was 523 mm in 2020 and 304 mm in 2021.
    Moreover, there was no rainfall (0.4 mm) during the crop period in 2020 than that
    in 2021 (84 mm). Although the temperature range was almost similar during both
    years, but it can be assessed from rainfall data that 2021 was the dry year compared
    with 2020 that ultimately affected crop yield. Download : Download high-res image

    during the crop seasons of 2020 and 2021. The analyzed results of irrigation water
    showed that the water had the marginal quality for irrigation purposes with the
    value of EC equaled to 2.3, SAR equaled to 17.2 and RSC equaled to 4.2. The detail
    of water analysis results is given in Table 2. Soil samples were also analyzed
    to determine the physical and chemical properties. The results revealed that the
    soil of the experiment plot was sandy loam with an average bulk density of 1.54
    (g/cm3). The soil was less fertile with the values of nitrogen equaled to 12 mg/kg,
    phosphorous equaled to 2.2 mg/kg and potassium equaled to 0.5 mg/kg (Table 2).
    These results are in accordance with the findings of other researchers (Chauhdary
    et al., 2017, Waqas et al., 2021), who conducted their research at same experiment

    of growth parameters The leaf area index (LAI), plant height and flowering date
    of corn were monitored as growth parameters. The LAI was varied from 2.67 to 3.40
    under different treatments. Minor variation in LAI was observed under closely
    varying plant spacings but it was significant among the highly different plant
    spacing. The value of LAI was 3.40 under S1 treatment that was non-significant
    with the same under S2 (3.30). S3 produced 3.00 LAI which was significant from
    S1 but non-significant with S2, S4 (2.67) and control treatment (2.68). The same
    relation of higher LAI of corn under dense plant spacings was observed and reported
    by (Djaman et al., 2022, Timlin et al., 2014a, Timlin et al., 2014b) but these
    finding are contradicted with the results of (Jia et al., 2018b) who reported
    inverse behavior of corn for producing more LAI under less or medium plant spacing
    (20–25 cm). The plant height was lower under dense plant spacing compared with
    the treatments with wide spacings. Significantly, the highest plant height was
    produced by S4 (275 cm), having widest plant spacing (22.5 cm) among all treatments
    with raised beds, followed by S3 (267 cm), control treatment (265 cm), S2 (260 cm)
    and S1 (251 cm). The higher plant height under broader plant spacing was due to
    the fact of the availability of more nutrient and input resources to individual
    plants with less competition among them (Yang et al., 2017). These findings are
    in contrast with the results of (Bernhard and Below, 2020, Djaman et al., 2022),
    who reported less plant height under dense plant geometry of corn with same production
    system. The results regarding plant height are different with the findings of
    (Irmak and Djaman, 2016a), who reported no significant effect of plant spacing
    on plant height. S4 treatment had significantly higher plant height than control
    treatment but the height under S2 and S3 was non-significantly with control while
    the was significantly higher under control than S1. The higher plant height under
    RBP with corresponding plant spacings under ridge-furrow system has also been
    reported by other researchers (Ahmad et al., 2007). The reasons behind the monitored
    trend regarding plant heights under varying plant densities was the same that
    higher crop densities effected the availability of input resources for proper
    plant growth to establish its height (Yang et al., 2017). Any significant effect
    on the flowering date was not observed under the treatments with different plant
    spacings. Irmak and Djaman conducted two-year field experiment on corn in Nebraska
    and reported the same phenomenon regarding flowering dates (Irmak and Djaman,
    2016a). The results of corn growth parameters are given in Table 3. 3.1.2. Response
    of yield parameters By comparing the different plant densities under raised bed
    planting, it was found that the yield parameters were being increased directory
    proportional toward the dense crop geometry but the difference in the yield parameters
    was started to be squeezed as the density increased to 15 cm plant spacing. This
    phenomenon represents the production potential of the unit area of cultivable
    land. The increase plant geometry can produce higher yield due to a greater number
    of cob up to an optimum limit but beyond that limit, the yield starts to be decreased
    due to the resource competition among plants (Chim et al., 2014). The highest
    grain was produced under S1 (7.46 Mg/hm2) that is significantly higher than that
    produced by S2 (6.89 Mg/hm2), S3 (6.25 Mg/hm2), S4 (5.55 Mg/hm2) and control treatment
    (5.33 Mg/hm2) (Table 3). The further perusal of the data revealed the inverse
    trend in case of per cob grains production, compared with total grain yield regarding
    different plant spacings. It was due to enough availability of input resources
    (sun light, fertilizer and moisture etc.) for individual plant growth under greater
    plant spacing compared with that under less plant spacing. But due to a smaller
    number of plants per unit area under wider plant spacings, the per hectare grain
    yield was lower under wider plant spacings compared with that under dense plant
    spacings (Berhan, 2020, Golla, 2018). Similarly, other researchers (Maddonni and
    Martínez-Bercovich, 2014) reported more yield under dense cultivation of corn.
    The interception in evapotranspiration efficiency has been reported as another
    potential reason for lowering the yield potential of corn beyond optimum limit
    of plant density (Barbieri et al., 2012, Jiang et al., 2014). The biomass produced
    by S1 (16.57 Mg/hm2) was the highest but non-significant with S2 (15.37 Mg/hm2).
    Similarly, the same produced by S2 was non-significant with S3 (13.86 Mg/hm2)
    but significantly higher than S4 (12.32 Mg/hm2) and control treatment (12.40 Mg/hm2).
    The output regarding biomass was significantly the same under S3, S4 and control.
    The reasons behind this phenomenon were the same as explained by (Barbieri et
    al., 2012, Chim et al., 2014, Jiang et al., 2014). The harvest index was slightly
    increased with lowering plant spacing but the effect was non-significant among
    all treatments. The value of HI was 0.443 under S1 and S2, whereas, it was 0.451
    under S3, 0.449 under S4 and 0.430 under control treatment. These findings are
    in agreement with the results of (Barbieri et al., 2012). The grain yield produced
    by the corresponding plant spacing under RBP was higher than that under ridge
    sowing. The S1, S2, S3 and S4 treatments produced 28.6 %, 22.6 %, 14.7 % and 4.0
    % more yield than that under control treatment (ridge-furrow system). Overall,
    the average increase under RBP treatments was 18.5 % compared with control treatment
    (ridge-furrow system). The higher corn yield under RBP has also been reported
    by other researchers (Ahmad and Mahmood, 2005, Buttar et al., 2006, Irfan et al.,
    2009, Konuskan et al., 2022, Shahid et al., 2011). 3.1.3. Response of irrigation
    parameters The amount of irrigated water was same (non-significant) under all
    the treatments with RBP, which was 14 % less than that under control treatment
    (ridge-furrow system). The reported water saving under RBP was the same as stated
    by other researchers (Buttar et al., 2006, Chauhdary et al., 2016, Rizwan et al.,
    2018). The water productivity under varying plant spacings i.e. S1, S2, S3 and
    S4, was varied from 1.00 to 1.33 kg/m3 (Table 3). The highest water productivity
    was produced by S1 (1.33 kg/m3) followed by S2 (1.23 kg/m3), S3 (1.12 kg/m3),
    S4 (1.00 kg/m3) and control treatment (0.83 kg/m3). These findings are in accordance
    with the work of (Djaman et al., 2022). These results are also in contrast with
    the findings of (Irmak and Djaman, 2016a),who reported 2.27 to 2.81 kg/m3 productivity
    of corn under varying plant densities. The same trend of water productivity for
    semi-arid region has also been reported by (Ren et al., 2016), whose results ranged
    from 1.81 to 1.2.19 kg/m3. Jia (Jia et al., 2018a) reported similar behavior of
    corn water productivity for different plant spacings. The comparison of grain
    yield and water productivity can be seen in Fig. 5. Download : Download high-res

    and validation The calibration process was performed only for treatments under
    raised bed planting due to their better performance against traditional ridge-furrow
    system. The range of calibration values and final calibrated values of model parameters
    and coefficients are given in Table 4, which were used in model calibration. As
    the same values of model parameters cannot be used for all regions and cultivars
    (Ahmed et al., 2016), therefore, these calibrated values could be helpful for
    model simulations regarding corn crop in semi-arid regions of Asia. Table 4. Model

    1 (Critical Photoperiod 1) 25 10–25 Grain yield is the major parameter for crop
    output, that was considered for model calibration. The actual value of final crop
    yield was compared with the simulated value and a good agreement was observed
    with the values of RMSE, NRMSE, R2, CRM and NSE as 0.4, 0.18, 0.87, –0.04 and
    0.76, respectively. The biomass was the second yield parameters which was considered
    and the calibration results were good as grain yield with the values of 0.62,
    0.13, 0.88, 0.01 and 0.87 for RMSE, NRMSE, R2, CRM and NSE, respectively. Two
    growth parameters including plant height and LAI were selected and the data was
    collected four times during different time steps of the crop period. The performance
    evaluation was accomplished on final value of plant height and LAI during harvesting
    period. The evaluation proved the accuracy of calibration process with the values
    of RMSE as 8.90 (plant height) and 0.29 (LAI), NRMSE as 0.24 (plant height) and
    0.22 (LAI), R2 as 0.88 (plant height) and 0.78 (LAI), CRM as –0.03 (plant height)
    and 0.01 (LAI), NSE as 0.65 (plant height) and 0.89 (LAI). After the successful
    calibration, the model run was performed for validation using calibrated values
    of model parameters and the field crop data from second year (autumn 2021). The
    performance evaluation was done on same parameters, as used in calibration process.
    The results of validation process were good enough with the value of RMSE, NRMSE,
    R2, CRM and NSE as 0.4, 0.21, 0.83, 0.04 and 0.68 for grain yield. The RMSE and
    NRMSE were 0.79 and 0.14 for biomass yield. The value of R2 ranged from 0.69 to
    0.87, CRM ranged from –0.03 to 0.005, NSE ranged from 0.69 to 0.86 for biomass
    yield, plant height and LAI. The simulated results regarding plant height and
    LAI were compared with the measured values and are illustrated in Fig. 6. The
    quantitative results of validation process are given in Table 5. showing perfect
    agreement between measured and simulated values of selected crop parameters. These
    results proved the ability of APSIM model to accurately simulate the change trend
    of corn yield under different production schemes in semi-arid regions of Asia.

    on the range of dataset. Keeping in view the range of given dataset, the values
    of RMSE for both calibration and validation were small enough for acceptance.
    NRMSE is the advanced indicator used to incorporate the factor of data range with
    its deviation. The values of NRMSE were in accordance with the results of other
    studies (Daliakopoulos et al., 2016, Feleke et al., 2021, Ren et al., 2016). The
    negative value of CRM during calibration and validation process represents the
    under-estimation of model simulations compared with observed data but the values
    are so small and could be considered invalid. One of the potential reasons for
    this underestimation could be the variations in actual daily evapotranspiration
    rate as explained by other researchers (Balwinder-Singh et al., 2011, Pagano and
    Maddonni, 2007). The values of R2 and NSE are considered to be acceptable above
    0.50 (Moriasi et al., 2007). The calibration and validations results showed that
    the range of R2 and NSE is above the defined limit so the authenticity of the
    model development must be considered good for further scenario simulations (Chauhdary,
    2018, Chauhdary et al., 2020, Chauhdary et al., 2019, Gaydon et al., 2017). 3.3.
    Data downscaling of climatic parameters The historical climatic data (1994–2019)
    from GCMs was compared with the observed data and illustrated in taylor diagram
    (Fig. 7). An ambiguous pattern was observed between observed and downloaded data
    from different GCMs. ACCESS and HadGEM-CC showed better results regarding precipitation
    among all GCMs; whereas, HadGEM-CC seemed to be less efficient for solar radiation
    but the ACCESS also showed better results for solar radiation. Download : Download

    results of downscaling technique; (a) precipitation, (b) solar radiations, (c)
    maximum temperature, (d) minimum temperature. However, downscaling was performed
    using distribution mapping technique and the future climate data for different
    GCMs was acquired. The summary of climatic data from GCMs for different parameters
    after correction through downscaling is given in supplementary material. The trends
    of future climate change under both rcps (rcp4.5 and rcp 8.5) can be categorized
    as haphazard from 2022 to 2100. The precipitation under rcp4.5 started from 585
    mmy-1 and reached to 502 mmy-1 for ACCESS. Similarly, under different GCMs, the
    precipitation started from high and moved towards low through periodic fluctuations
    (inner and outer) from 2022 to 2100. The final reduction in precipitation from
    2022 to 2100 was observed as 16 % (rcp4.5) and 1.8 % (rcp8.5) under ACCESS, 13
    % (rcp4.5) and 20 % (rcp8.5) under bcc-csm, 19 % (rcp4.5) and 13 % (rcp8.5) under
    MPI-ESM, 26 % (rcp4.5) and 19 % (rcp8.5) under IPSL-CM5A-MR, 3.5 % (rcp4.5) and
    37 % (rcp8.5) under HadGEM2-CC. Minor fluctuations were observed in decade mean
    values of solar radiations (Fig. 8), acquired from each GCM. The predicted solar
    radiation was lower under ACCESS for both scenarios (rcp4.5 and rco8.5) followed
    by the same under HadGEM2 for both scenarios (rcp4.5 and rco8.5), compared with
    other GCMs. The temporal trend of solar radiation can be seen in Fig. 8. Opposite
    to precipitation, the final increase in solar radiations from 2022–2100 was observed
    as 5.5 % (rcp4.5) and 6.2 %(rcp8.5) under ACCESS, 0.4 % (rcp4.5) and 0.9 % (rcp8.5)
    under bcc-csm, 3.3 % (rcp4.5) and 1.3 % (rcp8.5) under MPI-ESM, 1.3 % (rcp4.5)
    and 1.8 % (rcp8.5) under IPSL-CM5A-MR, 19.6 % (rcp4.5) and 16 % (rcp8.5) under

    after downscaling. A gradual temporal increase in the case of maximum and minimum
    temperature with minor fluctuations was observed (Fig. 8). The impact of climate
    change can easily be assessed from the increasing trend of maximum and minimum
    temperatures. The maximum and minimum temperature varied from 21.5 oC to 36.8 oC
    and 14.7 oC to 23.4 oC, respectively during the baseline period (2022); that increased
    27.9 oC to 40.1 oC and 16.5 oC to 27.8 oC, respectively at the end of century
    (2100). The increase in maximum and minimum temperatures were 9.4 % (rcp4.5) to
    17.1 % (rcp8.5) and 11.4 % (rcp4.5) to 22.9 % (rcp8.5), respectively under ACCESS,
    0.3 % (rcp4.5) to 8.9 % (rcp8.5) and 6.8 % (rcp4.5) to 17.7 % (rcp8.5), respectively
    under bcc-csm, 4.3 % (rcp4.5) to 12.5 % (rcp8.5) and 5.6 % (rcp4.5) to 18.8 %
    (rcp8.5), respectively under MPI-ESM, 4.5 % (rcp4.5) to 15.4 % (rcp8.5) and 11.8
    % (rcp4.5) to 32.7 % (rcp8.5), respectively under IPSL-CM5A-MR and 19 % (rcp4.5)
    to 31.9 % (rcp8.5) and 12.2 % (rcp4.5) to 34.8 % (rcp8.5), respectively under
    HadGEM2-CC. 3.4. Scenario simulation regarding impact of future climate change
    on corn production Crop simulations model are effective tools to simulate the
    different scenarios in present and future aspects to understand the crop behavior
    under varying input and climatic conditions (Adam et al., 2011, Chauhdary, 2018,
    Chauhdary et al., 2019). As the testing of treatments regarding a variety of plant
    spacings for its optimization is difficult in field, therefore, model simulations
    were performed under varying plant spacings ranged from 5 cm to 27.5 cm (5 cm,
    7.5 cm, 10 cm. 12.5 cm, 15 cm, 17.5 cm, 20 cm, 22.5 cm, 25 cm, 27.5 cm) for highest
    economical crop productivity. Model simulations showed that the grain and the
    biomass yields were 7.06 Mg/hm2 and 15.41 Mg/hm2 under 5 cm plant spacing; 7.77
    Mg/hm2 and 16.83 Mg/hm2 under 7.5 cm plant spacing; 8.14 Mg/hm2 and 17.48 Mg/hm2
    under 10 cm plant spacing; 7.99 Mg/hm2 and 17.01 Mg/hm2 under 12.5 cm plant spacing;
    7.19 Mg/hm2 and 15.57 Mg/hm2 under 15 cm plant spacing; 6.61 Mg/hm2 and 14.21
    Mg/hm2 under 17.5 cm plant spacing; 5.97 Mg/hm2 and 12.71 Mg/hm2 under 20 cm plant
    spacing; 5.27 Mg/hm2 and 11.12 Mg/hm2 under 22.5 cm plant spacing; 4.45 Mg/hm2
    and 9.30 Mg/hm2 under 25 cm plant spacing; 3.66 Mg/hm2 and 7.58 Mg/hm2 under 27.5 cm
    plant spacing. A gradual increase in grain and biomass yields was observed with
    decrease in plant spacing from 27.5 cm to 10 cm, while this phenomenon started
    to behave inversely beyond 10 cm spacing towards lesser plant spacings. The results
    are in accordance with the findings of Djaman et al. (Djaman et al., 2022), who
    stated that the potential of the unit cultivable land can accommodate and support
    the growth of limited number of plants. Beyond that limit, the plant growth is
    started to be affected, results lower crop yield. Other researcher found the scarcity
    of input resources (sun light, fertilizer and moisture etc.) as potential reason
    to not support extensive dense crop geometries (Maddonni and Martínez-Bercovich,
    2014). Liu et al. categorized the reasons behind the yield reduction under extensive
    corn density and referred the sunlight as the top influential factor (Liu et al.,
    2016). The illustration of yield components under different plant spacings and
    associated correlation functions can be seen in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res

    of crop parameters under different plant spacings during scenario simulation.
    Similar to yield component, the LAI was the highest under 10 cm plant spacing
    while it was approximately same under 12.5 cm treatment. The values of LAI were
    started to be lowered gradually with the decrease in plant spacing. The illustration
    of simulated LAI under different plant spacing can be seen in Fig. 9. The behavior
    of plant height was different than LAI as it decreased continuously with decrease
    in plant spacings until 2 cm. The trends in LAI and the plant height prove the
    research findings of Timlin et al., who reported that the corn growth parameters
    are dependent on plant density (Timlin et al., 2014a, Timlin et al., 2014b). However,
    these findings are contradicting from the work of Imran and Djaman, who reported
    non-significant difference among corn growth parameters under different plant
    densities (Irmak and Djaman, 2016b). Research work of other scientists supported
    our results by narrating the decrease in LAI with dense cropping over an optimum
    limit (Borrás et al., 2003, Liu et al., 2016). In second part of scenario simulation,
    the corn yield (grain yield and biomass yield) was simulated using future climate
    data for 10 cm plant spacing, being a best performing treatment during optimization
    for given geometry of RBP under semi-arid conditions. Simulations were developed
    for climatic data, acquired from each GCM (ACCESS, bcc-csm, MPI-ESM, IPSL-CM5A-MR
    and HadGEM2-CC) to incorporate every aspect of climate behavior. Moreover, model
    run was also performed for control treatment using same future climate data to
    compare it with 10 cm plant spacing under RBP. The detail of crop response is
    given in Table 6. The illustration of crop behavior under RBP treatment and percent
    changes in yield parameters are shown in Fig. 10. Table 6. Simulated grain yield

    from 8.3 % (rcp4.5) to 13.8 % (rcp8.5), 1.2 % (rcp4.5) to 4.9 % (rcp8.5), 1.6
    % (rcp4.5) to 7.9 % (rcp8.5), 5.9 % (rcp4.5) to 16.6 % (rcp8.5) under bcc-csm,
    MPI-ESM, IPSL-CM5A-MR and HadGEM2-CC, respectively. By comparing the base period
    (2022–2030) with far-future period (2090–2100), it can be revealed that the reduction
    in corn biomass will be 2.8 % (rcp4.5) to 12.4 % (rcp8.5) under bcc-csm, 0.5 %
    (rcp4.5) to 12.9 % (rcp8.5) under MPI-ESM, 2.4 % (rcp4.5) to 23.1 % (rcp8.5) under
    IPSL-CM5A-MR and 19.2 % (rcp4.5) to 14.6 % (rcp8.5) HadGEM2-CC. The average reduction
    in grain yield was determined as 5.72 % under rcp4.5 % and 11.32 % under rcp8.5.
    Similarly, the average reduction in biomass yield was identified as 7.78 % under
    rcp4.5 % and 13.84 % under rcp8.5. Moreover, long term simulations (2022–2030)
    under different climate scenarios revealed the average increase in grain (33.5
    %) and biomass (29.3 %) yields under the RBP treatment with 10 cm plant spacing
    as compared with that under control treatment (ridge-furrow system) (Table 6).
    The box plot represent the yield parameters in better way by explaining the lowest
    extreme (Q0), lower quartile (Q25 %), median quartile (Q50 %), upper quartile
    (Q75 %) and upper extreme (Q100 %) (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). The sowing dates in APSIM
    module was selected as variable (not fixed) to form a realistic sowing scheme
    for corn in future scenarios; therefore, the sowing period of corn was being changed
    as per the sowing conditions that ultimately changed the cropping period and degree
    days (Tao et al., 2017). The temperature increase could also be a potential reason
    to reduce crop yield due to change in crop degree days (Asseng et al., 2015).
    Xiao described another aspect of temperature increase that it effects the development
    period of growth stages of a crop by early accordance of flowering and maturity
    stage that cause potential decrease in yield parameters (Xiao et al., 2013, Xiao
    and Tao, 2016). Although, the increase in solar radiations and CO2 level can enhance
    the efficiency of photosynthesis process that is beneficial for corn health (Kheir
    et al., 2019, Xiao and Tao, 2016), but due to the negative impact of temperature
    increase, the overall reduction in crop yield was observed (Li et al., 2011; Wu
    et al., 2021). Other researcher also reported decrease in corn yield under the
    impact of climate change (Tao and Zhang, 2011). Lizaso (Lizaso et al., 2018) reported
    that corn yield can seriously be affected by heat stress (due to temperature raise)
    during silking stage that effects the grain formation. Due to early maturity,
    the grain development in terms of size and quality is affected and cause reduction
    in final yield (Hatfield and Prueger, 2015). Srivastava (Srivastava et al., 2021)
    also reported decrease in corn yield under irrigated conditions till the end of
    2080 due to temperature rise but interestingly, the yield was enhanced under rainfed
    conditions due to mitigating the negative impact of temperature rise by the occurrence
    of more precipitation. Keeping in view the future trends of corn yield under changing
    climate scenarios and the importance of irrigation in irrigated regions, effective
    irrigation management can be used to mitigate the negative effect of higher temperature
    for better crop production (WANG et al., 2023). Therefore, the importance of water
    saving techniques like RBP and high efficiency irrigation systems is increased
    for future agricultural development. The potential of RPB for corn production
    has been proved in this study in comparison to traditional ridge-furrow sowing
    system. Therefore, this cultivation system should be adopted in future for better
    production in varying environmental conditions under the impact of climate change.

    image Fig. 12. Box-plot representation of biomass yield, produced under different
    climate scenarios. The research work has some limitations regarding the applications
    of GCMs for determining future values of climatic parameters. Each GCM has its
    own algorithm for determining future values of climatic parameters, but each GCM
    has limitations regarding perfect simulation of future climate. Therefore, researchers
    recommended to use multiple GCMs to overcome this uncertainty (Dixit et al., 2018,
    Liu et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2019). The reviewer can ask to explain the use
    of limited number of GCMs but it can be explained that all the selected GCMs were
    recommended by researchers for semi-arid conditions (Haider et al., 2020, Xiao
    et al., 2020). Another limitation involved in such studies is to not portrait
    the accurate picture of actual crop response by crop models under different environmental
    scenarios (Asseng et al., 2019). The said risk in this study was controlled by
    efficient calibration of the mode with respect to local environmental and input
    conditions. The efficiency of the model was assessed by performance indicators
    that showed acceptable values for model predictions regarding different crop growth
    and yield parameters. Other researchers (Chen et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2012,
    Xiao and Tao, 2016) also reported the reliable efficacy of APSIM model for development
    of future scenarios subject to the accurate model calibration. 4. Conclusion and
    recommendations To study the potential of raised bed planting (RBP) and effect
    of different plant spacings, experiments were conducted on corn, sown under RBP
    with different plant spacings (S1:15 cm, S2:17.5 cm, S3:20 cm and S4:22.5 cm).
    S1 produced highest productivity in terms of grain yield (7.46 Mg/hm2), biomass
    yield (16.57 Mg/hm2), HI (0.443) and water productivity (1.33 kg/m3). Overall,
    RBP produced 18.5 % more yield and saved 14 % irrigation water compared with that
    under control treatment (ridge-furrow system). In second part of the study, calibration
    and validation of APSIM was performed using experiment data and the accuracy of
    calibration process was assessed from the fact that the values of performance
    indicators including RMSE, NRMSE, R2, CRM and NSE were satisfactory as 0.40, 0.21,
    0.83, 0.041 and 0.68 during model validation for grain yield. In third part, scenario
    simulations were performed to see the crop response under varying plant spacings
    ranged from 5 cm to 27.5 cm (5 cm, 7.5 cm, 10 cm. 12.5 cm, 15 cm, 17.5 cm, 20 cm,
    22.5 cm, 25 cm, 27.5 cm) for its optimization. The results revealed that 10 cm
    plant spacing produced highest grain yield (8.14 Mg/hm2), biomass yields (17.48
    Mg/hm2) and LAI (5.08). After identification of best performing plant spacing
    (10 cm), future simulations were performed for this optimized plant spacing using
    climate data from different GCMs (ACCESS, bcc-csm, MPI-ESM, IPSL-CM5A-MR and HadGEM2-CC),
    while the values of model input parameters were kept same as finalized during
    the calibration process. The simulation results revealed the average reduction
    in grain yield as 5.72 % (rcp4.5) and 11.32 % (rcp8.5). Similarly, the reduction
    in biomass yield was determined as 7.78 % (rcp4.5) and 13.84 % (rcp8.5). Optimized
    plant spacing (10 cm) under RBP produced 35.5 % more grain yield and 29.3 % more
    biomass yield than that under control treatment (ridge-furrow system). Keeping
    in view the future trends of corn yield under changing climate scenarios and the
    significance of RBP for crop productivity, it is recommended that conservation
    technique like RBP with optimal corn density (plant spacings) needs to be adopted
    in semi-arid regions of Asia to mitigate the impact of climate change in terms
    of future temperature rise for better corn production. Funding source The research

    Cryptosporidium is a known causative agent of infectious diarrhoea, affecting
    human and animal populations worldwide (Gururajan et al., 2021; Ryan et al., 2014).
    It has been documented as the primary etiological agent of 63 % of 239 waterborne
    outbreaks reported in 2017 (Efstratiou et al., 2017). It is considered a significant
    concern in the food production industry worldwide as it is associated with over
    eight million annual cases of foodborne diseases (Ahmed and Karanis, 2018; Ryan
    et al., 2018). Diarrhoeal diseases were the cause of mortality in nearly 1.5 million
    cases in 2019, of which half were children (Dattani et al., 2023). Of the 44 species
    and over 120 valid genotypes of Cryptosporidium reported globally, 21 species
    and genotypes have been documented in humans, with C. hominis and C. parvum being
    the most frequent species, accounting for over 90 % of the infection cases (Li
    et al., 2020; Ryan et al., 2021). C. andersoni, C. ubiquitum, C. meleagridis,
    C. muris, and C. cuniculus are among the other pathogenic species in humans, and
    they are responsible for the sporadic emergence of zoonotic outbreaks, mainly
    due to direct contact with infected animals (Ahmed and Karanis, 2020). Cryptosporidium
    oocysts can be transmitted directly or indirectly via contact with infected hosts
    or contaminated sources, typically through the faecal-oral route (Putignani and
    Menichella, 2010). Notably, ingestion of a single oocyst can potentially cause
    infection (Carmena, 2010; Messner and Berger, 2016). The faecal-oral transmission
    modes of Cryptosporidium include the following: • Person-to-person contact. •
    Contact with infected animals. • Consumption of contaminated food. • Consumption
    of contaminated water (e.g., drinking, and recreational water). Cryptosporidium
    infection leads to mild and severe diarrhoea and several gastrointestinal symptoms
    by interfering with barrier function and absorption capability. The disease is
    mild and self-limiting in immunocompetent adults (Marcos and Gotuzzo, 2013). Cryptosporidium
    spp. have been frequently found in water environments throughout Latin America
    since 2000 (Rosado-García et al., 2017). Different water sources in African countries
    are also contaminated with oocysts of Cryptosporidium parasites, with a significant
    incidence in nearly 50 % of the reports. Based on these reports, the multiple
    risk factors contributing to the promotion of waterborne protozoan parasites (e.g.,
    Cryptosporidium) and other microbial pathogens linked to diarrhoea include poor
    institutional infrastructure, insufficient water supplies, insecure drinking water,
    poor sanitary facilities, water crises, global warming, lack of development, political
    and social conflicts, poverty, increased level of malnutrition, high population
    density, and illiteracy (Aldeyarbi et al., 2016). Developing countries are predominantly
    affected by Cryptosporidium-attributable diarrhoeal diseases (Ahmed et al., 2018;
    Aldeyarbi et al., 2016; Kotloff et al., 2013; Kotloff, 2017; Mahmoudi et al.,
    2017; Rosado-García et al., 2017). According to the Global Enteric Multicenter
    Study (GEMS), Cryptosporidium has been indicated as one of the four most typical
    causes of diarrhoeal disorders occurring over the first two years of life in seven
    regions in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with approximately 202,000 deaths
    caused by cryptosporidiosis annually (Liu et al., 2016; Sow et al., 2016; Kotloff
    et al., 2013). Insufficient official reports on the occurrence of Cryptosporidium
    in human populations, food, water resources, and the environment have resulted
    in the underestimation of significant numbers of waterborne disease reports and
    associated outbreaks in various developing countries (Ahmed and Karanis, 2020).
    Cryptosporidiosis has become a severe public health issue in developed countries.
    For instance, the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) estimate indicated that
    the burden of Cryptosporidium in the Netherlands, a country with proper sanitary
    standards, has increased since the prior forecast. In addition, cryptosporidiosis
    cost 19.2 million euros and led to 137 DALYs in 2017, while long-term clinical
    symptoms such as persistent diarrhoea and joint discomfort caused 9 % of all DALYs
    in this country. Many cryptosporidiosis cases have been documented in the US,
    which has the largest economy in the world. According to the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention (CDC), a four-fold increase was observed in the rate of
    outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium reported in the US between 2014 and 2016.
    Foodborne cryptosporidiosis is a disease of public health importance in both developing
    and developed countries. However, epidemiological surveys have shown that the
    prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in developing nations (5 % to >10 %) is higher
    than that in developed nations (<1–3 %), primarily due to poor water quality and
    food sanitation (DuPont, 2016; Karanis, 2018). Thus, it is essential to establish
    specific public health surveillance to prioritize concerns associated with Cryptosporidium
    infection in these regions. In developed countries, the primary sources of Cryptosporidium
    are contaminated water resources and food products. The surveillance and monitoring
    programs in these countries primarily concerned bacterial and viral infections,
    and only included small numbers of protozoan parasites in their public health
    systems. In high-income countries, these parasitic infections are frequently disregarded
    as the leading causative agents of diarrhoea due to overconfidence in municipal
    sanitization facilities, hygiene monitoring systems, livestock and agricultural
    practices (Bouzid et al., 2018; Putignani and Menichella, 2010). Livestock is
    an agriculture sector that is crucial to providing food security on a worldwide
    scale (Hollas et al., 2022). However, the expansion of the agricultural and livestock
    sectors has affected the environment, contributing to natural resource loss, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and pollution (Yitbarek, 2019). Cryptosporidiosis has been documented
    in a variety of livestock animals, including cattle, buffaloes, pigs, goats, sheep,
    horses, camels, donkeys, and poultry such as chickens and ducks (Ryan et al.,
    2014; Robertson et al., 2014). Cattle, and quite possibly wild ruminants, play
    a significant role in releasing Cryptosporidium oocysts into the environment,
    which are responsible for foodborne and waterborne diarrhoea outbreaks in humans
    worldwide. The ability of cattle to carry different species of Cryptosporidium,
    including C. hominis, highlights a significant public health risk related to this
    potential association (Hatam-Nahavandi et al., 2019). Animal manure is a valuable
    source of organic materials and nutrients, including phosphorus, potassium, and
    nitrogen, thus stimulating the search for alternatives for managing this waste.
    Global efforts toward environmentally friendly practices have led to the worldwide
    promotion of methods that enhance the sustainability of production processes.
    As a result, governmental organizations have focused on adopting strategies to
    promote a less polluting and low-carbon economy (Bluemling and Wang, 2018). One
    of the current major concerns in waste management is the shift from linear to
    cyclical thinking, with the application of circular economy (CE) concepts as one
    of the primary solutions for these modifications (Širá et al., 2022). The vision
    of the circular economy must be applied to managing waste, particularly agricultural
    waste, to enable these activities to maintain their operations in the future.
    The finalization of the material cycle depends on the recovery of energy, by-products,
    nutrients, and water reuse (Bonciu et al., 2021). The present article critically
    reviews scientific research on Cryptosporidium species in the agricultural sector.
    It summarizes the knowledge regarding the risks of cryptosporidiosis in agricultural
    production, emphasizing the sources of contamination, the importance of animal
    production in transmitting the parasite, and the role of farmed animals as hosts.
    The zoonotic potential and risk to farmers and household members are also highlighted.
    In contrast, the need for a training strategy for farmers and the One Health approach
    are advocated for controlling and preventing zoonotic cryptosporidiosis. 2. Literature

    in agriculture are included in the list of references. In total, 409 papers were

    and valuable scientific knowledge was summarized. 3. Water pollution from agricultural
    contamination sources: impact on Cryptosporidium transmission The impact of agricultural
    practices on the pollution and degradation of inland and coastal water bodies
    in most high-income countries is more significant than that on settlements and
    industries (Evans et al., 2019). Agriculture accounts for 70 % of the world''s
    water resources; therefore, agricultural pollutants lead to the pollution or deterioration
    of the environment and nearby ecosystems (Díaz et al., 2012; Mateo-Sagasta et
    al., 2017; Wato et al., 2020). This contamination occurs through runoff, soil
    erosion, livestock farming, aquaculture, chemical inputs, and overuse of water
    resources (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017; Önder et al., 2011). In the USA, agricultural
    land is a substantial source of pollution for rivers and streams, and it is considered
    the second and third potential source of contamination for wetlands and lakes,
    respectively (US EPA, 2016). Furthermore, as demonstrated by the National Water
    Quality Inventory in the USA, pollutants and pathogens from agriculture and agricultural
    production are responsible for almost 50 % of contaminated water bodies in this
    country (Díaz et al., 2012). In European countries, 38 % of the water bodies are
    threatened by agricultural pollutants (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017). In addition,
    agricultural activities are responsible for significant surface water and groundwater
    nitrogen pollution in China (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2013). In low-income countries,
    agricultural-based pollutants have also become a concern due to increased sediment
    runoff (Evans et al., 2019). At the global level, the FAO indicated that factors
    associated with agriculture, such as the production of waste from livestock and
    aquaculture, manure application, misuse of fertilizers, unsustainable cropping,
    non-standard grazing systems, surface runoff, and microbial and antimicrobial
    residues via leaching, potentially lead to pollutants reaching water resources
    (FAO, 2020). The increasing trend of water scarcity worldwide has raised attention
    to the use of alternative water sources for agricultural purposes, emphasizing
    the need for improved management of the microbial safety of water used for irrigation
    (Alegbeleye and Sant''Ana, 2021). Therefore, wastewater reuse is a helpful solution
    despite potential risks to public health and the ecosystem (Abeledo-Lameiro et
    al., 2018; Liao et al., 2021), as worldwide wastewater production is estimated
    to be 330 km3 per year (Tripathi et al., 2019). Regardless of the risks of emerging
    contaminants and subsequent health issues, wastewater reuse for irrigation remains
    common in different regions of the world (Jaramillo and Restrepo, 2017; Tripathi
    et al., 2019). Its reuse in agriculture is classified into direct and indirect
    utilization, with the last being the prevailing practice in agricultural settings
    as approximately 35.9 Mha of agrarian fields are exposed to the indirect use of
    wastewater (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017). In this process, the treated effluent
    is diluted with fresh water, from reservoirs or streams after discharge from wastewater
    treatment plants (Jeong et al., 2016). However, there are concerns regarding the
    massive disposal of untreated wastewater on land and surface waters to cover irrigation
    water demand, particularly in arid areas, as it can be involved in epidemics of
    foodborne diseases (Tripathi et al., 2019). Previous studies have reported a strong
    correlation between intestinal parasites and the application of wastewater and
    animal/human excreta in agricultural production, especially in Africa, South and
    Southeast Asia, and China, all regions with intense water shortages (Duc et al.,
    2011). Agricultural water, which is source of water used in agricultural practices
    (e.g., irrigation, livestock watering, and various other farming activities),
    plays a prominent role in the transmission of Cryptosporidium, mainly attributable
    to the presence of livestock (as a reservoir) and crops exposed to contaminated
    irrigation water, manure, and agricultural workers (Spanakos et al., 2015). Manure-based
    pathogens are possible causative agents of large waterborne and foodborne outbreaks
    (Venglovsky et al., 2006). Manure-borne contaminants originating from non-point
    sources (pastured and stray animals and leaching/runoff from agricultural fields)
    and point sources (manure storage lagoons, animal housing facilities, and animal
    feedstuffs) can result in water and soil contamination (Venglovsky et al., 2006).
    Manure application on agricultural lands is associated with the transmission of
    Cryptosporidium parasites to humans (Boxall et al., 2009). Manure-contaminated
    runoff water from farms and animal waste utilization in agricultural fields can
    release significant quantities of oocysts into the environment (Schijven et al.,
    2004). The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in manure can differ among livestock
    species and age categories. Recent research estimating global Cryptosporidium
    loads in livestock manure revealed that cattle predominantly contribute to approximately
    3.2 × 1023 oocysts per year. Asian countries exhibit the highest loads of livestock-derived
    oocysts from waste, followed by European, South American, and African countries
    (Vermeulen et al., 2017). According to a global review, it is estimated that Cryptosporidium
    spp., with an overall prevalence of 11 %, is the most prevalent protozoa in vegetables
    (Badri et al., 2022) because of the use of new or insufficiently composted animal
    and human faeces as fertilizer in agricultural lands. Many recent studies have
    revealed Cryptosporidium contamination in wastewater and recycled water used for
    agricultural irrigation, urban reuse, and recreational purposes (Spanakos et al.,
    2015; Zhu et al., 2022), and the overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. In
    wastewater, surface water and groundwater resources are estimated to be 46.9 %,
    45.3 %, and 18.8–19.9 %, respectively (Daraei et al., 2021). A quantitative risk
    assessment calculated the probability of contamination with Cryptosporidium originating
    from the use of surface waters and effluents in septic tanks on agricultural land
    in China. According to this evaluation, the total disease burden due to Cryptosporidium
    infection was 9.68 × 10−6 disability-adjusted life years per person per year (DALYs
    pppy) and 3.14 × 10−5 DALYs pppy for immunocompetent patients and cancer patients,
    respectively (Huang et al., 2023). Furthermore, the extensive effects of agricultutal
    water pollution significantly affect the quality of water bodies. It is conceivable
    that drinking water derived from groundwater contributes more significantly than
    expected to the worldwide burden of cryptosporidiosis (Chique et al., 2020). Surface
    water, the primary source of drinking water supply, is widely used for recreational
    activities, such as swimming, boating, and fishing (Shortle et al., 2001; Horman
    et al., 2004). These water resources are at risk of contamination by surface runoff
    from agricultural lands, which has a substantial role in water impairment, degradation
    of drinking water supplies, and hazards to aquatic and wildlife ecosystems (Bashir
    et al., 2020). The consumption of contaminated surface water and groundwater is
    strongly linked to waterborne outbreaks, especially those related to Cryptosporidium
    species (Karanis et al., 2007; Baldursson and Karanis, 2011; Chique et al., 2020;
    Efstratiou et al., 2017; Bourli et al., 2023). Table 1 shows the surface water
    and groundwater contamination of Cryptosporidium species. Table 1. Surface waters

    climatic patterns on the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. Weather patterns
    and climatic factors have an essential effect on the transmission of Cryptosporidium
    spp. (Boxall et al., 2009). Climate conditions can play a significant role in
    the possibility of resuspended oocysts in water, contamination of water sources
    by effluents, and crop contamination (Lal et al., 2013). The effects of rainfall
    pattern and temperature on cryptosporidiosis incidence may be either direct (supporting
    the survival and dissemination of oocysts) or indirect (improving factors that
    enhance the chances of transmission). Warmer temperatures increase recreational
    activities in surface waters (e.g., bathing and swimming) and alter consumption
    habits, facilitating the unintended ingestion of oocysts (Ikiroma and Pollock,
    2021). During extreme weather incidents (e.g., heavy rainfall, floods, sea-level
    rise) and following the entrance of faecal and manure particles into water, drinking
    water resources can be contaminated with infectious pathogens (Bashir et al.,
    2020; Betancourt and Rose, 2004; Levy et al., 2016). The faecal contamination
    of drinking water sources and food products is reportedly concomitant with heavy
    rainfall events (Kostyla et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2016). The transfer of pathogens
    from agricultural animal waste to surface waters due to runoff during rainfall
    events is a national concern for water quality in the USA (Fayer, 2004). Research
    has revealed a substantial increase in the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts
    in both drinking water and surface water sources during wet seasons and the runoff
    from rainfall (Britton et al., 2010; Daraei et al., 2021; Jagai et al., 2009;
    Young et al., 2015). Moreover, heavy rainfall and river flooding may contribute
    to epidemics of waterborne gastrointestinal infections (Gertler et al., 2015).
    There is strong evidence regarding the wide range of seasonal peaks of cryptosporidiosis,
    primarily associated with geographic location, precipitation, temperature, climate
    patterns (e.g., heavy rainfall), and agricultural/human waste production (Levy
    et al., 2016; Chique et al., 2020). The seasonal fluctuation in the occurrence
    and concentration of Cryptosporidium in different water bodies depends on water
    temperature, parasite species and source dispersal, type of water use (agriculture,
    waste, household), and runoff water (Koompapong and Sukthana, 2012). A possible
    reason for seasonal variations in the incidence of intestinal pathogens in surface
    water depends on the contamination source and the factors letting the contaminants
    reach the surface water bodies. For instance, zoonotic enteric pathogens are frequently
    detected in high numbers during floods, extreme rainfall, and pasture seasons
    after snowmelt when related to agricultural runoff (Horman et al., 2004). The
    frequency of Cryptosporidium contamination in aquatic environments has different
    seasonal patterns and is most dominant in summer, autumn, and winter when the
    highest rate of occurrence and concentrations of oocysts are observed (Bodley-Tickell
    et al., 2002; Lapen et al., 2016; Nasser, 2016; Strathmann et al., 2016). The
    autumn/winter peak of oocysts can be attributed to autumn application of manure
    in agricultural fields, agricultural discharges caused by heavy rains, the presence
    of migrating birds in cold seasons, and the incidence of hydrological processes
    that mobilize contaminants in faeces which accumulate during summer (Bodley-Tickell
    et al., 2002; Koompapong and Sukthana, 2012; Lapen et al., 2016). Nevertheless,
    some monitoring studies have observed spring/summer peaks in the concentrations
    of oocysts. In the US, most waterborne outbreaks are associated with failure in
    water treatment plants after spring runoff events (Levy et al., 2016). However,
    in some cases, the low concentration in spring may be related to the effects of
    dilution and flushing coupled with spring freshets and the seasonal features of
    faecal contaminants entering surface waters (Lapen et al., 2016). Furthermore,
    seasonal patterns may correlate with the parasite species (genotypes), as it has
    shown that C. parvum peaks arise in late spring, whereas C. hominis peaks occur
    in autumn (Gallas-Lindemann et al., 2013). Long-term climate change also affects
    the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases and extends transmission cycles (Jagai
    et al., 2009). Climate change intensifies the transport of pathogens to surface
    waters through being involved in sewer overflow, increased runoff, and resuspension
    of contaminants from sediments due to extreme precipitation, increased winter
    precipitation, and changes in evapotranspiration (Islam et al., 2021; Sterk et
    al., 2016). Increased runoff and frequent leaching of animal faeces from agricultural
    farms have resulted in many waterborne disease outbreaks, exacerbated during high
    precipitation periods (Ananna et al., 2021; Levy et al., 2016). Precipitation
    can affect the movement and distribution of disease-causing agents, mainly through
    water sources. In addition, temperature determines the growth and survival of
    waste-derived pathogens in the soil and their subsequent transport via overland
    flow after applying faecal waste on land (Cissé, 2019; Sterk et al., 2016). Temperature
    and precipitation are two substantial predictors of Cryptosporidium contamination,
    particularly in regions with tropical climates (Jagai et al., 2009). 5. Cryptosporidium
    spp. in fresh fruits, vegetables, and related food products Unsafe food accounts
    for nearly 600 million foodborne diseases and approximately 420,000 annual deaths
    (Eslahi et al., 2023). It is estimated that 30 % of total foodborne deaths occur
    in children under five. According to WHO reports, the consumption of unsafe food
    results in the loss of 33 million years of healthy life worldwide each year, and
    this rate is probably underestimated (Milinovich and Klieve, 2011). The increased
    incidence of foodborne parasitic diseases has been revealed to be a consequence
    of old-fashioned agricultural practices, wild animals, poor sanitary facilities,
    disregard for sanitation rules by food service staff, globalization of the food
    industry, growth in worldwide food trade, convenient travel, the rise in the number
    of vulnerable individuals (e.g. aging, severely malnourished, and HIV-infected),
    changes in lifestyle and food habits, modified cooking practices, and advanced
    diagnostic techniques (Stryiński et al., 2020). The European Food Safety Authority
    reported 4005 foodborne outbreaks in the European Union (EU) in 2021, a 29.8 %
    increase compared to 2020. Furthermore, foodborne parasitic infections account
    for >1000 human cases reported annually in the EU (www.efsa.europa.eu). Although
    the European Union has implemented regulations for some foodborne parasites, there
    are still no published standards for protozoan parasites in food products (Stryiński
    et al., 2020). Cryptosporidium is among the most prominent foodborne parasites
    documented as the etiological agent in both waterborne and foodborne outbreaks
    reports (Karanis, 2018). Food-borne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis have been recorded
    since the beginning of the 1980s, and have been associated with an increase in
    reports of this infection in human populations (Ortega and Cama, 2008). Table
    2 shows the reports of Cryptosporidium spp. on vegetables, fruits and other other
    food products. However, the most well-known foodborne outbreak of Cryptosporidium
    infection was reported in October 1993 in central Maine, caused by drinking fresh
    pressed apple cider. The report indicated that Cryptosporidium oocysts in apple
    cider were also found on the cider press and in the faecal samples of a calf from
    the same farm where the apples were provided (Millard et al., 1994). Based on
    the current joint risk ranking of foodborne parasites by the WHO and FAO, Cryptosporidium
    is regarded as a significant foodborne pathogen, rated fifth among 24 potentially
    foodborne parasites (Ryan et al., 2018). Furthermore, Cryptosporidium is estimated
    to be among the top-five parasites out of 24 prioritized foodborne parasites in
    Europe (Bouwknegt et al., 2018; van der Giessen et al., 2021). Table 2. Reports

    Italy Barlaam et al., 2022 Given the growing number of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks,
    the food industry has paid great attention to Cryptosporidium spp. (McKerr et
    al., 2015, McKerr et al., 2018). However, most attacks caused by foodborne infections
    have been poorly examined, never recognized, or unreported. In the last 30 years,
    26 outbreaks related to food-transmitted Cryptosporidium have been documented
    in countries in northern Europe, the UK, and the USA (Karanis, 2018). The few
    reports of foodborne outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium may be attributable to
    underreporting and underestimation (Gopfert et al., 2022). The lack of information
    on foodborne cryptosporidiosis may be attributed to several factors, including
    inadequate epidemiological research, the unavailability of outbreak specimens,
    the absence of a reliable diagnostic method for detecting low concentrations of
    Cryptosporidium oocysts in suspected samples, and the prolonged incubation period
    of the parasite (Budu-Amoako et al., 2011). Regardless of their potential health
    advantages, the consumption of fresh or undercooked vegetables has increasingly
    been identified as a source of foodborne infections resulting from different microbial
    pathogens (Li et al., 2020). In many countries, the demand for raw fruits and
    vegetables out of the season leads to the transportation of thousands of miles
    from growing areas to suppliers in various regions. This trend can result in foodborne
    disease outbreaks in several places simultaneously (Milinovich and Klieve, 2011).
    In recent years, a substantial increase in the incidence of foodborne diseases
    has been linked to the consumption of fresh vegetables (Ryan et al., 2018). Furthermore,
    foodborne disease outbreaks associated with contaminated fruits and vegetables
    are increasing globally (Tripathi et al., 2014). Enteric pathogens on vegetables
    and fruits may originate from irrigation water and/or soil contaminated with livestock
    manure, human faeces, raw sewage, or directly via animals during growth and irrigation,
    or even following unsafe storage and processing (Badri et al., 2022; Nasser, 2022).
    Moreover, vegetable and fruit risk contamination is caused by improper sanitary
    conditions during harvest and transport, marketing, and preparation by an infected
    consumer or food handler (Eraky et al., 2014). Foodborne infections are often
    associated with the consumption of raw produce contaminated by infected food handlers
    or sewage water (Milinovich and Klieve, 2011). Oocyst shedding may last >60 days
    after the termination of symptoms, concluding that infected food handlers can
    be a potential contamination source for foodstuffs even a long time after the
    diarrhoea subsides (Ryan et al., 2018). Other risk factors for contamination of
    vegetables and fruits include the application of inappropriately prepared composts
    and animal manure in agricultural fields, using night soils (faecal sludge), and
    irrigation with inadequately treated wastewater (Eslahi et al., 2022). A worldwide
    meta-analysis indicated that vegetable and fruit samples obtained from regions
    with lower economic status displayed the most significant incidence of protozoan
    parasite contamination. Consequently, Southeast Asia has the highest contamination
    rate (Badri et al., 2022). Fresh produce could be a potential vehicle for transmitting
    Cryptosporidium parasites if consumed under inappropriate conditions (Karanis,
    2018). In North America, Cryptosporidium spp. was the cause of critical outbreak
    cases due to contaminated fruits and vegetables imported from tropical areas,
    where pickers'' sanitary settings and personal hygiene are poor and untreated
    wastewater is used for irrigation purposes (Pozio, 2020). Moreover, contamination
    of fresh produce has been implicated in several large outbreaks of Cryptosporidium
    in European countries (Åberg et al., 2015; Ethelberg et al., 2009; McKerr et al.,
    2015; Pönka et al., 2009). The CDC''s surveillance system recorded that 120 multi-state
    foodborne outbreaks occurred in the US between 2010 and 2014, of which 17 cases
    were related to fruits, 15 cases involved vegetables (row crops), 10 instances
    included sprouts, and nine were related to seeded vegetables (such as cucumbers
    and mini peppers) (Riggio et al., 2019). Cryptosporidium spp. are widespread throughout
    the American continent and are a major cause of outbreaks of diarrhoea associated
    with water, ranking as the third leading cause of diarrhoea linked to animal contact
    in the United States. Between 2009 and 2017, 7465 cases were reported by 40 states
    and Puerto Rico. Over this period, the reported outbreaks showed an average annual
    increase of approximately 13 %. The primary contributors to these outbreaks include
    the ingestion of contaminated water in pools, direct contact with infected cattle,
    and exposure to infected individuals in childcare settings (Gharpure et al., 2019).
    Cryptosporidium oocysts are highly stable and capable of remaining viable in aquatic
    environments (e.g. surface waters) and soil for two years. In addition to their
    resistance to unfavourable environmental conditions, disinfectants and their ability
    to penetrate drinking water filters facilitate human exposure to contaminated
    water and food (Li et al., 2020). Low temperatures do not affect the survival
    of oocysts on fruits and vegetables, allowing them to remain potentially infectious
    in household refrigerators for several days to weeks. Oocysts, typically sticky
    on the surface, can persist and survive on the leaves of plants during growth,
    but they are resistant to intense washing and the use of disinfectants (Hohweyer
    et al., 2016; Kubina et al., 2023). In addition, the stomata of fresh leafy vegetables
    and fruits may enable oocysts to survive and be protected (Ryan et al., 2018).
    The most probable cause of the higher prevalence of parasitic contamination in
    vegetables is the large contact surface area of leafy vegetables, which increases
    the chances of exposure to parasitic agents (Karshima, 2018). Although there is
    a potential for infection by consuming contaminated food, the methods used to
    recover and detect Cryptosporidium oocysts from fruits and vegetables are often
    insufficient due to inconsistent recovery rates and high expenses. Among the various
    types of leafy greens, spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is frequently contaminated
    and has been linked to C. parvum outbreaks. The recovery of Cryptosporidium oocysts
    from challenging samples, such as spinach with saponin-rich leaves, has been improved
    by the refinement of existing protocols using an alkaline 1 M glycine buffer (Razakandrainibe
    et al., 2020). Real-time PCR (qPCR) is a suitable technique for detecting parasitic
    oocysts in contaminated plant products with low concentrations of oocysts (Ahmed
    and Karanis, 2018). An accurate method that integrates cell culture and quantitative
    PCR (CC-qPCR) has been developed to detect infective C. parvum oocysts recovered
    from lamb''s lettuce, capable of detecting even a single infective oocyst (Kubina
    et al., 2021). Furthermore, nested multiplex PCR (mPCR) offers a fast, easy, and
    cost-effective approach for identifying protozoan pathogens in fresh produce (Shapiro
    et al., 2019). The cultivation of vegetables using non-polluting agricultural
    practices, organic farming techniques, and manure-based fertilizers has gained
    considerable attention. However, the source of the collected manure (farm animal
    faeces) may contain oocysts or may be indirectly contaminated with human waste.
    Flood irrigation methods for growing vegetables, primarily used in rural regions,
    can contaminate vegetables sold in markets and could be responsible for outbreaks
    (Li et al., 2020). Farm-to-fork is a concept for ensuring food safety, and it
    concentrates on all food production levels with control measures from farmland
    to consumers'' forks or drinking cups (Boyer and Kuczynska, 2010). According to
    FAO guidelines, the surveillance of foodborne diseases is a high priority for
    the development of food safety infrastructure. A global approach should be coordinated
    in order to support and strengthen national, regional, and international monitoring.
    As suggested by the FAO, critical strategies for advanced management of international
    foodborne diseases include establishing consistent laboratory training and related
    techniques, training for emergency preparedness, strengthened communication networks,
    and database development. In conclusion, agricultural producers should take appropriate
    measures to prevent foodstuffs from being contaminated by infectious pathogens
    in the farm environment (Millard et al., 1994). Properly washing raw vegetables
    and different chemical or radiation procedures are highly recommended for disinfection
    or sterilization of vegetables and fruits. The public health sector should raise
    awareness of the risk factors for transmitting foodborne parasites that contaminate
    fruits and vegetables. Foodborne outbreak investigations and monitoring of food-transmitted
    pathogens are fundamental concerns in food safety systems (FAO, 2020; Stryiński
    et al., 2020). Validated methodologies are required to accurately detect foodborne
    parasites (Chalmers et al., 2020). 6. Cryptosporidium spp. in animals 6.1. Cryptosporidium
    infection in cattle Cryptosporidiosis has serious animal health and economic implications
    for livestock production (de Graaf et al., 1999). Bovines are the most critical
    animal group infected with Cryptosporidium, probably due to their economic importance
    (Oliveira et al., 2021; Santín, 2013; Thomson et al., 2017). Cattle production
    is one of the most important agricultural industries worldwide. There are various
    species of farmed bovines, including cattle (Bos taurus), zebu (Bos taurus indicus),
    and water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). Bovine cryptosporidiosis has been reported
    worldwide (Robertson et al., 2014; Santín et al., 2008), and Cryptosporidium infections
    in bovines give rise to clinical manifestations including diarrhoea, abdominal
    discomfort, nausea, emesis, and reduced body mass. Nonetheless, cattle conditions
    are generally non-fatal (Santín, 2013). Cryptosporidium induces diarrhoea, particularly
    in young specimens, notably in neonatal dairy calves aged 1–3 weeks, due to low
    immunity (Doungmala et al., 2019; Nydam and Mohammed, 2005). In neonatal dairy
    calves, the clinical indications for cryptosporidiosis may range from mild to
    severe diarrhoea, accompanied by manifestations such as lethargy, loss of appetite,
    pyrexia, and profound dehydration (Castro-Hermida et al., 2002). Calves can recover
    4–6 weeks after infection with Cryptosporidium (Olson et al., 2004). A mortality
    rate of 35.5 % has been reported in animals younger than 30 days (Singh et al.,
    2006). The initial documentation of bovine cryptosporidiosis dates back to 1971,
    when it was reported that an eight-month-old-heifer experienced persistent diarrhoea
    (Panciera et al., 1971). Subsequently, Cryptosporidium spp. have become a frequent
    discovery on farms, occurring in cattle herds with calf diarrhoea issues and those
    without such problems. Recent studies have suggested that the most frequently
    encountered Cryptosporidium spp. in cattle are C. bovis, C. parvum, C. andersoni,
    and C. ryanae (Fayer et al., 2005; Fayer et al., 2008, Fayer et al., 2009; Lindsay
    et al., 2000). Of the four species mentioned, C. parvum and C. bovis were the
    most commonly identified in calves. The oocysts of C. andersoni were comparatively
    prominent, whereas those of C. parvum, C. bovis, and C. ryanae were similar in
    size and shape. Molecular methods have been used for species identification (Fayer
    et al., 2005, Fayer et al., 2008). In numerous studies conducted worldwide, C.
    parvum has been consistently found to be the predominant species infecting pre-weaned
    calves (Fayer et al., 2007; Santín et al., 2004; Santín, 2013). C. bovis and C.
    ryanae are primarily found in post-weaned calves (Fayer et al., 2010a), and C.
    andersoni infects the abomasum of juvenile and adult animals and occasionally
    young calves (Kváč et al., 2008; Lindsay et al., 2000; Olson et al., 2004; Santín,
    2013). Age-related patterns of Cryptosporidium species have been extensively documented
    in the scientific literature (Fayer et al., 2006, Fayer et al., 2007). C. bovis
    and C. ryanae do not cause clinical diarrhoea in cattle (Fayer et al., 2005; Santín,
    2013). Although C. parvum is often considered a primary pathogen in cryptosporidiosis
    cases in calves, reports suggest that C. bovis may also possess pathogenic potential.
    A study conducted in Sweden reported the presence of C. bovis as a single pathogen
    in diarrheal samples from calves aged >21 days (Silverlås et al., 2013). This
    indicates that C. bovis may cause disease and contribute to the clinical symptoms
    in older calves. C. bovis was first described in cattle in 2002 as a new genotype
    (Cryptosporidium genotype bovine B) (Xiao et al., 2002). Three years later, this
    species was officially recognized by the scientific community (Fayer et al., 2005).
    C. bovis οocysts measures are 4.76–5.35 × 4.17–4.76 μm, with a mean size of 4.89
    × 4.63 μm. After the experimental infection, the prepatent period of C. bovis
    was determined to be ten days (Fayer et al., 2005). C. bovis develops in the small
    intestine. It is often found in older animals and has uncertain clinical significance.
    Cattle are the most common hosts for C. bovis (Åberg et al., 2019; Firoozi et
    al., 2019; Lichtmannsperger et al., 2020; Ryan and Power, 2012; Yildirim et al.,
    2020), whereas human infection with C. bovis has been reported in a few cases
    (Khan et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2014; Ryan and Hijjawi, 2015). In 2004, C. ryanae
    was first described in the USA, as the Cryptosporidium deer-like genotype (Santín
    et al., 2004). C. ryanae, although never detected in deer, was named because of
    its 99.5 % similarity to previously reported deer genotype in the 18S rRNA gene
    locus (Xiao et al., 2002). Four years later, it was officially recognized as a
    species and designated C. ryanae (Fayer et al., 2008). With dimensions of 2.94–4.41
    μm × 2.94–3.68 μm and an average size of 3.16 × 3.73 μm, C. ryanae is one of the
    smallest known Cryptosporidium species (Fayer et al., 2008). Notably, C. ryanae
    has been identified worldwide (Åberg et al., 2019; Fayer et al., 2008; Feng et
    al., 2012; Jang et al., 2023; Lichtmannsperger et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020;
    Yildirim et al., 2020). In addition to domestic cattle, C. ryanae has been detected
    in zebu cattle and buffalos (Feng et al., 2012). It is essential to mention that
    C. ryanae does not possess zoonotic potential, meaning that it is not known to
    be transmissible to humans (Khan et al., 2018; Ryan et al., 2014). On the other
    hand, C. andersoni was first identified in cattle in 2000 (Lindsay et al., 2000).
    Oocysts are similar to those of C. muris described in mice, but larger than those
    of C. parvum. The size of C. andersoni oocysts is 6.0–8.1 × 5.0–6.5 μm, with a
    mean of 7.4 × 5.5 μm. It is notable that it is perceptibly more substantial than
    the other three species commonly found in cattle. This distinctive characteristic
    makes it easier to identify C. andersoni than other Cryptosporidium species through
    microscopy. Its large size aids in visual distinction, facilitating its recognition
    during microscopic examination (Lindsay et al., 2000). C. andersoni has been reported
    worldwide (Enemark et al., 2002; Firoozi et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2023; Mirzai
    et al., 2014; Ralston et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2013), and it is predominantly
    observed in young stock and adult animals, as reported in studies (Santín et al.,
    2004). In some countries, C. andersoni has been detected in pre-weaned calves
    (Jang et al., 2023; Kváč et al., 2011). Interestingly, infections caused by this
    parasite are frequently asymptomatic and post-mortem changes are not commonly
    observed (Kvác and Vítovec, 2003; Ralston et al., 2010). However, clinical signs
    of infection with C. andersoni in adult cows are characterized by weight gain
    and milk yield reduction, as documented in previous studies (Ralston et al., 2010).
    These clinical manifestations indicate the presence of C. andersoni in the adult
    cattle. C. andersoni has also been isolated from humans (Jiang et al., 2014; Leoni
    et al., 2006; Morse et al., 2007). C. parvum oocysts were first described in mice
    in 1912 (Tyzzer, 1912). Mature oocysts were ovoidal or spheroidal with a mean
    size of 5.41 μm × 4.93 μm (Fayer et al., 2008; Upton and Current, 1985). C. parvum
    is very common in young calves and it is the most frequently encountered species
    in diarrhoeic calves. However, it is often considered less severe and is associated
    with lower mortality rates than other Cryptosporidium species (Fayer et al., 2009).
    Cryptosporidium species are commonly associated with diarrhoea in young bovine
    calves and are the most critical Cryptosporidium species, causing economic losses
    (Santín et al., 2008). C. parvum can cause diarrhoea in calves, but may not always
    lead to severe clinical signs and adverse outcomes (Geurden et al., 2007; Silverlås
    et al., 2013). Clinical symptoms, such as watery diarrhoea, anorexia, fever, depression,
    and, in severe cases, even death, are primarily observed in calves up to six weeks
    of age (Robertson et al., 2014). C. parvum inhabits the small intestine, is the
    most common species in young calves, and is the cause of significant disease in
    this age group. The higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections among the
    younger age groups of livestock animals, including farm animals, can be attributed
    to the susceptibility of newborns. Cryptosporidium is a significant concern in
    newborn farm animals, primarily because it possesses an undeveloped immune system
    during the early stages of life (Danladi and Ugbomoiko, 2015; Santín, 2013). Calves
    are particularly susceptible to C. parvum infection because of their ability to
    acquire oocysts directly after birth. Early exposure to Cryptosporidium oocysts
    makes them highly vulnerable to infection, and clinical symptoms can manifest
    as early as three days post-infection (Santín et al., 2008). Notably, C. parvum
    is not limited to bovines; it is pathogenic to a wide range of animal species,
    including humans (Ryan et al., 2014; Ryan and Hijjawi, 2015). On the other hand,
    C. bovis, C. andersoni, and C. ryanae have a more restricted host range and are
    primarily found in cattle. Cattle are the primary reservoir for C. parvum, and
    the infection is common among calves worldwide (Lichtmannsperger et al., 2020;
    Ryan and Power, 2012; Yildirim et al., 2020). This widespread presence in cattle
    has significant implications for the epidemiology and transmission of C. parvum
    to various susceptible hosts including humans. It has zoonotic potential and can
    be transmitted to humans through the faecal-oral route, primarily during direct
    or indirect contact with infected animals (Ryan et al., 2014). Table 3 shows the
    cases of Cryptosporidium spp. infection in cattle. Table 3. Cryptosporidium spp.

    et al., 1996 Apart from the four widespread species previously mentioned, sporadic
    natural infections with various Cryptosporidium species and genotypes have been
    detected in cattle (Robertson et al., 2014). These include C. felis, C. hominis,
    C. scrofarum, C. serpentis, C. suis, and C. suis-like genotypes. Interestingly,
    C. felis and C. hominis have also been reported in cows (Bornay-Llinares et al.,
    1999; Smith et al., 2005). In France, Cryptosporidium infections have been detected
    in calves ranging from 3 to 7 weeks of age. However, it is noteworthy that no
    clinical disease was observed in calves infected with C. hominis (Razakandrainibe
    et al., 2018). Furthermore, experimental infections have shown that C. canis,
    typically associated with dogs, can infect cattle (Fayer et al., 2001). In addition
    C. ubiquitum has been experimentally transmitted to cattle and it was rarely found
    in people in England and Wales (Fayer et al., 2010b). 6.2. Cryptosporidium infection
    in small ruminants The economic significance of sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra
    aegagrus hircus) in the global agricultural industry cannot be overstated as they
    play a crucial role in providing meat, milk, and wool. However, Cryptosporidium
    infection poses a significant challenge for small domestic ruminants, such as
    sheep and goats, especially during the neonatal stages. These infections are the
    primary cause of neonatal diarrhoea, resulting in high morbidity and mortality
    rates in lambs. Neonatal diarrhoea is one of the most prevalent and costly diseases
    affecting small ruminants. Cryptosporidium is a significant enteropathogen, and
    its association with this enteric condition has been well documented in scientific
    literature (Angus et al., 1982; Sari et al., 2009). Controlling and managing Cryptosporidium
    infection in sheep and goats is of the utmost importance to ensure the health
    and productivity of these valuable animals in the agricultural sector. The primary
    clinical sign of cryptosporidiosis in sheep and goats is diarrhoea, although anorexia,
    depression, and abdominal pain may also be present (Paul et al., 2014). Cryptosporidium
    infection in sheep was first described in 1974 in Australia in 1- to 3-week-old
    lambs with diarrhoea (Barker and Carbonell, 1974). In goats, infection by this
    agent was first reported six years later, also in Australia, in a 2-week-old child
    with diarrhoea (Mason et al., 1981). Ovine cryptosporidiosis has been reported
    worldwide (Dessì et al., 2020; Kaupke et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2023; Paraud
    and Chartier, 2012; Santín et al., 2007). In sheep, the identification of several
    Cryptosporidium species and genotypes varies across studies and is influenced
    by the age of the animals. Among the dominant Cryptosporidium species found in
    sheep and goats C. parvum, C. ubiquitum, and C. xiaoi are known to cause mild
    to severe diarrhoea and even mortality in these animals (Díaz et al., 2010a; Díaz
    et al., 2010b; Imre et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2021). C. xiaoi was initially characterized
    in sheep in 2009 (Fayer and Santín, 2009). Its oocysts resemble those of C. bovis
    but are slightly smaller, measuring 2.94–4.41 μm × 2.94–4.41 μm (mean = 3.94 μm
    × 3.44 μm), with a length/width shape index of 1.15 (Fayer and Santín, 2009).
    Sporadic infections with C. bovis (sheep), C. hominis (goats), C. suis, C. andersoni
    (sheep and goats), C. fayeri, and C. scrofarum have been reported (Karanis et
    al., 2007; Koinari et al., 2014; Ryan et al., 2005; Santín, 2013; Yang et al.,
    2014). Cryptosporidium oocysts are predominantly observed in very young lambs,
    typically between one and three weeks of age, with a lower incidence in older
    animals (Causapé et al., 2002; Majewska et al., 2000; Sari et al., 2009). In lambs
    older than one month, Cryptosporidium infections are generally subclinical, meaning
    that they do not exhibit overt clinical symptoms. However, subclinical infections
    can occur even in younger animals, which means they are infected but do not show
    apparent signs of illness. Despite the lack of noticeable clinical symptoms, Cryptosporidium
    infections can affect animals. Infected lambs may experience a reduced body condition
    score, potentially affecting their overall productivity (Sweeny et al., 2011,
    Sweeny et al., 2012). Cryptosporidium infection was detected in all age groups
    of goats. However, the prevalence of infection and illness is notably higher in
    kids (Paraud and Chartier, 2012). Caprine cryptosporidiosis primarily affects
    young goats aged 0–2 months. The prepatent period, which is the time between infection
    and the appearance of oocysts in faeces, was approximately four days. Clinical
    symptoms are more pronounced in young children, indicating that the disease manifests
    more severely in this age group (Paul et al., 2014). Generally, the prevalence
    increased until sheep and goats were 5–6 weeks of age and then gradually declined.
    Sheep cryptosporidiosis poses a significant risk to public health. Small ruminants,
    including sheep, can serve as potential reservoirs of Cryptosporidium, contributing
    to the transmission of this parasite to humans (Koinari et al., 2014). Sheep and
    goats are reservoirs of C. hominis and C. parvum (Imre et al., 2013; Lange et
    al., 2014; Ryan et al., 2005). Outbreaks of Cryptosporidium infection in schoolchildren
    have been linked to contact with lambs and goats (Lange et al., 2014). This highlights
    the zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium, in which the parasite can be transmitted
    from animals to humans, causing infections in susceptible individuals. Californian
    scientists have proposed several measures to reduce the shedding of zoonotic Cryptosporidium
    in sheep and minimize the risk of transmission. These measures effectively manage
    lamb health, prevent contact between sheep and cattle, and ensure the utilization
    of safe drinking water sources for sheep (Li et al., 2022). By implementing these
    preventive strategies, a significant contribution can be made to protect the health
    of animals and humans. Table 4 shows the cases of Cryptosporidium spp. infection
    in sheep and goats. Table 4. Cryptosporidium spp. detection in faecal samples

    Cryptosporidium reservoir, and Cryptosporidium affects pigs of all ages (Chen
    et al., 2023). Cryptosporidium infections in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus)
    have been extensively documented globally (Budu-Amoako et al., 2012; Chen et al.,
    2023; Farzan et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2008; Kváč et al., 2009a, Kváč et al.,
    2009b; Li et al., 2022; Petersen et al., 2015). Initial reports of Cryptosporidium
    infections in domestic pigs were reported by Berglund in the USA (Bergeland, 1977;
    Kennedy et al., 1977). C. suis, C. parvum, C. muris, C. andersoni, C. scrofarum
    (previously known as Cryptosporidium pig genotype II), and C. tyzzeri (previously
    known as Cryptosporidium mouse genotype I) have been isolated from pigs (Zheng
    et al., 2019). Recent research has shown that C. suis and C. scrofarum display
    host specificity, indicating that they are more specifically adapted to infect
    pigs. Additionally, C. scrofarum exhibits age-specific patterns of infection (Jeníková
    et al., 2011; Kváč et al., 2013; Ryan et al., 2004a). The oocysts of C. scrofarum
    have dimensions measuring 4.81–5.96 μm (with a mean of 5.16 μm) in length and
    4.23–5.29 μm (with a mean of 4.83 μm) in width, resulting in a length-to-width
    ratio of 1.07 ± 0.06. These specific morphological characteristics help to differentiate
    C. scrofarum from other Cryptosporidium species in pigs. Oocysts of C. suis have
    dimensions measuring 4.9–4.4 μm (with a mean of 4.6 μm) in length and 4.0–4.3
    μm (with a mean of 4.2 μm) in width, resulting in a length-to-width ratio of 1.1
    (Kváč et al., 2013; Ryan et al., 2004a). C. suis exhibits a higher frequency of
    infection in pre-weaned pigs, whereas C. scrofarum is typically detected in older
    animals (Johnson et al., 2008; Kváč et al., 2009a; Langkjaer et al., 2007). Most
    Cryptosporidium-infected pigs were between 2 and 3 months of age, followed by
    animals aged 1–2 months, 3–5 months, and those <1 month. Various Cryptosporidium
    species have been detected in farm pigs, including C. parvum, C. muris, and C.
    tyzzeri, which are commonly associated with mice (Kváč et al., 2013). The sporadic
    occurrence of C. parvum in pigs offers evidence to support the potential role
    of pigs in the transmission of Cryptosporidium from animals to humans. Pigs serve
    as reservoir hosts for C. scrofarum and C. suis, which can induce cryptosporidiosis
    in human (Li et al., 2022). Table 5 presents the cases of Cryptosporidium spp.
    infection in pigs. Table 5. Cryptosporidium spp. detection in faecal samples of

    in most areas of the world suggest that livestock farms must be considered a public
    health threat, and proper control measures should be introduced. Variations in
    the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections in pigs can be attributed to many
    factors. These factors include the size of the sample population, geographical
    region or location of the study, prevailing climatic conditions, age of the animals
    under investigation, specific diagnostic methods employed, pig breed, hygiene
    conditions maintained, and the overall management practices implemented (Santin,
    2020). 6.4. Cryptosporidium infection in fish Cryptosporidium species have been
    identified in various types of fish found in marine and freshwater environments,
    as well as in fish raised on farms, kept in captivity, and used as ornamental
    pets worldwide (Certad et al., 2020; Golomazou and Karanis, 2020). Consequently,
    aquatic environments are susceptible to contamination by agricultural runoff,
    rainwater, bathing activities, and sewage discharge (Ryan et al., 2014). The presence
    of parasites in marine habitats facilitates its distribution and transmission,
    whereas environmental aquatic substrate-associated biofilms serve as reservoirs,
    protecting the parasite within its matrices and surfaces (Masangkay et al., 2020).
    Direct transmission of the parasite has been confirmed in fish species such as
    the gilthead seabream and seabass, primarily through ingestion of mature oocysts
    released in faeces. Additionally, cannibalism and predation among infected and
    uninfected fish can also contribute to the spread of infection (Alvarez-Pellitero
    and Sitjà-Bobadilla, 2002; Sitjà-Bobadilla and Alvarez-Pellitero, 2003). Other
    aquatic organisms, such as eukaryotic organisms and macro-invertebrates, as well
    as live food such as Artemia and rotifers which are supplied to farmed fish, may
    act as reservoirs for Cryptosporidium species (Fayer et al., 2000b; Gómez-Couso
    et al., 2003; Méndez-Hermida et al., 2007; Reboredo-Fernández et al., 2014). Fish
    can host 11 known species of Cryptosporidium along with 29 additional genotypes
    specific to fish hosts. In contrast, other species and genotypes are specific
    to fish hosts, while others that are typically found in non-fish hosts, such as
    C. parvum, C. hominis, C. ubiquitum, C. scrofarum, C. xiaoi, and the rat genotype
    III, have also been detected in fish. The occurrence of non-fish-specific Cryptosporidium
    species in fish is likely attributed to the pollution of the aquatic ecosystem
    with disease-causing Cryptosporidium species originating from agricultural runoff
    and sewage discharge (Couso-Pérez et al., 2022; Golomazou et al., 2021; Moratal
    et al., 2022). Cryptosporidium infections have been documented in various farmed
    fish species in different regions. These include gilthead seabream and European
    seabass in Spain, turbot and rainbow trout in Spain, Murray cod in Australia,
    Asian seabass in Vietnam, Nile tilapia in Papua New Guinea, cichlids in Israel,
    and red drum in Louisiana, USA (Golomazou et al., 2021; Moratal et al., 2022;
    Reghaissia et al., 2022). When fish in aquaculture settings are exposed to Cryptosporidium,
    particularly under conditions of high stocking densities, temporarily unfavourable
    environmental factors, and specific farming practices, the prevalence of infection
    and mortality rates can be significantly elevated. This poses a notable concern
    for the global aquaculture industry, because Cryptosporidium can threaten aquatic
    hosts and humans, leading to negative economic consequences. Cryptosporidium infections
    in fish can trigger a robust stress response, compromising animal welfare and
    resulting in severe infections due to decreased immune competence. Harsh conditions
    are associated with impaired fish growth, pronounced pathological consequences,
    and elevated mortality rates (Alvarez-Pellitero et al., 2004; Sitjà-Bobadilla
    et al., 2005). Clinical and pathological signs of Cryptosporidium infection include
    listlessness, retarded growth, anorexia, and increased mortality, particularly
    in cases of heavy infections (Baragahare et al., 2011). Additionally, observations
    revealed muscle wasting, tissue atrophy, severe weight loss, enlargement of the
    coelomic cavities, and abdominal swelling (ascites). Necropsy indicates indigestion,
    intestinal distension due to the accumulation of mucus and gas in the intestines,
    and the presence of whitish faeces (Alvarez-Pellitero et al., 2004; Murphy et
    al., 2009; Zanguee et al., 2010). The histopathological effects of Cryptosporidium
    infection in fish tissues include necrosis, vacuolization, degradation, disaggregation,
    and shedding of epithelial cells (Baragahare et al., 2011). Severe inflammation,
    gastric mucosal epithelial cell necrosis, atrophy in the mucosal glandular, and
    reduction in glandular tissue may also be present (Ryan et al., 2004b). In severely
    infected fish, clusters of oocysts can be found in broad vacuolated areas within
    the lumen surrounded by enlarged macrophages (Alvarez-Pellitero and Sitjà-Bobadilla,
    2002). Massive infections can lead to severe intestinal lesions, and oocysts can
    cover the epithelial surface, distorting the tissue architecture. The presence
    of Cryptosporidium in aquatic environments and its potential transmission through
    fish consumption are notable fish-borne risk factors (Moratal et al., 2020). The
    inclusion of zoonotic Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in fish is a public
    health concern, emphasizing the association between fishborne cryptosporidiosis
    and the handling and consumption of infected fish (Certad et al., 2015; Couso-Pérez
    et al., 2018; Koinari et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2010; Ziarati et al., 2022).
    Among the zoonotic subtypes, C. parvum is the most identified source of zoonotic
    infections, and has been detected in numerous fish species and geographical regions,
    including wild and farmed edible fish. Although the prevalence of infections and
    diseases is generally low, trout species have exhibited the highest prevalence
    (Couso-Pérez et al., 2018, Couso-Pérez et al., 2019). Cryptosporidium in cultured
    trout is significant, mainly due to the stressful conditions associated with farming,
    such as increased fish density, which facilitates pathogen transmission (Alvarez-Pellitero
    et al., 2004). This is further compounded by the increased prevalence observed
    during the early growing stages, as fish have an undeveloped and immature immune
    system (Sitjà-Bobadilla et al., 2005). Moreover, the recent identification of
    C. ubiquitum, which is responsible for human infections, in the European sea bass
    in Spain shows an additional risk for consumers (Moratal et al., 2022). The detection
    of parasites in fish fillets is likely attributable to the fish preparation process,
    including potential contamination during evisceration and cleaning processes (Certad
    et al., 2015). This underscores the possibility of contamination of the edible
    parts of the fish from the digestive tract. Zoonotic Cryptosporidium species in
    edible fish broaden the spectrum of emerging foods responsible for cryptosporidiosis,
    emphasizing their potential threat to public health. Table 6 provides an overview

    Reghaissia et al., 2022 7. Zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. - risk
    to farmers People in contact with wastewater have a heightened risk of gastrointestinal
    infection. Surprisingly, relatively less attention has been directed toward comprehending
    the threat faced by farmers routinely exposed to wastewater, particularly in the
    urban and peri-urban irrigation hubs used for food production. The absence of
    well-structured on-farm practices and utilization of suitable irrigation techniques,
    coupled with the lack of on-farm wastewater treatment, elevates the annual risk
    of infection to a tolerable threshold. There is a notable direct correlation between
    the calculated likelihood of farmers'' exposure and certain vital factors, such
    as the concentration of pathogens in irrigation water, the method employed for
    on-farm water treatment, the frequency of accidental wastewater ingestion, and
    the frequency of exposure to Cryptosporidium spp., as detailed by Sampson et al.
    (2017). It is essential to recognize that the infective dose remains a critical
    parameter, signifying a substantial risk, as it is challenging to precisely predict
    the quantity of Cryptosporidium spp. that may be ingested daily through unintentional
    wastewater consumption. Domestic animals infected with Cryptosporidium can serve
    as reservoirs for transmitting the infection to susceptible individuals, including
    humans. People working closely with farmed animals, such as farmers and vets,
    are at an increased risk of contracting infection. Individuals who handle animals
    on calf farms, such as calf handlers, face an increased risk of contracting diarrhoea
    due to cryptosporidiosis transmitted from infected calves. Cattle are considered
    a substantial reservoir and source of zoonotic infection because C. parvum subtypes
    that infect humans have been found in cattle (Xiao and Fayer, 2008). This highlights
    the potential for the transmission of Cryptosporidium from cattle to humans, posing
    a significant public health concern. C. parvum is an important zoonotic pathogen
    that can cause severe outbreaks of diarrhoea in industrialized countries, particularly
    in vulnerable populations such as immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV patients),
    children, and the elderly (Xiao and Feng, 2008). These groups are more susceptible
    to severe symptoms and complications following infection with Cryptosporidium.
    For immunocompromised individuals, additional precautions are necessary to prevent
    exposure to Cryptosporidium spp. It is advisable to restrict access to young animals
    and potentially even restrict their access to farms to minimize the risk of infection
    (Fayer et al., 2000a; Karanis et al., 2007). Applying a quantitative microbial
    risk assessment approach revealed a notable incidence of waterborne pathogens
    affecting urban farmers use wastewater for agricultural and aquaculture purposes.
    In Africa, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium among farmers exhibits a spectrum
    that aligns with the expected range derived from previous prevalence reports on
    Cryptosporidium infections in children and adults (Squire et al., 2017). In specific
    instances, dairy farm labourers have exhibited a significant parasite prevalence,
    as documented by Siwila et al. (2007). Notably, within these farm environments,
    C. parvum was identified in 75 % of the individuals who tested positive among
    farm workers and 60 % of household members. This observation points to the possibility
    of zoonotic transmission on these farms, stemming from infected animals. In Pakistan,
    individuals cohabiting with domestic animals such as cows, sheep, buffaloes, and
    goats appear to be at a heightened risk of infection. The highest prevalence rates
    have been observed among individuals close to domestic animals and those with
    suspected human interactions, particularly in areas where cows, buffalos, and
    other domesticated animals frequently access and utilize surface water sources,
    including rivers, streams, and canals (Khan et al., 2019). In Vietnam, the prevalence
    of gastrointestinal infections has led to a significant disease burden, which
    is notably higher among farmers than in the general population. This disparity
    exceeds the revised WHO tolerable threshold by more than a hundredfold, as described
    by Fuhrimann et al. (2017). This divergence is expected given that farmers in
    developing nations engage in non-mechanized farming practices and frequently come
    into contact with infected animals. In contrast, in the United Kingdom, other
    European countries, New Zealand, and China, where intensive dairy farming practices
    are prevalent, the elevated prevalence of the disease is likely attributable to
    transmission via livestock, and C. parvum has assumed a more prominent role in
    causing cryptosporidiosis than C. hominis (Lebbad et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2021).
    Moreover, a potential risk is associated with handling fish that carry zoonotic
    Cryptosporidium species. This risk becomes more pronounced during the preparation
    and handling of fish as it facilitates parasite transmission. An evaluation of
    probabilistic risk, encompassing both fish and hand wash samples, indicated that
    fishermen are vulnerable to infection after fishing activities and the consumption
    of captured fish, a risk scenario substantiated by Roberts et al. (2007). This
    risk is further corroborated by C. parvum transmission, which was confirmed when
    handling blue crabs (Graczyk et al., 2007). 8. Prevention and mitigation strategies
    in primary production The One Health concept provides several prospects for preventing
    cryptosporidiosis, particularly regarding the infection caused by C. parvum and
    other zoonotic species that affect animal and human health (Innes et al., 2020).
    This approach can be primarily practical via: 1. Manure treatment to reduce oocyst
    viability. 2. Protection of water catchments from contamination with livestock
    faeces. 3. Prevention and control of infection in livestock. Effective reduction
    of oocyst viability can be achieved through practices such as slurry storage,
    precise composting of manure (where oocysts become inactive at temperatures exceeding
    60 °C), low pH and ammonia levels, and mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion
    processes (Vermeulen et al., 2017). Therefore, managing manure and slurry on farmlands
    can diminish the viability of Cryptosporidium oocysts and subsequently minimize
    the potential for infection in the environment, particularly in water catchments
    (Kay et al., 2012). Implementing comprehensive preventive and regulatory strategies
    aimed at mitigating cryptosporidiosis in livestock and adopting farm management
    practices to minimize environmental contamination with infectious oocysts yields
    significant positive outcomes in terms of animal health, welfare, and productivity.
    These measures provide economic benefits for livestock farmers on a global scale
    and mitigate parasite transmission by safeguarding the environment and water catchments
    (Innes et al., 2020). Effective management of surface runoff, excluding grazing
    animals from these areas, is essential in curbing the potential dissemination
    of oocysts into surface streams, employing management strategies that maintain
    high vegetation that allows heating and UV radiation penetration in the soil surface,
    leading to the inactivation of oocysts. Considering that a substantial portion
    of oocysts resides in the lower layers of forage, transitioning livestock to pastures
    with taller vegetation can reduce their exposure to oocysts and subsequently decrease
    infection rates and environmental contamination. Potential approaches to mitigate
    the substantial contamination risks posed to water resources, include canopy management
    techniques, wildlife management practices, and the implementation of short-cycle
    rotational grazing strategies to prevent infection and subsequent environmental
    pollution (Boyer and Kuczynska, 2010; Innes et al., 2020). Given the absence of
    an effective vaccine against cryptosporidiosis in livestock, disease prevention
    can be achieved by providing ample quantities of high-quality colostrum to newborn
    calves within the first few hours of life. Particular attention should be paid
    to segregating younger calves into age-specific groups, as they are particularly
    susceptible to infection by older calves. Infected calves should be isolated from
    healthy animals for at least one week after the cessation of diarrhoea to minimize
    transmission (Innes et al., 2020). Moreover, implementing measures such as regular
    sanitation of pens, ensuring deep and clean straw bedding, maintaining appropriate
    housing with elevated feeding and water troughs, and employing steam cleaning
    techniques are strongly recommended to minimize exposure of calves to faecal matter
    within the surrounding environment (Meganck et al., 2014). Disinfection with hydrogen
    peroxide can further reduce the proliferation of contaminated faeces on farms.
    At the same time, hydrated lime is indicated as an efficient disinfectant to reduce
    contamination in calf pens (Björkman et al., 2018; Innes et al., 2020). In addition,
    implementing vegetative surface treatments on livestock farms is an effective
    measure to provide soil stabilization during storm events. Straw mulch has emerged
    as a widely adopted technique for mitigating soil erosion resulting from soil
    particle entrainment and raindrop impact on bare soil surfaces (Miller et al.,
    2008). Implementing good agricultural practices and meticulous handling protocols,
    robust risk prevention measures, and adopting alternative decontamination methods
    are paramount to effectively prevent and mitigate outbreaks stemming from contaminated
    fresh produce. Furthermore, incorporating vegetative filter strips has consistently
    demonstrated their merit in reducing runoff and impeding pathogen transport of
    pathogens (Innes et al., 2020). In addition to the implementation of vegetated
    and riparian buffer strips, the strategic fencing of livestock to restrict their
    access to streams and other water bodies serves as a valuable measure to disrupt
    the Cryptosporidium oocysts in water resources (Kay et al., 2012). 9. Conclusion
    Agricultural settings can serve as a potential source of Cryptosporidium species
    contamination due to faecal matter from both humans and animals. Contamination
    from agricultural sources can lead to water pollution, affecting the water used
    for drinking, recreational activities, and irrigation. Cryptosporidium infections
    are of significant concern in farming practices, as they are closely linked to
    the production of fresh fruits, vegetables, terrestrial and aquatic animals, and
    public health. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a novel conceptual framework
    for the agricultural sector. Farmers are frequently exposed to wastewater, rendering
    them susceptible to an elevated risk of Cryptosporidium infections. It is imperative
    to establish an active policy framework that incorporates a multi-barrier strategy
    aimed at reducing farmer-wastewater interactions and mitigating disease risks.
    Implementing enhanced wastewater management regulations specifically designed
    to safeguard farmers and diminish their exposure to oocysts, is a vital requirement.
    The adoption of a proactive management approach is indispensable for effectively
    reducing the risks associated with such directions. The guidelines provided by
    the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding wastewater reuse present a comprehensive
    framework suitable for developing nations. These guidelines encompass a range
    of approaches that can be customized for local policies and cultural contexts.
    They were given priority in a multi-barrier strategy that focused on the mitigation
    of Cryptosporidium spp. The presence of accidental infection in farmers through
    the incorporation of appropriate measures to minimize direct sewage exposure is
    of utmost importance. Local policy directives play a vital role in successfully
    implementing this approach to effectively reduce infection risk among farmers.
    Farmers are pivotal in the agricultural sector, and implementing on-farm management
    measures can significantly mitigate the risk of Cryptosporidium spp. exposure,
    contingent upon providing comprehensive training to farmers. Research has consistently
    shown that well-informed farmers possess heightened awareness of the health hazards
    associated with urban farming and proactively adopt practices to diminish these
    risks, underscoring their enhanced proficiency in risk management. CRediT authorship

  description: Tea trees (Camellia sinensis), a quintessential homestead agroforestry
    crop cultivated in over 60 countries, hold significant economic and social importance
    as a vital specialty cash crop. Accurate nationwide crop data is imperative for
    effective agricultural management and resource regulation. However, many regions
    grapple with a lack of agroforestry cash crop data, impeding sustainable development
    and poverty eradication, especially in economically underdeveloped countries.
    The large-scale mapping of tea plantations faces substantial limitations and challenges
    due to their sparse distribution compared to field crops, unfamiliar characteristics,
    and spectral confusion among various land cover types (e.g., forests, orchards,
    and farmlands). To address these challenges, we developed the Manual management
    And Phenolics substance-based Tea mapping (MAP-Tea) framework by harnessing Sentinel-1/2
    time series images for automated tea plantation mapping. Tea trees, exhibiting
    higher phenolic content, evergreen characteristics, and multiple shoot sprouting,
    result in extensive canopy coverage, stable soil exposure, and radar backscatter
    signal interference from frequent picking activities. We developed three phenology-based
    indicators focusing on phenolic content, vegetation coverage, and canopy texture
    leveraging the temporal features of vegetation, pigments, soil, and radar backscattering.
    Characteristics of biochemical substance content and manual management measures
    were applied to tea mapping for the first time. The MAP-Tea framework successfully
    generated China's first updated 10 m resolution tea plantation map in 2022. It
    achieved an overall accuracy of 94.87% based on 16,712 reference samples, with
    a kappa coefficient of 0.83 and an F1 score of 85.63%. The tea trees are typically
    cultivated in mountainous and hilly areas with a relatively low planting density
    (averaging about 10%). Alpine tea trees exhibited a notably dense concentration
    and dominance, mainly found in regions with elevations ranging from 700 m to 2000
    m and slopes between 2° to 18°. The areas with low altitudes and slopes hold the
    largest tea plantation area and output. As the slope increased, there was a gradual
    decline in the dominance of tea areas. The results suggest a good potential for
    the knowledge-based approaches, combining biochemical substance content and human
    activities, for national-scale tea plantation mapping in complex environment conditions
    and challenging landscapes, providing important reference significance for mapping
    other agroforestry crops. This study contributes significantly to advancing the
    achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) considering the crucial
    role that agroforestry crops play in fostering economic growth and alleviating
    poverty. The first 10m national Tea tree data products in China with good accuracy
    (ChinaTea10m) are publicly accessed at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25047308.

    • Developed the first updated 10-m tea map covering China''s tea-producing areas.
    • Emphasized the distinctive features of tea plantations including high phenolic
    content and human measures. • Employed a knowledge-based mapping algorithm to
    extract large-scale tea plantations. • Differentiated tea plantations from other
    agroforestry crops. • Revealed that tea trees at high-moderate altitudes and low-moderate
    slopes exhibit higher dominance. Abstract Tea trees (Camellia sinensis), a quintessential
    homestead agroforestry crop cultivated in over 60 countries, hold significant
    economic and social importance as a vital specialty cash crop. Accurate nationwide

    with a relatively low planting density (averaging about 10%). Alpine tea trees
    exhibited a notably dense concentration and dominance, mainly found in regions
    with elevations ranging from 700 m to 2000 m and slopes between 2° to 18°. The
    areas with low altitudes and slopes hold the largest tea plantation area and output.
    As the slope increased, there was a gradual decline in the dominance of tea areas.
    The results suggest a good potential for the knowledge-based approaches, combining
    biochemical substance content and human activities, for national-scale tea plantation
    mapping in complex environment conditions and challenging landscapes, providing
    important reference significance for mapping other agroforestry crops. This study
    contributes significantly to advancing the achievement of the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) considering the crucial role that agroforestry crops play in fostering
    economic growth and alleviating poverty. The first 10m national Tea tree data

    1. Introduction Agroforestry holds considerable promise in enhancing food security,
    livelihoods, and environmental resource conservation, playing a pivotal role in
    achieving Sustainable Development Goals (Ruba and Talucder, 2023). Tea trees,
    as quintessential components of homestead agroforestry, are extensively cultivated
    in >60 countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, serving as a vital special
    cash crop in developing nations (Xia et al., 2020). The robust growth of tea cultivation
    and its associated industries significantly contributes to the creation of employment
    opportunities, income elevation, and regional economic prosperity. Importantly,
    it serves as a crucial source of foreign exchange for developing countries like
    Kenya and Sri Lanka (Kagira et al., 2012; Thushara, 2015). Therefore, promoting
    the global development of tea cultivation and associated industries, especially
    in developing countries, plays a pivotal role in supporting the implementation
    of SDG strategies, including No poverty (SDG1), Good health and well-being (SDG3),
    Decent work and economic growth (SDG8) and so on (Yin et al., 2023) (Fig.1). Download

    The output of tea reveals the importance of special cash crops in achieving SDGs.
    Globally major tea-producing countries and the overview of the study area (FAO:
    Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). Tea trees, classified
    as subtropical plants, thrive in warm and humid areas with ample thermal energy,
    making tropical and subtropical areas particularly conducive to their growth.
    Asia accounts for over 90% of the global tea plantation area, followed by Africa.
    Tea holds immense economic significance in the economies of tea-producing nations
    (Ahmed et al., 2018). Renowned for its rich content of phenolics, amino acids,
    caffeine, and other bioactive chemical compounds, tea is highly valued for its
    edible and therapeutic properties (Zhang et al., 2020). Due to the diverse bioactive
    compounds present, by-products derived from tea leaves find extensive applications
    across the food, pharmaceutical, and industrial sectors, significantly contributing
    to income diversification (Wei et al., 2023). For instance, extracts from tea
    leaves are utilized as additives in the food and medical industries, and they
    also play a role in microbial fuel cells and other industrial applications (Liu
    et al., 2023a, Liu et al., 2023b; Ta et al., 2023). China''s tea leaves production
    has soared to 1.37 billion tons, with a harvested area exceeding 3.37 million
    hectares in 2021, as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (FAOSTAT).
    This positions China as the foremost global producer of tea. The development of
    tea plantations and their related industries has provided economic opportunities
    to laborers in remote and economically depressed rural areas, contributing positively
    to rural revitalization and augmenting farmers'' income (Kang et al., 2023). Despite
    the substantial economic benefits observed in the tea industry, the rapid expansion
    of tea plantations has led to deforestation and encroachment on arable land, posing
    ecological challenges and raising concerns to land resource management, which
    in turn impacts food security (Li et al., 2019; Zhen et al., 2023). Therefore,
    striking a balance between promoting the economic growth of tea plantations for
    income generation and addressing potential threats to food security requires precise
    and efficient government oversight and decision-making. Accurate and reliable
    information about the distribution of tea plantations plays a crucial role in
    optimizing agricultural production planning and fostering sustainable agricultural
    development. Additionally, it facilitates predicting the output of the tea industry
    and assessing the carbon sequestration potential of tea plantations within the
    agricultural sector. Remote sensing serves as a crucial tool for efficiently acquiring
    agricultural data, encompassing crop types, distribution, growth, and yield in
    farmland (Qiu et al., 2022b). However, specialty cash crops, notably agroforestry
    crops, have received comparatively less attention compared to staple field crops,
    which generally occupy larger cultivation areas (Nabil et al., 2022). Among these
    agroforestry crops, the spatial distribution of tea plantations has gained prominence
    in recent years. Devi et al. (2012) utilized IRS P6 AWiFS data and ISODATA clustering
    algorithm for an unsupervised classification of tea plantations in Barak Valley,
    Assam, India, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.27%. Akar and Güngör (2015)
    extracted texture information from WorldView-2 images, combined with NDVI, and
    applied a random forest classification algorithm to distinguish various crop types,
    including tea and hazelnuts, in the eastern Black Sea region of Turkey, surpassing
    an overall accuracy of 87%. Parida et al. delineated the dynamic distribution
    of tea plantations in North Bengal and Assam, India, using Sentinel-2 and Landsat
    data for past years (Parida and Kumari, 2021; Parida et al., 2023). Traditional
    approaches to tea plantation mapping have been within the Land Use/Land Cover
    framework (Li et al., 2019; Qu, Le''an, Manchun Li, Zhenjie Chen, Wangbing Liu,
    Junjun Zhi, and Lechun Zhang., 2022). While studies have predominantly focused
    on predominantly tea plantations from prominent vegetation categories like forests
    and croplands, challenges arise in distinguishing tea from other woody evergreen
    agroforestry crops, such as fruit trees, due to similarities in planting arrangements
    and human activities (Dihkan et al., 2013). Machine learning approaches leveraging
    the phenological characteristics of tea trees have been widely adopted in tea
    plantation mapping (Chen et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Rahimi-Ajdadi and Khani,
    2021). However, these studies often face constraints in relatively small areas
    due to feature redundancy, complex model structures, and the need for extensive
    training labels (Li et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2023). Consequently,
    mapping large-scale tea plantations continues to pose significant challenges.
    Furthermore, the remote sensing characteristics and phenology of tea trees exhibit
    regional heterogeneity due to diverse species, management practices, and environmental
    factors (Li et al., 2019). Addressing these challenges, automated knowledge-based
    mapping approaches have demonstrated potential by utilizing predefined rules without
    the need for extensive calibrations (Qiu et al., 2022a). In contrast to data-driven
    algorithms, knowledge-based approaches offer the advantage of facilitating large-scale
    applications across regions and years without the need for retraining (Planque
    et al., 2021; Arvor et al., 2021). The essence of constructing knowledge-based
    mapping methods lies in establishing the correlations between remote sensing features
    and crop attributes, a process that demands substantial expertise (Qiu et al.,
    2021). The introduction of knowledge graphs effectively integrates these two domains
    at the knowledge level. Temporal features within the knowledge graph are extensively
    employed for constructing crop mapping methods. Research has employed that developing
    multidimensional remote sensing feature knowledge graph-based crop attribute knowledge
    helps in identifying the optimal feature that comprehensively captures crop differences
    (Zhao et al., 2022). To the best of our knowledge, tea trees exhibit various crop
    attributes, including being rich in phenolic substances, maintaining their evergreen
    nature throughout the year, and being subject to human management measures like
    picking and pruning. In this study, by leveraging the distinctive properties of
    tea trees, we constructed a knowledge graph containing tea tree knowledge and
    its corresponding remote sensing features to distinguish tea trees from other
    vegetation types. Typically, temporal metrics developed by analyzing crop growth
    period characteristics are employed. However, it''s crucial to have adequate and
    reliable observation data (Wang et al., 2023). The utilization of dense time series
    observations has gained increasing popularity due to its capability to observe,
    monitor, and characterize land cover information and changes (Zhu et al., 2022).
    The high temporal and spatial resolution of Sentinels (Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2
    MSI) data has significantly enhanced the application of remote sensing in monitoring
    and classifying land cover, encompassing crop mapping, yield prediction, and phenology
    monitoring (Qiu et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022). Sentinel-2
    optical data with its intensive time series helps alleviate the difficulty of
    determining the optimal crop identification period, enabling effective detection
    and extraction of crop phenological characteristic (Vuolo et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    optical data is susceptible to cloud cover, leading to limited temporal information
    and impacting classification accuracy (Tian et al., 2022). In contrast, Sentinel-1
    is independent of cloudiness and allows all-weather observation. SAR signals provide
    valuable information on the physical and structural properties of vegetation canopies,
    particularly in regions with complex environmental and climatic conditions (Orynbaikyzy
    et al., 2019). In recent years, the integration of optical and radar data for
    crop mapping has emerged as an important approach (Qiu et al., 2023). Radar images
    can serve as a substitute for optical images, especially in cloudy areas, augmenting
    the identification of specific crops (Ghazaryan et al., 2018; Bargiel, 2017).
    Recent studies have combined Sentinel-1/2 data, effectively improving the accuracy
    of tea plantations identification and successfully addressing challenges associated
    with the absence of optical data, demonstrating its potential for mapping applications
    (Gao et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2022). Agroforestry crops, especially in developing
    countries, offer significant economic and social benefits. However, there exists
    a dearth of timely and accurate data on these crops. This study seeks to enhance
    remote sensing applications for agroforestry crops, with a specific focus on mapping
    tea plantations, thus addressing the data gap prevalent in developing countries.
    Furthermore, it provides a valuable reference for subsequent remote sensing extraction
    of other agroforestry crops. Due to the relatively sparse distribution of agroforestry
    crops compared to field crops, coupled with the unfamiliarity regarding their
    typical characteristics and the common issue of spectral confusion among various
    landcover types, remote sensing applications encounter substantial limitations
    and challenges. Therefore, our research aimed to address the following scientific
    questions: (1) What are the distinctive characteristics of the tea trees? (2)
    Can features derived from tea tree crop attributes be utilized for mapping, especially
    those based on biochemical substance content and manual management measures associated
    with tea trees? 2. Materials 2.1. Study area The study area is situated in the
    primary tea-producing areas of China (Fig.1) (20°13′24″N ∼ 39°35′5″N, 97°20′53″E
    ∼ 123°9′20″E), spanning 16 provinces: Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hubei, Fujian,
    Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Chongqing,
    Jiangsu, and Shandong. Covering over 3.1 million square kilometers, the study
    area exhibits diverse topography, including plateaus, mountains, and hills (Fig.S1).
    The study area contributes 99% of the country''s tea plantation area and annual
    production. Significant variations exist in climate, topography, and agricultural
    production activities among the different provinces within the study area. Annual
    precipitation averaged 1230.0 mm year−1 across these provinces, ranging from 659
    mm year−1 in Shaanxi to 2088 mm year−1 in Guangdong. The annual cumulative temperatures
    above 10 degrees Celsius (Anderson and Cerkowniak, 2010) ranged from 2460.3 °C-d
    in Sichuan to 4071.2 °C-d in Henan. Topography varied across the study area, with
    the average elevation ranging from 13 m in Jiangsu to 2599 m in Sichuan. In terms
    of agricultural production, northern areas like Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu
    provinces are predominantly plains, and major agricultural provinces, with >10%
    of the land under cultivation. In the east, provinces such as Fujian, Guangdong
    and Zhejiang provinces are mainly mountainous and hilly regions with limited arable
    land resources. Agriculture in these areas focuses on agroforestry cash crops,
    particularly the cultivation of fruits, tea, and other horticultural crops. These
    provinces also boast abundant forest resources, contributing to the relatively
    developed forestry economy. In the western provinces such as Sichuan and Yunnan,
    lower average temperatures due to higher altitudes result in alpine forest dominance.
    Table S1 illustrates the variation in climate, topography, and the number of available
    images across the study areas. 2.2. Sentinel-1 SAR images and preprocessing We
    processed a total of 6566 Sentinel-1 SAR images covering the full extent of the
    study area in 2022. We processed Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products
    hosted on GEE (Google Earth Engine) (Gorelick et al., 2017) through the following
    procedures of pre-processing: 1) Sentinel-1 imagery was limited to interferometric
    wide (IW) mode, which acquires data that provide VV and VH backscatter with spatial
    resolution of 10 × 10 m (Vanderhoof et al., 2023). Since Sentinel-1 acquires radar
    imagery data globally through both ascending and descending orbits, it is essential
    to determine which one to use based on the specific characteristics and requirements
    of the study area. In this study, images collected in the descending orbits were
    selected for the study areas. 2) Processing of Sentinel-1 SAR data hosted in GEE
    is limited to thermal noise removal, data calibration, multi-looking, and range-doppler
    terrain correction. However, for applications like terrestrial analysis, additional
    preprocessing are necessary to make it more suitable for complex terrain conditions
    (Lewis et al., 2018). The preprocessed Level-1 GRD products were further processed
    to ARD (Analysis Ready Data) products through the published wrapper functions
    within the GEE platform, including border noise correction, speckle filtering
    and radiometric terrain normalization (Mullissa et al., 2021; Sinha et al., 2015).
    3) To extract the derivative information of Sentinel-1 SAR data, the GLCM (Gray-Level
    Co-occurrence Matrix) function available on GEE was used to compute statistical
    feature known as Savg (Sum of Average) based on the VH backscatter (Nabil et al.,
    2022). Furthermore, through the subsequent steps of linear interpolation of missing
    data, generation of 10-day composite time series and Whittaker Smoother (Qiu et
    al., 2021), we obtained a time-series of statistical texture features derived
    from VH backscatter, which comprises 37 periods of data captured at 10-day intervals
    throughout the year 2022. 2.3. Sentinel-2 MSI images and preprocessing We processed
    a total of 76,742 Sentinel-2 MSI images covering the full extent of the study
    area in 2022. All the available images were accessed through the GEE platform.
    And the preprocessing methods regarding Sentinel-2 optical data are as follows:
    1) The Sentinel-2 bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) image collection (Level-2 A) was
    used, which offers more realistic surface reflectance data (Kuhn et al., 2019;
    Main-Knorn et al., 2017). Since the optical sensors on the Sentinel-2 satellite
    can be affected by cloud and cloud shadows, leading to contamination of the observations.
    To address the contamination as well as radiometric-saturated observations, both
    the Quality Assessment (QA) band and the Cloud Probability product were employed
    to filter observations (Tang et al., 2023). Eligible observations were filtered
    out through the de-clouded code on the GEE. Due to the high frequency of clouds
    in the study area, the thresholds for clouds and shadows need to be adjusted for
    different regions. 2) We then calculated the 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index
    (EVI2) (Karimi et al., 2023), Red-edge Chlorophyll Index (CIre) (Zhang et al.,
    2022a, Zhang et al., 2022b), and Dry Bare-Soil Index (DBSI) (Rasul et al., 2018)
    from the preprocessed Sentinel-2 data, which were used to indicate the characteristics
    of vegetation, pigmentation, and soil, respectively (Table S2). Indeed, the acquired
    band and vegetation index datasets from Sentinel-2 were also subjected to preprocessing
    procedures such as linear interpolation, 10-day image mosaic and Whittaker Smoother.
    We obtained time-series datasets containing bands and vegetation indices, which
    comprises 37 periods of data captured at 10-day intervals throughout the year
    2022. 2.4. Ground reference data and additional datasets Ground reference data
    were acquired for training and validation purposes through multiple survey collections
    and utilizing methods such as Google Earth images. The high recognition of tea
    plantations in Google Earth images enables the augmentation of tea plantation
    reference data (Xia et al., 2023). By amalgamating ground reference points obtained
    from field surveys, a total of 55,704 reference points were compiled (Fig.S2).
    Of these, 53,807 points represented vegetation, whereas 1897 points represented
    non-vegetation. The vegetation points encompassed various crop types, including
    farmland crops (31,912 points), orchard crops (4570 points), and tea plantations
    (10,001 points). Additionally, there were 7324 points representing non-crop areas.
    Regarding data on the tea plantation area, the agricultural census data reported
    in 2021 (at the municipal level) and 2022 (at the provincial level) were all utilized.
    Given that tea trees constitute perennial evergreen shrubby vegetation, the area
    undergoes minimal change within adjacent years. To evaluate the influence of topographic
    factors on the spatial distribution of tea plantations, topographic variables
    such as elevation and slope were derived using the global Shuttle Radar Topography
    Mission (SRTM) digital elevation data with a 30 m pixel size (Abd Rahman et al.,
    2022). To ensure compatibility with the Sentinel data, all the topographic variables
    were resampled to a resolution of 10 m. 3. Methodology Several distinctive properties
    characterize tea trees (Fig.2), (1) Abundant phenolic substances: Tea tree leaves
    contain rich phenolic substances, including tea polyphenols. The short-wave infrared
    (SWIR) region is effective in directly indicating the biochemical composition
    at leaf and canopy levels (Bian et al., 2013; Kokaly and Skidmore, 2015; Luo et
    al., 2022). (2) Evergreen nature and multiple new shoots: Categorized as evergreen
    shrubs, tea trees undergo multiple rounds of new shoots during spring, summer,
    and fall, particularly under manual picking conditions, resulting in the sprouting
    of 5–6 rounds of new shoots. This continuous growth, coupled with higher vegetation
    cover and lower soil exposure, imparts distinctive temporal characteristics to
    its vegetation index, setting it apart from seasonal crops. (3) Specialized manual
    management practices: Tea trees are subject to special manual management practices,
    including pruning and picking (Xu et al., 2022). Pruning is employed to maintain
    a maximum canopy area, facilitating light radiation to promote new bud sprouting.
    Each round of sprouting is subsequently harvested. Both picking and pruning activities
    alter the canopy''s shape, influencing canopy scattering for radar signals, particularly
    with high-frequency activities impacting radar time-series signals. Download :

    graph of tea tree attributes and the remote sensing temporal profiles. A novel
    framework for mapping tea plantation using Sentinel-1/2 images was developed (Fig.3).
    The proposed framework consists of characterizing cultivated crops, farmland,
    and horticultural crops through three phenology -based indicators, and subsequently
    extracting tea plantations. The first two indicators were developed based on Sentinel-2
    images, enabling the differentiation of evergreen horticultural crops from other
    cultivated crops and other vegetation. The last indicator was proposed based on
    Sentinel-1 images to specifically extract tea trees from other woody horticultural
    crops. All the procedures were implemented using the GEE platform. Download :

    of the tea plantation mapping incorporating pre-processing, metrics designing/developing,
    algorithm application and validation. 3.1. Design of phenolic compound index and
    construction of tea polyphenol phenology index (TPPI) using Sentinel-2 time series
    3.1.1. Designing phenolic compound index through green and SWIR bands of Sentinel-2
    images Several studies have identified a relationship between the short-wave infrared
    (SWIR) band and the absorption characteristics of biochemical substances, such
    as phenolic compounds, found near 1.66 μm (Kokaly and Skidmore, 2015). However,
    due to the overlapping absorption of water, the spectral characteristics of the
    vegetation canopy are diminished. Additionally, specific wavelengths in the visible
    light, red-edge, and short-wave infrared bands have been identified for monitoring
    biochemical substances in tea at the canopy scale (Bian et al., 2013). Nevertheless,
    studies on phenolic spectral characteristics are typically based on higher spectral
    resolution, necessitating further testing for application in multispectral satellite
    remote sensing. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the visible, red-edge,
    and short-wave infrared bands of Sentinel-2 images. Consequently, we developed
    the Phenolic Compound Index (PCI) (Eq.1) by mathematically converting the Green
    and SWIR2 bands. This index undergoes spectral information from both bands and
    undergoes a logarithmic enhancement transformation to augment its discriminative
    power. It is important to note that this index requires further evaluation, and
    alternative methods may exist for constructing an index that is even more sensitive
    to phenolic content. (1) 3.1.2. Construction of tea polyphenol-based phenology
    index (TPPI) using Sentinel-2 time series PCI serves as an indicator reflecting
    the nutrient status of vegetation, resulting in higher temporal profiles for cultivated
    crops compared to other vegetation, particularly during the EVI2 high-value range
    indicative of vigorous growth (Fig.4). Leveraging the EVI2 and PCI time series,
    we formulated three distinctive metrics: high-value accumulation (HA), high-value
    robustness (HR) and high-value dominance (HD). Initially, we identified the high-value
    interval using the 50th percentile of the EVI2, representing the segment surpassing
    this percentile in the EVI2 temporal profile (highlighted in light green in Fig.5
    (a)). Subsequently, the PCI time series within this interval were utilized to
    calculate HA, HR, and HD. HA is the summation of the absolute values of the first-order
    differences in the PCI temporal profile within the specified time range, depicting
    the change in the index over time. HR quantifies the ratio of the range (LR) to
    the length of time (LT) of the PCI temporal profile within the specified time
    range, providing a numerical indicator of the degree of variation. HD represents
    the absolute value of the average value of the PCI temporal profile calculated
    within the designated time range. Ultimately, the first optical phenological indicator,
    Tea Polyphenol-based Phenology Index (TPPI) (Fig.5 (a), Eq.5), was developed by
    integrating it with the characteristic metrics. Notably, the TPPI value exhibits
    an inverse relationship with the phenolic content, where a lower TPPI value corresponds
    to a higher phenolic content. (2) (3) (4) (5) Note: pk is the value of index PCI

    based on the VH backscatter). (For interpretation of the references to colour
    in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
    3.2. Construction of tea biochemical-based phenology index (TBPI) using Sentinel-2
    time series Farmland crops display pronounced seasonality owing to their annual
    planting and harvesting cycles, while deciduous vegetation undergoes a regular
    pattern of leafing and defoliation throughout the year. Consequently, this results
    in significant seasonal variations in the temporal profiles of vegetation indices
    for such seasonal vegetation. In contrast, evergreen agroforestry crops, such
    as fruit trees and tea trees, maintain their green foliage year-round, leading
    to minimal changes in their vegetation indices over time (Fig.4). To capture these
    distinctions between evergreen and seasonal vegetation, the vegetation, pigment,
    and soil indices were amalgamated to form the Vegetation Phenology Separation
    Index (VPSI), reflecting variations across the biochemical properties of vegetation
    (Eq.6). Subsequently, the optical phenology index, Tea Biochemical-based Phenology
    Index (TBPI), was specifically tailored for tea plantations to differentiate between
    evergreen and seasonal vegetation (Fig.5 (b), Eq.7). A lower TBPI value signifies
    an extended duration of green vegetation coverage, with evergreen vegetation typically
    exhibiting lower TBPI values, while seasonal vegetation tends to have higher TBPI
    values. (6) (7) Note: i represents the period of the time series. 3.3. Construction
    of tea canopy texture-based phenology index (TCTI) using Sentinel-2 time series
    Tea plantations manifest distinct phenological periods, notably during activities
    such as picking and pruning. These human-induced activities bring about discernible
    changes in the temporal characteristics of radar textures within tea plantations.
    Particularly intensively managed tea plantations undergo multiple picking and
    pruning activities throughout the year. In contrast, other evergreen woody horticultural
    crops, while subject to similar human interventions, typically experience fruit
    ripening only once a year, resulting in less frequent anthropogenic activities
    compared to tea plantations. Consequently, tea trees exhibit greater variability
    in the frequency and magnitude of radar texture time series characteristics throughout
    the year (Fig.4). Based on these phenological characteristics, the radar phenological
    indicator, Tea Canopy Texture-based Phenology Index (TCTI), was formulated using
    the time series of VHsavg (Fig.5 (c), Eq.8). TCTI serves as a reflection of the
    overall interference level of radar backscattering throughout the year, where
    a higher TCTI indicates a more frequent occurrence of interference to radar backscattering
    within the vegetation canopy. (8) Note: VHsavg represents the texture statistical
    feature of Savg (Sum of Average) based on the VH backscatter; 1stdiff and 2nddiff
    represent the first-order difference and the second-order difference, respectively;
    and i represents the period of the time series. 3.4. Automatic knowledge-based
    tea plantation mapping algorithm by fusing Sentinel-1/2 images Mapping agroforestry
    crop presents challenges due to the impracticality of applying a cropland mask
    layer and the spectral similarities with woodlands, shrubs, and other agroforestry
    crops like fruit trees. This study introduced an innovative framework for tea
    plantation mapping that employs new optical and radar phenological indicators
    (TPPI, TBPI, and TCTI) derived from Sentinel-1/2 images (MAP-Tea). Initially,
    the vegetation area was delineated using the 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index
    (EVI2), forming the fundamental basis for subsequent classification frameworks.
    Subsequently, indicators derived from the attributes specific to tea trees were
    utilized to distinguish them from other vegetation types, including woodland,
    farmland, and fruit trees (Fig.6). Download : Download high-res image (294KB)

    algorithm for tea mapping (θ1, θ2, and θ3 respectively represent the thresholds
    of indicators TPPI, TBPI and TCTI). Phenolic compounds, essential bioactive substances
    that regulate vegetation growth, are found in plants with structural diversity,
    including fruits, tea, coffee, beans, vegetables, and other crops (Alara et al.,
    2021). Plants synthesize various organic compounds known as secondary metabolites
    during normal metabolic processes or under specific environmental conditions (e.g.,
    wounds, temperature, ultraviolet radiation, infection). Phenolic compounds can
    exist in forms such as functional derivatives, including methyl esters, esters,
    and glycosides (Olivoto et al., 2017). Widely present in edible plants, phenolic
    compounds are reported to be present in significant amounts in most plant-derived
    foods and agri-food wastes. Numerous studies have explored various sources of
    polyphenols, encompassing food waste, vegetables, fruits, microalgae, algae, tea
    (Alara et al., 2021; Huang et al., 1992). The first phenology-based indicator,
    TPPI, was constructed based on the phenolic compound index to reflect the phenolic
    content in vegetation. This indicator can distinguish edible cultivated crops
    including farmland and horticultural crops, from other crop types and natural
    vegetation. Subsequently, the second phenology-based indicator, TBPI, was utilized
    to differentiate between seasonal crops (including farmland and horticultural
    crops) and evergreen horticultural crops. The third phenology-based indicator,
    TCTI, was employed to identify tea plantations, which exhibit higher pruning and
    picking frequencies throughout the year, especially in comparison to other evergreen
    woody horticultural crops, such as evergreen fruit trees. 3.5. Accuracy assessment
    The accuracy of the tea mapping algorithm underwent verification through the utilization
    of agricultural statistics and reference point data. The distribution results
    of tea plantations in 2022 were consolidated at the municipal levels and compared
    with the statistics from the preceding year. Spatial distribution consistency
    was assessed using reference points gathered during field surveys and reference
    data obtained through visual interpretation based on Google Earth images. A random
    selection of 30% of these points was used for verification, and a confusion matrix
    was calculated. Evaluation of the classification results'' accuracy was conducted
    using metrics such as overall accuracy, user accuracy, producer accuracy, F1 score,
    and the Kappa coefficient. 4. Results 4.1. The first national-scale tea plantations
    map of China Approximately 70% of randomly selected reference points (38,992 points)
    were exploited to establish thresholds for each indicator, comprising 6998 tea
    points and 31,994 non-tea points. The specified values were set as follows: θ1
    = 60 for TPPI, θ2 = 4 for TBPI, and θ3 = 100 for TCTI (Fig.7 (a, b, c)). When
    assessing the efficacy of the proposed indicators in distinguishing different
    vegetation types, the TPPI and TBPI indicators based on optical data successfully
    differentiated forest and farmland, respectively (Fig.7 (d, e)). However, it was
    observed that optical indicators alone were unable to differentiate between tea
    plantations and other horticultural crops such as fruit orchards. In contrast,
    the TCTI indicator, utilizing radar data, proved effective in accurately extracting
    tea plantations (Fig.7 (f)). Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download

    The tea mapping result for the study area in 2022, generated by MAP-Tea, are illustrated
    in Fig.8. The total area of tea plantations in the primary tea-producing area
    of China was approximately 3.23 million hectares. The tea maps are predominantly
    highlight concentrated in the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau and the Southeastern Hills.
    The results revealed that tea trees are primarily cultivated in warm and humid
    subtropical climate zones, as well as transition zones between temperate and subtropical
    zones. The tea plantations consist mainly of taller tea trees with large and pointed
    leaves. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    tea plantation area in the study area was obtained using the MAP-Tea algorithm
    and subsequently compared with statistical data. In the primary tea-producing
    regions of China, the estimated tea area in 2022 was 3,233,270 ha, indicating
    a slight underestimation of 4.13% compared to the statistical data in 2022 (3,372,690
    ha). Notably, this underestimation was particularly evident in Guangxi, Hubei,
    and Henan provinces. The results revealed that the southwestern provinces boasted
    the most extensive tea plantation areas, with Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan surpassing
    400,000 ha each (541,648 ha in Yunnan, 457,722 ha in Guizhou and 401,010 ha in
    Sichuan) (Fig.9 (b)). Upon comparing the mapped tea plantation areas with statistical
    data from 102 municipalities, it was observed that the mapped tea plantation areas
    largely aligned with the statistical data from 2021, resulting in an R2 of 0.85

    (30% randomly selected) reference points within the study area are, are presented
    in Table 1. The overall accuracy (OA) achieved was 94.87%, with a Kappa coefficient
    of 0.83. Out of the 3003 tea plantation points, 2554 were correctly identified,
    resulting in an 85.05% agreement. However, 449 tea plantation points were misclassified.
    Given the relatively limited distribution area of tea trees, these misclassified
    sites were predominantly located at the bases of mountains or within enclosed
    mountainous forests, contributing to misclassification within the results. Download

    Concerning the 13,709 non-tea plantation points, 13,301 were accurately labeled
    (97.02% agreement). Among the 408 non-tea points misclassified as tea plantations,
    there were 254 farmland crop sites, 69 forest sites, 70 orchard sites, and 2 non-vegetation
    sites. Orchards represented the highest proportion of misclassification as tea
    plantations, constituting 5.1% of the orchard verification samples, followed by
    forests (3.5%). There seems to be spectral confusion between tea plantations and
    other homogeneous vegetation types like orchards and forests. We validated the
    accuracy of tea plantation mapping results using survey point data, which involved
    the verification of both tea plantation and non-tea plantation points. The distribution

    accuracy of our mapping results, we conducted accuracy verification in the primary
    tea-producing provinces, utilizing reference point data from each province (Table
    2). The overall accuracy (OA) across these provinces surpassed 91%, with Fujian
    Province achieving the highest Kappa coefficient of 0.88. Overall, the accuracy
    across different provinces underscores the satisfactory performance of the algorithm
    in tea plantation classification. Table 2. Accuracy assessment of main tea-producing

    spatial distribution of tea plantation is primarily influenced by environmental
    factors such as geomorphology, climate, and soil, as well as economic elements
    like agricultural practices and historical culture. Tea trees, forming a distinctive
    shrubland system, exhibit significant geographical suitability. Unlike farmland
    systems that typically congregate in gentle lowlands, tea trees thrive in various
    terrains including plains, mountains, and hills (Fig.13 (a)). The cultivation
    of tea trees spans different topographic conditions. Alpine tea production regions
    are found in plateau mountains, encompassing areas like Yunnan, Chongqing, Guizhou,
    as well as eastern regions such as Fujian and Zhejiang (elevation >500 m), accounting
    for 55.3% of the tea plantation area. Additionally, tea plantations are also clustered
    in lowland areas below 500 m, notably in the central region and the Sichuan basin,
    displaying a relatively dispersed distribution, which constitutes 44.7% of the
    tea plantation area). Due to the topographical influence, the spatial arrangement
    of tea plantations in the study area appears relatively decentralized, leading
    to a lower density of tea plantations distribution (an average proportion of 10%
    per unit area). Consequently, a 10% threshold was chosen to distinguish between
    high- and low-density tea plantations. Fig.13 (b) illustrates the distribution
    of high-density tea plantations across various municipalities. Regions in Zhejiang,
    Fujian, and parts of the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau showcase high-density tea plantations,
    with proportions exceeding 30%. The tea output of each province in these areas
    exceeds 20 billion CNY. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    with higher values indicating more tea plantation area), (b) Percentage of high-density
    tea plantations by municipality (the values represent the percentage of high-density
    tea plantations, where high-density indicates that the percentage of tea plantation
    area within the unit area is >10%), (c) Proportion of tea area under different
    slope and altitude ranges, and (d) The dominance of tea area and stacked chart
    of percentages of tea area at different elevations and slopes, respectively (the
    dominance represents the ratio of the tea area proportion in different altitudes
    or slopes to the total tea area proportion in the entire study area). Note: The
    circles in figure (b) and (c) represent tea plantations located at high and low
    altitudes respectively; The national average tea output is 96,000 CHY/ha. Researches
    have indicated a correlation between the content of tea polyphenols, amino acids
    and other nutrients in tea trees and altitude (Chen et al., 2010). Generally,
    tea produced at higher altitudes tends to possess a lower phenol-ammonia ratio,
    thereby offering superior quality because of light and temperature (Wang et al.,
    2022a, Wang et al., 2022b). However, as altitude rises, the temperature drops,
    impacting the synthesis of nutrients in tea plants. Consequently, the suitability
    of tea tree cultivation areas diminishes gradually (Fig.13 (c)). Findings reveal
    that tea plantations are predominantly located in areas characterized by lower
    altitudes and gentle slopes. For instance, tea plantations situated at an altitude
    below 200 m with a slope <4° collectively account for about a quarter of the total
    area (24.5% and 29.0%, respectively). Analyzing the dominance of tea plantation
    areas within specific altitude and slope intervals further allowed the evaluation
    of vertical distribution characteristics. A dominance value exceeding 1 indicates
    a higher tea plantation area within that interval than the overall average, signaling
    an advantage in tea distribution for that range. As illustrated in Fig. 13 (d),
    the dominance of tea plantations gradually increases with ascending altitude,
    peaking at 1300 m and gradually declining thereafter, with dominance elevations
    ranging from 700 to 2000 m. Conversely, as slope steepness increases to 4°, the
    dominance peaks, subsequently tapering off with steeper slopes. Consequently,
    the optimal range for tea plantation dominance lies within slopes from 2°to 18°.
    5. Discussion 5.1. Significances of mapping for agroforestry crops: Tea trees
    Agroforestry crops, as an essential component of agricultural systems, particularly
    in smallholders'' farming dominant developing countries, make significant contributions
    to wealth and job creation, foreign exchange earnings, and efforts to eradicate
    hunger and poverty (Kanyua and Waluse, 2015; Kheiri et al., 2023)。The expansion
    of agroforestry crops has recently become a global phenomenon (Su et al., 2016).
    Traditionally, plantations have expanded by encroaching upon former forests and
    farmlands to increase their cultivation areas and achieve higher yield goals.
    This has posed challenges to the implementation of agricultural policies and land
    use regulations, as well as to the respective regulation of agriculture and forestry
    (Yuliani et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the monoculture planting pattern of agroforestry
    crop plantations can also lead to a series of changes in the ecological environment
    (Li et al., 2023). Therefore, accurately understanding the spatiotemporal pattern
    and development trends of agroforestry crops is of great significance for rational
    development of limited land resources, optimizing land use planning, and formulating
    ecological conservation policies, thus promoting sustainable agricultural development.
    Tea trees, as a typical intensively managed agroforestry cash crop, plays a crucial
    role in poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, contributing significantly
    to social and economic development (Su et al., 2017). In recent years, the tea
    industry has shown tremendous development prospects. Both the cultivation area
    and economic output have been rapidly expanding. It is projected that by 2026,
    the global tea market will reach approximately $81.6 billion (Pan et al., 2022).
    According to the “Report on Tea Production and Marketing in China 2022” released
    by the China Tea Circulation Association (www.ctma.com.cn), the total economic
    output value of tea in China in 2022 reached 318 billion yuan, indicating an 8.62%
    increase compared to 2021. Additionally, the total export of tea from China in
    2022 amounted 375,200 tons, with a total value of $2.082 billion. As a labor-intensive
    industry, the tea plant, from cultivation to processing into tea leaves or other
    by-products, creates significant economic and societal value (Soni et al., 2015).
    However, the uncontrolled expansion of tea plantations fueled by economic interests
    has led to profound repercussions on biodiversity, carbon and water cycles, and
    ecosystems (Liu et al., 2017). Furthermore, the implications for changes in land-use
    are particularly noteworthy. For example, the blind reclamation of tea plantations
    has caused the encroachment on forest and cropland (Su et al., 2017). In particular,
    the emergence of tea trees competing with food crops for land resources poses
    a serious threat to land use policies and food security. Accurately estimating
    the area, spatial distribution, and expansion of tea plantations is of paramount
    importance for government planning, policy formulation, and land management decisions
    (Xu et al., 2018). Therefore, obtaining high-resolution and detailed data on the
    distribution of tea plantations is crucial for government supervision and rational
    planning to balance the goals of protecting arable land and promoting sustainable
    development of agriculture (Kang et al., 2023). Currently, existing remote sensing
    mapping research primarily focus on herbaceous crops in agricultural fields, while
    there is a growing interest in tea plantations as an important specialty cash
    crop (Nabil et al., 2022; Jiao et al., 2022; Digra et al., 2023; Zhou et al.,
    2022). Accurately obtaining high-resolution tea plantation mapping data can provide
    detailed information support for further applications and analyses in tea industry-related
    fields, including suitability assessment, disaster warning, and studies on greenhouse
    gas emissions (Wang et al., 2022a, Wang et al., 2022b; Lou et al., 2013; Xing
    et al., 2022). In addition to biophysical factors such as topography and climate,
    socioeconomic factors also play a relatively important role in the distribution
    and expansion of tea plantations, which includes labor input, production management
    techniques, and land allocation policies (Zhang et al., 2017). Due to the uneven
    development of agricultural technologies and limited practical application capabilities
    across provinces, significant variations in the tea production patterns can be
    observed in different regions (Wu et al., 2020). In this study, by calculating
    the distribution density of tea plantations in various cities of different provinces,
    it was found that the highest density of tea plantations in Hubei, Hunan, Fujian,
    and Zhejiang provinces all exceeded 50% (Fig.13 (b)), and the economic yield per
    unit area of tea in these four provinces is much higher than in Yunnan, which
    has the largest tea plantation area. In these areas with higher distribution density,
    there is usually a high level of intensive management and advanced agricultural
    technology and management. Advanced production techniques and technological innovations
    have profound positive effects on changing the layout of tea production, improving
    tea quality, and enhancing economic benefits (Corato and Ugo., 2020). Therefore,
    compared to solely expanding the area to increase tea production and profits,
    rational land use planning and advanced production management techniques are also
    crucial means to ensure the sustainable development of high-quality tea plantations
    and improve the economic benefits of tea production. 5.2. What are the distinctive
    characteristics of the tea trees? The distinctive characteristics of the tea trees
    are constituted of the abundance of phenolic substance and frequent manual management
    measures. Leveraging these attributes, we explored the corresponding remote sensing
    features, such as the TPPI temporal indicator constructed using the SWIR band
    to depict the phenolic content within the vegetation, and the TCTI temporal indicator
    developed using SAR radar backscatter to portray the level of human interference
    in the tree canopy. Phenolic richness and SWIR characterization of tea trees:
    The inspiration for TPPI comes from the fact that tea leaves are rich in phenolic
    compounds (tea polyphenols), and the SWIR bands in remote sensing signals can
    reflect the nutritional content in vegetation (Kanwar et al., 2012). Most of the
    biochemical parameters inversion studies are performed using hyperspectroscopy,
    which has narrow SWIR band (Falcioni et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a, Liu et al.,
    2023b). For example, the unique absorption characteristics of narrow-band SWIR
    for biochemicals (phenolics) were verified based on spectroscopic analysis techniques
    (Kokaly and Skidmore, 2015). Since the main phytochemical components do not confound
    this feature, it has the potential to be a direct indicator of phenolic-rich vegetation
    types (tea plants) (Houborg, 2015). Meanwhile some spectral indices using broadband
    SWIR have been used to detect land cover or nutrient stresses (Huo et al., 2021;
    Kumar et al., 2022). For example, the SWIR of Sentinel-2 was applied to evaluate
    phenolic concentrations or mapping (Fredes et al., 2021; Belgiu et al., 2023;
    Hamrouni et al., 2022). It has been suggested that a certain vegetation type with
    thin canopy contain lower transpiration rates and water content resulting in higher
    SWIR reflectance (Chen et al., 2023). In this research, the tea trees with lower
    height and relatively thinner canopies exhibited higher reflectance compared to
    forests (consistent with previous findings). When compared to field crops (either
    paddy field or dry farming), tea trees have deeper rooting systems, thicker canopies,
    and stronger transpiration, which also exhibit higher SWIR reflectance. It was
    suggested that the driving factors behind the SWIR characteristics of tea trees
    include not only moisture content but also biochemical substances (Manna and Raychaudhuri,
    2020). Thus, tea trees can be highlighted with an index of SWIR in theory. High-frequency
    manual measures and SAR backscattering characterization of tea trees: Dual-pol
    SAR data from the Sentinel-1 can sensitively capture the disturbances caused by
    human interventions on canopy structure, biomass, and water content (Mandal et
    al., 2020). The SAR signal interaction is primarily governed by the canopy dielectric
    constant, canopy morphology, and the roughness of individual scatterers (leaves,
    fruits, stems). Consequently, SAR data holds significant potential for evaluating
    canopy parameters. Theoretically, changes in backscattering of mature evergreen
    canopies are linked to variations in canopy biomass and water content (El Hajj
    et al., 2022). In major tea-producing areas, manual measures such as picking or
    pruning are conducted more frequently each year to ensure higher yields (Xu et
    al., 2018). These measures for the tea tree canopy led to alterations or disturbances
    in canopy biomass, water content, and canopy structure. SAR backscattering of
    different polarizations (VV and VH) correlates with the dielectric constant of
    the tree crown, with VV emanating from the top of the tree crown (surface backscattering)
    and VH originating from the tree crown structure (volume scattering) (El Hajj
    et al., 2022; Rao et al., 2020). Mechanical trimming significantly affects SAR
    backscatter by volume changes. In this research, based on SAR backscattering data,
    additional information supplementation of radar signals was achieved by computing
    statistical texture features (GLCM) based on image pixels (Nabil et al., 2022).
    The results indicated that the radar texture signals of tea trees more effectively
    capture manual measures compared to horticultural crops such as annual fruit trees.
    This research demonstrates that the sensitivity of radar signals to changes in
    vegetation canopy structure and its biochemicals due to anthropogenic activities
    can be a useful basis for differentiating horticultural crops under various management
    practices. 5.3. Can features based on biochemical substance content and manual
    management measures be utilized for mapping? Our answer is: “Yes”. In this research,
    a novel tea mapping framework (MAP-Tea) was proposed based on crop attributes
    and distinguishing characteristics, utilizing Sentinel-1/2 data. We explored the
    remote sensing characteristics related to various crop attributes of tea trees
    and employed distinct features derived from these attributes to achieve the tea
    mapping in China. Notably, indicators like TPPI and TCTI, derived from the attributes
    of biochemical substance content and human management measures associated with
    tea trees, respectively, demonstrated commendable classification results during
    the tea tree identification process. Our mapping strategy, utilizing crop attributes
    and distinguishing characteristics, demonstrates multiple advantages: 1) The proposed
    MAP-Tea method enables large-scale and automated pixel-based tea mapping, significantly
    reducing costly labor and computational resources in data collection and training
    compared to traditional machine learning methods (Zhao et al., 2022). Compared
    to classifier-based methods, threshold-based methods have the advantages of speed
    and convenience, making them highly suitable for rapid large-scale mapping (Zhang
    et al., 2022a, Zhang et al., 2022b). 2) The MAP-Tea was designed based on tea
    tree knowledge and Sentinel''s year-round time-series imagery, which facilitates
    the collection of large-scale cloud-free data and promote the practical application
    of tea extraction globally. Additionally, MAP-Tea has better identification for
    tea plantations that have intensive manual management practices (with multiple
    pruning and picking). Therefore, as early as after the second pruning and picking,
    it may allow tea detection ahead of time compared to taking a time series throughout
    the year. The knowledge-based automated crop mapping approach, leveraging prior
    knowledge, proves highly effective in tackling prominent issues encountered during
    large-scale crop mapping, including limited reference data, intra-class variability,
    and inter-class resemblance (Arvor et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2021). Simultaneously,
    the essence of developing a knowledge-based mapping method hinges on uncovering
    the relationship between crop attributes and remote sensing characteristics. 5.4.
    Uncertainties and future works While offering significant advantages over traditional
    land cover/use classification frameworks, the proposed Manual management and Phenolics
    substance-based Tea mapping (MAP-Tea) framework does have certain limitations.
    Similar to many threshold-based approaches, MAP-Tea based on optical data is notably
    affected by cloud disturbances. Given that suitable tea planting areas are primarily
    located in humid regions with ample rainfall and warmth, the impact of cloudiness
    on the original values is exacerbated, thereby limiting the accuracy of tea mapping
    in such areas. The MAP-Tea is constructed based on the year-round Sentinel-1/2
    time-series images, and the higher temporal resolution facilitates the collection
    and synthesis of cloud-free data over a large area. Consequently, the MAP-Tea
    can mitigate the influence of cloudy observations. Additionally, pixel-based methods
    inevitably contend with mixed pixels. Due to the spatial resolution of remote
    sensing data, the MAP-Tea performs well for homogeneous image elements of tea
    trees but has limitations in cases of characteristic tea plantations where tea
    plants are mixed with other vegetation types (e.g., tea-trees intercropping) (Qi
    et al., 2023). Furthermore, the pixel-based mapping method typically encounters
    challenges related to the influence of endmember spectral variability, leading
    to the pretzel phenomenon and potentially affecting the classification accuracy
    (Chen et al., 2023). Knowledge-based Fuzzy Logic approaches effectively address
    the challenge of mixed pixels and heterogeneity by assigning each pixel a similarity
    measure (Degree of membership) for each category. That is, each location is characterized
    by multiple and partial memberships across all candidate classes (Murmu and Biswas,
    2015). Through carefully designed experiments, the MAP-Tea was integrated with
    Fuzzy Logic to extract tea plantations in areas with mixed pixels. In this experiment,
    we formulated membership functions for TPPI, TBPI and TCTI respectively (Jiang
    et al., 2019). The results demonstrated that the fusion of MAP-Tea and Fuzzy Logic
    transforms the classification method from a simple threshold-based determination
    (0 and 1) into a probability-based approach for extracting tea plantation pixels,
    enabling the identification of tea plantations even within mixed pixels (Fig.S4).
    In practical applications, constructing fuzzy membership functions is a very complex
    task, requiring the formulation of a comprehensive and effective knowledge rule
    system and membership functions (Talukdar et al., 2022; Elyagoubi and Mezrhab,
    2022). Therefore, enhancing the MAP-Tea algorithm combined with fuzzy logic to
    achieve tea extraction under different environmental background conditions and
    various cultivation practices may represent an important direction for future
    research. The classifier-based methods can increase classification accuracy and
    efficiency by automatically mining the deep information in remote sensing data,
    which can achieve more satisfactory results compared to threshold-based approaches.
    However, due to the considerable variations in growth characteristics, internal
    properties, and other factors among different crop types, data-driven approaches
    heavily rely on a substantial number of accurately labeled training samples, and
    conveying information from these samples is challenging (Chen et al., 2023). The
    development of knowledge graphs is beneficial in addressing the issue of reference
    sample information silos. Integrating crop knowledge into the threshold-based
    method eliminates the necessity for extensive training samples, enhancing accuracy
    and enabling rapid, cost-effective acquisition of target crop information, particularly
    beneficial for minor crops with limited reference data (Chen et al., 2023). Therefore,
    based on the rule knowledge between crop attributes and remote sensing features
    constructed in this study, it can help to promote the development of knowledge
    graph and subsequent dynamic threshold determination methods. This will enable
    the business operation of adaptive remote sensing mapping in the future. 6. Conclusions
    The advancement of agroforestry represents substantial potential for stimulating
    economic growth and mitigating poverty, thereby playing a crucial role in advancing
    the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study specifically targets the
    data gap concerning agroforestry crop distribution in developing countries, concentrating
    on the mapping of tea plantations. It offers crucial insights to support sustainable
    agricultural development and the implementation of precise management practices
    in these regions. This study enhances agroforestry crop mapping by introducing
    a novel framework grounded in knowledge-based indicators derived from attributes
    of tea tree crops, encompassing biochemical substance content and human activities.
    Tea trees are remarkable for their distinctive features, characterized by high
    phenolic content and frequent human activities. The mapping algorithm, grounded
    in these attributes of tea tree crops, adeptly extracts tea plantations even in
    complex environmental settings. Three new phenological indicators—TPPI, TBPI,
    and TCTI—crafted based on the unique characteristics of tea trees, effectively
    differentiate woodlands and orchards that share strong similarities with tea trees.
    Utilizing the developed MAP-Tea algorithm, an updated tea map with a 10-m resolution
    in China''s major tea-producing regions for 2022 was generated, boasting an overall
    accuracy of 94.87% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.83. The distribution of tea plantations
    is influenced by topographical factors, resulting in lower regional planting densities
    (averaging 10%). Regions with a denser concentration of tea plantations are typically
    situated in favorable locations at altitudes ranging from 700 m to 2000 m, featuring
    slopes measuring between 2° to 18°. China has established two primary regions
    with denser cultivation, covering the central-western (e.g., Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou)
    and eastern (e.g., Fujian, Zhejiang) areas, respectively, exhibiting higher planting
    density and output value than Yunnan, despite the latter having the largest tea
    distribution area. Simultaneously, this study augments rule-based knowledge concerning
    the growth attributes of tea trees and their relationship with remote sensing
    characteristics. It provides valuable assistance for future research and applications
    in large-scale crop mapping by developing lightweight knowledge-based algorithms.

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used
    to gather relevant literature and research studies on the extent of integration
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation. The approach used in this study (Fig.
    1) followed well-defined steps, known as the PRISMA approach [44,45]. Multiple
    academic databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Google Scholar,
    and Web of Science were searched for relevant research articles published in the
    past decade. The literature search was conducted between 27th to 31st August 2023.
    Keywords used for the search included \"Smart Irrigation,\" \"Fourth Industrial
    Revolution,\" \"Artificial Intelligence,\" \"Internet of Things,\" \"Big Data,\"

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    irrigation efficiency. Furrow and drip irrigation [75] Demonstrated AI modelling
    for optimizing green roof irrigation by adapting watering schedules based on evolving
    environmental conditions. Sprinkler irrigation [76] Utilized AI to estimate drip
    tape irrigation discharge using temperature and pressure data, enhancing water
    use efficiency in drip irrigation systems. Drip tape irrigation Table 3. Applications
    of IoT in irrigation. Reference IoT Usage Findings Summary [86] IoT infrastructure

    regulation of agro-hydrological systems using zone model predictive control. Proposed
    an IoT-based approach for regulating agro-hydrological systems using zone model
    predictive control. Enhanced irrigation management for crop growth. Internet of
    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    in sub-saharan africa Infrastructure limitations and access to technology One
    of the significant constraints in leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa is the limited infrastructure and lack
    of access to technology [111,112]. Many rural areas in the region lack reliable
    electricity supply, internet connectivity, and adequate communication networks
    necessary for the seamless functioning of smart irrigation systems. The absence
    of basic infrastructure hampers the deployment and operation of advanced technologies
    such as sensors, IoT devices, and cloud computing platforms. Additionally, the
    high cost of technology acquisition and maintenance further restricts the access
    and adoption of 4IR solutions for smart irrigation in the region. Governance and
    policy challenges Governance and policy challenges pose significant obstacles
    to the effective utilization of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation in sub-Saharan
    Africa [111,113,114]. Fragmented regulatory frameworks, and a lack of coordination
    among different stakeholders hinder the integration of these technologies into
    existing irrigation systems. The absence of clear guidelines on data management,
    privacy, and security also creates uncertainties and inhibits the widespread adoption
    of 4IR technologies. It is crucial to establish comprehensive governance frameworks
    and supportive policies that address data governance, privacy concerns, interoperability
    standards, and institutional coordination to facilitate the successful implementation
    of smart irrigation systems. Regulatory frameworks and safety Considerations regarding
    the use of drones need to be established to ensure safe and responsible operations
    [115]. Compliance with airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and licensing requirements
    are crucial aspects that need to be addressed. Developing appropriate guidelines
    and training programs can help farmers navigate these regulatory challenges and
    ensure the safe integration of drones in irrigation practices. Financial constraints
    and investment requirements The adoption of 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    requires significant financial investment, which presents a considerable constraint
    in Sub-Saharan Africa [116,112]. The high initial cost of acquiring and deploying
    technologies such as sensors, drones, IoT devices, and data analytics platforms
    can be a deterrent for smallholder farmers and resource-constrained agricultural
    enterprises [117]. Limited access to financing and the absence of appropriate

    In recent years, IoT sensors have enabled smart agriculture to grow rapidly with
    many compelling real-world applications. One such application is the case of smart
    irrigation. A particular interest exists in forecasting soil water potential to

    irrigationSoil water potentialSensor data 1. Introduction In many domains, anticipating
    the future path of a time-series is of key importance. Smart agriculture is one
    such domain where forecasting holds a significant role, as demonstrated in [1].
    Smart agriculture contains a panoply of compelling predictive use-cases, including
    but not limited to, crop yield prediction [2] and automated crop disease detection
    [3]. A comprehensive overview of such applications can be found in [1]. Smart
    irrigation – a subfield of smart agriculture – has gained a specific interest
    in recent years due to its direct relationship with water scarcity [4]. To this
    end, soil moisture sensors have proven useful in facilitating smart irrigation
    systems by providing real-time insights [5]. Besides real-time monitoring, there
    is also a critical need for accurate soil moisture forecasting — especially over
    a multi-day horizon [6]. Accurate soil moisture forecasting can help farmers with
    smart irrigation scheduling and other precision agricultural decisions such as
    smart fertilization [7]. However, forecasting soil moisture is non-trivial due
    to complex non-linear temporal dynamics of both endogenous and exogenous nature
    [8]. Moreover, gaining insight from a wide variety of data sources in agriculture
    remains an open challenge [4]. Until recently, there was a heavy emphasis on time-series
    forecasting techniques that focus on isolated time-series — so called local forecasting
    methods [9], [10]. However, we argue that in a complex agricultural setting, such
    models would perform poorly since they do not exploit external information from
    e.g. other (IoT) sensors. As such, forecasting soil moisture requires models that
    can capture these complex non-linear relationships through data fusion. To this
    end, we suggest the use of the state-of-the-art Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
    [11] as a global forecasting model for efficient integration of various data sources
    in smart agriculture. Our contribution is three-fold: (i) To the best of our knowledge,
    we are the first to apply the state-of-the-art TFT – a transformer-based architecture
    – to multi-day sensor forecasting in the context of smart agriculture. (ii) We
    present a detailed comparison between global and local forecasting approaches,
    enriching the ongoing discussion on global vs. local forecasting. (iii) We overcome
    the significant data integration challenges associated with forecasting soil moisture
    sensors due to its dependency on a wide array of data sources stemming from various
    environmental conditions across fields. The remainder of this paper is structured
    as follows: in Section 2, we review related work. Section 3 through Section 5
    discuss, respectively, the specific setting along with a formal problem description
    and the methods used. Details on training and evaluation are covered in Section
    6. The results are presented and discussed in Section 7. Finally, the conclusion
    and future directions are presented in Section 8. 2. Related work A benefit of
    the rise of (IoT) sensors in smart agriculture, is the high volume of data captured
    by those sensors. This high volume creates leeway for more advanced data analysis
    techniques such as deep learning [12]. Since soil moisture sensors typically generate
    temporal data with non-obvious patterns, multiple studies investigated the use
    of advanced analytics techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. For example,
    in [13] multiple LSTMs were trained – one per site – for one-day-ahead prediction.
    The learned models were shown to generalize by testing them on independent fields,
    though with similar soil characteristics as the train data. Notably, the naive
    model yields strong performance for one-day-ahead predictions — though their discussion
    on this is limited. This may indicate a high correlation between current and next-day
    measurements. While one-day-ahead forecasts serve as a valuable proof-of-concept,
    the greater challenge lies in the realm of multi-day forecasting [6]. Other works,
    such as [14], include future open-source information from e.g. weather forecasting
    services to obtain better multi-horizon predictions for soil moisture and show
    promising results, though only for a single plot. The authors of [10] used a bidirectional
    LSTM for forecasting soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity. They used
    5 nodes ( plots), all located in one orchard. A forecasting horizon of 14 days
    was used, and the model was trained separately for each plot (i.e. a local approach).
    They point out that it could be valuable to include static variables such as soil
    properties and that training could be more efficient by utilizing knowledge obtained
    from the other fields (e.g. a global approach). However, the small dataset size
    for each node raises concerns about overfitting. Additionally, the use of a bidirectional
    LSTM may be impractical when not all variables are known 14 days in advance, as
    is often the case in real-world settings. The authors of [15] used a novel attention-aware
    LSTM model for predicting soil moisture and soil temperature on a one- and seven-day
    forecasting horizon. Their attention mechanism allowed for an interpretable network
    permitting expert validation of the learned model. It is worth noting that – while
    they obtained data from multiple sites – they trained a separate LSTM model per
    site, essentially treating the LSTM as a local model. While the size of their
    data permits the use of LSTMs as a local model, recent work [9] has shown that
    neural networks can indeed be used as local models given sufficient data, but
    produce superior results when used as a global model. As such, we identify several
    key challenges. For instance, local modeling approaches restrict the ability to
    integrate information across various fields or plots. This becomes problematic
    in scenarios with limited local data causing risks of overfitting or restricting
    model choice — as is the case for our dataset. This limitation is a significant
    driver for our work, as we advocate for a more efficient global modeling technique
    that can harness insights from multiple sources — even when those sources have
    only limited data available on a local level. Another important consideration
    is the challenge of multi-day soil moisture forecasting. This limitation has practical
    implications for agricultural planning and highlight the need for advanced techniques
    capable of addressing longer-term forecasting. Additionally, while there is recognition
    of the potential value of incorporating static properties and future information,
    the adoption of these factors remains limited in existing approaches. To this
    end, recent advances in deep learning permit to build global models that can address
    these challenges through the use of TFTs [11]. TFTs can include both static and
    future information along the historic endo- or exogenous measurements. This work
    presents a global soil moisture fusion transformer, applied on a challenging multi-source
    agricultural dataset. 3. Application We demonstrate the benefit of global data
    fusion over local data fusion on a challenging dataset generated by Watermark
    soil moisture sensors (Irrometer Company, Inc., USA), retrieved from [16]. These
    sensors (i.e. our targets) were located on three different pear orchards in Belgium
    and were operational from 2007–2009, measuring the soil water potential ( in kPa)
    every four hours during the months June-August. This yields a time-series of approximately
    three months for each sensor per year. Due to this discontinuity in time, we consider
    a sensor to produce a separate time-series for each year rather than one time-series
    over all three years. Given the low intra-day variability of the sensors, it was
    deemed appropriate to calculate the daily average for , in accordance with the
    daily frequency at which all other variables, such as rainfall and reference evapotranspiration,
    were measured to obtain a common frequency. This yields a multivariate time-series
    with an average length of 80 (e.g. 80 -measurements for each sensor for a given
    year). The value of the target, , is negative, expressed in pressure units (kPa)
    which indicates how strongly the water is held in the soil pores by capillary
    and adhesive forces in a soil that is not saturated. Basically, the drier the
    soil, the stronger these forces are, the more negative the soil water potential
    is, and the more difficult it is for plant roots to extract that water. Furthermore,
    each field was divided into several plots which each contained six sensors at
    different depth levels: three sensors at a depth of 30 cm, two at a depth of 60
    cm, and one at a depth of 90 cm. These sensors recorded soil moisture levels at
    different depths, providing a comprehensive picture of the . Other temporal variables
    measured at plot-level are irrigation-amount and plot-specific treatments (e.g.
    root pruning). These variables capture the effects of irrigation and other treatments
    on soil moisture levels. At field level, precipitation and reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) were – respectively – recorded and calculated over time. These variables
    provide information about the overall water availability and demand in the field.
    All of these variables have a proven relationship to the target, [16]. A full
    overview of all variables and their characteristics is presented in Table 1. The
    collection and integration of these heterogeneous information sources posed several
    challenges. Missing values typically only occurred at the beginning of a time-series
    since some sensors were deployed earlier than others. Selecting a common measurement
    period solved this discrepancy. Remaining missing values, although limited, were
    imputed using forward filling. Lastly, some -sensors were entirely removed from
    the analysis due to concerns regarding data quality. During certain periods, the
    readings from these sensors exceeded their measurement range, rendering them unable
    to provide data for those time frames. Furthermore, the trustworthiness of these
    sensors could not be guaranteed as it is unclear whether they would remain reliable
    once they returned to their normal measurement ranges. Despite these challenges,
    the final dataset consisted of approximately 560 unique time-series or 220 sensors
    per year1 (70 per orchard), totaling 50k data-points. Fig. 1 depicts the distribution
    of ten randomly selected -sensors from one of the pear orchards for a given year.
    Observe how both the mean and variance vary widely between sensors. This suggests
    that a model trained on one sensor (i.e. a local approach), might not generalize
    well to other sensors. Furthermore, the top row in Fig. 1 shows the -values for
    the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test. The -values are obtained through regression
    surface approximation from MacKinnon [17], using the updated 2010 tables [18].
    The ADF test indicates that many of the randomly selected sensors show random
    walk patterns, suggesting the use of e.g. methods that allow for inclusion of
    exogenous information. Table 1. Overview of variables included in each model with

    description Formally, we consider a time-series problem with inputs containing
    multivariate time-series along with potential metadata, where the goal is to learn
    a function that accurately forecasts the output . Let be a dataset of observations,
    where is a multivariate time-series input with time-steps and features, and represents
    static metadata with features. is the output with forecast-horizon . Our goal
    is to learn a function that maps the inputs and to the output . That is, we seek
    to find the parameters of the function that minimize the following objective function
    — Eq. (1) [19]: (1) where is a task-specific loss function. 5. Methodology Forecasting
    natural phenomena such as soil moisture requires a model that can exploit exogenous
    information while simultaneously exploiting a potentially non-linear relationship
    with lagged values of the target (see [20], [21] for a similarly complex task
    in evapotranspiration prediction). To this end, we distinguish between global
    and local forecasting methods. 5.1. Local methods In short, given many time-series
    (or sensors in our case), a local method would independently estimate model parameters
    for each individual time-series (or sensor) with its corresponding local input
    variables [9]. Since each time-series measures on average 80 data-points (see
    Section 3), the local method should be limited in terms of parameters to be estimated
    in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality. A visual overview is provided in
    Fig. 2(a). Naive model. As a baseline, a naive model is introduced which simply
    uses the last known value as the multi-horizon forecast. That is, a constant line.
    Including a naive baseline permits to investigate whether the more advanced forecasting
    methods actually obtain any skill (see e.g. [22] for a similar approach). Download

    2(a) shows a local approach where each (in this case) plot gets assigned its own
    model while 2(b) shows a global approach with one model for all plots. Vector
    AutoRegressive model. Next, a state-of-the-art flexible local method is considered
    which can exploit exo- and endogenous relationships present in the data. To this
    end, a Vector AutoRegressive model is used as a strong local method [23], [24].
    A Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) model is a linear multiple-equation model that allows
    to model and forecast multivariate time-series. Section 3 described the multivariate
    nature of the problem. Moreover, it is known [25] that some input variables are
    influenced by (i.e. the target) raising issues of endogeneity, especially in multi-horizon
    forecasts. As such, to jointly model such dynamic interdependencies the Vector
    AutoRegressive (VAR) model is a feasible local method with proven theoretical
    properties and parsimonious parameterization, leading to a small model for the
    small local dataset. For full details we refer to the original paper [23] of VAR
    models. Note that VAR models can only include numerical historic variables. To
    this end, the final VAR model in concise matrix notation [24] is shown in Eq.
    (2): (2) with a -matrix for variables with forecasting horizon . a coefficient
    matrix with the size of the look-back window (or lag-length), a -matrix containing
    the lagged variables, and the error matrix. The actual variables included in the
    VAR model are indicated in Table 1. Observe how the number of variables , the
    size of the look-back window , and the forecasting horizon entirely govern the
    complexity of the model in terms of parameters. Therefore, since we need to include
    multiple exogenous time-series and are interested in a multi-horizon forecast,
    the look-back window will need to be properly tuned to avoid overfitting. Lastly,
    since VAR models assume stationarity, some variables (e.g. the target variable
    soil water potential — see Fig. 1) need to be transformed to obtain stationarity
    using e.g. differencing. 5.2. Global methods For global methods, the entire set
    of sensors and their corresponding predictors are considered at once, giving rise
    to a larger dataset (see Section 3). Global methods estimate the parameters jointly
    from all available time-series (or sensors). To this end, neural networks have
    shown to be particularly promising as global forecasters since they thrive in
    large data contexts [9]. In fact, given enough data, global forecasting methods
    such as neural networks can inherently model more complex non-linear structures
    in the data compared to local methods that are restricted in terms of complexity
    since their access is limited to local data only. A visual overview is provided
    in Fig. 2(b). LSTM. First, an LSTM network [26] is considered. LSTMs are widely
    considered to be a solid baseline in forecasting (multivariate) time-series data
    (see e.g. [22]). An LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable
    of learning long-term temporal dependencies in sequence data. A key component
    of the LSTM are so-called memory gates that mitigate the problem – typical for
    traditional RNNs – of exploding/vanishing gradients. Temporal fusion transformer.
    The TFT [11] is a state-of-the-art model for time-series forecasting. It stands
    out compared to e.g. LSTMs thanks to its ability to include static (i.e. time-invariant)
    variables and its efficient architecture. In an agricultural context this permits
    to condition on field-specific time-invariant variables which ultimately allows
    for efficient data fusion across different static properties. TFTs rely on a sophisticated
    transformer-based [27] architecture allowing them to model complex interactions
    between the different temporal (future or historic) and static inputs while preserving
    interpretability. The use of a quantile-based objective function, enables the
    TFTs to output -quantiles instead of point forecasts. The full architecture is
    shown in Fig. 3. We discuss the main components from the bottom-up (for a full
    overview we refer to the original TFT paper in [11]): Download : Download high-res

    obtained from [11]. The left (in brown) shows the static variables encoder, followed
    by the past inputs encoder (in blue) and the known future inputs decoder (in dark
    red). Observe the variable selection units for all inputs. Multiple gates are
    present with skip-connections making the network efficient. The multi-head attention
    block permits for efficient information fusion. Parts with the same colors indicate
    weight-sharing. 1. Variable selection network: The network is trained on global
    data with different variable types: static (i.e. time-invariant), historic (i.e.
    exo- or endogenous time-series), and known (i.e. a priori known future inputs,
    e.g. day of week). By implementing a variable selection module, the model itself
    can select important and ignore irrelevant variables at different time-steps.
    2. Static variable encoders: In an agricultural context, e.g. soil characteristics
    can have a big impact on soil moisture dynamics [10]. Hence, mapping static variables,
    such as soil type, to a higher-dimensional embedding space can help the model
    to condition the temporal embeddings on such static properties allowing for conditional
    information fusion. 3. LSTM encoders: LSTMs [26] are incorporated for local processing
    of the time-series. Here, a sequence-to-sequence structure is employed for the
    LSTM-layer to learn fixed-length temporal embeddings as input for the attention
    heads. 4. Gating mechanisms: Throughout the network, multiple gating mechanisms
    with skip-connections (and normalization) are put in place. As such, the network
    itself can regulate its complexity and learn more efficiently if possible, even
    when limited data is available. 5. Temporal multi-head attention: A key component
    of the TFT is the multi-head self-attention block [27] which enables the network
    to attend to the most relevant dependencies present in the network. Thanks to
    a grouping operation (i.e. averaging) over the multi-head attention mechanism
    in the TFT, efficient information fusion takes place. Moreover, investigating
    the final grouped attention vectors can help with interpreting to which time-steps
    the TFT pays attention. 6. Quantile Forecasts: The final dense layer directly
    outputs a quantile forecast for the given prediction horizon. This results in
    a distribution forecast rather than a point forecast, providing a notion of uncertainty.
    6. Training and evaluation For a given time-step , we want to predict steps ahead
    (here, ), using a window of past observations with size . These past observations
    can include exogenous time-series as well as the target itself . For the TFT specifically,
    known future observations (numerical or categorical) can also be included . Finally,
    static information can also be included in the TFT. A full overview of the included
    variables and their type for each model is provided in Table 1. Next, the data
    is split into a train ( k - 92%), validation ( - 4%), and a test set ( - 4%).
    To respect the temporal nature and prevent data leakage, the validation set is
    represented by the penultimate forecasting window for the years 2008, 2009 — i.e.
    with . The test set is comprised of the last forecasting window of each sensor
    for 2008, 2009 — i.e. with . A graphical overview is presented in Fig. 4. Note
    that every time-series of 2007 is left entirely for training only. This allows
    the model to observe at least one entire growing season during training. To evaluate
    the performance of the local and global model, the mean absolute error (MAE) Eq.
    (3), the root mean squared error (RMSE) Eq. (4), and the mean directional accuracy
    (MDA) Eq. (5) are computed for each time-series [28], [29] as follows: (3) (4)
    (5) where represents the measurement of a given sensor at time and the length
    of the forecasting horizon. is the forecast by the model. These metrics, respectively,
    give insight in general performance, large errors, and directional skill of the
    model. Note that for the local models, by definition, the forecast for each time-series
    implies a different model. As such, for time-series, VAR-models would be created.
    Hence, for local models, the final MAE, RMSE, and MDA are aggregated across all
    local models to obtain global metrics. This ultimately allows for a fair comparison
    between the local and global models. For the MAE and RMSE the median is calculated
    across forecasts, and for MDA the mean. This permits to perform statistical tests
    to compare the performance across models. As such, the MAE and RMSE are compared
    across models with a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the MDA is compared
    using a -test. A Bonferroni correction [30] is applied to account for multiple
    testing. Lastly, following [11], the normalized quantile loss across the forecast-horizon
    is also considered, through -Risk (see Eq. (6)): (6) with the domain of the given
    dataset and (see Eq. (7)) the quantile loss [11]: (7) Here, represents the quantile
    of interest and . Note, when , then Eq. (7) MAE. Furthermore, -Risk is a global
    metric by definition and is not calculated for each time-series separately. As
    such, no statistical tests are performed for the -Risk. Download : Download high-res
    image (108KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Train-Val-Test split
    of a certain sensor for a given year for a given orchard. Note that each year
    for a given sensor per orchard is considered as a unique time-series as described
    in Section 3. 6.1. Training - Naive model The naive model simply forward-propagates
    the last known value for each sensor per year across the horizon . Hence, no actual
    training is done for this model. 6.2. Training - VAR model Since the VAR model
    is a local method, training is done on local time-series data only. That is, one
    model is trained per sensor, per year, taking into account exogenous information
    from that time-period. We refer to Table 1 for a full overview of the included
    exogenous information per sensor, per year. The main interest is in comparing
    predictive performance of the local and global methods on the unseen test data.
    As such, since 2007 is kept as a train set for the TFT (see Fig. 4), it is omitted
    for the local method estimation as it does not contain a test set. This preserves
    the fairness in comparing both methods. Given the non-stationarity of the target
    (see Section 3), first-order differencing is applied such that the target becomes
    . The target is then reverted to its original form for evaluation. This is done
    to obtain stationarity which is a requirement for VAR models. Other exogenous
    temporal variables that were non-stationary were also transformed through first-order
    differencing. The lag is a key hyperparameter that governs the model complexity.
    As such, the optimal lag (limited to a maximum of four to prevent overfitting)
    is determined using the Akaike Information Criterion [31] on both the train and
    validation set for a given sensor. A constant is added to allow for a time-series
    with a non-zero intercept. Lastly, each VAR-model with optimal lag is then refitted
    on the local train and validation set after which the final results are obtained
    on the local test set. 6.3. Training - LSTM The LSTM is trained on the train data
    shown in Fig. 4. Hyperparameters were selected using the validation data with
    a full grid search — see A.1. The data is normalized — a requirement for any neural
    network. While first-order differencing of the target (as done in Section 6.2)
    is not a necessity for neural networks, better results where observed for the
    LSTM when first-order differencing was applied. Hence, the target becomes . The
    target is then reverted to its original form for evaluation. The final model contained
    two LSTM-layers (i.e. a stacked LSTM network), each with 64 LSTM cells and a dropout-rate
    of 0.2. A final fully connected layer is added with five nodes to obtain a five-day-ahead
    forecast. The network is trained for 50 epochs using the AdamW optimizer [32]
    with a learning rate of 0.001 on a single Nvidia T4 GPU and implemented in Pytorch
    Lightning v1.6.5. 6.4. Training - temporal fusion transformer The TFT contains
    multiple hyperparameters. The original paper [11] also showed that the performance
    of the TFT on a given dataset, largely depends on the set of hyperparameters.
    Due to the complexity of the TFT, a full grid search (as done for the LSTM in
    Section 6.3) is not feasible. To this end, we use Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
    [33] to tune the hyperparameters of the TFT. Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
    is a computationally efficient manner for finding that optimizes a given objective
    function. Bayesian hyperparameter tuning relies on Bayes theorem to approximate
    the true objective function shown in Eq. (7) with a surrogate objective function
    – here, a Gaussian Process regression – that can be sampled efficiently. Recursively
    optimizing yields repeatedly improved sets of hyperparameters. Essentially, this
    allows for an informed search in the hyperparameter space when a full grid search
    is not feasible. For more details on Bayesian hyperparameter optimization we refer
    to [33]. The actual Bayesian hyperparameter optimization was done through Weights
    & Biases [34]. The final set of hyperparameters is shown in Table 2. An overview
    of the priors can be found in A.2. All variables were normalized and here too,
    an improvement was observed when predicting the first-order difference rather
    than the raw target. The target is then reverted to its original form for evaluation.
    The TFT implementation was obtained from Pytorch Forecasting v0.10.1, and Pytorch
    Lightning v1.6.5. Training was done for 50 epochs on a single Nvidia T4 GPU. Table

    We present a comparative analysis that highlights the effectiveness of our approach
    and provide insights into the practical relevance in varying agricultural scenarios.
    7.1. Model comparison The results are presented in Table 3. The TFT significantly
    outperforms all other approaches on all metrics. The discrepancy between the MAE
    and the RMSE shows that all methods might have (a few) larger forecasting errors,
    potentially due to the noisy dataset. Indeed, Fig. 5(a) shows that almost all
    models make some larger errors for orchard one — except for the VAR model. Furthermore,
    the MDA shows that the learned directional insight of the TFT is better. In fact,
    the other methods are only correct about the direction of the forecast in 50%
    (or less) of the forecasts — i.e. a random guess. Note that the naive method –
    by definition – does not have any directional insight, since it simply predicts
    a constant. The TFT on the other hand, shows more prowess about the direction
    of the forecast. In terms of -Risk, the TFT outperforms the other methods — though
    the LSTM gets close for the 0.9-risk. Table 3. Performance of the TFT compared
    to the global and local baselines on the unseen test set. The TFT outperforms
    the other approaches on all metrics with statistical significance. For the MAE
    (in kPa) and RMSE (in kPa) the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. For the MDA,
    a test was used. *** marks the 0.01 significance level. For all tests the Bonferroni
    correction for multiple testing was applied [30]. No tests are performed for the
    -risk since those are global metrics. Model Type Test set performance Empty Cell

    the practical benefit of the TFT – allowing for conditional global information
    fusion due to the addition of static information – versus the other methods. Interestingly,
    the VAR-model has fewer larger errors in orchard zero compared to the other models.
    This suggests that the local approach flexibly adapts to sensors that are out
    of the ordinary. Though, note that its median MAE is higher than the other models
    in orchard zero indicating that the local gains are only marginal. Perhaps surprisingly,
    the naive model scores relatively good as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5. However,
    a closer look at Fig. 5(b) shows that the good performance of the naive model
    is mainly due to its accuracy in the earliest forecasts, which are close to the
    last known value. This is further supported by Fig. 6, which shows the correlation
    between the last known value of and the true values at different forecasting horizons.
    Specifically, Fig. 6 shows a strong correlation during the earlier time steps,
    which weakens as time passes. As such, it is important to note that the naive
    model is not useful for longer-term forecasts as supported by Fig. 5(b) and Fig.
    6. For example, a prediction at for the naive model would not capture important
    changes in . Orchard one and two in Fig. 5(a) demonstrate the superior capability
    of the TFT to efficiently fuse the information from the different orchards in
    order to perform better locally. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download

    horizon representing the correlation between at time and at to . 7.2. Model interpretability
    One argument against global models – typically neural network-based – is their
    lack of interpretability. A key novelty of TFTs is the interpretable multi-head
    attention mechanism for time-series data. The attention heads permit for an interpretation
    of which time-steps the model pays attention to. Fig. 7(a) shows an example of
    a forecast on a random sample from the unseen test set. Note how the model pays
    the highest attention at the moment where the history of the target changes direction.
    Looking at the global attention in Fig. 7(b), a broader understanding of the attention-mechanism
    in the model can be acquired. On average, the model pays most attention to the
    value from seven days ago and then – in a downward trend – takes into account
    values from closer to the present day. However, attention varies widely across
    time as shown by the boxplots in Fig. 7(b). Note that the size of the look-back
    window was considered as a hyperparameter during Bayesian hyperparameter tuning
    (see Section 6.4) with seven being the minimal value considered. The insights
    from such attention mechanism can foster interesting discussions with e.g. agricultural
    experts and perhaps even deliver novel insights to the experts. Download : Download

    a five-day-ahead forecast of the first difference of soil water potential. The
    gray line (secondary y-axis) illustrates the attention of the model for this sample.
    Note how attention is the highest at the point where the observed value changes
    direction. The attention across the forecast-horizon sums to one. 7(b) shows side-by-side
    boxplots of attention per timestep (with mean-indicator) obtained from the model
    on the test set. Furthermore, thanks to the variable selection networks present
    in the TFT (see Section 5.2), a measure of variable importance can be established.
    The static variable importance in Fig. 8 corresponds well to expert knowledge.
    For example, the name of the particular pear orchard, the measurement year, and
    the depth of the sensor have the highest importance. This is to be expected since
    soil moisture will differ substantially depending on the orchard-specific characteristics
    and the year considered [10]. Further, different depth levels can have different
    root distributions. Sensors at different depths (especially those in deeper levels)
    might have a delayed soil moisture response to e.g. precipitation. As such, Fig.
    8 confirms that the TFT is capable to pick up on these regional and temporal differences.
    Note that the inclusion of static variables in the TFT allows to train a global
    model on this data despite the different characteristics present in the data.
    This is – inherently – not possible with local methods or other global methods
    such as the LSTM. Download : Download high-res image (500KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Variable importance learned by the variable selection
    networks of the TFT. Fig. 8 also shows the variable importance for the historic
    and known variables. For historic information, the measurement month and soil
    temperature both receive nearly equal importance. The importance of the measurement
    month is as expected and shows again that the TFT picks up on temporal patterns
    available in the data. Soil temperature on the other hand, does not directly reflect
    expert knowledge. However, soil temperature is a proxy of evaporative demand.
    This could potentially explain why this variable is considered as important by
    the model since evaporative demand is known to influence soil water potential.
    In terms of known variables, the precipitation amount receives the highest importance,
    followed by measurement month and ETo. This is not a surprise since precipitation
    and ETo act as a supply and demand mechanism for soil moisture. As such, it is
    worth observing that the model accurately emphasizes those variables as important.
    It should be noted that precipitation and ETo are taken from the actual data and
    provided as future input. In reality however, one could rely on weather forecasting
    services to obtain future information for those variables. 7.3. Practical implications
    The practical applications of our findings are significant in the realm of smart
    agriculture. The advanced forecasting capabilities of the TFT model could potentially
    lead to more efficient and sustainable irrigation practices, tailored to specific
    needs of fruit orchards. This would not only enable optimization of water usage
    but would also support farmers in making informed decisions. This could ultimately
    enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability. However, to obtain actionable
    irrigation advice based on the -forecasts, further work is needed. To this end,
    one could rely on a simple rule-based system that gets triggered when a -threshold
    is reached (see e.g. [35]). More advanced prescriptive analytics or automated
    policy learning could also be explored to get a more precise or self-adapting
    advice. 8. Conclusion and future work In this work, we contribute to the literature
    by comparing global and local forecasting methods for the complex case of soil
    moisture forecasting in smart agriculture with various information sources. We
    showed that a transformer-based global approach outperforms the local and previous
    state-of-the-art global approaches with statistical significance. We discussed
    how – for noisy agricultural sensor data – efficient combination of heterogeneous
    information is necessary to skillfully forecast soil moisture sensors across multiple
    days. It is argued that the use of TFTs permits to build skillful global models
    due to its unique structure and its ability to incorporate static information,
    next to historical and temporal future information. This demonstrates the utility
    of an advanced global model such as the TFT for the complex use-case of soil moisture
    forecasting given limited local data. We built and trained all models on a challenging
    and unique dataset from pear orchards collected at different points in time from
    different locations. The statistically significant results indicate that the TFT
    better succeeds at exploiting the various exogenous data sources while the other
    approaches struggle with finding signal in the noise. As such, the TFT successfully
    incorporates multiple real-world datasets, ranging from soil moisture readings
    to weather station data across fields. It also aligns closely with expert knowledge
    by focusing on relevant variables. While all models are thoroughly trained and
    fine-tuned, it is noted that the local model – i.e. the VAR model – is a linear
    model. As such, more complex non-linear interdependencies that potentially exist
    in the data cannot be captured by a linear model like VAR, thus giving the TFT
    and LSTM a potentially inherent advantage. Improved multi-day forecasting of opens
    multiple future avenues of research. For example, the demonstrated ability to
    learn the underlying characteristics of can potentially help in forecasting other
    important measures such as — a measure of tree water status directly related to
    irrigation. Given our successful integration of various climatic data sources
    into one model, the use of such model as a foundation for domain adaptation towards
    other crops could also be explored. Additionally, exploring the feasibility and
    strategies for on-edge deployment can provide crucial insights into the practical
    application of these techniques in real-world scenarios. Lastly, prescriptive
    analytics should be explored to transform the forecasts into actionable irrigation
    advice as to directly reflect economic value for farmers. CRediT authorship contribution

    due to the deteriorating economic situation in the country. However, the absolute
    values differ substantially, largely due to discrepancies between the estimated

    illustrate the spatial variability of Awp in Lebanon, with the area that contributes
    significantly to the agricultural production nationally (Bekaa and Baalbek) shows
    lower land and water productivity compared to irrigated areas in other governorates.
    The contribution of agriculture to the overall SDG 6.4.1 indicator was relatively
    small, although agriculture is a major consumer of water.

    2018 Introduction In 2015, the United Nations (UN) together with the heads of
    the state of 193 countries agreed to adopt the 2030 Agenda as a response to global
    challenges such as population growth, changing lifestyles, and climate change
    which deplete resources and stress the earth system (Bhaduri et al. 2016). They
    were built on the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and
    are far more ambitious in scope of global development (Purvis et al. 2019). It
    consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 169 targets and 231 indicators
    (UN 2017; WWAP and UN-Water 2018; Eisenmenger et al. 2020). The 2030 Agenda now
    also incorporates a specific target focussing on achieving sustainable management
    of clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) (UN 2015). This is in recognition of the
    fact that water availability supports economic growth and the wellbeing of people
    and has been identified as one of the main challenges for human survival (Steffen
    et al. 2015). SDG 6 consists of two indicators, one focusses on overall water
    scarcity (SDG indicator 6.4.2) and the other one focusses on efficient use of
    water from an economic perspective (SDG indicator 6.4.1). These indicators take
    into consideration water withdrawals of three main economic sectors – agriculture,
    industries and services and compare them to their economic contribution to the
    economy (6.4.1) and the total water available (6.4.2) (UN-Water 2021). SDG indicator
    6.4.1 is a composite of the water use efficiency (WUE) of the three sectors, expressed
    into economic value added per unit of water withdrawn (in USD/m3). As a composite,
    this indicator is dominated by the high value, low water use sectors such as industry
    and therefore to be able to provide sector specific recommendations, literature
    suggests to evaluate each sector’s water use efficiency separately (Hellegers
    and van Halsema 2021). Monitoring WUE for the agricultural sector, and thus Agricultural
    Water Use Efficiency (Awe), is also important for SDG indicator 6.4.2 as it is
    responsible for over 70% of the globally withdrawn water (FAO 2015). Even though
    the methodology for monitoring SDG indicator 6.4.1 has been clearly defined (FAO
    2019), there is an ongoing debate on the rationale for using water withdrawn as
    it doesn’t take into consideration return flows which could be used elsewhere
    or is returned to the environment (Hellegers and van Halsema 2021; Vanham 2018).
    An alternative recommended approach therefore is to evaluate the agricultural
    productivity against the water consumed in the form of evapotranspiration (ET)
    (Hellegers and van Halsema 2021), which is also known as agricultural water productivity.
    One of the discrepancies between considering water withdrawals compared to water
    consumed is that the latter includes water stemming from rainfall. It is therefore
    important to consider the water consumed from irrigation only (also called blue
    ET (ETb) (Chukalla et al. 2015). The progress of the SDGs is monitored by the
    countries themselves through comprehensive data collection (Connor 2015; Reyers
    et al. 2017). However, this is a costly effort and most countries do not collect
    this information on a regular basis (Roopnarine et al. 2019). In 2019, OECD (2019)
    reported that on average countries reported on just 55% of the SDG indicators
    since 2015, with only few countries providing data for all years. The low level
    of progress compared to the MDG monitoring, which was 68% in 2015, can be explained
    by the fact that the SDGs has more indicators (231 vs. 48) and more complex computing
    workflows (MacFeely 2018). Remote Sensing (RS) is considered as a reliable source
    of data which can support the monitoring and reporting of the SDG indicators on
    a regular and near-real time basis (Calera et al. 2017; Hakimdavar et al. 2020;
    Kavvada et al. 2020). FAO, one of the custodian agencies for reporting several
    SDGs is therefore actively promoting the uptake of amongst other data, the use
    of Earth Observation (Gennari et al. 2019). Open data platforms such as Global
    surface water explorer (Pekel et al. 2016) and the Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer
    (Lu et al. 2021) contribute significantly to the periodical estimation of indicators
    related to SDG 6.Recent publications demonstrate the use of satellite data in
    mapping of wetlands contributing to SDG 6.6.1 (Weise et al. 2020), mapping land
    degradation to support SDG 15 (Giuliani et al. 2020), and collect evidence on
    slavery from space supporting SDG 8 (Foody et al. 2019; Boyd et al. 2018). RS
    based ET has been used to monitor various aspects of water management such as
    estimation of water allocation to various sectors (Droogers et al. 2010) and irrigation
    performance assessment (Karimi et al. 2019), however, the use of RS based ET for
    monitoring the SDGs is still relatively new (Biancalani and Marinelli 2021). There
    are various RS based ET products available which can be utilised to support reporting
    of SDG 6 indicators (e.g. SSEBop: Senay et al. 2013; CMRSET: Guerschman et al.
    2009; SEBS: Chen et al. 2013; MOD16: Mu et al. 2011). There are multiple global
    initiatives globally to coordinate the efforts of monitoring SDG’s using RS data.
    One of the major initiatives is Group on Earth Observations (GEO) which is a partnership
    of more than 100 national governments and organizations with major objective being
    main streaming Earth observation data for decisions and actions towards sustainable
    development (Anderson et al. 2017). GEO initiated the development of Global Earth
    Observation System of Systems (GEOSS: Nativi et al. 2020) with the Committee on
    Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) contributing to the technical side of the
    development including initiatives to promote RS for SDG monitoring such as EO4SDG
    (Kavvada et al. 2022). In this paper, we investigate how RS can support monitoring
    of SDG 6.4.1 on water use efficiency. We modelled the agricultural component of
    SDG 6.4.1. with RS data using two different approaches: (i) using volume of consumptive
    water use (actual evapotranspiration) and (ii) using the water productivity concept.
    We applied both approaches to the country Lebanon as a case study and compared
    the results to the standard calculations using AQUASTAT data. Methodology Case
    study: Lebanon Lebanon has an area of 10,452 km2 and is divided into 7 governorates
    (Fig. 1). The annual rainfall ranges between 700 and 1,500 mm/year, averaging
    910 mm/year. Lebanon is considered rich in water resources compared to its surrounding
    countries, with 12 permanent watercourses with a discharge of 3,542 million m3/year
    along with 2,000 major springs which provide 630 million m3/year (Shaban 2020).
    Fig. 1 Map of Lebanon showing distribution of irrigated areas in governorates
    in 2020. (source of data: WaPOR) Full size image Agricultural lands occupy more
    than one third of the area (3,600 km2), of which 1040 km2 is equipped for irrigation
    and 900 km2 was actually irrigated as recorded in the 1998 census (FAO 2008).
    About 42% this area is located in the Bekaa Valley (FAO 2008). The main irrigated
    crops are wheat (24%), potatoes (18%), citrus (16%) and vegetables (14%). The
    source of water for irrigation is evenly distributed between surface water (48%)
    and groundwater (52%) (Shaban 2014). The agricultural sector contributes 5% of
    GDP and employs 8% of the labour force (FAO-Lebanon 2022). Methods This study
    focuses on modelling the agricultural component of the SDG indicator 6.4.1 (Awe)
    using two different RS-based approaches (Awp) and compare the results to the standard
    equation of Awe. The analysis was conducted using annual timesteps for a 5-year
    period starting with the baseline for the SDG in 2015 to 2020. We used a geospatial
    modelling approach (Chen et al. 2020; Koubarakis 2023) to provide a comprehensive
    analysis of water use efficiency and productivity in agricultural systems. The
    standard equation for the agricultural component of SDG indicator 6.4.1 (Awe)
    is defined in FAO (2019) as: $${A_{we}} = \\frac{{GV{A_a}(1 - {c_r})}}{{{V_a}}}$$
    (1) Where: Awe represents the water use efficiency of irrigated agriculture in
    USD/m3. GVAa is the Gross Value Added to gross domestic product (GDP) by agriculture
    in USD/year. cr is the proportion of agricultural GVAa produced by rainfed agriculture.
    Va is the volume of water used by the agricultural sector in m3/year. The equation
    focusses on the gross value added to GDP by irrigated agriculture (represented
    by GVAa* (1 - cr)) as this is where the water withdrawals contribute to. This
    ensures that the Awe calculation focuses solely on the efficiency of the water
    withdrawals in agriculture. For the RS-based approaches for modelling the agricultural
    component of SDG 6.4.1, we developed two approaches. The first approach modifies
    Eq. 1 by replacing the water withdrawn (Va) with the total volume of the blue
    water consumed (VETb) derived from water supplied through irrigation (Eq. 2).
    $${A}_{wp1}=\\frac{{GVA}_{a}\\left(1-{C}_{r}\\right)}{{V}_{ETb} }$$ (2) Where:
    Awp1 is the water productivity of irrigated agricultural in USD/m3 using approach
    1 VETb is the volume of water consumed by irrigation (blue ET) in m3/year. To
    estimate VETb the first step is to separate ET into water from rainfall (ET green)
    and irrigation (ETb) (Chukalla et al. 2015). Various models exist to separate
    ET, which have different level of complexity and without clear validation data
    it is not possible to identify the best model (Msigwa et al. 2021). Therefore,
    for this purpose, we used a rather simple model by considering effective rainfall
    as ET green with the remainder of ET to be attributed to ETb. The effective rainfall
    and ETb is calculated on a monthly basis and summed to an annual value using Eq.
    3: $${ET}_{b}={\\sum }_{n=1}^{12}max(ET -{P}_{e},0)$$ (3) Where: ETb is in mm/year,
    ET is in mm/month, and Pe is effective rainfall in mm/month. Pe is computed from
    monthly precipitation by applying the conditions in outlined in the Eq. 4, adapted
    from Brouwer and Heibloem (1986): \\(Pe = \\max (0.8*P - 25,0)\\), if P > 75 mm/month
    (4) \\(Pe = \\max (0.6*P - 10,0),\\) if P ≤ 75 mm/month Annual ETb is then converted
    to volume (VETb) in m3/year by multiplying the average ETb of the irrigated areas
    (\\({\\stackrel{-}{\\text{E}\\text{T}}}_{\\text{b}}\\)) with the irrigated area
    (Airr) as given in Eq. 5. $${V_{ETb}} = \\overline {E{T_b}} \\times {A_{irr}}$$
    (5) The second approach starts with calculating Biomass Water Productivity (WPb)
    at pixel scale in kg/m3. WPb is derived from dividing the Total Biomass Production
    or Land Productivity (LP in kg/ha) by the irrigation water consumed (ETb). This
    is represented by the following equation (Eq. 6): $${WP}_{b}= \\frac{LP }{{ET}_{b}
    }$$ (6) WPb is converted to economic water productivity by multiplying the average
    price per unit of annual biomass production from irrigated agriculture as presented
    in the following equation (Eq. 7): $${A}_{wp2}= {WP}_{b} \\times \\stackrel{-}{p}$$
    (7) Where: Awp2 is the agriculture water productivity in USD/m3 using approach
    2. WPb is the Biomass Water Productivity in kg/m3. \\(\\stackrel{-}{\\text{p}}\\)
    is the average value added in USD per kg of annual biomass production The average
    price is obtained by dividing GVAa of irrigated agriculture with the total LP
    of the irrigated area. This second approach is modelled at the grid or pixel level,
    which fills the gap that national level indicators are not able to provide all
    the required information for decision makers (Giuopponi et al. 2018; Saner et
    al. 2020). The analyses enables the spatial disaggregation of the results to sub-national
    levels (governorates and villages), and thereby providing an assessment of spatial
    variability of Awp within a country. Data sources Table 1 shows an overview of
    the data used in this research and for each approach, it consists of both secondary
    data and RS derived data. Awe is calculated using solely the secondary data from
    AQUASTAT (FAO 2022). This secondary data consists of annual country-level data
    on agricultural water withdrawals (Va), gross value added to GDP from agriculture
    (GVAa), and the Proportion of GVAa produced by rainfed agriculture (cr). Except
    for Va, this data was also used to model the two RS-based approaches. For the
    RS-based approaches, the data is complemented by RS based ET and LP. This data
    was obtained from FAO’s portal to monitor water productivity through open access
    RS derived data (WaPOR) (FAO 2023). WaPOR data is available in three resolutions,
    for Lebanon the highest resolution available covering the entire country of 100
    m (WaPOR level 2) was used in this study. Table 1 Data and corresponding sources
    employed in each of the approaches Full size table Results and discussion National
    level The results of the two approaches for calculating Awp were compared to Awe
    (Fig. 2). The values of Awp1 range between 1.93 USD/m3 in 2020 to 2.46 USD/m3
    in 2015, with Awp2 showing a slightly higher estimation compared to Awp1. The
    three curves show similar trends over time, with a decline from 2015 to 2016,
    a general increase from 2016 to 2019 and a sharp decline in 2020. The results
    show a high correlation between Awp1 and Awp2 (r2 = 0.9), and lower correlation
    between the two approaches for Awp and Awe (r2 = 0.5). Fig. 2 Comparison between
    Awe and the two approaches for estimating Awp Full size image In absolute values,
    however, Awp1 and Awp2 are almost a factor 2 higher than Awe. With the GVAa for
    Awe and Awp1 being the same, the difference is in the estimation of the water
    withdrawn or consumed. Comparing the annual irrigated areas obtained from the
    WaPOR and those from AQUASTAT, it shows a significant difference. The WaPOR LCC
    map estimates an area between 354 and 432 km2 as irrigated, which is less than
    half of the area reported by the Lebanese government in AQUASTAT (900 km2) (Fig.
    2A). A major distinction between the two is that the AQUASTAT data is based on
    area equipped for irrigation, which is a static value, whereas WaPOR uses a water
    deficit index based on precipitation and evapotranspiration to estimate if a cropland
    is irrigated or not, which varies year by year 2 (FAO 2020). When comparing the
    volume of water used for irrigation per area (in mm/year) (Fig. 2B), the values
    from both sources have a closer match. The WaPOR ETb data ranges between 449 mm/year
    in 2020 to 604 mm/year in 2015 (Fig. 2B), while AQUASTAT reports the volume of
    water withdrawn by agriculture (WWagric) to be 0.7 km3/year (equivalent to 777
    mm/year), and crop water requirement (CWR) of 0.529 km3/year (equivalent to 587
    mm/year). The discrepancy in the last two years could be attributed to fields
    being abandoned because of the economic hardship faced by farmers in Lebanon.
    Despite these differences, the order of magnitude in estimated water depth estimated
    using the WaPOR data are reasonable. As shown in Fig. 2, the results show a consistent
    drop in Awe and both Awp approaches between 2019 and 2020. Comparing WPb with
    Awp2 shows that the main culprit for the decline in Awp2 is not in efficient water
    use in the agricultural sector as WPb shows an overall increasing trend from 2015
    to 2020, from 2.1 to 2.2 kg/m3 in 2015 to 3.18 kg/m3 in 2020 (Fig. 4). Awp2 followed
    the same trend as WPb until 2019, starting at 2.79 USD/m3 in 2015 to reach 3.21
    USD/m3 in 2019. After 2019, the two indicators start deviating with WPb increasing
    to 3.18 kg/m3, and Awp2 dropping to 2.2 USD/m3. The drop in Awp2 is therefore
    not the result of a reduced performance of the agricultural sector but is due
    to factors affecting the economy in Lebanon 2020, with GVAa dropping from 634
    million USD in 2018 to 339 million USD in 2020. At the same time, the results
    show that WPb continues to increase over time. Fig. 3 A) Area under irrigation

    Full size image Sub-national level The spatial disaggregation of LP, WPb and Awp2
    per governorates and villages provides additional information related to the performance
    of the irrigated areas in the different administrative zones (Fig. 5). The highest
    LP was found in the North and South with a LP between 20 and 25 ton/ha. Fig. 5
    A) Water Productivity (WPb), B) Land Productivity (LP) and C) Awp2 per governorates
    in 2015; D) Awp2 per village in 2015 Full size image The highest WPb during these
    five years was Bekaa governorate in 2020. However, the highest average WPb of
    all the governorates was Akkar with 2.8 kg/m3 and the lowest was recorded in the
    North Governorate with 2.4 kg/m3 (Fig. 5D). Overall, WPb per governorate was increasing
    over the years (Fig. 6A), however Awp2 was decreasing, especially in the last
    year of the analyses (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6 A) Annual WPb and B) annual Awp2 per governorate
    in 2015 Full size image While Lebanon’s average AWp2 between 2015 and 2020 was
    2.78 USD/m3, the spatial disaggregation per governorate or even village shows
    high variability, with Awp2 in the range between 1.8 and 3–3.5 USD/m3 (Fig. 6B).
    These results show that reporting of Awp2 (and therefore Awe) at country level
    masks the spatial variability within a country and thereby hiding the issues shown
    when data is disaggregated. Thus, the spatial disaggregation can actually identify
    hotspots and assist in identifying factors that can explain successes and thus
    measures for improvement. Implications for SDG 6 reporting In the context of reporting
    SDG indicator 6.4.1 for Lebanon, Fig. 7 shows the indicator increasing from 17.5
    USD/m3 in 2000 to 25 USD/m3 in 2019. While the analysis shows that the indicator
    increased significantly over this period, the changes since 2015 (the baseline
    of the SDGs) were negligible. The contribution of agriculture to the WUE was relatively
    small (Fig. 7), although agriculture is a major consumer of water (Fig. 8a). Fig.
    7 Contribution of the different sectors to SDG Indicator 6.4.1 water use efficiency
    for Lebanon over time between 2000 and 2019. (Source of data: UN-Water 2022) Full
    size image Fig. 8 (a) water withdrawal per sector; (b) GVA per sector over time
    between 2000 and 2019. (Source of data: UN Water 2022) Full size image The data
    breakdown for SDG indicator 6.4.1 reveals that water withdrawals for the agricultural
    sector decreases over time while its contribution to the GVA remains relatively
    constant. The main jump in the overall SDG indicator 6.4.1 between 2000 and 2015
    is thus clearly related to the increase in industrial water withdrawals, which
    has grown nine-fold from 2000 to 2017, surpassing agriculture, while its GVA contribution
    declines (Fig. 8A and B). Conclusion The results of the different approaches show
    that RS based data can be a valuable source of data for regular reporting and
    monitoring of SDG indicator 6.4.1. By replacing the water withdrawn by the water
    consumed, the latter of which can be observed by RS, a proxy to the conventional
    indicator is estimated. The results of these different approaches to estimate
    Awp show similar trends as Awe. While the overall results on trends are encouraging,
    the absolute values differ substantially. One main factor is the large inconsistencies
    in the data on area irrigated in Lebanon between the WaPOR data and the data reported
    in AQUASTAT. A possible explanation of this discrepancy can be related to the
    different definitions used in AQUASTAT where the irrigated area is the area equipped
    with irrigation, whereas WaPOR uses the water deficit index to identify areas
    that are actually irrigated (FAO 2020). Arguably, monitoring progress benefits
    more from information on actually irrigated areas and the water consumed in those
    areas compared to the potential irrigated areas and the estimated water supply
    to these areas as reported in AQUASTAT. A second source of discrepancy is that
    the Awp approaches only estimate water productivity in irrigated areas and does
    not consider the aquaculture and livestock components as per the definition of
    SDG indicator 6.4.1. In the case of Lebanon, the volume of water consumed by irrigation
    contributes to an important part of the total water withdrawn by agriculture,
    and therefore will not affect the results. The methodology used in this paper
    can be easily extended globally. The combination of spatial and temporal analysis
    can give a better understanding of the spatial variations and can help incorporate
    policy changes, decisions, and actions toward Agenda 2030. Before applying the
    methodology to other countries, it is recommended to validate the RS based estimates
    to improve the reliability of the analysis and to evaluate if the assumption that
    irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of water in agriculture is valid.

  description: Water governance (WG) plays a crucial role in steering integrated water
    resources management (IWRM) toward the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs), particularly in developing regions. Despite this, substantial challenges
    hinder effective WG implementation across Asia. This study systematically reviews
    WG literature in Asia from 2000 to 2020, identifying prevailing challenges and
    proposing a modified WG framework to encourage policy reform. Utilizing the Preferred
    Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, we
    searched the Scopus database and additional resources to accumulate comprehensive
    literature on WG in Asia. We incorporated peer-reviewed articles, gray literature,
    and institutional reports. These were evaluated based on their relevance to WG
    in Asia, use of analytical frameworks, and incorporation of performance indicators.
    The search identified 350 potentially relevant documents, with 145 qualifying
    for in-depth review after screening through rigorous selection criteria, comprising
    peer-reviewed articles, institutional reports, and influential gray literature.
    The literature revealed increasing attention to WG since the SDGs’ inception,
    with the most significant contributions related to Southeast Asia, South Asia,
    and East Asia. Critical WG issues identified include transboundary water management,
    irrigation challenges, water quality concerns, and water–food–energy nexus interdependencies.
    Predominantly, these issues stem from insufficient legal and institutional frameworks,
    poor stakeholder engagement, and ineffective cooperation, particularly in cross-border
    river basins. The analysis frequently employed legal and institutional frameworks,
    Ostrom’s theory, and OECD guidelines, all pointing to common challenges. We propose
    a modified WG framework with 13 elements, accompanied by key recommendations.
    The study underscores the need for an enhanced understanding of WG to support
    policymakers, managers, and scholars in developing effective WG strategies that
    align with the SDGs. This research contributes to the literature by providing
    a synthesized perspective on WG in Asia and a foundation for future governance
    improvements.

    2024 1 Introduction Water is a pivotal driver of economic growth, social improvement,
    and environmental well-being (OECD 2018a). Consequently, it has become a focal
    point for sustainable development (SD) of human societies globally (Guppy et al.
    2019; Benson et al. 2020; Duc et al. 2021). In fact, according to Nilsson (2016),
    Guppy et al. (2019), UN (2019), Benson et al. (2020), GWP and UNEP-DHI (2020),
    Fonseca et al. (2020), Stibbe and Prescott (2020), Duc et al. (2021; 2023), ISC
    (2021), and OECD (2018a), implementation of comprehensive IWRM has played a crucial
    role in enabling countries to achieve internationally agreed United Nations’ (UN)
    SDGs and targets. These include not just the water-dedicated SDG 6 (clean water
    and sanitation) but also parts of other SDGs such as nos. 3, 11, 12, 13, and 14,
    as shown in Fig. 1. Similarly, sound water management will also be critical for
    achieving other global goals such as the New Urban Agenda, Paris Climate Agreement,
    and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, which explicitly calls
    for “strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk” (UNDP 2013;
    Chan et al. 2016; OECD 2018a). Nevertheless, an increasing number of countries,
    particularly in developing regions, face mounting challenges in the implementation
    of IWRM in ever more complex circumstances. These deep-seated challenges include
    rapid industrial growth and urbanization, unsustainable agriculture (Duc et al.
    2021) and land use, climate change, and especially, poor governance (Li et al.
    2021). All these factors are leading to situations where there is too little,
    too much, or too polluted water globally. Globally, these challenges pose the
    principal risks to the availability and quality of current and future freshwater.
    In fact, according to OECD (2012, 2018a) and Vo et al. (2017), 40% of the world’s
    population currently lives in water-stressed river basins, while water demand
    is expected to rise by 55% by 2050. Also, in 2050, 240 million and 1.4 billion
    people are expected to remain without access to clean water and basic sanitation,
    respectively, despite global efforts to tackle this shortage. Fig. 1 Linkages
    among IWRM, key water-related SDGs, and their main targets Full size image The
    attainment of comprehensive IWRM as well as SDGs, especially in developing countries,
    will require these challenges to be addressed (OECD 2018a), with particular priority
    given to the improvement of poor governance. In fact, OECD (2015), Otsuka (2019b)
    and Di Vaio et al. (2021) stated that to put IWRM into practice effectively, good
    WG must be successfully fulfilled. Since IWRM promotes the coordinated development
    and management of water, land, and related resources, WG refers to the political,
    social, economic, and administrative systems that influence water use and management
    (Chan et al. 2016). Many scientific studies have also shown that water insecurity
    and crises are frequently rooted in governance crises (OECD 2011, 2018a; Chan
    et al. 2016) and that improving WG is widely regarded as the key to solving these
    problems, particularly in developing countries (Rogers and Hall 2003; Kashyap
    2004; Saleth and Dinar 2005; Hoekstra and Chapagain 2007; Rijsberman and Zwane
    2008; Briscoe 2009; Biswas and Tortajada 2010; Araral and Yu 2012, 2013; Araral
    and Wang 2013; Araral and Ratra 2016). Therefore, to effectively address the complex
    problem of securing access to safe water, scholars and practitioners have suggested
    fostering improved modes of WG that actively support the implementation of IWRM
    (Chan et al. 2016; Jiménez et al. 2020). Over the last 2 decades, WG has emerged
    as an essential function of public administration and is widely acknowledged as
    a suitable framework to orient IWRM toward achieving diverse SDGs around the world
    (Tropp 2007; Gain and Schwab 2012; Zinzani and Bichsel 2018; Jiménez et al. 2020).
    Although much work and various entry-point views have been developed, the practical
    meaning of the term “WG” and how to work with it remains unclear (Araral and Yu
    2012, 2013; Araral and Ratra 2016; Jiménez et al. 2020). For instance, there is
    no consensus on the scope and definition of WG, on the principles of good governance,
    or on the concepts or elements required for an effective governance framework––all
    leading to disputes among practitioners and researchers alike. Different schools
    of thought have adopted and interpreted governance from different perspectives,
    and international forums and agencies have also used this term with different
    interests and sometimes with conflicting objectives. Moreover, WG has been referred
    to both as a process and an outcome, giving rise to different usage of the term.
    Although the number of studies of WG has increased in recent years, a synthesis
    of these studies––especially those reflecting WG regimes in developing regions––is
    still very rare. With 30 out of 47 countries characterized as less developed and
    developing, in the global context, Asia is considered to be a developing area
    (UN 2020, 2022a; Britannica 2022; O’Neill 2022). Encompassing five distinct regions
    (Fig. 2 and supplementary Table 1), this continent is the Earth’s largest (44,579,000
    km2) and most populous (with 60% of the world’s population) (Kataoka 2005; Douglass
    2013; Wikipedia 2022; Worlddata 2022). Notably, its annual absolute volume of
    water resources (13,500 km3 or 32% of the world’s freshwater resources) is larger
    than any other continent’s (Douglass 2013). Indeed, the continent is home to 57
    of the 263 international river basins globally (Fig. 3), of which at least 40
    are major ones, including the Aral Sea-Central Asia River Basin (ASCARB), Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghan
    River Basin (GBMRB), Indus River Basin (IRB), and Mekong River Basin (MRB) (UNEP
    2008; Baran and Myschowoda 2009; Mfodwo 2010; Douglass 2013; Dixit 2018). However,
    only ten are fully covered by basin agreements (Rieu-Clarke et al. 2012; Chen
    et al. 2013), leading to various transboundary political challenges in Asia. Furthermore,
    despite possessing vast river systems, Asia is a global epicenter of water insecurity.
    This manifests as limited access to clean water for many of its inhabitants (Douglass
    2013; ADB 2016) and lower freshwater availability per capita compared to other
    continents (Chellaney 2007; Wikipedia 2022), which is exacerbated by high water
    demand from its rapidly growing population and industrial sectors. Moreover, with
    more than half of the world’s poorest people, Asia is one of the most climate-related
    hazards and disaster-prone regions (mainly floods and droughts) (ADB 2016; FAO
    2018; OXFAM 2020). Fig. 2 Map of the Asian continent, including its regions and
    countries Full size image Fig. 3 Cross-border river basins of Asia (OSU 2009;
    Rieu-Clarke et al. 2012; Douglass 2013) Full size image In general, although Asia
    is changing rapidly and becoming a new global economic center, many of its poor
    and developing countries often suffer from problems of poor hydrology, such as
    heavy dependency on agriculture and irrigation, rapid population growth, and industrial
    urbanization and hence high water demand and pollution, aging water infrastructure,
    fragile institutions, and more uncertainties arising from climate change (Araral
    and Yu 2012; OXFAM 2020). The result is more water insecurity and conflicts within
    and between its countries (Briscoe 2009; Araral and Yu 2012). Consequently, it
    is acknowledged that the WG problem is acute in Asia; hence, understanding and
    improving governance there is more vital than anywhere else toward achieving both
    the regional and global SD (MRC 2010; Keskinen et al. 2016). This study undertakes
    a systematic review to fill the existing knowledge void by offering a comprehensive
    understanding of water governance (WG), particularly within the developmental
    landscapes of Asian countries. It elucidates the definitions, conceptualizations,
    operations, challenges, evaluations, and evolution of WG across the varied contexts
    of these nations. Through an analysis of the findings, the study advocates for
    the establishment of an appropriate WG framework tailored to the specific needs
    of these regions. Our research aimed to answer the following questions: How has
    WG been defined and conceptualized over time, and what constitutes effective WG?
    How has academic interest in WG within Asia evolved over time in the scientific
    literature? Which frameworks and key elements are commonly employed to analyze
    WG and associated issues in Asia? What constitutes an optimal framework for current
    and future WG in Asia, and what governance challenges does this framework face
    in its application? 2 Methodology In this study, a systematic literature review
    was employed to provide a comprehensive insight into WG in Asia between 2000 and
    2020, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
    (PRISMA) guidelines to document the literature review process (Moher et al. 2009;
    Özerol et al. 2018). To collect relevant peer-reviewed literature, the Scopus
    database (http://www.scopus.com/, accessed in December 2021) was used as our primary
    source. Google Scholar was used to manually search for other publications and
    for other relevant global reports (gray literature). The search was restricted
    to publications from the year 2000 (when the MDGs were approved (UNDP 2013)) to
    2020. The year 2000 was selected as the starting point to align with the advent
    of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which constituted a pivotal shift
    in the global development agenda impacting water governance discourse. This demarcation
    ensures the inclusion of literature that reflects the evolving priorities in water
    management practices, particularly in response to international sustainability
    targets. Furthermore, the beginning of the twenty-first century marked significant
    technological advancements and the digital availability of publications, providing
    a robust and relevant corpus for analysis. The implementation process of this
    study consisted of four key steps as follows (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Flowchart of the
    systematic review methodology Full size image In the first step, the study performed
    the search query for the Scopus database with the following Boolean string: (TITLE-ABS-KEY
    (“water governance” AND Asia*) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“adaptive governance” AND water
    AND Asia*) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“sustainable water management” AND Asia*)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY
    (framework OR approach). The search was restricted to a publication period from
    2000 (when the MDGs were approved (UNDP 2013)) to 2020. The search yielded 296
    publications, primarily including articles, books, book chapters, and conference
    proceedings. Next, a manual search in Google Scholar targeting the first 250 results
    was applied to extend the study to relevant publications in non-indexed journals.
    Here, 39 additional publications, mainly comprising reports, dissertations, policy
    documents, and newspaper articles, were added to the list. Moreover, 15 professional
    publications were also added by manually searching in repositories of the Global
    Water Partnership (GWP) (https://www.gwp.org/en/GWP-CEE/WE-ACT/publications/),
    Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/),
    UN Development Programme (UNDP) (https://www.un-ilibrary.org/), and the Asian
    Development Bank (ADB) (https://www.adb.org/publications). In total, 350 publications
    were retrieved by the defined search query. The next step was the process of quick
    database screening of each publication’s title, abstract, and keywords to obtain
    only relevant publications for inclusion in the full-text review. During this
    process, the following five inclusion criteria were thoroughly examined: The publication
    (i) had the full text written in English language (compulsory criterion), (ii)
    focused on WG-related issues and (iii) case study areas in Asia (compulsory),
    (iv) included frameworks and elements applied for analyzing these issues (optional),
    and (v) comprised WG performance indicators (optional). After screening and eliminating
    duplicate publications, a total of 213 were found to match the defined criteria.
    In the last step, the full-text review was manually applied to retain only particularly
    relevant ones. These were then subjected to in-depth analysis. The criteria behind
    this review were: how the case study areas were selected, whether a methodology
    was applied, and how the database was collected and analyzed. Consequently, this
    review narrowed the number of eligible publications to 145, comprising 92 peer-reviewed
    articles, 27 books/book chapters, three theses, and 23 reports. For in-depth analysis,
    specific information from these publications, such as the authors, publication
    years, titles, journals/organizations and types, WG definitions, frameworks and
    elements constructed, case study focus areas, WG-related issues examined, and
    WG challenges, was collected and summarized in supplementary Table 2. 3 Results
    and Discussions 3.1 Spatiotemporal Distribution of the Available Literature on
    WG 3.1.1 Temporal Distribution Figure 5 shows the annual numbers of qualifying
    publications focusing on the Asian WG-related issues published between 2000 and
    2020. These numbers show an upward trend, originating from 2001 and especially
    after 2015, with almost 50% (72 publications) being published. Specifically, starting
    with a very low baseline of 0–3 publications per year until 2007, this annual
    number increased slightly from 2008 to 2014 and picked up significantly during
    the latter period. This number was 11 in 2015, then rapidly rose, and peaked in
    2020. This upward trend indicated growing global attention toward the issues of
    WG in Asia after the 1990s, especially in recent years, possibly due to the emergence
    of the MDGs and SDGs and following specific events over the last 2 decades. Fig.

    Full size image According to OECD (2011), the attention to WG followed a general
    shift in focus on the sector during the 1990s. Indeed, after the establishment
    of the “Dublin Principles” in 1992––a milestone in the global consciousness of
    the importance of water resources, a global effort was mounted to urge all governments
    to translate these universal principles into urgent action programs for good WG
    and SD (Rahaman and Varis 2008; OECD 2011). Moreover, following the creation of
    the World Water Council in 1996, the first (1997) and second WWF (2000) considered
    WG to be a main issue for water-related problems and continued to call for ensuring
    good WG (Gain and Schwab 2012; Wajjwalku 2019; WWC 2022). In the Millennium Summit
    2000, a list of eight MDGs was adopted as an international development agenda
    until 2015. Regarding water, the MDGs targeted to halve the world population without
    access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (Mfodwo 2010; Chan
    et al. 2016). Subsequently, key international events from 2000 to 2005 such as
    the HMD (WWF 2000) and UNMA (UN 2000); BFC (Aminova and Abdullayev 2009); WSSD
    (Gain and Schwab 2012); third WWF (Chan 2009); establishment of UN-Water with
    its “Water for Life” International Decade (UN 2022b); and CSD had all considered
    improved governance in the water sector to be an overarching concern for meeting
    the water-related MDGs (Tropp 2007; Gain and Schwab 2012). Also, in 2002 and 2003,
    official definitions of IWRM and WG were, respectively, presented by the GWP,
    in which a better WG focusing on technical and scientific aspects was recognized
    as a key condition for achieving holistic WRM (Rahaman and Varis 2008; OECD 2011)
    and SD (Otsuka 2019b). In general, these key events identified WG as the first
    area for priority action and called all nations and regions, including Asia, to
    govern water effectively (UN 2000; Gain and Schwab 2012). Although WG issues had
    become a centerpiece of the high-level political agenda of the early 2000s, surprisingly,
    there was a lack of theoretical analysis and debate over them (Franks and Cleaver
    2007). Until the fourth (2006) and fifth WWF (2009), the WG concept was more widely
    discussed with a focus on a supportive legal and institutional framework––one
    of its central elements (OECD 2011). Consequently, the number of WG studies in
    the globe, including Asian regions, gradually increased from the early 2000s.
    Indeed, from 2006, international organizations such as the World Bank and ADB,
    with their most ambitious “SA Water Initiative,” began to intervene in WG-related
    issues in SA (Hanasz 2017b). Social scientists also increasingly debated and analyzed
    the political nature of water and its governance (Zinzani and Bichsel 2018). Even
    in the early 2010s, the term most prevalent in the water sector during the 2000s,
    “IWRM,” was increasingly deprecated in favor of the term “WG” (Biswas and Tortajada
    2010; Gain and Schwab 2012). Another action plan significantly contributing to
    this attention growth was the 2011–2020 SPB. It included 20 ABTs supporting the
    MDGs’ implementation by conserving biodiversity to underpin global food security
    and clean water (CBD 2020). Most WG publications in Asia have been published since
    2015––a milestone marking a rapid growth of debates on WG globally (Pahl-Wostl
    2015). Indeed, since 2000, substantial progress has been made toward achieving
    the MDGs, but as of 2015, many of the water-related targets have not been fully
    achieved (e.g., globally, one in ten people lack access to safe water) (WHO and
    UNICEF 2015). Thus, in 2015, the UN presented 17 SDGs covering economic, social,
    and environmental aspects as a unifying global vision to continue the progress
    made under the MDGs over the next 15 years. Specific to WG, Goal 6 calls for effective
    WG to ensure safe water and sanitation for all by implementing IWRM across multiple
    scales (Mcdonnell 2008; Osti 2018; GWP and UNEP-DHI 2020). This inclusion of WG
    formally recognized that comprehensive achievement of the IWRM and SDGs cannot
    be realized without considering WG. Therefore, the announcement of SDGs (especially
    SDG 6) has been acknowledged as the key driver behind the increase in WG publications
    since 2015. For instance, in 2016, the GWP partnered with the UNEP-DHI Centre
    and Cap-Net in the SDG 6 IWRM Support Programme to assist governments in promoting
    more programs and studies toward SDG indicator 6.5.1. In the third Asia–Pacific
    Water Summit 2017, the Asia–Pacific region’s leaders committed to facilitating
    the implementation of WG at all levels, strongly focusing on TWM in the region
    (GWP and UNEP-DHI 2020). Moreover, a study by Ahmed and Arara (2019) found that
    WG in eight Indian states, as well as WG studies in this Asian country, had significantly
    improved after 2015, and effective WG was the key to the realization of SDGs,
    particularly SDG 6. Apart from the SDGs, the adoptions of Sendai Framework 2015–2030
    (applied to reduce disaster risk) (ADB 2016, 2020) and CCSF 2015 (agreed upon
    and discussed in the COPs 21 and 22) were also recognized key drivers promoting
    better WG, and hence boosting WG studies in Asia after 2015 (UN 2016; Osti 2018).
    3.1.2 Spatial Distribution Geographically, 80% of the publications (n = 116) selected
    specific Asian countries as study areas, while the remaining 20% focused on Asia’s
    wider regions (i.e., CA, SA, SEA, etc.). Of these 116 publications, around 68%
    included only one Asian country, 24% covered two to five countries, and the remaining
    included more than five countries as their study locations. Notably, some well-known
    WG studies, including high numbers of Asian countries, were Dinar and Saleth (2005)
    (16 countries), Araral and Yu (2012, 2013) (18 and 17, respectively), and ADB
    (2020) and OECD (2020) (30 each). In general, the scope and number of case study
    locations in publications varied widely, mainly due to the diversity in (i) typical
    characteristics of watersheds (i.e., national or international), (ii) types and
    specific objectives of studies (i.e., analytical, assessment, or comparative studies),
    and even (iii) database availability. To visualize these locations better, their
    spatial distribution is shown in supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Spatial
    distribution of the available literature on WG by study locations (countries)
    in Asia Full size image The study locations are unevenly distributed across Asia,
    reflecting the uneven distribution of global resources. Most publications focused
    on WG issues in SA, EA, and SEA. In SA, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal were the
    most-studied countries, while China was the studied hotspot in both EA and Asia.
    Noticeably, the SEA countries, especially Vietnam and Thailand, occupied nearly
    one-third of the total case study locations (n = 111), while scholars also had
    great interest in WG issues of Uzbekistan in CA. The predominance of these countries
    was due to their abundant water resources and typical WG-related challenges. Indeed,
    the largest Asian cross-border river basins are mostly located in these countries
    (Fig. 3), such as the GBMRB and IRB (mainly crossing India, China, Nepal, Bangladesh,
    and Pakistan), MRB (China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam), Red River Basin
    (China, Vietnam, and Laos), and ASCARB (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and
    Kyrgyzstan) (Lebel et al. 2005; Kranz et al. 2010; Douglass 2013; Droogers and
    Bouma 2014; Hanasz 2015). Besides complex TWM-related issues, the water–food–energy–climate
    nexus, legal and institutional arrangements (LIAs), and climate change were all
    significant WG-related challenges in these locations, leading to close attention
    from global scholars. Moreover, although the high concentrations of WG studies
    in some nations such as China and India can also be explained by their large size,
    Vietnam constituted an exception, given its relatively small area but its dense
    waterway network. Regarding the 29 publications focusing on WG issues in Asia’s
    wider regions, each of them opted from one to four regions for case study areas.
    As shown in Fig. 7, SEA accounted for the largest proportion (18 out of 46 cases),
    followed by CA, EA, and SA. Remarkably, there was no case covering WA. These findings
    were also consistent with those shown in Fig. 6, indicating the overrepresentation
    of Southeastern nations in WG studies. Conversely, very few studies focused on
    Western countries, mainly due to the various obstacles regarding the lack of trust
    and official cooperation in WRM, the absence or inaccessibility of required databases,
    limitations in research capacity, and socio-economic and political instability
    in and between these water- and data-deficient nations. Fig. 7 Spatial distribution
    of the available literature on WG by study locations (regions) in Asia Full size
    image 3.2 International Perspectives on WG Definitions As reviewed, only 33 publications
    provided definitions of WG, while 20 others represented the concepts of effective
    WG. The GWP’s WG definition in 2003 was considered the first official and mostly
    mentioned in the reviewed publications (n = 31). The WG definitions of Araral
    and Yu (2013) were provided in four publications, while the remaining definitions
    generated by the Water Governance Facility (WGF), Department for International
    Development (DFID), and OECD were included in only one or two publications each.
    Notably, only Moench et al. (2003), Pahl-Wostl et al. (2012), and Araral and Yu
    (2013) proposed their definition of WG. Since the early 2000s, many definitions
    of the meaning and scope of WG have been provided. Until now, however, there has
    been no consensus among them. In 2003, the GWP officially defined WG as “the range
    of political, social, economic, and administrative systems that are in place to
    develop and manage water resources, and the delivery of water services, at different
    levels of society” (UNDP 2004), and it “embraces the formal and informal institutions
    by which authority is exercised” (Rogers and Hall 2003). These perspectives elaborated
    that WG includes the ability to design public policy and an institutional framework
    that is socially accepted and mobilizes social resources to support them. Importantly,
    WG focuses on not only “internal governance” (traditional management emphasizing
    economic and technical solutions) but also “external governance” (involving processes
    more social and political). In 2005, the WGF shared a similar but more nuanced
    and concrete definition, referring to WG as “the political, social, economic and
    administrative systems in place that influence water’s use and management, essentially
    who gets what water, when and how, and who has the right to water and related
    services, and their benefits” (Wajjwalku 2019; SIWI 2022). In 2006, the DFID also
    described WG as “encompassing all the mechanisms, processes, relationships and
    institutions through which citizens and groups articulate their interests and
    exercise their rights and obligations” (DFID 2006). Compared to the GWP’s perspectives,
    these two definitions emphasized one more crucial WG element: the clarification
    of the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders engaged in WRM and use. Although
    the definitions mentioned above include the broader aspects of water issues, they
    fall short in diagnostic and prescriptive utility. It is argued that they should
    diagnose and tackle intractable problems beyond statements of general principles.
    Thus, Tropp (2007) referred to WG in terms of the “evolution of formal and informal
    networks, partnerships, joint-decision-making processes including dialogue and
    negotiated outcomes as mechanisms for steering WG.” Wiek and Larson (2012) summarized
    key features of WG as “a systemic perspective, a governance focus on social actors,
    a transparent and accessible discourse on values and goals, and a comprehensive
    perspective on water sustainability.” Hirsch (2006) argued that in the case of
    MRB, catchment governance should be understood as “an arena for negotiating more
    sustainable, equitable, and productive use and management of water at multiple
    scales.” Others, such as Kashyap (2004), mentioned WG as “the ability to develop
    adaptive capacity” and Godden et al. (2011) as “adaptive and sustainable water
    management” in the context of climate change. Some scholars take a more behavioral
    approach. For instance, Pahl-Wostl et al. (2008, 2012) defined WG as “a system
    with structural features and transient processes at both rule-making and operational
    levels” that “takes into account the different actors together formulating and
    implementing water policy” and hence “promotes a change in these actors’ behavior
    in the area of WG” through these formulation and implementation processes. Some
    recent studies found that many previous definitions, especially the GWPs, presented
    a “one-size-fits-all” concept (Araral and Yu 2013; OECD 2015; Otsuka 2019b). Thus,
    it is difficult to apply the same WG strategy to developing as to developed countries
    since developing ones frequently have poorer capacity in administration, democratic
    institutions, and social service provision. Moreover, these statements are too
    broad and do not provide specified mechanisms or have clear operational implications
    for WRM (Araral and Yu 2013). Therefore, Araral and Yu (2013) provided an alternative
    operational definition of WG as “various dimensions of water law, policies, and
    administration that have been commonly regarded in the literature as important
    determinants of performance.” These include water rights, pricing, decentralization,
    accountability, integration, private sector and user group participation, and
    the organizational basis of WRM, among others (Rola et al. 2015; Maharjan 2018).
    In 2015, the OECD (2015) listed its 12 WG principles to identify whether WG systems
    are performing optimally and help to adjust them where necessary. Three WG elements
    emphasized under these principles are “effectiveness,” “efficiency,” and “trust
    and engagement.” Noticeably, the OECD’s WG perspective was developed “on the premise
    that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to water challenge worldwide,” that
    “water policies need to be tailored to different water resources and places,”
    and that “governance responses have to adapt to changing circumstances” (OECD
    2015; Otsuka 2019b). Furthermore, Jiménez et al. (2020) proposed a practical WG
    definition as “a combination of functions (what), performed with certain attributes
    (how), to achieve one or more desired outcomes (what for), all shaped by the values
    and aspirations of individuals and organizations.” This perspective has improved
    the understanding of WG through its future use: (i) To understand how, in practice,
    different functions are linked to certain attributes for achieving desired outcomes;
    (ii) to understand how countries self-assess their weaknesses and then extract
    general common trends; and (iii) to improve governance intervention design as
    a result of increased understanding of the WG process. Another concept that has
    been regularly discussed recently is “effective WG.” In contrast to the definition
    of WG, there is a relative consensus of perspectives on this concept. For instance,
    the GWP defined this concept as the effective formation and implementation of
    water policies to develop, allocate, and manage water use “equitably and efficiently
    and ensuring environmental sustainability” (Otsuka 2019b). According to both Rogers
    and Hall (2003), DFID (2006), UNDP (2006), Aminova and Abdullayev (2009), and
    Biswas and Tortajada (2010), effective WG should include open, transparent, inclusive,
    communicative, coherent, integrative, equitable, and ethical approaches. Its performance
    and operation should be accountable, consensus oriented, efficient, responsive,
    participatory, and sustainable. Within the perspectives of the OECD and UN-Water,
    effective WG enables people to participate in decisions affecting their lives,
    and to ensure this, accountability mechanisms need to be in place (UN-Water 2014;
    Otsuka 2019b). Several conclusions on WG and effective WG perspectives can be
    drawn. In general, the WG concept embraces the full complexity of political, social,
    economic, and administrative dimensions and their interactions. This is reflected
    in diverse perspectives on WG over the last 2 decades, indicating no standard
    approach to defining it. This is partially due to the diverse usages of this concept
    by practitioners and scholars in planning different WG projects or studying its
    various scopes, aspects, and norms (such as the role of different actors, laws
    and policies, institutions, mechanisms, politics, etc.) in WRM, rather than a
    broad, encompassing definition of WG. Among diverse WG definitions, the GWP’s
    one, which covers the most general characteristics of WG, is still frequently
    mentioned and considered the basis for other concepts to be studied, generated,
    and applied. Meanwhile, the effective WG concept has been conceptualized with
    relatively similar perspectives. In general, with its key elements such as efficiency,
    transparency, equity, accountability, sustainability, responsiveness, and participatory
    nature, effective WG primarily requires active participation by the government,
    civil society, and the private sectors to balance competing interests and social
    equity. 3.3 Focus Issues Addressed in WG This study examined and classified the
    issues addressed in each publication. Based on our findings, these issues were
    classified into water-related (indirect) and WG-related (direct) categories (Table
    1). In Asia, the most prominent water-related issues were “TWM,” “agriculture”
    (mainly regarding irrigation management), and “water quality.” WG scholars also
    frequently investigated energy-, climate-, and urban water-related issues in Asia,
    such as “hydropower energy,” “the water–energy–food nexus,” “climate change,”
    “urban water services,” and “water technology and infrastructure management.”
    In recent years, “SD and SDGs” have also become a hot topic, with 7 studies concerned
    with general SD and 13 focusing on specific SDGs, including goals 11, 16, and
    especially 6 (clean water and sanitation, n = 9). Moreover, natural hazard management
    (mainly water scarcity, drought, and flood risk), river basin and groundwater
    management, and water security were popularly examined and discussed. Among WG-related
    issues in Asia, “LIAs” was the most common topic of discussion, in which legal
    and institutional reforms were referred to as key drivers of improving WG in Asia.
    “Coordination and cooperation,” “stakeholder engagement,” “politics and power,”
    “adaptive governance,” and “capacity development” were also popularly discussed
    issues in the Asian WG, while the remaining issues were considered subsidiary.
    Table 1 Summary of the main water and WG-related issues examined in the reviewed
    publications Full size table Several observations can be made based on our findings.
    Only 10 out of 57 cross-border river basins in Asia are fully covered by basin
    agreements (Rieu-Clarke et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2013). This situation partially
    explains why “TWM” was of most interest in Asia. Indeed, this continent faces
    various challenges in governing water between upstream and downstream nations.
    For instance, the key cross-border challenges in the GBMRB and MRB are water conflicts
    caused mainly by hydropower dam-operating and building activities, poor regional
    cooperation in water allocation for irrigation, lack of joint strategies for mitigating
    climate change (mainly floods and droughts) and its risks, and absence of effectively
    legal and institutional frameworks for regional WG (Douglass 2013; Xing 2017;
    Maharjan 2018; Bourdais et al. 2021). Some core WG challenges in the IRB and ASCARB
    include water shortages in Pakistan due to diverting rivers for irrigation in
    India; weak agreements for controlling transboundary water pollution and saline
    intrusion in the Aral Sea region; and food and electricity shortages in Tajikistan,
    Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan due to unprecedentedly low water level in reservoirs
    (Droogers and Bouma 2014; Williams 2018; Bourdais et al. 2021). This review has
    confirmed our finding that apart from TWM, irrigation management, water quality
    control, hydropower generation, climate change, and the achievement of SDGs are
    the most-discussed issues in the Asian WG studies. The following interpretation
    also supports this finding. Two-thirds of the Asian nations are either less developed
    or developing (UN 2022a; O’Neill 2022). Thus, rapid industrial urbanization, intensification
    of primary production for export, global economic integration, increasing scales
    of projects such as huge dams, and privatization of water infrastructure and services
    have been set as priorities for socio-economic growth there, leading to spatiotemporally
    extensive interactions and impacts on the general WG in Asia. The main reason
    behind the prominence of “LIAs” in the context of WG issues can be explained as
    follows. The very concept of governance is implicitly but strongly concerned with
    laws, policies, regulations, and institutional arrangements. Thus, LIAs should
    be considered core features of any WG system. Reviewed studies have also confirmed
    that WG reform, first improving poor legal and institutional structures, is the
    key solution to complex water-related challenges in Asian nations. For instance,
    Jiang et al. (2020) analyzed two policy trends of WG in China––“state control”
    and “marketization.” They argued that instead of contradicting or supplanting
    each other, they should be complementary, collectively contributing to a distinctive
    governance institution that serves broader political, economic, and water security
    goals. Also, Pahl-Wostl (2009) and Otsuka (2019a) recognized that top-down governance
    has limitations in supporting WG policies enforced in both China and Vietnam.
    Hence, it should be replaced by, or incorporate, a bottom-up mechanism into new
    WG systems. According to Rola et al. (2016a, b), water use across sectors in the
    Philippines is governed by institutions that are too complex, too numerous, and
    too disjointed, and so the highest national priority should be reform of institutional
    structures to more effectively support the implementation of water-use decisions.
    The emergence of “coordination and cooperation,” “stakeholder engagement,” “politics
    and power,” “adaptive governance,” and “capacity development” issues in the reviewed
    studies reflects the following situation. Apart from weak LIAs, WG in many Asian
    nations is characterized by limited stakeholder involvement, inadequate governance
    capabilities (especially institutional adaptive capacity) (Chen et al. 2013; Bettini
    et al. 2015; Wu and Leong 2016; Otsuka 2019b), nationally and internationally
    ineffective coordination and cooperation (mainly regarding data and information
    sharing, the balance of interests, collaborative research, mutual trust, and conflict
    negotiation) (Dore and Lebel 2010; Xing 2017; Bourdais et al. 2021), unequal power
    and unstable political regimes (especially including transboundary geopolitics
    and hydropolitics) (Williams 2018; Zinzani and Bichsel 2018; Hussein 2019; Sehring
    2020), and restricted funding (Araral and Yu 2012; Delavari and Abdi 2018). These
    characteristics reflect an urgent need to confront these issues to strengthen
    more comprehensive WG regimes in Asia. This urgent need is entirely consistent
    with the study’s findings on other Asian WG-related issues. 3.4 Frameworks Used
    to Define WG A well-designed WG framework with diverse elements is crucial for
    assessing the general status of WG, hence identifying and overcoming WG challenges
    and gaps (Ostrom 1990, 2005; Clement 2010; McGinnis and Ostrom 2014). In the reviewed
    studies, a wide range of new and existing frameworks were applied (Table 2). Based
    on reviewing WG studies, especially those of Özerol et al. (2018) and Di Vaio
    et al. (2021), these frameworks were classified into “applied” (applying existing
    ones), “developed” (developing new ones based on existing theory), and “generated”
    (generating new ones based on own theory). Over three-quarters of the publications
    (n = 112) used frameworks, while the remaining were conducted with either no or
    unclear frameworks. Among these 112 publications, 54 applied existing frameworks
    for analysis, while 36 and 22 others, respectively, utilized “developed” and “generated”
    new frameworks. Table 2 Summary of the popular WG frameworks applied in the reviewed
    publications Full size table Some key points emerge from a more detailed review.
    Among the existing frameworks, the LIF, comprising a range of laws, policies,
    and organizations in place to develop and govern water resources, was the most
    commonly applied to many Asian WG regimes. For instance, Molle et al. (2009) applied
    it to (i) analyze the Mekong River Commission’s institutional structure in hydropower
    and irrigation cooperation between Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam and (ii)
    bring to light the institutional dissonances between regional and national decision-making
    landscapes in the Lower Mekong Basin. Loan (2010), Huy et al. (2015), and Vo et
    al. (2017) assessed the Vietnamese WG status in agricultural and water supply
    sectors using LIFs to analyze the implementation of water policies and hence identify
    policy gaps and countermeasures for reforming these policies and institutional
    structures toward SD. Ho (2019a, b) compared the national-level water LIFs in
    China and India across multiple dimensions, including institutional and bureaucratic
    structures, laws, and policies that govern these nations’ urban water sectors.
    Several other frameworks can also be applied as the LIF. The Chinese “Four Systems”
    framework (He et al. 2020a, b) exemplifies this. In general, in the reviewed studies,
    the LIF was mostly utilized to focus on understanding specific case- or place-based
    WG issues. The frameworks generated or developed by adopting Ostrom’s theory of
    common pool resources (CPRs) management were also frequently utilized. They are
    the adaptive and integrated water management (AIWM), Management and Transition
    (MTF), Social-ecological System (SES), and especially Institutional Decomposition
    and Analysis (IDA) and Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) frameworks.
    Among them, the IAD framework generated in 1994 was one of the most tested ones
    in the field of policy sciences (Ostrom 2011; Shrestha and Ojha 2017). Its focal
    level comprises an action arena composed of actors and affected by a set of external
    variables: biophysical conditions (the nature of the environment where actors
    evolve), the attributes of the community (society), and the rules-in-use that
    govern nature–society interaction (Ostrom 2005; Clement 2010). Among the reviewed
    studies, the IAD framework was directly utilized in 4 studies and was referred
    to, modified, and applied in 31 others. For instance, Araral and Wu (2016) modified
    and used this framework as a new systematic analytical tool to compare micro-institutional
    variables in the Chinese and Indian WG regimes. Bruns (2017) and Bhargava (2019)
    applied it to understand linkages between physical, institutional, and community
    factors in the Philippines and India’s interactive and polycentric WG processes.
    Then, they developed a database of WG assessments based on an SES approach. Primarily
    rooted in the IAD framework, Saleth and Dinar (2004) developed the IDA to analytically
    and empirically evaluate the institutional linkages and their performance within
    the water sector. Then, Saleth and Dinar (2004) and Dinar and Saleth (2005) used
    this framework to develop the Water Institution Health Index based on legal and
    organizational variables to capture several aspects: accountability, competitiveness,
    institutional performance, and governance effectiveness. This index was linked
    to other economic, social, and governance indicators and then used to evaluate
    the health of water institutions across 43 countries, including 16 Asian ones.
    Later, Araral and Yu (2012, 2013); Araral and Ratra (2016); Rola et al. (2016a,
    2016b); Ahmed and Araral (2019); and Singh et al. (2019) also applied the IDA
    framework to explore key variations in the WG regimes of many Asian nations by
    measuring 20 diverse indicators regarding water law, policy, and administration.
    Also based on Ostrom’s theory, Pahl-Wostl’s AIWM framework was used in seven studies
    to analyze water policy and institutional reforms to achieve more adaptive WG
    in Asia. Specifically, Ha et al. (2018) and Mishra et al. (2020) used it to assess
    linkages between adaptive governance capacities and IWRM (in Vietnam) and water
    security improvement (in India), focusing on legal and institutional reforms.
    Knieper and Pahl-Wostl (2016) explored potential links between WG, IRWM, and environmental
    performance in the different contexts of African and Asian river basins. Other
    frameworks based on Ostrom’s theory, such as the IWRM’s conceptual, SES, MTF,
    and CPR governance frameworks, were also, respectively, performed in studies of
    Herrfahrdt et al. (2006), Mfodwo (2010), Kranz et al. (2010), and Yu et al. (2015).
    Recently, the OECD’s frameworks, namely the Multi-level Governance (MLG) (generated
    in 2011) and (Water Governance Indicator and Measurement (WGIM) frameworks (upgraded
    in 2018), were widely employed in the reviewed studies. The WGIM includes 12 principles
    enhancing the key WG elements of: effectiveness, efficiency, trust, and engagement.
    This framework is applicable across governance scales (local, national, basin,
    etc.) for assessing the state of play of WG policy frameworks (what), institutions
    (who), instruments (how), and their needed improvements over time (OECD 2018a,
    2018b). For example, Wajjwalku (2019) successfully applied it as a multi-stakeholder
    dialoguing tool to clarify the interaction and coordination between local non-government
    organizations (NGOs) and government authorities in water allocation and flood
    prevention in Chiang Rai (Thailand), focusing on participatory opportunities and
    negotiation capacity. Also using this framework, ADB (2016, 2020) and OECD (2020)
    surveyed 48 Asia–Pacific members to explore regional governance gaps and propose
    policy recommendations regarding the roles of stakeholder engagement, integrity,
    and trade-offs, along with monitoring and evaluation in WG systems, all to sustain
    regional water security. Apart from the frameworks mentioned above, a wide range
    of others were also reviewed, and they can be clustered into groups according
    to the specific WG-related issues analyzed. For example, the Transboundary Water
    Interaction Nexus (TWINS), Track II Dialogue (Hanasz 2017a, b), heuristic (Dore
    et al. 2012), transboundary nexus (Keskinen et al. 2016), water–energy–food (Lebel
    et al. 2020), and effective cross-border governance (Douglass 2013) frameworks
    all were used to analyze TWM-related issues; while the Hydro-Hegemony (HHF) (Hussein
    2019), “politics of scale” analytical (Neef 2008), and actor-oriented political–ecological
    (Maharjan 2018) frameworks focused on analyzing impacts of political and power
    factors on both national and regional WG. Overall, the frameworks considered in
    the Asian WG studies were highly diverse, and the influence of Ostrom’s theory
    on these frameworks is very significant. This acknowledgment is consistent with
    the findings of Özerol et al. (2018) and Di Vaio et al. (2021). Compared to the
    LIF that was mostly applied for analyzing specific case- or place-based WG issues
    in Asia, Ostrom’s theory-based frameworks (especially IAD, IDA, and AIWM) tended
    to assess the more general status of WG systems in Asia, primarily focusing on
    law, policy, and administration areas. The WG scholars who apply these broad frameworks
    in their studies tend to focus on building databases, abstracting the results,
    and giving more scientific evidence-based statements on WG-related issues. The
    studies using the OECD’s WGIM framework also provide another example of this tendency
    to achieve more inclusive WG and understand better who does what and at that level,
    how and why, all concerning water-related policies. This OECD framework has been
    increasingly applied for assessing and improving WG regimes in many Asian developing
    nations. In general, applying these frameworks has met the need for a next-generation
    research agenda on WG that needs to become more theoretically coherent, analytically
    robust, empirically grounded, and policy relevant. 3.5 Elements Included in WG
    Frameworks and Their Evolution 3.5.1 Inclusion of Key WG Elements A thorough set
    of governance elements plays a crucial role in an effective WG framework. These
    elements were significantly diverse in the reviewed frameworks and used differently
    for different analytical purposes. Even these elements’ practical meaning, application,
    and the names or phrases of use were spatiotemporally different. Thus, to fully
    identify these elements and unify their names/phrases of use, the reviewed results
    were compared to others referred to in the studies of Rogers and Hall (2003),
    OECD (2018a, b), and Jiménez et al. (2020). These studies focused on analyzing
    the WG frameworks’ elements and principles and were well recognized in the research
    community. Unclear or difficult-to-unify elements were thoroughly discussed and
    identified by all team members. As reviewed, this study identified a wide range
    of key elements (Table 3) and then discussed their roles and characteristics.
    After reviewing and referencing recent WG studies such as OECD (2018a, 2018b)
    and Jiménez et al. (2020), brief definitions of these elements are also presented
    in supplementary Table 3. The following observations on them can then be stated.
    Table 3 Summary of the main elements of WG frameworks used in the reviewed publications
    Full size table Among all the elements in the WG framework, the core ones were
    widely considered to be “legislation, regulation, instrument, and policy” and
    “management arrangement.” Those are also the most in need of reform in many Asian
    nations. “Stakeholder engagement” and “cooperation and coordination,” which often
    comprise the mechanisms, instruments, and platforms promoting multi-level, -sectorial,
    and -stakeholder cooperation among all actors, entail information sharing, dialog,
    and collaborative decision-making. At the transboundary scale, they often fall
    under the umbrella of water diplomacy and can have far-reaching impacts beyond
    the water sector, e.g., on geopolitical and hydropolitical security. Their frequent
    emergence is strongly consistent with this study’s earlier findings concerning
    stakeholder engagement, cooperation, coordination, and especially TWM as the most-discussed
    Asian WG challenges. In fact, most analytical frameworks for TWM issues in Asia
    included these two elements as essential. Importantly, their roles and responsibilities
    should be clearly allocated for successfully engaging stakeholders and sustaining
    their cooperation. Besides, ensuring that (i) policies are suited to particular
    places and account for multi-level dynamics across all governance levels and (ii)
    cooperation between different hierarchical scales is also vital for sustaining
    coordination and cooperation among stakeholders. More importantly, monitoring
    and evaluating water policies, institutions, and cooperation where appropriate,
    sharing the evaluated results with the public, and making adjustments when needed
    must be implemented regularly, timely, and transparently. As previously discussed,
    many Asian countries face challenges implementing the abovementioned requirements.
    This explains why “monitoring and evaluation,” “clear role and responsibility,”
    and “appropriate scales within basin system” were also key elements in frameworks
    applied to analyze WG in Asia. Regarding elements “integrity and transparency”
    and “data, information, and knowledge sharing,” they require (i) organizations
    and individuals to facilitate means for all stakeholders to understand WG decisions
    affecting them clearly and (ii) information to be usable through open, complete,
    credible, processable, and timely data. Specifically, they are vital to the underlying
    trust in transboundary cooperation, where data access can be strategically withheld
    or manipulated to strengthen the negotiating positions of one or more countries.
    In the reviewed studies, their frequent inclusion in WG frameworks for discussion
    is mainly due to the fact that a lack of integrity and transparency in public
    access to information often characterizes the Asian regional and national WG systems.
    Indeed, Chang et al. (2020) concluded that information, data, and policy-making
    transparency were among the most complex challenges for improving WG in many Chinese
    cities. Islam et al. (2020) also stated that the significant integrity and transparency
    gaps between national water departments were the main drivers of poor WG quality
    in Bangladesh. In particular, “capacity development” also became a WG element
    attracting attention in Asia, and the reason behind this is apparent. This development
    requires all stakeholders to systematically stimulate and develop their sustainable
    WG capabilities over time through knowledge-gaining, awareness-improving, and
    skill-building processes (UNDP 2009; UNISDR 2009; Jiménez et al. 2020). However,
    as previously discussed, inadequate governance capability is one of the common
    WG-related challenges in Asia. Thus, developing WG capacity is an urgent need
    in this continent. Many reviewed studies also confirm this situation by analyzing
    this Asian challenge and providing solutions to address it. Li et al. (2021) examined
    how the key actors involved in the Hong Kong WG play their roles, focusing on
    their capacity to capture signals, implement policies, and adapt to external changes.
    They then explored the capacity limitations to be addressed. Singh et al. (2019)
    and Chang et al. (2020) assessed the Chinese and Indian WG capacities by analyzing
    institutional and policy implementation and then identified relevant obstacles
    and proposed countermeasures. Also, Wu and Leong (2016) stated that institutional
    capacity was a key factor leading to the difference in the river basin governance
    quality between China and India. Wajjwalku (2019) discussed the role of civil
    society in flooding warning systems in Northern Thailand, focusing on negotiation
    capacity and solutions. Regarding the remaining WG elements, they were less popular
    for inclusion in the reviewed frameworks. 3.5.2 Evolution of Key WG Elements The
    reviewed findings show a temporal variation in the number of key WG elements in
    the frameworks considered in the Asian WG studies. To explore this variation over
    the research period, the 5-year average numbers of these key elements and their
    frequency in these frameworks were identified. The results are shown in Table
    4 and Fig. 8 and discussed as follows. Table 4 The average number of key WG elements
    and their frequency in the 5-year periods Full size table Fig. 8 The evolution
    of the average number of WG elements over the research period Full size image
    From 2000 to 2005, the average number of key WG elements included in analytical
    frameworks was six (as shown with blue numbers in Table 4). Together with the
    legal framework and institutional arrangement, all actors'' involvement and cooperation
    were referred to as integral components of the Asian WG systems in the early emergence
    period of the WG concept. Regularly examining and assessing the effectiveness
    of policies, institutions, and cooperation also had to be considered. In the next
    period, two more key elements of “clear role and responsibility” and “data, information,
    and knowledge sharing” began to be considered and added to the WG frameworks.
    They were even more prominent than the “appropriate scales within basin system”
    element. Note that this period was recorded with a higher number of WG studies
    (n = 25) (Fig. 5). By frequently including these two elements in the analytical
    frameworks, these studies indicated the importance of not only effectively engaging
    stakeholders but also allocating their roles and responsibilities, as well as
    the value of sharing information in a timely way in the implementation of WG in
    Asia. Compared to the previous period, there was no significant change in the
    category of elements during 2010–2015, except for the increase in the number of
    studies published. However, between 2015 and 2020, most WG frameworks in the reviewed
    studies combined ten separate elements. Some frameworks included more than ten,
    such as Van Rijswick et al. (2014), Ha et al. (2018), Otsuka (2019b), Wajjwalku
    (2019), and OECD (2020), which used the modified AIWM and OECD’s frameworks with
    11 or 12 elements. In this prominent period of the Asian WG studies, integrity
    and transparency practices across WG policies, institutions, and frameworks for
    greater accountability and trust were better appreciated. Moreover, in this continent
    of limited WG capacity, building competencies of responsible authorities to carry
    out their duties and address complex WG challenges effectively was also well noted
    after 2015. Overall, there was an upward trend in the number of key WG elements
    in the frameworks considered to be Asian WG studies over the last 2 decades. This
    trend can be explained by the constantly changing perception of the WG concept
    around the globe and by the increasingly challenging status of WG regimes in many
    Asian regions. 3.6 Proposed WG Framework, Common Challenges, and Key Recommendations
    3.6.1 Proposed WG Framework Based on the reviewed findings on (i) the current
    Asian WG characteristics, limitations, and challenges, (ii) the diverse frameworks
    applied and the elements evolved, and (iii) the recently successful application
    of WG frameworks, especially MLG and WGIM as mentioned in Sect. 3.4, this study
    proposes a 13-element WG framework (Fig. 9). Together with ten elements frequently
    used in the 2015–2020 period, this framework is modified by adding three others,
    namely “planning and preparedness,” “financial capacity,” and “innovative governance”
    (see supplementary Table 3 for their brief definitions). If its elements are comprehensively
    applied and adapted to the Asian nations’ diverse WG status, this modified framework
    could be a valuable orientation tool for effectively implementing WG in these
    countries rather than relying mainly on LIF as before. Fig. 9 The proposed framework
    for the Asian WG and its elements Full size image Planning is the process of data
    collection, formulation of actionable plans, and cost estimation. At the same
    time, preparedness refers to the arrangements, capacities, and knowledge developed
    by responsible authorities to help all actors respond effectively to potential
    or current WG challenges. On a regional scale, the planning and preparedness process
    is broadened to encompass international agreements that govern the joint development
    and management of institutions (e.g., River Basin Organizations). This process
    can establish and maintain essential communication channels between countries
    that need to work together on fundamental issues related to regional WG within
    a shared basin. Effective “planning and preparedness” can strongly support enhancing
    “financial capacity” in WG. Hence, these two elements can contribute together
    to a more effective WG. Indeed, the planning and preparedness process produces
    time-bound roadmaps with estimations of human and financial resources needed for
    effectively implementing all WG activities and elements. Based on these estimations,
    fundraising activities will be implemented to obtain the necessary funds to cover
    these activities and elements. Furthermore, financial capacity also includes forecasting
    (projecting the costs under different scenarios generated by the planning and
    preparedness process) and budgeting abilities (planning expenditure within a certain
    time horizon). Thus, with their valuable functions and benefits, these two elements
    must be included in the framework proposed for governing water in many Asian countries
    where deficient planning and restricted funding are often considered chronic WG
    challenges (Araral and Yu 2012; Delavari and Abdi 2018). Furthermore, Asia has
    unique features of water resources, climate, socio-economic mechanisms, and political
    contexts that frequently affect its WG quality. Many Asian nations are also facing
    diverse gaps in policy (weak policy coherence across sectors), capacity (poor
    knowledge and technologies for implementing policies), and information (insufficient
    information and technical systems for transferring scientific findings to practices).
    Therefore, the “innovative governance” element should be included in the proposed
    WG framework to address these gaps and promote better WG quality in Asia. Indeed,
    this element promotes pilot experiments on WG, followed by drawing lessons from
    successes and failures and finally scaling up replicable practices. Based on these
    lessons learned, the negative impacts of these unique features on WG quality will
    be gradually mitigated and then thoroughly addressed. This element also promotes
    social learning to facilitate dialog and consensus building through networking
    platforms, social media, and information technologies. It also focuses on building
    innovative ways to cooperate, pool resources and capacity, build synergies across
    sectors, search for efficiency gains, and promote a user-friendly science–policy
    interface to bridge the divide between scientific findings and WG practices. 3.6.2
    Common Challenges and Key Recommendations Based on our findings, an increasing
    number of Asian countries face mounting challenges in implementing this proposed
    WG framework. These common challenges are summarized below to serve as the basis
    for giving appropriate recommendations to respond to them toward realizing a future
    with more effective and robust WG in this continent. Legal and institutional arrangements:
    Institutional fragmentation of water laws and policies across multiple actors,
    inconsistent legal regimes across sectors, and insufficient process of translating
    these laws and policies into action are the Asian common WG challenges. In many
    nations, especially in SA and SEA (i.e., Bangladesh, India, Laos, the Philippines,
    Vietnam, etc.), water is governed by a dense network of institutions that are
    disjointed, do not have a flow of information horizontally, and have overlapping
    roles and responsibilities. To respond to these challenges, cross-sectorial coordination
    mechanisms should be improved to facilitate coherent laws and policies. These
    mechanisms will develop coordinated WRM and consider coordinated policies that
    affect water availability, quality, and demand across all relevant water use sectors
    (mainly agriculture, industry, energy, ecology, and navigation in the Asian case).
    Based on these mechanisms, identifying and addressing the barriers to legal coherence
    within and beyond these sectors can be achieved using regular monitoring, reporting,
    and reviews. It is also essential to provide incentives and solutions to mitigate
    conflicts among sectorial strategies that fit local governance and norms. Institutionally,
    it is vital to (i) specify the allocation of roles and responsibilities across
    all WG-related institutions and (ii) address gaps, overlaps, and conflicts of
    interest between them through comprehensive coordination. Stakeholder engagement,
    cooperation, and coordination: Due to the dense network of institutions and stakeholders,
    the overlap in their responsibilities and tasks is considered a key WG challenge
    in Asia. It leads to indefinite and vague accountability assigned to any of the
    agencies and even causes conflicts within and between them. Weak participation
    and collaboration among various sectors and administrative layers, especially
    in the CA, WA, and SEA nations (ADB 2020), results in ineffective implementation
    of WG policies. Also, human resources for WG are poorly developed in many Asian
    countries (mainly in SA and SEA). Thus, to boost the involvement of stakeholders
    and their cooperation, it is crucial to: (i) Map public, private, and non-profit
    actors (who have a stake in outcomes or are affected by decisions) and their responsibilities,
    motivations, and interactions; (ii) Mitigate power imbalances and risks of consultation
    capture from overrepresented or overly vocal categories; (iii) Develop the capacity
    of stakeholders; (iv) Assess the outcomes of stakeholder engagement to adjust
    and improve accordingly; and (v) Customize the type and level of stakeholder engagement
    according to their needs and keep the process flexible to adapt to changing circumstances.
    The critical challenge is the non-existence of institutions for promoting joint
    WRM at the transboundary scale. Where these exist, they often remain ad-hoc, disparate,
    and underfinanced. Other challenges are the lack of (i) common platforms to advance
    joint transboundary WRM, (ii) financing for this, and (iii) coordinated approaches
    among development partners. Moreover, notwithstanding contemporary challenges,
    new ones are emerging in Asia. While national institutions provide mechanisms
    for addressing domestically conflicting demands, there are no equivalent institutions
    to respond to transboundary problems, leading to international conflicts for water
    sharing. In response to these challenges, a key insight is to understand various
    actors in the transboundary arena better. Thus, thoroughly analyzing the power
    structures before any transboundary engagement is imperative. Without this, policy
    measures may be misguided and unintentionally result in favor of the stronger
    party––thus entrenching a status quo that, in the long run, may be disruptive
    to sustainable cooperation. Moreover, weaker parties should be strengthened to
    interact on equal terms when negotiating the shared WG. This creates an equilibrium
    between all riparian parties and establishes the enabling environment for higher
    cooperation and coordination. To address the financial scare, developing WG activities
    with clear outcomes and timelines are critical to attract support from international
    donors such as the ADB and World Bank, who are largely interested in the WG issues
    in Asia. Monitoring, evaluation, information sharing, and transparency: In Asia,
    these common challenges are a lack of inclusive and transparent decision-making
    (mainly in CA, WA, and SEA); irregular use of monitoring, evaluation, and enforcement
    mechanisms; insufficient information systems; and low mutual trust in benefit
    sharing and conflict negotiation. The key measures to address them are establishing
    dedicated monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and institutions that are competent,
    independent, and equipped with effective instruments, ensuring timely and transparent
    sharing of results, and adapting strategies as new information becomes available.
    To improve transparency practices, the most prioritized solutions should be (i)
    establishing legal frameworks to hold all stakeholders accountable, establishing
    the right to information and independent authorities to investigate water-related
    issues and enforce laws, (ii) developing clear accountability and control mechanisms
    for transparency, especially in making and implementing policy; and (iii) applying
    multi-stakeholder approaches and dedicated tools to support these mechanisms toward
    gaining greater accountability and trust, particularly for the CA, WA, and SEA
    WG. Regarding data and information sharing, Asian countries should develop cost-effective
    agreed methods, platforms, and mechanisms for this sharing, especially at the
    transboundary scale. A good example from six SEA nations could be learned. In
    2016, China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam jointly established
    a Lancang-Mekong River Cooperation Framework for SDGs. In this framework, a transboundary
    sharing mechanism was signed to promote sharing data, information, experiences,
    and research outcomes to narrow development gaps between these countries toward
    achieving their SDGs. Capacity development: In Asia, a lack of knowledge, experience,
    human capital, technology, and funding is acknowledged as a chronic WG challenge.
    Thus, first, it is required to review the specific capacity constraints existing
    at all levels of the institutional structure. Then, the technical, financial,
    and institutional capacity of WG systems should be aligned with the nature of
    problems and needs. The adaptive and evolving assignment of competencies upon
    demonstration of capacity should be implemented. Education, training, and knowledge-sharing
    of water professionals to strengthen the capacity of water institutions and stakeholders
    must be regularly and timely promoted at all levels. Moreover, Asian countries
    should be actively involved in international organizations and associations to
    seek potential opportunities for sharing experiences, learning knowledge, and
    obtaining funding to facilitate their WG implementation. 4 Conclusion and Future
    Work In addressing the deficit of comprehensive scientific literature, this study
    has executed a systematic review pertaining to water governance (WG) in Asia and
    its associated challenges spanning the past 2 decades. The findings illustrate
    an escalation in international focus on WG in the Asian context since the early
    2000s, with a marked intensification subsequent to the advent of the Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. This underscores the recent nascence of WG as
    a field of inquiry. Geographically, Southeast Asia (SEA), South Asia (SA), and
    East Asia (EA) have emerged as focal points for WG research. These regions are
    characterized by their expansive and densely populated areas, substantial water
    resources, extensive transboundary river basins, and complex WG challenges. The
    study notes a lack of consensus on the definitions of WG, attributable to its
    varied applications across different research scopes, aspects, and norms. Nonetheless,
    effective WG has been conceptually aligned with the need for inclusive stakeholder
    engagement and the principles of efficiency, transparency, accountability, sustainability,
    and responsiveness within governance processes. Predominant issues that pose a
    challenge to WG in Asia include transboundary water management (TWM), irrigation
    and energy management, water quality control, and the implications of climate
    change—most notably exacerbated by insufficient cooperative agreements governing
    numerous transboundary river basins. In addition, inadequate legal and institutional
    arrangements (LIAs), limited stakeholder collaboration, fluctuating power dynamics,
    and governance capacity deficits are identified as critical barriers to effective
    WG across Asian nations. Various analytical frameworks have been employed to scrutinize
    these challenges. Among these, the Legal and Institutional Framework (LIF), Ostrom’s
    theoretical constructs, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
    (OECD) guidelines are frequently referenced. However, the adoption of frameworks
    varies widely, reflecting the diverse academic disciplines and research objectives
    of WG scholars. Broadly, these frameworks can be categorized into those focusing
    on specific, contextual WG issues (e.g., the LIF and Four Systems) and those that
    assess WG systems more generally (e.g., Integrated Development Assessment (IDA),
    Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD), and Adaptive Integrated Water Management
    (AIWM)), aiding in the construction of databases and generation of evidence-based
    assessments. A broad array of WG elements is discussed within these frameworks,
    with LIAs, stakeholder involvement, and monitoring and evaluation repeatedly underscored
    as critical to the successful implementation of WG in Asia. The emphasis on these
    elements echoes the chronic challenges identified—namely inadequate LIAs, poor
    stakeholder engagement, and ineffective evaluation mechanisms. There has been
    an evolution in the number of elements included in these frameworks over time,
    reflecting changes in global and regional WG perspectives. To align with the contemporary
    WG landscape in Asia, this study advocates a modified 13-element WG framework,
    addressing the implementation challenges and offering strategic recommendations.
    WG in Asia is notably complex, characterized by vast and populous landscapes,
    disparate water resource distribution, underdeveloped socio-economic conditions,
    political instability, weak LIAs, limited resources, and a high vulnerability
    to climate change. These challenges impede the effective implementation of WG
    across many Asian nations. This study contributes a comprehensive overview of
    WG challenges in Asia over the last 20 years and provides systematic, evidence-based
    insights. It underscores the pressing need for effective and inclusive WG, emphasizing
    a deeper comprehension of roles, methods, and rationales within WG policies and
    institutions. Moreover, it serves to assist policymakers, managers, and academics
    in developing, executing, evaluating, and refining WG strategies in achieving
    SDG attainment. For future research, the study recommends that pilot WG studies
    be conducted and assessed at local, national, and regional levels within Asia,
    with successful strategies subsequently disseminated and adapted for application
    in other nations facing similar WG implementation challenges. Data Availability

  description: Remote sensing-assisted monitoring of forest health entails methods
    that can provide up-to-date and accurate information on decline and mortality
    of individual trees, while maintaining time and cost efficiency. However, the
    trade-off of applying consumer-grade UAV-RGB data as the most affordable and accessible
    data source at the catchment level is constrained by its poor spectral information
    content. We developed a method based on the fusion of UAV-RGB data with space-borne
    Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) at the level of tree crowns, with the
    specific target of supporting studies on semi-arid tree decline. We applied linear
    spectral unmixing (Spectral Unmixing-Based data Fusion method, LSUBF) by considering
    a limited number of endmembers and calculating the abundances (fractional covers)
    from the UAV data, and evaluated the results by high-resolution MSI space-borne
    data including SPOT-6 (1.5 m spatial resolution) and PlanetScope (3 m spatial
    resolution). This method suggested an increase in the coefficient of determination
    of the applied generalized additive model for decline severity estimation at tree
    crown level from 0.61 to 0.69, while it was improved from 0.70 to 0.91 when fitting
    a non-parametric random forest model. The results of sensitivity analysis demonstrated
    that the additional spectral information obtained from the proposed method results
    in higher accuracy in estimating decline severity. We suggest this method as a
    cost-effective alternative to monitor periodical tree decline, in particular across

    Remote sensing-assisted monitoring of forest health entails methods that can provide
    up-to-date and accurate information on decline and mortality of individual trees,
    while maintaining time and cost efficiency. However, the trade-off of applying
    consumer-grade UAV-RGB data as the most affordable and accessible data source
    at the catchment level is constrained by its poor spectral information content.
    We developed a method based on the fusion of UAV-RGB data with space-borne Sentinel-2
    Multispectral Instrument (MSI) at the level of tree crowns, with the specific
    target of supporting studies on semi-arid tree decline. We applied linear spectral
    unmixing (Spectral Unmixing-Based data Fusion method, LSUBF) by considering a
    limited number of endmembers and calculating the abundances (fractional covers)
    from the UAV data, and evaluated the results by high-resolution MSI space-borne
    data including SPOT-6 (1.5 m spatial resolution) and PlanetScope (3 m spatial
    resolution). This method suggested an increase in the coefficient of determination
    of the applied generalized additive model for decline severity estimation at tree
    crown level from 0.61 to 0.69, while it was improved from 0.70 to 0.91 when fitting
    a non-parametric random forest model. The results of sensitivity analysis demonstrated
    that the additional spectral information obtained from the proposed method results
    in higher accuracy in estimating decline severity. We suggest this method as a
    cost-effective alternative to monitor periodical tree decline, in particular across
    semi-arid ecosystems. KEYWORDS: Tree declinedata fusionlinear spectral unmixingUAV-RGBSentinel-2Semi-arid
    vegetation 1. Introduction Forest ecosystems worldwide are facing threats caused
    by climate change and human activities (Finch et al. 2021), in particular over
    arid, semi-arid, and other fragile ecosystems (Omidi et al. 2022). Iran´s semi-arid
    Zagros forests with a semi-Mediterranean climate that encompasses an area of ca.
    6 million ha, i.e. 44% of the total forest area in Iran (Talebi, Khosro, and Pourhashemi
    2014), have historically been affected by serious threats including climate change,
    fire, dust storms, and different pathogens (Fakhri et al. 2022). Moreover, it
    has been subject to massive tree decline in recent decades (Pourhashemi and Mohammad
    Moein Sadeghi 2020), which is widely recognized as a complex and gradual phenomenon
    over several years that eventually leads to tree mortality (Gentilesca et al.
    2017). Field-based sampling and data collection are conventionally employed for
    forest health monitoring, which are yet laborious, time- and cost-intensive, possibly
    destructive, and unfeasible for large-scale assessments (Ghasemi, Latifi, and
    Pourhashemi 2023), as well as remote and mountainous areas with limited access.
    Solutions based on remote sensing data and methods can therefore provide suitable
    alternatives or complements for field surveys. These techniques were expanded
    in the 1970s when digital space-borne imagery complemented aerial photography,
    which had been available since the early 20th century (Leeuw et al. 2010). Accessibility
    to very high-resolution image data, especially those collected with sensors mounted
    on consumer-grade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with ground sampling distance
    (GSD) from 2 to 10 cm px−1, has significantly increased during the past few years
    (Ecke et al. 2022). In particular, cost-effective, lightweight UAVs with RGB cameras
    are easily operated and adaptable (Sidike et al. 2018). Employing cost-effective
    UAV-RGB data and digital photogrammetric methods utilizing the Structure From
    Motion (SFM) approach results in extensive information from canopy cover (Maimaitijiang
    et al. 2020) due to their ability to provide point clouds with high density (L.
    Wang et al. 2016; White et al. 2013). However, vegetation health monitoring often
    requires multispectral data as decline signals go beyond the RGB spectral domain.
    Although various sensors (ranging from multispectral sensors to imaging spectrometers)
    are currently available for UAVs, their spectral calibration for sophisticated,
    higher-level products requires tremendous additional efforts. Additionally, the
    exact spectral behaviour of the spectral bands must be known to enable deriving
    physical quantities (JE, ME, and Kneubühler 2018). Logie and Coburn ( 2018) measured
    the spectral and radiometric characteristics of consumer-grade digital cameras
    in laboratory-based experiments, and concluded that spectral characteristics showed
    broadly overlapping spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths
    with spectral bandwidths between 70 and 100 nm (Logie and Coburn 2018). Moreover,
    multi spectral satellite data that are usually applied for vegetation health studies
    have high spectral resolutions but relatively low spatial resolution (J. G. Liu
    2000; Nikolakopoulos 2008) (Ha, Gowda, and Howell Wonsook, Gowda, and Howell 2013);
    In forest health studies, it is commonly preferred to obtain complementary information
    (e.g. low spatial resolution with high spectral resolution or high spectral resolution
    with quite low spectral resolution) for a detailed understanding of the observed
    phenomenon, which calls for developing image fusion approaches (Mitchell 2010).
    Space-borne multispectral data often cover the Near-Infrared (NIR) domain, which
    is not available for UAV-RGB systems; thus integrating satellite multispectral
    data with canopy structure information from UAV-RGB data would help to fully utilize
    the potential of satellite imagery, particularly in tree health monitoring at
    crown level. Multiple solutions have been developed to generate a high-resolution
    multispectral image by fusion (Beltrán-Marcos et al. 2023; Ehlers et al. 2010;
    Qizhi, Zhang, and Li 2014), with a history that dates back to the 1980s (Cliche
    1985). Fusion techniques can be classified into those on pixel/data level, feature
    level, and decision level (Pohl and Van Genderen 2016). Optical data are commonly
    fused at the pixel level (Zhang 2010). Among the related studies, two categories
    of fusion methods can be found that aim to fuse low spatial resolution data with
    high spectral resolution and high spatial resolution data with low spectral resolution
    to increase the spectral resolution of high spatial resolution data: 1) the Spatial
    and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM)-like methods and 2) the
    Spectral Unmixing-based Downscaling Fusion Model (SUDFM)-like methods. The STARFM
    fuses images acquired at different times with different spatial resolutions which
    predict reflectance of high-resolution pixels through a linear model (Gao et al.
    2006). However, the STARFM and its improved alternatives are based on the assumption
    of a linear relationship between high- and low-resolution image reflectance, which
    requires that the input images of different resolutions come with the same centre
    wavelength and bandwidth. It is generally difficult to meet the requirements of
    consistent parameters for different satellite sensors (Guo et al. 2015; Hilker
    et al. 2009) (Wu et al. Mingquan et al. 2012); (Zhu et al. 2016). A further alternative
    is SUDFM (Zhukov et al. 1999). In this case, the number of endmembers and abundances
    are obtained from the high-resolution dataset, while the spectrum of the endmembers
    is unmixed from the lower resolution dataset. The main advantage of unmixing-based
    methods is that, unlike STARFM-based methods, they do not require high- and low-resolution
    data to have corresponding spectral bands. This allows to downscale extra spectral
    bands of low-resolution data to increase the spectral resolution of the high-resolution
    data (Zurita-Milla et al. 2011). Existing studies mainly focused on improving
    the algorithms for unmixing lower resolution images to get a more reasonable estimation
    of the mean reflectance of different endmembers (Gevaert and García-Haro ( 2015)
    (W. Liu et al. 2020; Zhong and Zhou 2018; Zhu et al. 2016). However, the endmember
    abundance of low-resolution images is usually calculated based on an unsupervised
    classification (clustering) of high-resolution images or high precision land cover
    maps (Jiang and Huang 2022; Min et al. 2023), which ignores the widely existing
    mixed pixels in images, in particular in heterogeneous scenes (Min et al. 2023).
    Therefore, the endmember abundance map is calculated inaccurately, which affects
    the accuracy of decomposing the endmember spectral reflectance of low-resolution
    pixels (W. Liu et al. 2020). The above-mentioned review reveals an existing research
    gap for methods to fuse high spatial resolution UAV-RGB data with space-borne
    multispectral data when the aim is to estimate tree decline at individual tree
    crown level, which can be identified at UAV images. In a recent study (Ghasemi,
    Latifi, and Pourhashemi 2023), tree decline severity at the tree crown level was
    estimated using the information extracted from UAV-RGB images, where the tree
    crown-level decline severities played the main role as the subsequent wall-to-wall
    reference data for decline severity estimation at 10-m Sentinel-2 pixel level.
    In the present study, we intend to operationally increase the accuracy of estimating
    the decline severity at the tree crown level by estimating the indices and spectral
    reflections of Sentinel-2 data at the tree crowns delineated on the UAV images
    using a novel fusion approach called the Linear Spectral Unmixing-Based data Fusion
    method (LSUBF). It can be demonstrated that if the new approach improves the accuracy
    of the decline severity estimated at the tree crown level, it will likewise lead
    to an increase in the accuracy of the decline severity when upscaled to Sentinel-2
    pixel level (Appendix 1). Although the proposed method is inspired by pixel-based
    fusion methods (see the conventional categorization of fusion methods in Pohl
    and Van Genderen 2016), it integrates spectral information at the object level,
    i.e. tree crowns. In this method, spatial information from the UAV-RGB with 2.19 cm
    pix−1 GSD determines the endmember abundance in the 10-m Sentinel-2 pixels, followed
    by estimating the spectral reflections at the crown level by the method based
    on the linear spectral unmixing. The calculated spectral reflectance of each crown,
    along with other information extracted from UAV data, is used to calculate tree
    decline severity, our central research focus. The objectives of this study are:
    Estimating the spectral reflectance at the tree crown level by fusion of Sentinel-2
    MSI data and UAV-RGB data. Estimating the severity of tree crown decline by the
    spectral reflections and the corresponding spectral indices resulted from LSUBF,
    along with the information extracted from UAV-RGB data. Therefore, we first describe
    our data fusion method, followed by unfolding how we evaluated the spectral values
    from the fusion step using very high resolution space-borne data. Finally, we
    incorporate the evaluated spectral information into previously-verified models
    to estimate tree decline severity, and assess their sensitivity to input variables.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study sites and data We showcase our approach within
    a representative portion of semi-arid, mountainous forests located in the Zagros
    Mountains of western Iran. The Zagros forests are known as rich sources of biodiversity
    in fauna and flora as well as for providing various non-wood forest products.
    The main woody species include Quercus brantii Lindl., Q. infectoria G.Olivier.,
    Q. libani Olivier., Pistacia Atlantica Desf., Crategus sp., and Pyrus sp., with
    a high dominance of up to ca. 70% for Q. brantii across central and southern Zagros
    sub-zones (Talebi, Khosro, and Pourhashemi 2014), which, have been partly impacted
    by tree decline at various stages. Our test sites comprised 16 areas of ca. 1 ha
    each, located along the latitudinal gradient of the Zagros mountains with mean
    annual precipitation ranging from 400 to 800 mm. The sites encompassed 4 sample
    plots in the northern zone, 6 sample plots in the central zone, and 6 sample plots
    in the southern zone. These forests generally comprise sparse tree and shrub stands
    and are, depending on the imaging season, represented by a bright background and
    discernible vegetative components in UAV-RGB scenes. Details on the location of
    the study sites and their canopy cover at the time of data collection are presented
    in Table 1 and Figure 1 shows the study area visual summary and contains UAV-derived
    orthophoto of each site. Figure 1. Location of study sites and the UAV-derived

    CSVDisplay Table 2.1.1. Field data Field data on both tree structure and decline
    were collected during 2019–2020 within the framework of ‘The National Zagros Forest
    Monitoring Plan’ coordinated by Iran´s Research Institute of Forests and Rangelands
    (RIFR). Control points required to process UAV images included GPS-measured latitudes,
    longitudes, and altitudes. The position of each of these was measured using real-time
    kinematic (RTK) for the northern and central plots and post-processing kinematic
    (PPK) for the southern plots. We used two GPS receivers including the Trimble
    −5700 and −5800, and a Zephyr Geodetic antenna. For the PPK method, the recorded
    points were post-processed using fixed geodetic reference points within Shamim
    National Platform (https://shamim.ssaa.ir/sbc). The locations of the control points
    in each plot were selected to cover the surroundings and the centroid of each
    plot. A number of trees were selected at each study site to be structurally inventoried
    by field techniques. The specific location of the trees, their height, crown diameter,
    and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) were all measured. The state of decline was
    evaluated visually by regional RIFR field crew. Based on the degree of the decline,
    they divided the trees into four categories. Then, invoking the fundamental approach
    presented by Finch et al. ( 2021), we generated the Phenotypic Decline Index (PDI)
    using these discrete classifications and the structural data (height, crown diameter
    and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)) collected for the reference trees. The index
    is accessible through the pdi package in R (Finch et al. 2021) and is a measure
    of overall decline severity by continuously scoring trees between 0 and 1, whereby
    more severely declining oak trees have a score closer to 1 (Finch et al. 2021).
    The PDI were used as decline severity reference data, which was attributed to
    each tree by means of the recorded position of the trees. 2.1.2. UAV-RGB data
    The UAV-RGB data was acquired using a consumer-grade DJI Phantom-4 pro quadcopter
    carrying an on board RGB camera and a fixed gimbal. The device included a 3-axis
    stabilization gimbal, 1’’ CMOS sensor camera, and FOV 84° 8.8 mm/24 mm lens. Further
    information about camera parameters which effects images resolution presented
    in Table 2. Table 2. Camera parameters of phantom 4 pro and the GSD that resulted
    in 80 m flight height. Download CSVDisplay Table Flights were designed as double-grid
    networks with 80% horizontal and vertical overlaps within an iOS version of Pix4D
    Capture (https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010419-iOS-Pix4Dcapture-Manual-and-Settings)
    installed on an iPad 2018 notebook and were conducted during September and November
    2019 with a resolution of 5472 × 3648 pixels at 80 m flight altitude. This resulted
    in ca. 125 image tiles per study site, which were further used for the subsequent
    analysis. The images were processed using the SfM software Agisoft Metashape Pro.1.7.0
    to generate orthophotos. The Ground Sampling Distance was equal to 2.19 cm px−1.
    High-quality data processing by the software produced orthophotos with 7 mm resolution,
    which we did not change. In addition to orthophotos, Canopy Height Models (CHMs)
    were derived from the differences between Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and Digital
    Surface Models (DSMs). 2.1.3. Sentinel-2 MSI data Sentinel-2A level-1C data were
    downloaded from United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer at the closest
    possible time to the time of UAV campaigns (Table 3). Level-1C processing includes
    data that encompasses radiometric and geometric corrections, including ortho-rectification,
    adding the radiometric offset, and spatial registration on a global reference
    system with sub-pixel accuracy. We used bands with 10 m spatial resolution containing
    Red, Green, Blue, and NIR bands. The specification values were 0.458–0.523 μm
    (Blue), 0.650- 0.543-0.573 μm (Green), 0.650–0.680 μm (Red), and 0.785–0.899 μm
    (NIR). Additional processing containing topographic correction and spectral subsets
    was carried out using SNAP 7.0 (https://step.esa.int 2021). Table 3. Summary of
    data from various remote sensing sources used in this study. Download CSVDisplay
    Table 2.1.4. PlanetScope MSI data We applied PlanetScope imagery products to independently
    evaluate the fusion without being used in estimating the severity of tree decline.
    The data are available as either individual basic scenes, ortho scenes, or ortho
    tile products. The basic and ortho scenes can be obtained from the Planet Application
    Programming Interface (API) through the PSScene item type. We used the PlanetScope
    ortho scene product, which is orthorectified and has been processed to remove
    distortions caused by terrain. Ortho scenes are radiometrically, atmospherically,
    sensor, and geometrically corrected. The geometric correction uses fine DEMs with
    a post spacing between 30 and 90 metres. The product has 3 m spatial resolution
    with 4 spectral bands, including 0.465–0.515 μm (Blue), 0. 547–0.583 μm (Green),
    0.650–0.680 μm (Red), and 0.845–0.885 μm (NIR). In our case, these data covered
    14 of the total 16 study sites (Table 3). 2.1.5. SPOT-6 MSI data Our further independent
    evaluation datasets included SPOT-6 MSI data that were accessed from OneAtlas
    platform of the Airbus Group. The products comprise four pan-sharpened multispectral
    bands with JPEG 2000 image format as standard ortho acquired over sites with a
    minimum of 100 Km2 each. The multispectral product includes four spectral bands
    with specification values 0.455−0.525 μm (Blue), 0.530 −0.590 μm (Green), 0.625−0.695 μm
    (Red) and 0.760 −0.890 μm (NIR). The data was delivered with the original pixel
    size of 6 m (Ortho) and a pan-sharpened colour product with 1.5-m pixel size.
    The products are corrected for radiometric and sensor distortions, using internal
    calibration parameters, ephemeris, and attitude measurements. The ortho product
    is a georeferenced image in earth geometry, corrected for acquisition and terrain
    off-nadir effects. The standard ortho product is an image that has been corrected
    for viewing angle and ground effects. In addition, a geometric process using a
    relief model (known as ortho-rectification) eliminates the perspective effect
    on the ground (not on buildings), restoring the geometry of a vertical shot. These
    data cover 10 study sites (Airbus Group 2021). Table 3 shows the access to data
    from each of the aforementioned data sources. 3. Methods We used three data sources
    to estimate decline severity at the tree crown level: 1) field data, 2) UAV-RGB
    data, and 3) Sentinel-2 MSI data. Field data were used to calculate PDI, which
    describes decline severity to be used as reference data. The UAV-RGB data were
    processed to produce orthophotos for each plot. In each orthophoto, the crown
    was delineated using the method presented by Ghasemi et al. (). Structural information
    containing tree height and crown area along with RGB indices were calculated for
    each delineated crown in orthophotos. The grid of each Sentinel-2 MSI data for
    each plot was generated using fishnet tool in ArcGIS v.10.3.1. These grids and
    corresponding delineated crowns resulted in fractional cover maps of each plot
    that was used in LSUBF method along with spectral reflectance of Sentinel-2 bands
    with 10 m spatial resolution. It resulted in spectral reflectance at tree crown
    level and was added to the information extracted from UAV orthophoto. Finally,
    decline severity is calculated using models whose inputs include structural information,
    RGB indices, and spectral information from LSUBF. Figure 2 shows the flowchart
    of the presented method. In the following, we first explain the new method presented
    for data fusion and then describe the method for the estimation of crown-level
    decline. Figure 2. Decline severity estimation at crown-level workflow. Display
    full size 3.1. Crown spectral reflectance via LSUBF The proposed LSUBF method
    calculates crown spectral reflectance by fusing UAV-RGB data and Sentinel-2 MSI
    data. Endmember abundances of crowns and bare soil (fractional covers) are calculated
    using crowns delineated in UAV-derived orthophotos and the pixel grid of Sentinel-2
    data. The spectral reflectance of Sentinel-2 bands with 10-m spatial resolution
    and the corresponding abundances constitute the linear spectral unmixing equation
    components in which the reflectance from endmembers are the unknowns. Thus, the
    inverse least square process results in the endmember reflectance. Finally, the
    spectral reflectance of each crown will be calculated using the crown delineations.
    To evaluate the spectral reflectance, two reference maps were generated using
    very high-resolution SPOT-6 (1.5-metre spatial resolution) and PlanetScope (3-metre
    spatial resolution) data. These reference maps consider the spectral reflectance
    of the mentioned data inside the delineated crown. The main process is presented
    in Figure 3. Figure 3. LSUBF workflow. Display full size 3.1.1. Crown delineation
    Trees within the study sites were entirely broad-leaved and partly clustered in
    clumps with overlapped crowns. Most of them comprise multiple stems or coppices,
    which result in crowns with unusual shapes compared to single-stem trees (Ghasemi,
    Latifi, and Pourhashemi ; Imanyfar, Hasanlou, and Mirzaei Zadeh 2019). This hampers
    using common techniques for tree detection and crown segmentation in UAV images.
    We utilized the method recently presented by Ghasemi et al. (), which is based
    on edge detection to detect and delineate multi-stem tree crowns. This returned
    polygons that define the crown boundaries of all trees. 3.1.2. Fractional cover
    To calculate the fractional cover, the grid corresponding to the lower-resolution
    satellite image of each site was initially created using a fishnet. The crown
    polygons that resulted from crown delineation were intersected by the lower-resolution
    satellite image grid. The area of all crowns and partial crowns located in a pixel
    grid were aggregated to calculate crown area within a pixel. Then, the fractional
    cover of crowns in a pixel of a medium-resolution image is calculated as follows:
    f  c = A ac A p (1) where fc is the fractional cover of crowns in the medium-resolution
    image called abundance in spectral unmixing context. A ac is the area of all crown
    and partial crown polygons from the UAV ortho image located in a pixel of medium-resolution
    satellite image, and A p is the medium-resolution image pixel area. If the only
    coverage around the trees located in the medium-resolution image pixel is the
    bare soil, the fractional cover of soil can be obtained as follows: f s = 1 −
    f c (2) where fs is the fractional cover of bare soil in medium-resolution image.
    3.1.3. Spectral analysis of medium-resolution pixel Since only bare soil and trees
    were visible over the scenes captured from our test sites located in open forests,
    we assumed that there are only two endmembers in each pixel of the medium-resolution
    satellite image: 1) tree crowns and 2) bare soil. The abundance of each endmember
    (fractional cover) was calculated using UAV orthophotos, as described in the previous
    section. Then, the endmember spectrum was estimated by the spectral analysis of
    medium-resolution pixels using pixel reflectance of the Sentinel-2 image and its
    corresponding abundance. We calculated a set of vegetation-sensitive spectral
    indices from the available 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 bands and added them as
    reflectance bands to the calculation process. The indices were selected from the
    relevant literature on the use of Sentinel-2 data for forest health monitoring
    (Table 4). However, some indices were removed in the applied stepwise feature
    selection step to avoid overfitting and reduce the number of variables that were
    used to model the decline severity. We categorized the indicators into two groups,
    including Group 1 (incorporating red and NIR bands) and Group 2 (additionally
    incorporating Blue and/or green bands). We did this to compare the performance
    of indicators that include only red and NIR bands with indicators that also include
    Blue and Green bands. Table 4. List of spectral indices calculated using sentinel-2
    imagery and employed in the development of the decline detection model. The list
    contains the selected indices in the feature selection step of decline severity
    modelling. Group 1 contains indices calculated only by red and NIR, whereas group
    2 contains indices in which blue and/or green bands were additionally incorporated.
    Download CSVDisplay Table The basic expression used for the linear spectral unmixing
    analysis by Quintano et al. in 2012 could be rewritten for two endmembers as:
    r i = f c × e c + f s × e s + ε i (3) where r i is the pixel spectral reflectance
    of band i, fc is the crowns abundance, ec is the estimated pure signal of the
    crowns, fs is the bare soil abundance, es is the estimated pure signal of the
    bare soil, and εi represents the residual error. The constrained linear least
    squares inversion was adopted for calculating the crowns and bare soil spectrum
    in Sentinel-2 pixels. In order to increase the degree of freedom and avoid singularity,
    the equation is solved simultaneously for a set of neighbouring pixels. The dimensions
    of the neighbourhood window of each pixel were determined locally and were based
    on the size of the crowns that appeared in the pixel. Tree crowns have an irregular
    shape, so there is no restriction on how many crowns can be placed in one pixel
    of a medium-resolution image. The neighbouring window of a pixel is a squared
    window around the desired pixel that includes all the parts of crowns that are
    placed partially in the desired pixel. This process can be expressed as: R i =
    F × E i + ε i (4) where Ri is a n2 ×1 dimensional vector containing a single spectral
    band reflectance for all pixels in a window; n is the size of the window; F is
    a n2 ×2 matrix which its first column contains the abundance of crowns and its
    second column contains abundance of bare soil in corresponding pixels in the window,
    E is a 2 × 1 dimensional vector that represents the crowns and bare soil spectrum
    to be solved in band i; and εi is the residual error. We rewrote the Equation
    4 in matrix form as: r 11 ⋮ r nn n 2 × 1 = f C 11 f s 11 ⋮ ⋮ f C nn f s nn n 2
    × 2 × e C e s 2 × 1 + ε (5) In which rij refers to a single band spectral reflectance
    for the pixel located in the ith row and jth column of the neighbouring window,
    f C ij and f s ij refer to the mentioned pixel’s crown and soil abundances. Which
    is returned to Equation 6 for k bands: r b 1 11 ⋮ r b 1 nn ⋮ r b k 11 ⋮ r b k
    nn k n 2 × 1 = f C 11 f s 11 ⋯ 0 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋯ ⋮ ⋮ f C nn ⋮ 0 ⋮ 0 f s 11 ⋮ 0 ⋮ 0 ⋯ ⋱

    e b k c e b k s 2 k × 1 + ε (6) In which bi refers to the ith band. In the process
    of least squares inversion, the objective function is expressed as: O = argmin
    F × E kbands − R kbands (7) Where argmin is used to find the smallest possible
    values given constraints of least squares, and k bands refer to the Sentinel-2
    bands and VIs. Thus, the least square constraints return the following solution
    to calculate the spectral reflectance values of bands and VIs as: R kbands = F
    T F − 1 F T E kbands (8) 3.1.4. Assigning reflectance spectra at the tree crown
    level The final step in LSUBF is the reconstruction of the fused image. The spectral
    reflectance of the crowns delineated in UAV high-resolution ortho image is assigned
    with inversed endmember spectrum values and their corresponding fractional cover
    in medium-resolution images. It should be mentioned that some crowns are located
    in different neighbouring pixels, while other crowns are partially located in
    one pixel. The assigned spectral reflectance of all crowns and partial crows in
    a pixel i can be expressed as: r i = f c . e c (9) where the abundance fc in the
    formula is the fractional cover of all crowns in a pixel (derived from UAV-RGB
    data) and the endmember spectrum ec is resolved from Equation 8 (derived from
    linear spectral analysis of satellite medium-resolution image). Then, the spectrum
    will be assigned to each crown or partial crown according to its area as: r  c
    / pc = A C / p c f i ⋅ A P × ri (10) where rc/pc is the spectral reflectance of
    a crown or partial crown in pixel i, Ac/pc is the area of a crown/partial crown
    in the pixel i, fi is the crown abundance (fractional cover) in pixel i, Ap is
    the pixel area of a medium-resolution image, and ri is the crown endmember calculated
    in the previous step. Then, the spectral reflectance of crowns that are located
    partially in more than one pixel (rc) was considered as the average of the spectral
    reflectance of different parts: r c = average r pc (11) This process can restore
    the composition of the original crown in UAV images. 3.2. Evaluation of the LSUBF
    The spectral integrity of the unmixing results can be evaluated using spectral
    signatures that were acquired in situ, in the laboratory, or obtained from high-resolution
    images (e.g. (Shahid and Schizas 2021; H. Wang et al. 2022)). A number of studies
    created a synthetic image exploiting these spectra and a reference map to test
    their procedure and validate the endmember extraction (Dobigeon et al. 2014) or
    the fractional abundance estimation (Halimi et al. 2016; Pravesh et al. 2006).
    Among the available studies, only Dobigeon et al. ( 2014) exploited synthetic
    images to both spectrally and spatially validate spectral unmixing. Producing
    reference maps using high-resolution data has been used due to the lack of ground
    reference data (Cavalli 2022). The existing literature includes a summarized reference
    to the following four requirements for an accurate reference map: (1) this data
    should cover most of the study area rather than just a few pixels (Ichoku and
    Karnieli 1996); (2) the spatial resolutions of these maps should be higher than
    that of the data to be validated (Williams et al. 2017) (Yang, He, and Oguchi
    Yang, Yuhong, and Oguchi 2014); (3) the maps should include accurate detail to
    validate the full range of their values that were obtained by spectral unmixing
    (Shi and Wang 2014; Williams et al. 2017) and (4) this data should minimize errors
    in co-localization and spatial resampling due to the comparison of different data
    at different spatial resolutions, i.e. remote sensing data and reference maps,
    in the spatial validation procedures (Cavalli 2021). To satisfy the above requirements,
    we evaluated our results with reference maps obtained from the SPOT-6 data with
    a spatial resolution of 1.5 m and the PlanetScope data with a spatial resolution
    of 3 m. We evaluated the spectral reflectance at the crown level as resulted by
    the fusion. Therefore, two separate reference maps were produced, in each of which
    the spectral reflections of crowns were calculated. This data: covered most of
    the study sites (SPOT-6 and PlanetScope data were available for 10 and 14 study
    sites, respectively) had a higher spatial resolution than the Sentinel-2 data
    had spectral coverage equivalent to the Sentinel-2 data were orthorectified and
    topography corrected by the provided and, after being co-registered with UAV ortho
    images, were applied to derive reference maps. Figure 4 schematically summarizes
    the different resolution levels and spectral bands provided by each data source.
    As can be seen, the crowns delineated in the UAV orthophoto could be visually
    identified in SPOT-6 and PlanetScope, but they will be missed in the case of 10-metre
    Sentinel-2 pixels. The reflectance of the original Blue, Green, Red, and NIR bands
    as well as the spectral indices on each crown were calculated using Sentinel-2
    and reference maps from SPOT-6 and PlantScope data. Then, they were all normalized
    to simplify the statistical comparison. The results of calculating Sentinel-2
    spectral band reflectance were compared to the reference maps by the evaluation
    metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson’s correlation coefficient,
    and the Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthèse (ERGAS) (Wald 2002).
    The latter assumes that the fused result must be spectrally similar to the high-resolution
    image: Figure 4. Different spatial resolution data and their spectral information.
    The PlanetScope and SPOT-6 data were applied to evaluate the spectral reflectance
    of sentinel-2 data that was estimated for crowns delineated on UAV-RGB data. The
    figure shows the level of detail that can be extracted from each data source.
    Whereas UAV data lacks spectral information in the NIR domain, it is a seamless
    source to delineate tree crowns thanks to its high spatial resolution. Sentinel-2
    data provides spectral information and enables the provision of spectral values
    at the crown level following its fusion with high-resolution data. The SPOT-6
    and PlanetScope data feature higher spatial resolutions and were thus leveraged
    to derive reference maps. Display full size ERGAS  spectral = 100 h l 1 N ban
    ∑ i = 1 N ban R M S E i / M i 2 (12) where h is the spatial resolution of the
    high-resolution image, l is the spatial resolution of the low-resolution image,
    Nban is the number of spectral bands, and Mi is the mean spectral value of band
    i. Lower ERGAS values indicate a higher fusion quality. Trees at our study sites
    were associated with variable degrees of decline. Therefore, trees with a high
    PDI (PDI >0.5) and trees with a low PDI (PDI <0.5) were divided into two groups,
    for which evaluation metrics were separately calculated. 3.3. Information derived
    from UAV-RGB data In addition to the spectral information obtained by LSUBF, the
    UAV-RGB ortho images also contain decline-relevant information, which includes
    RGB indices and structural information. The RGB indices comprise a set of possible
    RGB-based vegetation indexes computed using the Red, Green, and Blue bands from
    the ortho images and were applied together with the original Red, Green, and Blue
    bands (Table 5). However, we removed some of these indices in a feature selection
    to reduce the number of input variables. In addition, the structural information
    from UAV data consists of the height of the identified trees and the area of their
    delineated canopies that were extracted directly from the UAV data by considering
    the highest point of the CHM in the area of the tree crown and the area of the
    polygon that determines the edge of the tree, respectively (Ghasemi, Latifi, and
    Pourhashemi). Table 5. RGB VIs calculated from UAV images where R, G, and B are

    B =B/Bmax. Download CSVDisplay Table 3.4. Decline severity The decline severity
    for each tree crown was estimated using the information derived directly from
    UAV ortho images as well as spectral information calculated from LSUBF, with the
    field-based PDI values as the ground reference. The RGB indices and structural
    information (from UAV) data and satellite indices (from LSUBF) were applied as
    predictors to model the severity of decline at the tree crown level. Two models,
    including a nonparametric Random Forest (RF) (Breiman 2001) and a semiparametric
    Generalized Additive Model (GAM) (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990), were used. The
    fitted models were validated using k-fold cross-validation, leading to the selection
    of the best model. While GAM provides higher statistical interpretability, RF
    typically shows higher predictive performance. The GAM is a generalized model
    with a linear predictor involving a sum of smooth functions of covariates. It
    generally takes the following basic structure: g μi = A iθ + f 1 ( x 1 i ) + f
    2 ( x 2 i ) + f 3 ( x 3 i , x 4 i ) + . . . (13) where μi ≡ E(Yi) and Yi ∼ EF(μi,
    φ). Yi is a response variable, EF (μi, φ) denotes an exponential family distribution
    with mean μi and scale parameter, φ, Ai is a row of the model matrix for any strictly
    parametric model components, θ is the corresponding parameter vector, and the
    fj are smooth functions of the covariates, xk. The model allows for flexible specification
    of the dependence of response variables on predictor variables, yet by specifying
    the model only in terms of ‘smooth functions’, rather than detailed parametric
    relationships (Wood 2017). Here, we majorly used spline functions. Whereas splines
    are useful for modelling complex relationships, their limitations include 1) the
    need to manually select the position and number of the knots as well as the degree
    of the polynomials between knots and 2) the difficulty of combining splines for
    different predictors (Rhys 2020). A stepwise feature selection was employed to
    address the first limitation. To address the second limitation, the gam function
    from the mgcv R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mgcv) was used. We
    used the gam. Selection function for setting the model structure and the terms
    in each smoothing function. 3.5. Evaluating decline severity The coefficient of
    determination was used to evaluate the model performance to represent the proportion
    of the variance for the output variable that was explained by predictor variables.
    Eventually, we implemented a variance-based sensitivity analysis on models in
    order to check the influence of the model inputs on the calculated decline severity
    as the model output. Sensitivity analysis co-assists in the identification of
    the model processes (Saltelli et al. 2010), can declare the use and meaning of
    the model predictors (Nossent, Elsen, and Bauwens 2011) and determine the most
    influential predictors (Saltelli et al. 2010). We used the variance-based Sobol’
    method (Sobol’ 1990) as it intuitively helps quantifying the amount of variance
    that each predictor contributes to the unconditional variance of the model output
    (Nossent, Elsen, and Bauwens 2011). In our case, these amounts, caused either
    by a single predictor or by the interaction of two or more predictors, are expressed
    as Sobol’ Sensitivity Indices (SI’s), which represent fractions of the unconditional
    model output variance (Tang et al. 2007). Since the models in this study included
    input predictors from multiple sensor data, sensitivity analysis was performed
    to evaluate the influence of changes in each predictor on the severity of decline
    predicted by the models and examine the added value resulting from different data
    sources. The sensitivity analysis was performed using the Sobol2007 function from
    the Sensitivity package in R (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sensitivity).
    This implements the Monte Carlo estimation of the Sobol’ indices for both first-order
    and total indices at the same time, at a total cost of (p + 2) × n model evaluations.
    These are called the Mauntz estimators and demonstrate the number of model predictors
    and n = 1200 as mentioned by Nossent et al. ( 2011). 4. Results 4.1. Evaluation
    of LSUBF Results of implementing LSUBF on Sentinel-2 data were evaluated using
    the two reference maps produced with the SPOT-6 and PlantScope datasets (Table
    6). In both evaluations, considering all the trees in the study sites, r > 0.7
    and RMSEs < 0.1 were observed. Due to variations in decline degree amongst the
    trees, metrics were calculated separately for trees with high and low PDI (Appendix
    2, Figs. S1-S2). The correlation was notably reduced along with an increase in
    the RMSE for trees with high PDI (Table 6). The ERGAS showed a small value (high
    quality) when considering all trees together as well as trees with low PDI, while
    the values were higher (lower quality) for trees with high PDI. In addition, the
    ERGAS values calculated by PlanetScope data consistently showed lower values than
    those derived by SPOT-6 data. Table 6. Metrics calculated to evaluate LSUBF proceed

    similar sensitivities. Here, we present the Sobol sensitivity analysis results
    of the RF model due to its better performance, while the sensitivities of the
    GAM model will be presented in the Appendix 2, Figure 1. The original value for
    the first-order Sobol index in the RF model ranged between 0.001 and 0.640, with
    OSAVI returning the highest value (Figure 10). The OSAVI was also associated with
    the highest total Sobol index. Both first order and total order Sobol indices
    for LSUBF-derived information were higher than UAV-derived information, particularly
    in case of UAV-RGB indices. The indices showed slight variations around 0, which
    indicates the low sensitivity of the model to these indices as compared with LSUBF
    indices. However, structural information still showed notable effects on model
    outputs. Figure 10. Sobol-based first order and total sensitivity indices for

    potentials of RGB-UAVs as a cost-efficient approach to forestry applications like
    individual tree detection (Kunyong et al. 2022), extracting structural information
    (Fakhri and Latifi 2021) and recently tree health (Iglhaut 2023), two inevitable
    constraints in the context of tree health analysis include broad bandwidth and
    overlapping bands. The spectral characteristics of RGB sensors are primarily designed
    to create visually pleasing images (Pauly 2016) served by their broad bandwidth
    and overlapping individual bands. However, the overlap between bands causes spectral
    contamination, leading to the clumping of several vegetation characteristics such
    as chlorophyll content, canopy density, and architecture (Hunt et al. 2013). Targeted
    information on these characteristics is a prerequisite to extract vegetation stress
    dynamics. To model between tree health conditions and distinct reflectance properties,
    RGB sensors are thus a sub-optimal choice. The value of RGB sensors is arguably
    higher in agricultural applications, where slight changes in the visible range
    are more apparent in even-aged monocultures (Kazemi and Ghanbari Parmehr 2023).
    Forests, however, exhibit far higher natural variability. Following this perspective,
    NIR modifications have increased the utility of RGB sensors. Previous studies
    attempted to simulate the NIR band by modifying off-the-shelf cameras, replacing
    the hot mirror with a NIR filter (Brovkina et al. 2018; Lehmann et al. 2015),
    or estimating NIR bands from RGB data using machine learning methods (Costa, Nunes,
    and Ampatzidis 2020) in order to increase the efficiency of RGB data for forest
    health inventories. However, they still used overlapping bands with broad bandwidth,
    so their application remains restricted to relative assessments of a single dataset.
    To address this problem, we added multispectral data from freely available optical
    data sources to UAV-RGB data to estimate the severity of tree decline. The process
    of fusing images from different sensors is intended to complement multi-source
    information compared to single-source data (Siok, Ewiak, and Jenerowicz 2020).
    This is of particular importance for cost-effective solutions for using UAV-RGB
    data across remotely accessible areas, which are associated with tree decline.
    Below, we first discuss the LSUBF results, followed by arguing why this presents
    an effective solution for estimating tree decline severity, especially in sparse
    woody vegetation. Finally, the main potential and pitfalls of the proposed method
    are briefly discussed. 5.1. LSUBF To evaluate the new LSUBF method, the estimated
    spectral bands were compared with reference maps extracted from SPOT-6 and PlanetScope
    data. Our comparisons proved operationally high correlations, i.e. 0.76 and 0.77,
    when compared with SPOT-6 data, which features a comparably higher spatial resolution.
    Correlations were slightly lower compared with the case of PlanetScope data. This
    is consistent with previous studies on data fusion with spectral analysis methods
    (W. Liu et al. 2020). Previous methods mainly focused on calculating endmember
    abundance in high-resolution data, followed by calculating the spectral values
    resulting from the decomposition of spectrally richer yet lower spatial resolution
    data for endmembers in a higher-resolution image (Guo et al. 2015). When calculating
    endmember abundance, the higher the spatial resolution, the lower the possibility
    of the presence of mixed pixels attributed to a specific endmember (especially
    at the borders), which would lead to a higher performance of the method (Xisheng
    and Hanqiu 2018). On the one hand, higher correlations between the results of
    spectral analysis and higher-resolution data can be considered the result of fewer
    background effects in the reference map calculated from high-resolution data.
    On the other hand, the calculated spectral ERGAS values for the PlanetScope data
    were lower than those of the SPOT-6 data. A number of studies also acknowledged
    that the higher-resolution PlanetScope data could be considered a complement to
    the Sentinel-2 data (Kpienbaareh et al. 2021; Mudereri et al. 2019; Rösch et al.
    2022). As expected, evaluation metrics calculated for the spectral reflectance
    of highly declined trees were generally associated with poorer LSUBF performance.
    Decline causes the leaves to fall or change colour (Ghasemi, Latifi, and Pourhashemi
    2023). The increase of the Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV) part of the declined
    tree causes the spectral reflections recorded from a healthy crown (or those at
    the earlier stage of decline) to be different from the spectral reflections corresponding
    to a declined tree (Tian et al. 2021, 2023), and its interpretation is, therefore,
    context-dependent. In other words, the endmembers defined for spectral decomposition
    are expected to be affected by the health conditions of the trees. If the spectral
    analysis is performed with a goal other than investigating vegetation health status,
    the NPV-relevant information can be inherently integrated into the method as auxiliary
    data, help define the endmembers, and ultimately improve the LSUBF´s performance.
    We did not incorporate this solution here since our goal was to study tree crown
    health, but we expect it to lead to enhanced performance of the method in other
    applications in which data fusion has already been tested. Examples are tree species
    classification (Hartling, Sagan, and Maimaitijiang 2021), land cover maps (Chen,
    Huang, and Bing 2017), and plant diversity (Reddy 2021). We derived and validated
    decline-relevant vegetation indices in addition to spectral bands that we divided
    into two groups according to whether Green and Blue bands were used along with
    Red and NIR bands. Multiple studies limited spectral information application from
    space-borne sensors by extracting information using individual light spectral
    bands or a group of single bands for data analysis (Xue and Baofeng 2017). Studies
    often combine data from the NIR (0.7–1.1 m) and Red (0.6–0.7 m) bands in different
    ways according to their specific objectives (Foley et al. 1998). In line with
    our context and consistent with the literature, Fakhri et al. ( 2022) recently
    showed that adding the Blue band to broadband vegetation indices can lead to an
    increase in its effectiveness for semi-arid tree cover monitoring. This was also
    confirmed by Swatantran et al. ( 2011) when fusing hyperspectral and LiDAR data
    to map biomass and tree stress. They used area of lignin and cellulose absorption
    features (2045–2218 nm) (Curran, Dungan, and Peterson 2001) to identify non-photosynthetic
    vegetation, and reported improvements in biomass estimates by using indices incorporating
    green, red, and blue bands compared with NDVI. Moreover, Siok et al. ( 2020) pan-sharpened
    Sentinel-2 data with the UAV panchromatic band and reported higher R2 values for
    the Blue and Green bands compared with the Red band. 5.2. Modelling decline severity
    We recently presented a workflow to estimate tree decline severity at tree crown
    level using information extracted from UAV-RGB data (Ghasemi, Latifi, and Pourhashemi
    2023), in which RGB indices and structural information were applied as inputs
    to model tree decline across semi-arid tree cover. The study returned an R2 value
    of 0.61 for GAM and 0.88 for RF models in estimating decline severity at tree
    crown level. Here, we proved that adding spectral information and indices from
    the fused UAV-RGB and Sentinel-2 data enhances the accuracy of the models. In
    the final GAM model used to estimate PDI, bands and spectral indices appeared
    either linearly or in the form of 2nd degree splines in the model, whereas RGB
    indices and structural information derived from UAV data appeared as splines with
    higher degrees (between 2 and 5). Therefore, we argue that the relationship between
    the information that can be directly extracted from the UAV data and the PDI (an
    indicator of tree decline) is more complicated than the relationship between the
    spectral information derived from LSUBF and the PDI. A closer look at the results
    of our sensitivity analysis confirmed this (see Figure 10), based on which variation
    in input spectral indices was shown to lead to a higher variation in the modelled
    response, i.e. PDI. In other words, our analysis revealed that the PDI was more
    sensitive to the spectral indices than to the RGB indices. In case of RGB indices,
    the first-order and total Sobol indices for the RGB indices were very small and
    close to zero. Despite this, Sobol indices returned higher values for the input
    structural information, which was obviously associated with lower values compared
    to Sobol indices for spectral information. The highest level of sensitivity was
    returned for SAVI and OSAVI, which were derived to eliminate the background effects
    present across our sparse test sites. This is compatible with the recent findings
    on the sole use of Sentinel-2 data for the retrieval of tree decline on a landscape
    level (Ghasemi, Latifi, and Pourhashemi). Last but not least, a number of recent
    studies also compared the use of RGB information with spectral information that
    can be derived from different UAV sensors in studies related to forest health
    (Fuentes-Peailillo et al. 2018; Jónsson 2019; Yuan et al. 2022) and suggested
    the superior performance of multispectral vegetation indices to that of RGB indices,
    though RGB can still provide some valuable information on tree health (Yuan et
    al. 2022). 5.3. Potentials and pitfalls of our method The tree decline periodically
    occurs and results in the loss of trees (Pourhashemi and Mohammad Moein Sadeghi
    2020). This calls for the availability of data in the time ranges required by
    the researchers and managers that can accurately predict both the location and
    the severity of tree decline in order to investigate decline at the tree level
    (Imanyfar, Hasanlou, and Mirzaei Zadeh 2019), a precondition for management interventions.
    Despite being accessible and cost-effective, UAV-RGB data lack the spectral information
    required to assess the health of trees, whereas UAV platforms with other payloads
    like multi- and hyperspectral sensors are prohibitively expensive. UAV-RGB data
    enable accurately determining the position and boundaries of crowns, while the
    method proposed by this study helps improve the spectral quality of the high spatial
    resolution UAV-RGB data at low computational and financial costs. Additionally,
    we offer an approach for object-based data fusion that directly computes spectral
    characteristics at tree level. The consensus within the literature shows that
    object-based methods generate similar or higher accuracy compared with pixel-based
    methods for high and very high-resolution images (Qin and Liu 2022) by 1) minimizing
    within-class spectral variance especially in high-resolution satellite imagery,
    and 2) enabling derivation of a large set of features characterizing objects’
    spatial and contextual properties as complementary information (Blaschke 2010).
    Nevertheless, it should be highlighted that a constraining assumption is used
    in the calculations for linear spectral unmixing applied in this method. The existence
    of two distinct soil and tree classes is a fundamental presumption to reduce the
    uncertainties associated with land cover classifications and is thus of elemental
    importance for our approach. The equations, however, become singular when the
    number of endmembers is added to Equation 7 without additionally including spectral
    information. This presumption entirely holds true in sparse, semi-arid forests
    like those being studied here. Equation 7 streamlines the process and cuts down
    on the number of calculations. The primary principle of the approach is still
    applicable if there are more endmembers in the UAV-RGB images (which could be
    segmented accurately), although in this case the existing methods (W. Liu et al.
    2020) could conveniently be utilized to address the issue of spectral unmixing.
    6. Conclusion We designed LSUBF to show how a fusion method can compensate for
    the lack of spectral information in widely used and cost-effective UAV-RGB sensors
    with the main objective of estimating tree decline severity in semi-arid and sparse
    tree covers. Our suggested approach estimates spectral reflectance of 10-m spectral
    resolution Sentinel-2 bands on tree crowns delineated on UAV images. The evaluation
    of LSUBF`s results showed that the spectral reflectance and indices estimated
    from LSUBF are comparable with the very high-resolution multispectral data and
    are therefore of high reliability for tree health studies. Subsequently, adding
    spectral information led to an increase in the accuracy of estimated tree decline
    at the crown level using UAV-RGB data. As the presented method uses very cost-effective
    data sources to estimate the decline severity for individual trees with high accuracy,
    it can be integrated within current monitoring programmes to periodically observe
    the declining status of tree covers in remote and semi-arid forests. Declaration

    Introduction Agriculture is the predominant sector worldwide in terms of water
    consumption, with roughly 72% of available freshwater resources allocated for
    agricultural irrigation (Davarpanah and Ahmadi, 2021; Koo et al., 2013). The scarcity
    of water resources poses a significant constraint on sustainable socio-economic
    development (Chopra et al., 2022; Voeroesmarty et al., 2015). It is estimated
    that nearly one billion people inhabit regions affected by chronic drought and
    water shortages (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016). Agriculture consistently emerges
    as the largest consumer and user of water, representing 70%–90% of global water
    consumption (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012). Therefore, the adoption of water-saving
    practices in the agricultural sector becomes not only necessary but also critical
    for effective water resource management. The development of water-saving, ecological,
    and efficient agricultural practices is of utmost importance (Fu et al., 2022;
    Ren et al., 2021). Water-saving technologies encompass various approaches, such
    as modern biological water-saving technology, unconventional high-efficiency and
    safe-water using technology, water-saving irrigation technology and equipment,
    dry high-efficiency water utilization technology, and new materials for regional
    high-efficiency water-saving agriculture (Wu, 2010), et al. Among these practices,
    artificial irrigation and drip irrigation are widely recognized for their benefits
    in water economy. Drip irrigation has emerged as an economically viable option
    for irrigating field crops like maize (Jat et al., 2019; Patra et al., 2021; Yolcu
    and Cetin, 2015) and wheat (Sidhu et al., 2019) to enhance water productivity.
    Sub-surface drip irrigation, when compared to traditional furrow irrigation and
    conventional tillage, conserves 54% of irrigation water while doubling water productivity
    (Patra et al., 2023). To address water scarcity and enhance productivity, effective
    irrigation and fertilization management are essential. Drip fertigation, involving
    the controlled application of water and fertilizer through plastic tubing at the
    base of plants (Bar-Yosef, 1999), has proven to be an efficient approach. It significantly
    improves water productivity by 26.4% (Li et al., 2021). The broad implementation
    of water-saving practices, coupled with active involvement from stakeholders,
    can yield immediate water conservation and efficiency enhancements, as well as
    long-term environmental and economic advantages. The management of agricultural
    products with high water demand through water-saving strategies has been proposed
    to reduce their water footprint (Novoa et al., 2019). To promote both agricultural
    water-saving and industrial development, local governments frequently establish
    agricultural water-saving investment companies. Nonetheless, this approach can
    place the financial burden on the government and farmers (Cao et al., 2020). The
    high costs associated with adopting new water-saving technologies can deter some
    farmers from embracing them (Katic and Ellis, 2018). Scholars have explored the
    use of water rights trading models to motivate participants in water-saving activities
    by offering precise subsidies and rewards based on their efforts (Cui et al.,
    2020; Rosegrant and Binswanger, 1994). However, challenges related to opportunistic
    behaviors, management, and stakeholder involvement can arise in agricultural water
    management (Adelodun et al., 2021; Jones and White, 2022). Effective government
    supervision can enhance project implementation, reduce speculation, and address
    these challenges (Koo et al., 2013). Nonetheless, traditional supervision methods
    are often costly and inefficient, leading to sub-optimal outcomes. The integration
    of blockchain technology (BT), with its decentralized and distributed ledger system,
    coupled with smart contract capabilities, offers promising opportunities for technological
    innovation in market supervision. These advancements lay the foundation for exploring
    new operational models that enhance transparency, efficiency, and accountability
    (Wu et al., 2022). In various market supervision scenarios, including traceability,
    government services, credit supervision, online transaction supervision, and intellectual
    property supervision, BT has demonstrated success (Adjei-Arthur et al., 2022;
    Min, 2019). It has emerged as a significant technological application, revolutionizing
    the way supervision is conducted and enhancing overall efficiency. However, there
    is still a lack of theoretical discussion regarding the application of BT in agricultural
    water-saving practices. For the research on agricultural water-saving, three primary
    challenges have been identified. First, Water-saving service companies (WSSCs)
    face a perplexing dilemma known as the “water-saving paradox”. On one hand, they
    recognize the potential for profitability in adopting water-saving technology.
    However, the high costs associated with implementing these technologies can deter
    their active participation and hinder progress. Second, farmers, who play a crucial
    role in water-saving practices, may encounter discouragement due to the substantial
    expenses involved in implementing such measures. This issue becomes more pronounced
    when there is a lack of financial support from the government or companies in
    the form of subsidies. The absence of these incentives can undermine farmers''
    enthusiasm and delay the widespread adoption of water-saving techniques. Third,
    the complex dynamics among various stakeholders can give rise to opportunistic
    behaviors driven by information asymmetry and profit-oriented motives. To address
    these challenges, this study focuses on analyzing the decision-making behavior
    and interaction mechanisms among three stakeholders: the government, WSSCs and
    farmers. This analysis is conducted under various scenarios using evolutionary
    game theory. The main objectives of this study are as follows. (I) A tripartite
    evolutionary game model is developed to investigate the relevant factors affecting
    the stakeholders’ strategy choices, which aims to provide some guidance to the
    three stakeholders involved in the water-saving management, especially the government.
    (II) The impacts of the main parameters are illustrated in numerical simulations,
    which aims to provide a theoretical basis for all stakeholders make long-term
    decisions. The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides
    literature reviews about agricultural water-saving and water rights trading, the
    applications of BT and evolutionary game theory. And the methodology is presented
    in Section 3, the game theory model is constructed and analyzed. Section 4 gives
    the case study analysis and discussions for the findings of this study. Section
    5 provides the conclusions and future research. 2. Literature review 2.1. Agricultural
    water-saving and water rights trading Agricultural water-saving is a pivotal field
    of research within the realm of sustainable agricultural development (Yang et
    al., 2022b). Extensive research has been conducted on agricultural water-saving
    technology, management policies, and engineering measures to ensure food security
    (Blanke et al., 2007; Chai et al., 2014). Scholars have also employed Data Envelopment
    Analysis (DEA) as a tool to gauge the effectiveness of water-saving measures in
    China''s agricultural sector (Cao et al., 2020). Recognizing the importance of
    stakeholder engagement and effective water-saving policies is crucial in the pursuit
    of sustainable agricultural water usage goals (Lee et al., 2022). Yang et al.
    (2022b) conducted a comprehensive review of policies and systems implemented since
    2012, examining the progress of agricultural water-saving in Jiangsu Province
    from 2014 to 2019. They utilized relevant data, including the agricultural irrigation
    water use coefficient. From a sustainability standpoint, Zhou et al. (2020) proposed
    an integrated irrigation strategy focused on high-efficiency water-saving, which
    offers guidance and serves as a foundation for decision-making in agricultural
    production and model innovation. Water rights trading has found application within
    the sphere of agricultural water-saving (He et al., 2021). It primarily revolves
    around the reassignment of saved agricultural water for both economic development
    and ecological purposes (He et al., 2021; Rosegrant and Binswanger, 1994). The
    transfer of agricultural water to non-agricultural sectors and the resulting benefits
    can be viewed as a collaborative endeavor involving water-saving entities and
    various industries. Consequently, compensation for agricultural water-saving can
    be regarded as a form of cooperative income distribution. Drawing upon the principles
    of agricultural water-saving economics and ecological systems, He et al. (2021)
    have devised a representative water rights trading model illustrating its potential
    to enhance benefits for both industries and ecosystem services. Nevertheless,
    some scholars argued that the discernible impact of water rights trading on agricultural
    water-saving is not entirely clear due to limitations in transaction scope and
    scale (Zhang et al., 2013). The progress in irrigation technology spurred by water
    rights trading may not sufficiently support the goals of agricultural water-saving
    (Fang and Zhang, 2020). Thus, there is a pressing need to further expand new business
    models in agricultural water-saving to address investment gaps. While existing
    research on agricultural water-saving and water rights trading is extensive, the
    primary focus remains on the regulation of stakeholders'' investment and water-saving
    behaviors to implement effective agricultural water-saving practices. Various
    regions exhibit disparities in terms of agricultural infrastructure, agricultural
    modernization processes, water resource endowment, economic and social development
    status, and water resource management. These factors contribute to uneven advancements
    in the comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices (Yang et al., 2022a),
    and give rise to significant regional differences (Cooper et al., 2023; Hou et
    al., 2022). Furthermore, owing to differences in natural conditions, irrigation
    methods, and economic capacities among various regions, the cost of water supply
    production varies, resulting in certain fluctuations in water prices. The adjustment
    of agricultural water prices to regulate water consumption and improve efficiency
    is also a relatively time-intensive process (Hou et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2022;
    Yang et al., 2022a). Consequently, the core approach to addressing agricultural
    water resource challenges centers on harnessing the subjective role of stakeholders
    and guiding them toward conscious and proactive adoption of water-saving behaviors.
    To ignite internal motivation for water-saving among all stakeholders, it becomes
    imperative to establish an array of effective incentive measures for promoting
    agricultural water-saving practices. 2.2. The application of BT Blockchain platform
    plays an instrumental role for the various challenges solving, including issues
    related to information asymmetry, high supervision costs, and low supervision
    efficiency (Kim et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023). It''s reported
    that blockchain has several key characteristics, such as decentralization, persistency,
    anonymity and auditability, which has obtained more and more attention across
    multiple fields (Borges et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2018). The application research
    of BT can be categorized into the following areas. Firstly, scholars have focused
    on the integration of BT with supply chain management. With the increasing globalization,
    the complexity of managing and overseeing supply chains has surged. BT brings
    transparency to value chains through a distributed ledger system, which is anticipated
    to alleviate these challenges (Saberi et al., 2019). BT has the potential to enhance
    inter-organizational activities through improvements in data integrity, enhanced
    transaction transparency, and a reduction in transaction costs (Cho et al., 2021).
    It becomes evident that blockchain''s contribution to enhancing transparency within
    value chains is not only significant but also multifaceted. Min (2019) has investigated
    the potential of BT in improving the adaptability of supply chains during periods
    of heightened risk and uncertainty. Helo and Hao (2019) proposed an architecture
    for a blockchain-supported logistics monitoring system, built upon the Ethereum
    platform. In the context of governance over manufacturing supply chain data and
    government policy incentives within blockchain frameworks, Wei et al. (2023) developed
    an evolutionary game model using the prospect theory for the relationships among
    the government, manufacturers, and retailers. Secondly, studies have been conducted
    on trading mechanisms. Xiong et al. (2022) devised a real-time transaction mechanism
    employing smart contracts within BT to meet the security and economic needs of
    photovoltaic production enterprises. Mao et al. (2022) introduced a demand response
    framework based on BT to address issues of data reliability and transaction efficiency
    in the power system industry. Adjei-Arthur et al. (2022) developed a contract
    management system based on BT that promotes efficient collaboration and work among
    multiple organizations. Lastly, some researchers have examined agricultural water
    resource management. Some regions are facing the dilemma of water scarcity and
    insufficient agricultural land (Jabal et al., 2022), with agricultural irrigation
    canals facing 43% of water loss and prominent water management issues (Syed et
    al., 2021). Xiong et al. (2020) delved into the application of blockchain within
    the agricultural domain, illustrating how information and communication technology
    (ICT) has significantly enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of data collection,
    storage, analysis, and utilization in agriculture (Rajak, 2022; Walter et al.,
    2017), and it allowed agricultural practitioners and agricultural communities
    to easily access the latest information, enabling better decision-making in daily
    agricultural work (Xiong et al., 2020). Zeng et al. (2023) combined the Internet
    of Things (IoT) with BT to design an intelligent water resources management system
    for effective farmland monitoring. Pincheira et al. (2021) demonstrated that integrating
    BT and IoT technology into irrigation water management systems can incentivize
    positive behaviors among stakeholders. Furthermore, BT has been harnessed by agricultural
    organizations to empower their practices. Notably, farmland irrigation organizations
    in Taiwan have adopted blockchain as a means to archive data and enhance interaction
    with the public (Lin et al., 2017). Each organization publishes its irrigation
    management data and information on the blockchain, establishing itself as a “public
    legal entity” accessible to the general public. This heightened transparency serves
    as a catalyst for sustainable development in agricultural water-saving activities
    and encourages intensified efforts towards improving water resource utilization
    (Xiong et al., 2020). Scholars have increasingly acknowledged the potential of
    BT. Nevertheless, a conspicuous gap in research exists concerning the regulation
    of blockchain in the context of agricultural water-saving activities. The integration
    of BT into the oversight of water-saving practices in agriculture is expected
    to offer solutions to challenges such as trust deficits, the absence of information
    traceability, and potential tampering among government, WSSCs, and farmers engaged
    in water-saving initiatives. 2.3. The application of the evolutionary game theory
    Game theory is the theory that uses mathematical methods to investigate the relationship
    among the participants and find the optimal development strategy. Its research
    objects include game subjects, game strategies, information sets and game results.
    The end result of game theory is an equilibrium state, in which each game subject
    chooses a strategy that he hopes will give him the greatest gain. However, in
    some cases, the game subject does not fully know the game information and is likely
    to fail to find the strategy that maximizes its returns, which requires each game
    subject to constantly adjust its own strategy to find the optimal strategy (Sterman,
    2000). Evolutionary game theory is the theory that combines the game theory and
    the dynamic evolutionary process. It emphasizes a dynamic equilibrium, and the
    most commonly used method in the analysis of results is numerical simulation analysis
    (Perc and Szolnoki, 2010). Evolutionary game theory (Friedman, 1991) recognizes
    that all participants in the game are bounded rational and dynamically achieve
    equilibrium through continuous learning and adaptation. It can addresses the limitations
    of complete rationality found in traditional game theory (Perera, 2018; Schmidt,
    2004). Since participants in evolutionary games are bounded rationality, and they
    adjust their behavioral strategies by observing and learning from others (Shan
    and Yang, 2019). Consequently, the selection of behavior strategies by each participant
    in the game becomes uncertain. A key characteristic of evolutionary games is the
    adaptability of strategies over time (Sun et al., 2019). The compensation mechanism
    for agricultural water-saving is a significant research topic. The evolutionary
    game model is well-suited for analyzing the behavior strategies of participants
    in agricultural water-saving under incomplete information, considering the complexity
    and uncertainty of their behaviors. Wang and Lu (2010) utilized game theory to
    analyze the balance of interests among stakeholders. Hu and Li (2015) applied
    game theory to analysis the evolution of strategies related to agricultural water
    price, water-saving irrigation technology, water supply units, and farmers'' water
    use behaviors. They highlighted the importance of reasonable water prices in promoting
    water-saving irrigation technology and improving efficiency. Shen et al. (2021)
    combined evolutionary game theory and prospect theory to investigate the evolution
    and influencing factors of government and enterprise behaviors. Their findings
    can provide valuable insights for establishing effective compensation mechanisms
    and guiding investment decisions for the government and enterprises, respectively.
    The process of agricultural water-saving entails decision-making and strategy
    selection by the government, WSSCs, and farmers in the game process. The choices
    made by one party can impact the income of others participating in this process.
    Previous research has primarily focused on the dynamic interactions between the
    government and WSSCs, as well as between the government and farmers. However,
    these studies have not fully capture the interactive effects of strategies among
    all participants in this context. Moreover, considering the distribution of income
    and the losses resulting from self-interested strategies is also of paramount
    important to the participants. To address these gaps, this study harnesses the
    advantages of evolutionary games in dynamic analysis. It constructs a tripartite
    evolutionary game model involving the government, WSSCs, and farmers, and analyzes
    the conditions and process of its evolution. 3. Methodology 3.1. Problem description
    The government''s primary objective is to maximize social welfare by supervising
    and managing the water-saving behaviors and subsidy utilization of WSSCs. They
    aim to reward or penalize WSSCs accordingly, encouraging their responsible development.
    In turn, WSSCs strive to maximize their own profits by investing in advanced water-saving
    technology, accepting government supervision, and offering convenient and affordable
    water services to farmers. Conversely, farmers possess the autonomy to decide
    whether to engage in water-saving practices, with the goal of minimizing their
    own water-related expenditures, including costs for chemical fertilizers, pesticides,
    and water fees. However, when the government is unable to accurately assess and
    quantify the potential water-saving benefits and costs for water users, WSSCs
    may display excessive enthusiasm for water-saving investments to obtain maximum
    individual income from the government. Yet, during the actual implementation process,
    they may not necessarily fulfill their commitments outlined in the contract regarding
    the agreed-upon water-saving project funds. In the agricultural water-saving game
    process, the purpose of the government is to achieve the maximum of the social
    welfare, which mainly relies on the efforts of WSSCs and farmers in water-saving
    practice. And the WSSCs and farmers strive to maximize their own profits. Specifically,
    the WSSCs’ net profits are calculated as the difference between their total profits
    and cost, where the total profits include the punishments or subsidies from the
    government according to their water-saving behaviors, and the costs are their
    efforts including the introduce of the water-saving technology, etc. Similarly,
    the total profits of the farmers include the subsidy and incentive profits from
    the government, and the costs of them are the punishment by the government and
    the efforts due to implementing water-saving. From the perspective of government
    supervision, the core issue originates in information asymmetry. To address this
    problem, it is necessary to upgrade the government''s supervision system and establish
    comprehensive monitoring of the water-saving practices of WSSCs and farmers. This
    proactive approach ensures a balanced flow of supervisory information, thereby
    mitigating information asymmetry between the supervisory authority and the entities
    under supervision. The smart contract technology of blockchain can realize the
    government''s supervision and early warning on the water-saving behavior of WSSCs
    and farmers. Therefore, compared to the traditional supervision means, the application
    of BT for government can significantly enhance the water-saving efficiency of
    WSSCs and farmers. Meanwhile, to incentivize water-saving efforts by WSSCs and
    farmers, collaborative incentives from the government are granted to them, with
    rewards distributed to WSSCs and farmers in a predetermined proportion. On the
    contrary, if WSSCs and farmers fail to implement water-saving measures, they will
    undertake the corresponding punishment. The game logic chart of stakeholders in
    the agricultural water-saving practice is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download

    chart of stakeholders in the agricultural water-saving practice. 3.2. Model assumptions
    and model parameters To construct the game model, some assumptions are first presented
    as follows. Assumption 1 Assume that the game subjects consist of the government,
    WSSCs and farmers, who exhibit bounded rationality (Legros, 2022). Their behavioral
    strategies dynamically evolve during the water-saving management process, without
    considering the influence of uncertainty or uncontrollable factors on their behavioral
    choices. Since the game subjects'' inaction in agricultural water-saving management
    is an absolute bad strategy in the long-term game process, it is not advisable
    in the model construction, such a strategy is not advisable in the model construction.
    For example, since the government''s failure to supervise the WSSCs'' and farmers''
    water-saving behaviors is an absolute bad strategy in the long-term process of
    water-saving management, the government''s choice of abstaining from supervision
    will not be taken into account in the construction of the game model. Therefore,
    the assumptions for the game subjects are presented as follows. Assumption 2 Assume
    that the strategy set for the government are {A1, A2}, in which the strategies
    A1 and A2 are to use blockchain technology supervision (BTS) and to use traditional
    means supervision (TMS), respectively, and their probabilities chosen by the government
    are assumed as and , respectively. Assumption 3 Assume that the strategy set for
    the WSSCs are {B1, B2}, in which the strategies B1 and B2 are to invest in water-saving
    and not to invest in water-saving, respectively, and their probabilities chosen
    by the WSSCs are assumed as and , respectively. Assumption 4 Assume that the strategy
    set for the farmers are {C1, C2}, in which the strategies C1 and C2 are to choose
    to water-saving and not to choose to water-saving for the farmers, respectively,
    and their probabilities chosen by the farmers are assumed as and , respectively.
    Assumption 5 Assume that the cost of using BTS for the government is larger than
    the cost using TMS. Furthermore, if the WSSCs choose to invest in water-saving,
    then the government will offers water-saving subsidies according to the farmers''
    water-saving practice. And it is assumed that, when the farmers do not choose
    to water-saving strategy, the subsidy to the WSSCs is smaller than the subsidy
    for the case of the farmers choose to water-saving. Meanwhile, when both of the
    WSSCs and farmers choose to engage in water-saving practices, they can obtain
    collaborative incentive incomes and , respectively, and is the distribute coefficient
    of the collaborative incentive income to WSSCs. Assumption 6 Assume that when
    both of the WSSCs and farmers choose to water-saving practices, the income from
    water right trading is distributed to them based on a specific proportion. If
    represents the income from water right trading and is the distribution coefficient
    to the WSSCs, then the income from water right trading for WSSCs and farmers would
    be denoted as and , respectively. Assumption 7 Assume that the government will
    impose penalties to the WSSCs, once the WSSCs or farmers does not engage in water-saving
    practices. When the farmers implement water-saving and the WSSCs do not invest
    in water-saving, the penalty to WSSCs is denoted as . And, when both of the farmers
    and WSSCs do not engage in water-saving practices, the penalty to WSSCs is denoted
    as . Furthermore, it is assumed that the penalty is lower than the penalty . Assumption
    8 Assume that the probability of the WSSCs'' or farmers'' engaging in water-saving
    discovered by the government''s choosing TMS is , and the corresponding penalties
    would be represented as and . Assumption 9 Assume that the probability of the
    WSSCs'' or farmers'' engaging in water-saving discovered by the government''s
    choosing BTS is , and the corresponding penalties would be represented as and
    . To explore the benefits and costs of all stakeholders’ different behavioral
    strategies, some relevant parameters and their meanings are given as shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. The parameters and their meanings. Parameters Meanings The costs
    of using BTS and TMS for the government, respectively The water-saving subsides

    According to the assumptions mentioned above, the income matrix of tripartite
    game is shown in Table 2. Table 2. Income matrix of tripartite game. Strategies
    Government A1 A2 WSSCs B1 Farmer C1     C2     B2 Farmer C1     C2     3.3. Analysis
    of tripartite game equilibrium This subsection will analyze the evolutionary equilibrium
    strategies within the tripartite game involving the government, WSSCs and farmers,
    which includes the constructions of their replication dynamic equations and the
    analysis of equilibrium evolutionary stability strategy based on the constructed
    replication dynamic equations. 3.3.1. Replication dynamic equation for government
    From Table 2, the government''s expected social utility by choosing the strategies
    A1 and A2 are and , respectively, and the average social utility is , which are
    as follows: (1) (2) (3) So, the replicated dynamic equation choosing the strategy
    A1 for the government is as follows: (4) Let then. (I) when , the replicated dynamic
    equation . It shows that the strategies chosen by government are stable no matter
    what the values of . (II)when , suppose that , then two stable points and are
    obtained Next, the partial derivative of with respect to can be written as follows:
    Obviously, for , if , then , and if , then . Therefore, is the evolutionary stability
    strategy. Similarly, when , is the evolutionary stability strategy. Therefore,
    drawing from the analysis of the evolutionary game equilibrium involving the government,
    it becomes evident that when farmers show a preference for water-saving practices,
    the government is inclined to choose TMS, as it can result in cost savings for
    supervision. Conversely, if farmers do not demonstrate a strong inclination towards
    water-saving, the government is more likely to choose BTS to oversee their water-saving
    behaviors, as it offers better regulation of their water-saving efforts. Meanwhile,
    there are similar discussions for the case of , where and . It won''t be repeated
    here. 3.3.2. Replication dynamic equation for WSSCs From Table 2, the WSSCs’ expected
    incomes by choosing the strategies B1 and B2 are and in the game process, respectively,
    and the average income is , which are as follows: And, the replicated dynamic
    equation choosing the strategy B1 for the WSSCs is as follows: (I)when , the replicated
    dynamic equation . It shows that the strategies chosen by government are stable
    no matter what the values of . (II)when , suppose that , then two stable points
    and are obtained. Next, the partial derivative of with respect to can be written
    as follows: According to the above formula, for , if , then , and if , then .
    Therefore, is the evolutionary stability strategy. Similarly, when , is the evolutionary
    stability strategy. Therefore, through an examination of the evolutionary game
    equilibrium for WSSCs, a notable conclusion emerges. When the government demonstrates
    a preference for the utilization of BTS, WSSCs are more inclined to invest in
    water-saving practices. In contrast, if the government favors the use of TMS,
    WSSCs are less motivated to invest in water-saving practices. Similarly, let ,
    there are similar discussions in Subsection 3.3.1, which won''t be repeated here.
    3.3.3. Replication dynamic equation for farmers From Table 2, the farmers’ expected
    incomes by choosing the strategies C1 and C2 are and in the game process, respectively,
    and the average income is , which are as follows: And, the replicated dynamic
    equation choosing the strategy C1 for the farmers is as follows: Suppose that
    , (I)when , the replicated dynamic equation . It shows that the strategies chosen
    by government are stable no matter what the values of . (II)when , suppose that
    , then two stable points and are obtained Next, the partial derivative of with
    respect to can be written as follows: From the above formula, for , if , then
    , and if , then . Therefore, is the evolutionary stability strategy. Similarly,
    when , is the evolutionary stability strategy. Therefore, following an analysis
    of the evolutionary game equilibrium for farmers, a discernible pattern emerges.
    When the government expresses a preference for the use of BTS, farmers are more
    inclined to embrace water-saving strategies. Conversely, if the government leans
    toward relying on TMS, farmers exhibit reduced enthusiasm for water conservation.
    Similarly, let , there are similar discussions in 3 Methodology, 3.3.1 Replication
    dynamic equation for government.3.2, which won''t be repeated here. 3.3.4. Analysis
    of equilibrium evolutionary stability strategy of tripartite evolutionary game
    Considering the pivotal conditions and pathways of strategy evolution as analyzed
    previously for the government, WSSCs, and farmers, the evolutionary stability
    strategies and different equilibrium states under the joint action of the tripartite
    game subjects will be discussed simultaneously. Subsequently, the replication
    dynamic equations are constructed for the government, WSSCs, and farmers as follows:
    Since the evolutionary stability strategy of differential equation system can
    be determined through the local stability analysis of the system''s Jacobian matrix
    (Shan and Yang, 2019), the Jacobian matrix of the tripartite evolution game is
    first constructed below: where If the Jacobian matrix above satisfies the conditions
    and , then the equilibrium points of the replicated dynamic equations are stable,
    which also represents the he evolutionary stability strategies. In the asymmetric
    game, the evolutionary stability strategy is regarded as a pure strategy if the
    conditions of asymmetric information are satisfied (Friedman, 1991). Thus, the
    asymptotic stability of the eight local equilibrium points, denoted as , , , ,
    , , , , satisfying the conditions , and , is discussed. Subsequently, each of
    these eight equilibrium points is substituted into the Jacobian matrix, and the
    resulting eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobian matrices are presented in
    Table 3. Table 3. System equilibrium points and eigenvalues. Equilibrium points
    Eigenvalue Eigenvalue Eigenvalue From Table 3, the stable evolution strategy of
    the system is analyzed as follows. (I)If , and , then the stable evolution strategy
    of the system is . From the government''s perspective, if the overall cost of
    using TMS and providing water-saving subsidies is lower than that of employing
    BTS and offering water-saving subsidies to WSSCs, then the government will choose
    to use TMS. In the scenario where WSSCs invest in water-saving technology, two
    conditions must be satisfied. First, the investment made by WSSCs in water-saving
    technology should be lower than the government''s subsidy. Second, the WSSCs''
    income from other activities should be less than the penalty imposed when they
    do not invest in water-saving technology. For farmers, several factors need to
    be considered. If the total costs of additional expenses for water-saving, charges
    associated with selecting water-saving measures, penalties for not saving water,
    and benefits from not saving water surpass the punishment for not saving water,
    the benefits derived from saving water, sharing benefits from water rights trading,
    and water charges for not saving water, then farmers may choose not to engage
    in water-saving practices. (II)If , , , then the stable evolution strategy of
    the system is . From the government''s perspective, if the total subsidies and
    supervision costs provided to WSSCs using TMS are lower than the sum of subsidies,
    supervision costs, and collaborative incentive costs when using BTS, then the
    government will choose to use TMS. Additionally, if the difference between income
    from other purposes and the obtained subsidy is larger than the investment in
    water-saving technology, WSSCs are more likely to invest in water-saving. While,
    for farmers, if the sum of income for water-saving, charges not saving water,
    sharing benefits from water rights trading is larger than that of charges saving
    water, income not saving water, then farmers are inclined to engage in water-saving
    activities. (III) If , , , then the stable evolution strategy of the system is
    . It is evident that if the profitability of using TMS is lower than that of using
    BTS, the government will choose to use BTS. For WSSCs, if the disparity between
    their income from other purposes and the penalty incurred by not investing in
    water-saving technology is less than the difference between the water-saving investment
    and the obtained subsidy, they would choose not to invest in water-saving technology.
    Similarly, for farmers, if the total of income for not water-saving, additional
    costs for water-saving is larger than that of the penalty incurred by not water-saving,
    income for water-saving, sharing benefits from water rights trading, and charges
    for not water-saving, then farmers will decide against engaging in water-saving
    practices. (IV)If , , , then the stable evolution strategy of the system is .
    It is evident that when the profitability of using TMS is lower than that of using
    BTS, the government will select to use BTS. Additionally, if the total of the
    obtained subsidy, the punishment resulting from not investing in water-saving,
    and the sharing benefits from collaborative incentive is smaller than that of
    the income for other purposes, the income for investing water-saving, then WSSC
    would not invest technology to water saving. While, for farmer, if the total of
    income for not water-saving, additional costs for water-saving, charges for water-saving
    is lower than that of charges for not water-saving, sharing benefits from water
    rights trading, income for water-saving, sharing punishment due to not water-saving,
    then farmers will choose to implement water-saving. (V) If , , , then the stable
    evolution strategy of the system is . For the government, if the profitability
    of using TMS is lower than that of using BTS, it will choose to utilize BTS. In
    contrast, for WSSC, if the total of the income for other purposes, the water-saving
    investment is lower than that of the obtained subsidy and the punishment incurred
    from not investing water-saving, sharing benefits from collaborative incentive,
    then the WSSCs would invest in water-saving technology. As for farmers, they will
    decide to implement water-saving practices once the sum of charges for water-saving,
    income for not water-saving is lower than sharing benefits from collaborative
    incentive, income for water-saving, sharing benefits from water rights trading,
    charges for not water-saving. Based on the foregoing analysis, it can be concluded
    that the usage of BT in the evolutionary game of agricultural water-saving management
    provides a theoretical foundation for the government, WSSCs and farmers to apply
    BT to make informed strategic decisions. Firstly, BT empowers agricultural water-saving
    management, primarily through the imposition of default costs on defaulting parties.
    This mechanism fosters varying degrees of healthy cooperation among all stakeholders
    to varying degrees. Second, the adoption of BT, along with the associated additional
    default costs, acts as a deterrent, compelling WSSCs and farmers to actively engage
    in water-saving practices. Finally, the magnitude of additional default costs
    of utilizing BT has emerged as the principal determinant in the government''s
    choice between BTS and TMS. The government''s inclination towards the usage of
    BTS increases as the additional default costs decreases. 3.3.5. Analysis of the
    evolutionary equilibrium of system for key parameters Based on the analysis of
    the evolutionary equilibrium results, there are two problems to be addressed.
    One is the appropriate balance of providing subsidy and imposing penalties for
    non-compliance by the government, the other is how the government distributes
    the subsidy between the farmers and WSSCs and also the penalties among the farmers
    and the WSSCs. To deal with these problems, the key parameters will be examined
    using the numerical simulation, where the parameters includes the punishment sharing
    coefficient, the magnitude of punishment, and the subsidy provided by the government.
    (I) The influence of the punishment sharing coefficient on evolutionary equilibrium
    of the system I) The influence of the punishment sharing coefficient on evolutionary
    equilibrium of the system when the government chooses the BTS strategy. According
    to the analysis of evolutionary equilibrium strategies, it is shown that, if ,
    , , then the point is a stable evolution point of the system. That is, for this
    case, the government choices the BTS strategy, the WSSCs and the farmers do not
    engage in water-saving practices. It can be seen that, under this circumstances,
    the values of the punishment sharing coefficient within can ensure the stability
    of the system, in which the condition should be satisfied. That is, if the incomes
    of the WSSCs and farmers are larger than their costs when they all do not engage
    in water-waving, they naturally do not engage in water-saving practices. To examine
    the changes in the punishment sharing coefficient , three functions are first
    set, they are , and , respectively, and their graphs are shown in Fig. 2. From
    Fig. 2, the intersection point of two straight lines and is point , in which .
    Similarly, the point is the intersection point of two straight lines and , where
    . Since the punishment sharing coefficient satisfies , two cases should be considered:
    , and . For the case , the values of the punishment sharing coefficient within
    region I and region II can ensure the stability of the system. At this time, the
    WSSCs'' incomes when they invest in water-saving are larger than the subsidy provided
    by the government. And, for the case , the intersection point of two straight
    lines and is changed as the point , and the values of the punishment sharing coefficient
    within region I can ensure the stability of the system. Now, the WSSCs’ incomes
    when they do not invest in water-saving are smaller than the subsidy provided
    by the government. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download : Download

    case , the values of the punishment sharing coefficient within region I and region
    II can ensure the stability of the system. That is, the farmers’ incomes when
    they engage in water-saving practice are larger than the incomes when they do
    not engage in water-saving practice. And for the case , the intersection point
    of two straight lines and is changed as the point , and the values of the punishment
    sharing coefficient within region I can ensure the stability of the system. At
    this time, the incomes of farmers when they engage in water-saving practices are
    smaller than those when they do not engage in water-saving practices. II)The influence
    of the punishment sharing coefficient on evolutionary equilibrium of the system
    when the government chooses the TMS strategy. Similar discussions in Case I) are
    carried out in the following context. According to the analysis of evolutionary
    equilibrium strategies, it is shown that, if the conditions , and are satisfied,
    the point is a stable evolution point of the system. That is, for this case, the
    government chooses TMS strategy, the WSSCs invest in water-saving and the farmers
    do not engage in water-saving. It can be seen that, under this circumstances,
    the values of the punishment sharing coefficient within can ensure the stability
    of the system, in which the condition should be satisfied. At this time, the incomes
    of WSSCs when they invest in water-saving practices are larger than those of when
    they do not invest in water-saving practices, and the incomes of farmers who do
    not engage in water-saving practices are larger than those who engage in water-saving
    practices. First, three functions are set, which are , and , respectively, as
    shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4, since the punishment sharing coefficient satisfies
    , two cases should be considered: and . For the case , the values of the punishment
    sharing coefficient within region I and region II can ensure the stability of
    the system. At this time, the incomes of WSSCs from their investment in water-saving
    practices are smaller than those resulting from their contrary water-saving behaviors,
    and the incomes of farmers when they do not engage in water-saving practices are
    smaller than those when they actively engage in water-saving. Download : Download

    region of the punishment sharing coefficient when the government choose to TMS.
    And, for the case , the intersection point of two straight lines and is changed
    as the point , and the values of the punishment sharing coefficient within region
    I can ensure the stability of the system. Under this situation, the incomes of
    Water-Saving Support Centers (WSSCs) when they do not invest in water-saving practices
    are relatively smaller than those when they invest in water-saving practices,
    and the incomes of farmers when they engage in water-saving practices are relatively
    smaller than those when they do not engage in water-saving practices. The above
    discussions hold for this case , and the similar discussions for the situation
    and will not be repeated here. Based on the above analysis, the punishment sharing
    coefficient set by the government is the basis to allocate punishments between
    WSSCs and farmers, whose objective is to ensure the evolutionary equilibrium of
    system. From the discussions on the changes of the punishment sharing coefficient
    under the government''s different supervision choices, it can be seen that the
    setting of the punishment sharing coefficient should take into account the benefits
    and costs of the WSSCs or farmers in water-saving practices, and encourage them
    to actively participate in water-saving while also ensuring their benefits. (II)
    The influence of the punishments and subsidies from the government on evolutionary
    equilibrium of the system I) The influence of the punishments and subsidies on
    evolutionary equilibrium of the system when the government chooses TMS. According
    to the analysis of evolutionary equilibrium strategies, it is shown that, if the
    conditions , and are satisfied, then the point is a stable evolution point of
    the system. For this case, the government chooses TMS, the WSSCs invest in water-saving
    and the farmers do not engage in water-saving. It can be seen that, under this
    circumstances, the punishment and subsidy from the government to the WSSCs satisfying
    the condition can ensure the stability of the system, and the conditions and should
    be met, simultaneously. At this time, the subsidy provided by the government choosing
    TMS is smaller than that provided by the government choosing BTS, and the punishment
    to the WSSCs from the government is smaller the WSSCs’ costs when they do not
    invest in water-saving. To examine the influence of the punishment and subsidy
    from the government on the evolutionary equilibrium of the system, let the function
    be , where and . And the graph of the function is shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5,
    it is denoted as that , and . Since , three cases should be considered: , and
    . For the case , such as , the punishment and the subsidy satisfying the relationship
    within regions I, II, III and IV can ensure the stability of the system. And,
    for the case , the point is changed as , the punishment and the subsidy satisfying
    the relationship within regions I and II can ensure the stability of the system.
    The last case means that the punishment and the subsidy satisfying the relationship
    within regions I, II and III can ensure the stability of the system. These cases
    show that the WSSCs'' and farmers’ net profits are one of the important basis
    for the government balancing the relationship between the punishment and the subsidy
    in water-saving management. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download

    between the punishments and the subsidies can be obtained from the evolutionary
    equilibrium strategies in Subsection 3.3.4, which will not be repeated here. II)
    The influence of the punishments and subsidies on evolutionary equilibrium of
    the system when the government choose BTS. According to the analysis of evolutionary
    equilibrium strategies, it is shown that, if the conditions , , are satisfied,
    then the point is a stable point of the system. Under this situation, the government
    chooses BTS, the WSSCs do not invest in water-saving and the farmers engage in
    water-saving. It can be seen that, under this circumstances, the punishment and
    subsidy to the WSSCs from the government satisfying the condition can ensure the
    stability of the system, and the condition should be satisfied. At this time,
    the punishment to the WSSCs provided by the government, when the farmers engage
    in water-saving practice, is larger than the difference between the costs of the
    government''s different strategic choice in water-saving management. To examine
    the influence of the punishment and subsidy from the government on the evolutionary
    equilibrium of the system, let the function be , in which . And the graph of the
    function is shown in Fig. 6. Two cases are considered: and . For the case as shown
    in Fig. 6(a), it is denoted as , . Since , such as , the punishment and the subsidy
    satisfying the relationship within regions I can ensure the stability of the system.
    And for the case as shown in Fig. 6(b), it is obviously that , . If , such as
    , then the punishment and the subsidy satisfying the relationship within regions
    III can ensure the stability of the system. Conversely, if , the position of changes
    to the left of , and the punishment and the subsidy satisfying the relationship
    within regions II and III can ensure the stability of the system. Download : Download

    more discussions on the relationship between the punishments and the subsidies
    when the government chooses BTS can be obtained from the evolutionary equilibrium
    strategies in Subsection 3.3.4, which will not also be repeated here. Based on
    the above analysis, the punishment and subsidy set by the government needs to
    be within a certain range, and there is a certain correlation between them, and
    they cannot be considered separately. From the discussions on the influence of
    the punishments and subsidies from the government on evolutionary equilibrium
    of the system, balancing the relationship between the punishment and the subsidy
    plays an important role in water-saving management. Meanwhile, the amount of punishment
    or subsidy is also related to several factors, such as the WSSCs'' and farmers’
    benefits and costs. 4. Case study analysis and discussions To verify the reliability
    of the game model and the validity of the conclusions drawn, a case study will
    be conducted, and numerical simulations using MATLAB will be carried out. The
    case study will focus on the comprehensive reform demonstration project for modern
    water-saving agriculture in City A, which involves a total investment of 106 million
    CNY. The project encompasses various elements, including intelligent water and
    fertilizer integrated drip irrigation facilities covering an area of approximately
    4000 hm2, an automatic monitoring system, and a supporting “service network” system
    for project management and operation. It also includes the operation and maintenance
    of water-saving irrigation pipelines and integrated water and fertilizer management.
    The primary source of income for WSSC stems from providing services related to
    water and fertilizer integration technology, water rights trading, government
    subsidies, and other related activities. The government, meanwhile, regulates
    the water-saving behavior of both WSSCs and farmers and imposes strict penalties
    if farmers fail to conserve water. In the subsequent sections, different application
    scenarios will be explored utilizing the constructed model based on the numerical
    simulation. 4.1. Numerical simulation and discussions According to the analysis
    of the stable evolution strategy of the system in Subsection 3.3.4, it can be
    seen that the usage of BT and the associated additional default costs serve as
    a key role for all stakeholders’ practices in water-saving management. This section
    mainly considers the influence of the factors induced by them on the system evolution
    strategy, which includes three aspects: punishment sharing coefficient, punishment
    and subsidy from the government. (I)The influence of the punishment sharing coefficient
    allocated to the WSSCs on the system evolution strategy is analyzed In accordance
    with the system evolution and stability strategy, if the social benefits for the
    government using BTS are greater than those using TMS, then the government will
    choose to utilize BTS. Conversely, the government will choose to utilize TMS.
    In this case, both WSSCs and farmers will be punished in a certain proportion
    once they do not implement water-saving practices, which reflects the binding
    effect on their water-saving behaviors in the water-saving process. For the special
    cases where and , it means that all the punishment will be borne solely by either
    WSSCs or farmers. And the punishment will be shared between both parties, when
    the punishment sharing coefficient satisfies . Additionally, from the income matrix,
    it can be seen that as the punishment sharing coefficient increases, the income
    of WSSCs decreases while that for farmers increases. Meanwhile, from the stability
    strategies of the system, it is shown that there are two stability strategies
    and , respectively, when conditions , , and are satisfied accordingly. As shown
    in Fig. 7(a) and (b), for different punishment sharing coefficients , the system
    remains stable. Furthermore, it is noticeable that the system exhibits slower
    evolution speed for smaller values of , and the evolution speed gradually accelerates
    with the increase of . Download : Download high-res image (424KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. The influence of the punishment sharing coefficient between
    WSSCs and farmers on the system evolution strategy. This aligns with the practical
    scenario. Generally, a smaller value of indicates a relatively significant punishment
    for farmer, which naturally diminishes their enthusiasm. However, as the punishment
    for WSSCs increases, it leads to an increase in farmers'' enthusiasm for water-saving
    practices. Therefore, the government needs to find a suitable punishment sharing
    coefficient to really stimulate WSSCs and farmers. Similar to previous studies
    (Chen et al., 2023; Li, 2022), when the WSSCs and farmers don''t implement water-saving
    practice, both of them will be punished by the government. However, comparison
    to the existing literature, a binding punishment mechanism is designed in water-saving
    game modeling, in which the WSSCs and farmers are regarded as a community of interests,
    and one party of them without water-saving would bring losses to the interests
    of the other party. Promoting the joint water-saving by both parties is one of
    the biggest highlight in this study, which is different from other previous research.
    (II)The influence of the government punishment on system evolution strategy under
    the cases of the farmers'' different water-saving practices. When the WSSC do
    not invest in water-saving, the government will imposed different degrees of punishments
    based on whether farmers engage in water-saving or not, which are denoted as and
    , respectively. In practical terms, even if the WSSCs do not invest in water-saving,
    it will also reduce the water pollution if farmers prefer to engage in water-saving.
    Naturally, the punishment on the WSSC should also be appropriately reduced, which
    reflects the effect of the government''s effort to bind the benefits of both the
    WSSCs and the farmers in the water-saving process. From the stability strategy
    analysis of the system, the farmers either choose water-saving or choose not water-saving,
    assuming the government utilizes BTS and WSSCs do not invest in water-saving,
    respectively. The evolutionary stability strategies of the system are and , respectively.
    As shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), the behavior strategies of farmers regarding water-saving
    are influenced by the difference between and . When the difference is relatively
    small, the system has evolutionary stability strategies and . Download : Download
    high-res image (382KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. The influence
    of the difference between different punishment to farmers on the evolutionary
    stability strategies of the system. When there is a significant difference in
    the punishment, the system lacks a stable strategy. This is due to the shared
    nature of the punishment between farmers and WSSCs. If the imposed punishment
    on WSSCs is excessively high, it also increases the penalty for farmers, which
    in turn discourages them from actively choosing water-saving practices. Under
    the binding punishment mechanism aimed at promoting mutual water-saving behaviors
    between WSSCs and farmers, this phenomenon indicates the necessity for the government
    to establish a reasonable punishment mechanism. Such a mechanism should encourage
    collective water-saving efforts without diminishing the enthusiasm of either party
    due to non-compliance. Similarly, when the government utilizes TMS, similar discussions
    as mentioned above apply. Similar to previous studies Mattoussi and Mattoussi
    (2022), when the punishment from the government is strong, the stakeholders''
    water-saving behaviors by is more likely to occur. However, different from the
    existing literature, this study investigates, when one party makes a behavior
    choice, the impact of the difference of the punishments from government under
    the other party''s different water-saving behaviors on the stakeholders'' water-saving
    behaviors, which is another one of the biggest highlight in this study. (III)The
    influence of the government subsidizes on the evolutionary stability of the system
    under the cases of the farmers'' different water-saving practices. To establish
    a strong binding effect on water-saving behaviors between WSSCs and farmers, the
    government provides subsidies to the WSSCs based on whether the farmers engage
    in water-saving or not. In practical terms, when farmers implement water-saving
    practices, the subsidy given to the WSSCs should be higher than the case of farmers
    do not choose to engage in water-saving. It can effectively incentive WSSCs and
    farmers to jointly water-saving. From the stability strategy analysis of the system,
    it is evident that farmers have two strategic choices: saving water and not saving
    water, when the government is assume to choose BTS or TMS and the WSSCs are assumed
    to invest in water-saving, respectively. The evolutionary stable points of the
    system are and , respectively. When the government chooses TMS and BTS, the farmers
    either choose to engage in water-saving or not. As shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b),
    the subsidies to the WSSCs provided by the government are larger when farmers
    engage in water-saving than the case of farmers do not engage in water-saving.
    The subsidy from the government indirectly affects and constrains the farmers''
    decision-making for their water-saving behaviors. Download : Download high-res

    difference between different government subsidizes to WSSCs on the evolutionary
    stability strategies of the system. When examining the influence of the difference
    between government subsidies for farmers'' water-saving behaviors on the evolutionary
    stability of the system, an interesting finding emerges: when the difference is
    either too large or too small, there is no stable strategy in the system, as illustrated
    in Fig. 10(a) and (b). This occurs due to the consideration of WSSCs regarding
    the cost of supervising farmers'' water-saving efforts, coupled with the reduction
    of government subsidies when farmers do not engage in water-saving. The binding
    effect between WSSCs and farmers is primarily limited to supervision. If the punishment
    imposed on the WSSCs is too severe, it may diminish their enthusiasm to supervise
    the farmers, and in extreme cases, they may even abandon supervision altogether.
    This emphasizes the importance for the government to establish an appropriate
    subsidy mechanism, which goes beyond merely implementing binding subsidies. The
    subsidy mechanism should also consider the original intention of promoting collective
    water-saving practices as a means of fostering collaboration among stakeholders.

    Fig. 10. The influence of the too large difference between different government
    subsidizes to WSSCs on the evolutionary stability strategies of the system. Similar
    to previous studies (Chen and Cheung, 2021), when the subsidy from the government
    can promote the stakeholders'' water-saving behaviors. However, different from
    the existing literature, this study focuses on that the degree of subsidy provided
    by the government to WSSCs is related to the farmers'' water-saving behaviors.
    And this study mainly focuses on the impact of the difference of the subsidies
    from the government under the farmers'' different water-saving behaviors on the
    WSSCs’ water-saving behaviors, which is the third one of the biggest highlight
    in this study. To sum up, this study applies evolutionary game theory to analyze
    the decision-making of the behaviors about the government, WSSCs and farmers in
    agricultural water-saving games. The analysis reveals that the additional default
    costs associated with BTS have a deterrent effect on both WSSCs and farmers, prompting
    them to actively embrace water-saving practices. The findings of this study can
    be summarized as follows: (I)The magnitude of the punishment sharing coefficient
    in the binding punishment mechanism significantly impacts the punishment faced
    by farmers and their enthusiasm for water-saving. A smaller coefficient results
    in greater punishment for farmers and diminished enthusiasm for water-saving.
    Conversely, as the punishment for WSSCs increase, farmers become more enthusiastic
    about implementing water-saving practices. (II) For a relatively large difference
    in punishment, there is no stable evolutionary strategy. Since both of the WSSCs
    and farmers are punished in the binding punishment mechanism, the government should
    establish a reasonable punishment mechanism. The mechanism would encourage their
    collective water-saving efforts without dampening the enthusiasm of either party
    for compliance with regulations. (III) Government subsidies play a role in promoting
    water-saving behaviors among WSSCs and farmers, and the difference of subsidies
    for the WSSCs under the farmers’ different water-saving behaviors cannot be too
    large or too small. The government should design a suitable subsidy mechanism
    to stimulate both of the WSSCs and farmers to engage in water-saving behaviors.
    Based on the above analysis, this study analyzes the evolutionary laws of all
    stakeholders'' water-saving behaviors, whose findings enrich the theoretical bases
    for the agricultural water-saving management and provide the theoretical references
    for the decision-making processes of policy-makers. Compared with the existing
    literature (Chen et al., 2023; Chen and Cheung, 2021; Kampas et al., 2012; Li,
    2022; Qu et al., 2021), they mainly focuses on the assessing the impact of raising
    water prices on the agricultural water-saving (Kampas et al., 2012; Qu et al.,
    2021), the optimal timing of government subsidies and internal incentives for
    promoting on agricultural water-saving (Chen and Cheung, 2021), the impact of
    taxation schemes on the innovation of agricultural water-saving technology (Chen
    et al., 2023), and the influencing factors of the agricultural water-saving, including
    water fee collection, water-saving policy publicity, water resource dependence,
    etc (Li, 2022). In contrast to these studies, this study focuses more on the impact
    of the subsidies and punishments from the government on various stakeholders''
    water-saving behaviors, in which the differences of subsidies and punishments
    under the WSSCs'' or farmers’ different water-saving behaviors are the highlight
    factor considered in this game modeling and few research do this. 4.2. Implications
    One of the main challenges in agricultural water-saving practices is to find an
    appropriate balance between the costs and benefits associated with various stakeholders.
    Through a comparative analysis of the evolutionary patterns of water-saving behaviors
    under varying conditions, this study obtained some reliable and robust results.
    The results show that government subsidies and penalties, as well as the costs
    and benefits of stakeholders, are the fundamental drivers for them to implement
    water-saving behaviors. Meanwhile, the government should establish a collaborative
    punishment mechanism to encourage WSSCs and farmers to jointly implement water-saving
    behaviors to pursuit the sustainable agricultural water-saving practices. Therefore,
    there are some management and policy implications are as follows: (I)From the
    government''s perspective, to promote water-saving practices among WSSCs and farmers,
    the government should establish an effective punishment sharing mechanism. One
    of the critical considerations is that the coefficient for sharing punishments
    between WSSCs and farmers should be carefully considered. Smaller coefficients
    result in reduced enthusiasm among farmers due to greater punishment, while larger
    coefficients increase their motivation. Enhancing the supervision mechanism through
    BT is crucial. This involves the integration of costs, transaction data, and water-saving
    information onto a blockchain platform for the comprehensive, closed-loop supervision,
    thereby improving oversight accuracy and efficiency. By implementing these strategies,
    the government can effectively incentivize water-saving behaviors and cultivate
    a sustainable water management system. Moreover, it is imperative for the government
    to establish a collaborative punishment mechanism that incentivizes both WSSCs
    and farmers to jointly embrace water-saving practices. It should not only concentrate
    on penalizing individual parties for non-compliance but also reflect the efficacy
    of collaborative incentives. By implementing a fair and binding system of punishments,
    the government can foster a sense of shared responsibility and encourage active
    engagement in water-saving practices, which ensures that the punishment mechanism
    serves as a cooperative incentive rather than discouraging participation. (II)
    From the perspective of the WSSCs, cost should be reduced since it is one of the
    key factors affecting the profitability of WSSCs. In the agricultural water-saving
    industry, WSSCs confront substantial internal cost pressures and must seek viable
    solutions to curtail the input costs associated with water-saving technologies.
    To get the best results from water-saving behaviors, the WSSCs must ensure that
    they work with government policy support and subsidies or partners to conserve
    water. Obviously, WSSCs can obtain the most profits only through the improvement
    of management level and the reduction of management cost. However, the construction
    and promotion of water-saving facilities need to consume a lot of costs, such
    as raw material cost, construction cost, operation and maintenance cost, management
    cost and so on. Therefore, WSSCs should reduce the investment and production costs
    of water-saving facilities through innovations in management practices and operation
    maintenance. (III) From the perspective of water-saving management and governance
    policies, the following policy recommendations are suggested. Firstly, there should
    be more stringent regulations governing water use and protection. It is important
    to develop scientific and effective policies, systems, and technical standards
    for water-saving management, while concurrently promoting the widespread adoption
    of advanced and practical water-saving equipment, processes, technologies, and
    products. Secondly, the reasonable and binding punishment mechanism should be
    established and implemented. The government should design appropriate subsidy
    policies for water-saving based on the specific circumstances and encourage active
    participation in water-saving practices by all stakeholders. Thirdly, the WSSCs
    should be encouraged to actively engage in agricultural water-saving practices,
    and even implement water-saving management in public institutions and buildings
    (Chen and Cheung, 2021). Overall, it is necessary to establish and strengthen
    governance policies for water conservation management, cultivate and support enterprises
    with professional capabilities, effective water-saving processes, and technological
    improvements. Encouraging their active participation in implementing water conservation
    practices is crucial. 5. Conclusions and future research The shortage of water
    resources presents a significant constraint on economic and social development
    (Jiang et al., 2022). Through analyzing the logical characteristics of water-saving
    behaviors among the government, WSSCs and farmers, this study scrutinizes the
    “multi-directional” influence exerted by various stakeholders and their impact
    on incentives for conserving agricultural water resources, utilizing an evolutionary
    game model. This analysis holds immense significance for both current and future
    agricultural water resource management. 5.1. Conclusions The main findings of
    this study are as follows. Firstly, the punishment sharing coefficient for the
    WSSCs significantly influences the system''s evolutionary stability. A relatively
    small punishment sharing coefficient will lead to a relatively large punishment
    for farmers, which can reduce their enthusiasm. Conversely, increased punishment
    for the WSSCs can enhance farmers'' motivation. Secondly, when the WSSCs adopt
    water-saving behaviors, the government''s punishment towards WSSCs differs significantly
    depending on farmers save water or not. This lack of consistency in punishments
    creates instability in the system as farmers share the punishment with WSSCs.
    Excessive punishment for WSSCs can discourage farmers from embracing water-saving
    practices. Thirdly, when WSSCs adopt water-saving behaviors, imbalances in government
    subsidies based on whether farmers save water or not can also hinder the emergence
    of a stable strategy. WSSCs must consider the cost of motivating farmers to save
    water, and government subsidies would decrease if farmers fail to adopt water-saving
    practices. The results mentioned above highlight the importance of finding a balance
    in punishment sharing coefficients and government subsidies to establish an effective
    and stable agricultural water-saving system. The main contributions of this study
    are as follows. (I) It establishes an innovative framework that integrates BT
    into the behaviors of government, WSSCs, and farmers. This framework uncovers
    the internal mechanisms influencing agricultural water-saving behaviors. By transforming
    the issue into a multi-party strategic decision-making process, it broadens our
    perspectives and approaches for addressing water conservation challenges in agriculture.
    (II) A dynamic game model is developed among the government, WSSCs, and farmers.
    This model ensures a balance of interests among stakeholders involved in the agricultural
    water-saving process. It also enhances operational and management mechanisms for
    water-saving practices in agriculture. Additionally, it provides a valuable theoretical
    reference for decision-making behaviors of all stakeholders in the agricultural
    water-saving industry. However, there are still some limitations in this study.
    Firstly, the research is based on theoretical modeling using simulated data for
    numerical analysis. Fortunately, given the increasing attention to the actual
    characteristics of practices in the agricultural water conservation industry and
    the relationships among various stakeholders, the findings of this study remain
    robust enough to provide valuable insights and policy implications for agricultural
    water conservation management. Secondly, the cost of utilizing blockchain supervision
    in this study is generally by defined a single variable without further subdivision.
    It does not account for additional costs such as the significant energy consumption
    associated with blockchain usage or the expenses involved in purchasing blockchain
    services. Furthermore, the ecological costs and efficiency associated with agricultural
    water conservation are not comprehensively addressed in terms of overall effectiveness.
    5.2. Future research While this study provides valuable insights into agricultural
    water-saving, there remain avenues for further exploration in future research.
    The dynamic nature of the game process involving the government, WSSCs, and farmers
    implies that their behaviors and strategies evolve throughout the water-saving
    process. Future research should incorporate additional influential factors that
    align with ongoing socio-economic development, thereby enriching existing game
    models to effectively address practical challenges. From a practical perspective,
    it is imperative for the government to consider regional variations, disparities
    in political system, and other relevant factors when establishing a reasonable
    mechanism for punishments and subsidies that suits local conditions. Institutional
    innovation through supervision, reward, and punishment should empower the government
    to modify game rules, reinforcing positive incentives, and promoting mutual cooperation
    among stakeholders. Moreover, the cost of the government''s utilizing blockchain
    technology supervision in this study is defined by a single variable without further
    subdivision. It also has not been accounted for additional costs, such as the
    significant energy consumption associated with blockchain usage or the expenses

  description: Crop rotation is one strategy for adapting agroecosystems to a framework
    that balances ecological diversity, sustainability, and food production. The Sacramento
    Valley, one of the most productive rice growing regions in the US, faces sustainability
    challenges including increasing herbicide resistant weed pressure and water use
    restrictions. Increasing crop diversity may help address these challenges, but
    this region has unique soil attributes including high clay content, salinity,
    alkalinity, and cemented subsurface layers, and the degree to which these soil
    properties influence crop rotation decisions remain unclear. The objectives of
    this study were to quantify the extent of crop rotation in this region, compare
    soil properties for rotated and continuous rice fields, and assess the potential
    for expanding rotations based on the geographic coverage of influential soil variables.
    Using satellite derived land cover data for 2007–2021, our analysis shows that
    only ∼5000 ha are in rotation with rice, while 220,000 ha are in continuous rice
    production. This land cover information is fused with SSURGO soil maps in a spatial
    random forest model. The modeling approach indicates that fields with soil pH
    between 6.5 and 8, EC between 0.5 and 2 (ds m-1), and saturated hydraulic conductivity
    less than 2 (μm s-1) are more likely to be rotated. However, we estimate that
    only 11% of the continuous rice area has all three of these soil properties combined,
    suggesting soil limitations are an important constraint. This research highlights
    a method for evaluating land use decisions in relation to spatial variability
    of soil properties to better understand barriers to agroecological diversification.

    Soil properties of continuous and rotated rice fields in California were assessed
    using remote sensing and soil survey information. • The region has a high diversity
    of crop types but rotation with rice occurs in a limited portion. • Soil properties
    may limit the feasibility of expanding crop rotations in this region. Abstract
    Crop rotation is one strategy for adapting agroecosystems to a framework that
    balances ecological diversity, sustainability, and food production. The Sacramento
    Valley, one of the most productive rice growing regions in the US, faces sustainability
    challenges including increasing herbicide resistant weed pressure and water use
    restrictions. Increasing crop diversity may help address these challenges, but
    this region has unique soil attributes including high clay content, salinity,
    alkalinity, and cemented subsurface layers, and the degree to which these soil
    properties influence crop rotation decisions remain unclear. The objectives of
    this study were to quantify the extent of crop rotation in this region, compare
    soil properties for rotated and continuous rice fields, and assess the potential
    for expanding rotations based on the geographic coverage of influential soil variables.
    Using satellite derived land cover data for 2007–2021, our analysis shows that
    only ∼5000 ha are in rotation with rice, while 220,000 ha are in continuous rice
    production. This land cover information is fused with SSURGO soil maps in a spatial
    random forest model. The modeling approach indicates that fields with soil pH
    between 6.5 and 8, EC between 0.5 and 2 (ds m-1), and saturated hydraulic conductivity
    less than 2 (μm s-1) are more likely to be rotated. However, we estimate that
    only 11% of the continuous rice area has all three of these soil properties combined,
    suggesting soil limitations are an important constraint. This research highlights
    a method for evaluating land use decisions in relation to spatial variability
    of soil properties to better understand barriers to agroecological diversification.

    Increased crop rotation is being explored as one potential solution to global
    challenges in agricultural sustainability (Altieri, 2015, Cabell and Oelofse,
    2012). Rice (Oryza sativa L.), the main staple food for nearly half the world’s
    population (Awika, 2011, F.A.O, 2019, Yuan, 2021), is often grown in continuous
    cropping systems supporting one to three rice crops per year. Continuous flooded
    rice production can maintain high productivity due to biological and chemical
    soil processes unique to flooded agricultural soils (Pampolino, 2008, Cassman
    and Pingali, 1995, Waha, 2020, Bronson et al., 1998). However, there are agricultural
    sustainability challenges for modern continuous rice systems. To support these
    challenges, diversifying rice-based cropping systems with non-flooded crops is
    being explored in different contexts (Baste, 2021, Cassman and Grassini, 2020,
    Horton et al., 2021). In California, rice production is concentrated in the Sacramento
    Valley, where it is grown on approximately 210,000 ha (USDA - NASS, 2021). California
    is the second largest rice growing state in the US, with some of the highest rice
    yields in the world (Hill et al., 2006). However, the long-term viability of the
    California rice industry is threatened by a number of challenges including increasing
    weed pressure and water scarcity (Hanson, 2014, Gebremichael et al., 2021). California
    rice has the highest number of herbicide resistant weed species of any other crop
    or region in the U.S. (Hanson et al., 2014). Also, populations of new weed species,
    such as weedy rice (also known as red rice), are evolving a suite of phenotypic
    traits that closely resemble cultivated rice, making them particularly difficult
    to manage (De Leon et al., 2019). Droughts across the Western US have led to severe
    water shortages, including water restrictions for growers (Hanak and Ellen, 2019,
    Gebremichael et al., 2021). Gebremichael et al. (2021) found that fallow land
    across California’s Central Valley tripled during drought years due to water use
    restrictions. In four of the last 10 years, during periods of severe drought,
    rice acreage declined leading to widespread fallowing throughout the rice growing
    region (USDA, 2020). Drought conditions are expected to increase in frequency
    and severity due to climate change (Cayan et al., 2010), and alternative cropping
    system strategies are needed to maintain agricultural sustainability. Diversifying
    the number of crops grown in the region could be an important component of integrated
    weed management strategies and has potential benefits for water conservation.
    Rotations can be part of integrated weed management strategies by allowing for
    the use of different modes of herbicide action, and cultivation techniques and
    irrigation systems that are different from those used in typical continuous rice
    systems and can target different weed species including pervasive aquatic weeds
    (Kayeke, 2017, Beckie, 2004, Brim-DeForest, 2017). Rice is one of the most water
    intensive California crops, behind almonds, pistachios, and alfalfa (Cody and
    Renee Johnson, 2015, Medellin-Azuara, 2022). Common alternative irrigated summer
    annual crops in the region such as processing tomatoes, dry beans, and safflower
    use 36%, 9.2%, and 3.4% the water that rice uses annually (Cody and Johnson, 2015).
    Rotating continuous rice with less water intensive annual crops could help maintain
    agricultural productivity while meeting water use restrictions. Despite the potential
    benefits of crop rotation for weed management and water conservation in rice systems,
    soil constraints may be a major limitation. Large portions of the Sacramento Valley
    are reclaimed wetlands that have soil properties that are suitable to flooded
    rice production but make crop rotation difficult (Hill et al., 2006). Previous
    studies have reported that more than half of the rice growing region is considered
    ‘rice only’, where production of other summer or winter crops is, due to properties
    of the soil, expected to fail due to poor yield and high input costs (Carter,
    1994, Hill et al., 2006). The remaining half of the region has been described
    as having limited rotation capability. Soil features such as floodplains, heavy
    clays, salinity and/or alkalinity, and cemented subsurface layers are widespread
    in the region and are perceived as major limitations to rotation (LaHue and Linquist,
    2021, Rosenberg et al., 2022, Hill et al., 2006). Some rice growers are successfully
    rotating rice with summer irrigated crops (tomatoes, corn, safflower, and dry
    beans), vetch and wheat as a winter annual crop, alfalfa, and other forages (Rosenberg
    et al., 2022), with most rotation occurring in a limited portion the Southern
    Sacramento Valley (Rosenberg et al., 2022, Carter, 1994). However, these evaluations
    of soil properties were not based on digital USDA-NRCS Soil Survey Maps, which
    offer the most detailed soil map data for the US (Soil Survey Staff, 2014), and
    the relative amount of rice area under some form of rotation is poorly quantified.
    Thus, there is an opportunity to explore the feasibility of rotations based on
    soil limitations using soil survey maps to determine the relationship between
    crop rotation decisions and soil properties. Machine learning methods are one
    potential approach for assessing the role of soil properties on future land use
    scenarios to improve natural resource management. Machine learnings models can
    be used to efficiently examine relationships between multiple, interacting soil
    parameters and their influence on different land use categories at large spatial
    scales. For example, these approaches have been used to predict crop rotation
    in the US Midwest (Socolar, 2021), to assess the potential for dryland agriculture
    in the High Plains region, USA (Deines et al., 2020), to identify floodplains
    at high resolution across the continental US (Woznicki et al., 2019), to simulate
    the conversion of grasslands to grain in the great plains (Olimb and Robinson,
    2019), and to predict future cropland expansion (Rashford et al., 2011). These
    studies illustrate the novel insights that can be gained by integrating land use
    maps with underlying soil properties in a machine learning framework. The overall
    goal of this study was to explore the potential for agroecological diversification
    of rice-based cropping systems based on a geospatial assessment of soil limitations.
    The method presented here uses land cover data, SSURGO soil data, and a spatial
    random forest model to identify key soil properties associated with continuous
    rice fields and rotated rice fields. The specific objectives were to: 1) quantify
    the total rice area under crop rotation and continuous rice; 2) evaluate differences
    in soil properties between rotated and continuous rice fields; and 3) estimate
    the potential continuous rice area that could support a high likelihood of rotations
    based on the most influential soil variables identified in random forest models.
    Results will help inform the feasibility of crop rotations as a tool for enhancing
    the long-term sustainability of California rice systems. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Data sources and processing 2.1.1. Land use data Land use maps for the Sacramento
    Valley were built by integrating the Crop Land Data Layer (CDL) with field boundary
    data provided by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). The CDL is
    a high resolution (30 m) national land cover data set that provides crop-level
    information on a yearly basis. The CDL is generated from Landsat satellite missions
    and developed by the United States Department of Agriculture/ National Agricultural
    Statistics Service (USDA/NASS) CropScape project (NASS CDL, 2022). The CDL includes
    up to 141 land use classes, 117 of which are agricultural. In California, the
    CDL is currently available from 2007 to 2021, and all years were used in this
    analysis. While the CDL is considered a powerful tool for understanding agricultural
    landscapes in the United States (Lark et al., 2017) it is still prone to uncertainties
    that result from land cover classification using satellite remote sensing data.
    To reduce these errors and improve overall accuracy, the CDL was integrated with
    a high accuracy land cover and field boundary data set provided by DWR (Verburg
    et al., 2011; Seo et al., 2014). The field boundary data set is prepared by LandIQ,
    a private mapping company based in Sacramento CA, and provided to the California
    DWR Regional Office Land Use office (DWR, 2022). The integration approach is as
    follows. Pixels, or portions of pixels, outside of field boundaries were excluded,
    managing errors where fields do not align with pixels, and where edge effects
    can influence acreage estimates (Lark et al., 2017). Within the field boundary,
    each field was reclassified as the dominant pixel type, mitigating errors where,
    for example, a few incorrect pixels are scattered across a rice field. Acreage
    estimates and change detection were performed on this reclassified, field level
    data set. After reclassifying all fields within the Sacramento Valley region,
    we limited the analysis to the rice growing area by selecting all the fields where
    the dominant class was rice in at least one year of the 15-year data set. In total
    there were 13,120 fields covering 268,950 ha. This region has a high diversity
    of annual and perennial crop types. To simplify our analysis and to increase accuracy
    (Lark et al., 2017), we grouped CDL crop classes together into eleven dominant
    groups. These groups are: rice, fallow, summer annual, winter annual, other annual,
    alfalfa, grasses, walnut, almond, other perennial, and other (See table S1 for
    a complete list of the CDL classes in each group). We used this data set to examine
    land use changes in the region including yearly changes in rice area, the acreage
    under rotation with rice, and the area that has been converted to perennial tree
    crops such as almonds and walnuts. To assess the accuracy of our custom data set,
    we compared our county level rice acreage estimates to NASS data (USDA - NASS,
    2020) for the eight major counties in the rice growing region. 2.1.2. Soil data
    Spatial soil information in this region was obtained from the Soil Survey Geographic
    Database (SSURGO) developed by NRCS (NRCS Soils, 2022). SSURGO data was accessed
    using the FedData package (Bocinsky, 2019), which downloads federal geospatial
    data directly from the internet and loads it into RStudio. A range of soil variables
    important to agricultural production were used in the preliminary data analyses
    including chemical properties (acidity, salinity, sodium adsorption ratio), physical
    properties (soil texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, linear extensibility),
    and general descriptors of soil type (soil order, soil series, irrigated capability
    class, or the presence of subsurface layers that are restrictive to root growth).
    For all numeric soil variables, a depth weighted average was computed across all
    horizons in the rooting zone (top 30 cm of the soil profile). In this process,
    horizons that start below 30 cm depth are excluded and the thickness of all remaining
    horizons is computed. A weighted mean for each numeric soil property was calculated
    by multiplying the soil property value from each horizon by the thickness of the
    horizon, summing the value for all horizons present, and dividing by the total
    depth (30 cm). This depth weighted average was then applied across the SSURGO
    map unit area, and field level averages were computed for each field in the study
    area. This process was conducted using the sf package in R (Pebesma, 2018). Categorical
    soil variables, such as soil order or irrigated capability class, have only one
    value per component and do not require a depth weighted average. For this data,
    the dominant soil component (largest percent composition within the map unit)
    was selected, and the location of each field’s centroid was used to determine
    the field level value. 2.2. Modelling process 2.2.1. Data preparation To compare
    soil properties of continuous rice fields and rotated rice fields, a binomial
    classification approach was used. For this approach, two classes were determined
    from the land cover data set: ‘continuous rice’ fields and ‘rotated rice’ fields.
    These two groups had strict criteria: Fields that were in rice at least 12 of
    the 15-year data set and were fallowed in the alternate years (i.e. never planted
    in a summer annual, winter annual, alfalfa, or grass) were considered ''continuous
    rice’ fields; Fields that were in rice at least seven years and were rotated with
    summer annual crops, winter annual crops, alfalfa, or grasses on at least two
    separate occasions were considered ‘rotated rice’ fields. We used these two categories
    to make a direct comparison between continuous rice fields and fields that are
    in rice almost half the time but also rotated with other crops. The core objective
    was to explore the potential for rotation in fields that are currently continuous
    rice, thus we set a medium requirement of years in rice for rotated fields rather
    than including fields that were predominantly other crops or not rotated with
    rice on two separate occasions. As a result, some rice fields were excluded from
    the model. Fields that were in rice 9 of the 15 years and other land uses the
    remaining years were placed into a distinct category called ‘rice + other’ (15.8%
    of total area). This includes fields that transitioned out of rice to urban uses,
    or fields that were fallowed and/or planted with other crops such as alfalfa or
    annuals only on a few occasions. Fields that were in annual crops (summer annuals,
    winter annuals, alfalfa, and grasses) 9 of the 15 years were considered ‘annual’
    (6.3% of total area). Fields that were frequently fallowed (9 of the 15 years)
    were considered ‘fallow’ (1.3% of total area). 2.2.2. Random forest After randomly
    splitting the data set into training and validation subsets (75% to train and
    25% to validate), a random forest classification model (Breiman, 2001) was trained
    to create a binary prediction for ‘continuous rice’ and ‘rotated rice’ based on
    soil variables. Random forest is an ensemble learning method that has recently
    become very popular because it combines the interpretability of decision trees
    with the performance of modern learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks
    and SVMs. Random forest models use multiple independently constructed decision
    trees, each with a unique bootstrap sample of the training data set, thus reducing
    the variance of single trees and improving prediction accuracy (Liaw and Wiener,
    2002; Wiener; Prasad et al., 2006). Furthermore, random forest models are efficient,
    insensitive to overfitting, and are relatively straight forward to implement (Belgiu
    and Drăgu, 2016). 2.2.3. Model assessment Following model training, model assessment
    was performed on our remaining validation data set. The primary objective was
    to correctly classify rotated fields within the rice area. Therefore, we examined
    classification accuracy using precision (P), recall (R), and F1 score of rotated
    fields. Precision is how often the classified product (rotated fields) is correct
    when compared to the source data set (Eq. (1)). Recall, also known as the hit
    rate, is how often the source dataset is correctly classified by the model (Eq.
    (2)). F1 measures classification accuracy of rotated fields by combining precision
    and recall using their harmonic mean (Eq. (3)). (1) (2) (3) Where Tp is the number
    of true positives (number of pixels correctly classified as rotated fields), Fp
    is the number of false positives (number of pixels incorrectly classified as rotated
    fields), and FN is the number of false negatives (number of pixels incorrectly
    classified as continuous rice fields). In our modelling process, the F1 score
    was used as the primary measure for model evaluation because it balances precision
    and recall. 2.2.4. Model set up In spatial data, observations that are relatively
    close tend to be more related to each other, which means that training and validation
    data sets are rarely independent, violating an important prerequisite of model
    building and leading to highly optimistic evaluations of predictive power (Arlot
    and Celisse, 2010, Ploton et al., 2020). Factors other than soil properties can
    influence the spatial distribution of crop rotation across a landscape, such as
    market distance, access to equipment, or economic factors. (Socolar et al., 2020;
    Rosenberg et al., 2022). One method to deal with spatial heterogeneity in is spatial
    cross validation. Spatially cross validated models of ecological data can have
    better performance at predicting error estimates and predicting to new data or
    predictor space, as well as for selecting causal predictors (Roberts, 2017). We
    used R’s ‘spatialsample’ package (Silge, 2021), to implement spatial cross validation.
    In summary, our training data was split into ten cross validation groups using
    k-means clustering of the field’s spatial coordinates. Next, model hyperparameters
    were defined and tuned. Because the model was assessed primarily with F1, these
    combinations of hyperparameter values were optimized for F1. F1 was static after
    a minimum of 150 trees, so 150 trees were used to ensure adequate trees for all
    models. To define the number of variables randomly selected as candidates at each
    split (mtries), and the minimum number of data points in a node that is required
    for the node to be split further (min _n), a hyperparameter grid search was performed
    with values from one to six and 20–40, respectively. Mtries = 3 and min _n = 31
    were selected based on the highest F1 score. Sampling strategy is another model
    parameter that can require careful calibration, especially when there is substantial
    class imbalance (Woznicki et al., 2019). In our binomial data set, continuous
    rice fields were 16-times more prevalent than rotated rice fields. Sampling strategies
    that adjust the prevalence of either class in the training data can affect precision
    and recall rates (Chen et al., 2004, Woznicki et al., 2019). Thus, we also optimized
    for F1 in our model tuning process. The minority class was up sampled randomly
    and at 10%, 20%, and 50% sampling ratios. The strategy using a 20% sampling ratio
    had the highest F1 score, so this strategy was used in the final model deployment.
    Woznicki et al. (2019) used this sampling strategy and similarly found that a
    20% sampling regime was optimal because of its higher recall. 2.2.5. Variable
    importance An important task in machine learning interpretation is to understand
    which predictor variables have the strongest influence on the predicted outcome.
    To accomplish this, a ranked order of variable importance in the classification
    model was determined using the permutation method based on AUC. In this method,
    AUC is computed for each tree after permuting each predictor variable (Greenwell
    et al., 2018). This method is considered more robust towards instances of class
    imbalance (Janitza et al., 2013). Variable importance was computed in R’s ‘vip’
    package (Greenwell et al., 2018). To improve interpretability, we pruned our set
    of predictor variables to reduce model complexity without compromising accuracy.
    Redundant soil variables were removed if they were highly correlated (r > 0.8).
    Moreover, if model predictions for a variable did not show clear patterns in partial
    dependence plots (explained below) and omission of this variable in the model
    did not affect F1 scores when evaluated on the validation data set, variables
    were removed. This included linear extensibility (%), cation exchange capacity
    (CEC), drainage class, the presence of a cemented layer, and the soil series name.
    The remaining set of soil variables used in the modeling process were pH, electrical
    conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), saturated hydraulic conductivity
    (Ksat), taxonomic soil order (soil order), and irrigated capability class (ICC)
    (see Table 1 for a complete description of these soil variables). Table 1. SSURGO
    predictor variables used in the modeling process. Variable name Type Description
    EC Continuous The electrical conductivity of an extract from saturated soil paste
    (ECe, ds m-1). EC represents the ability of a soil to conduct or attenuate electrical
    current. It is a metric reflecting the content of soluble salts in the soil matrix,
    also known as salinity or ion concentration. pH Continuous The negative logarithm
    to the base 10, of the hydrogen ion activity in the soil using the 1:1 soil-water
    ratio method. A numerical expression of the relative acidity or alkalinity of
    a soil sample. Ksat Continuous Saturated hydraulic conductivity The ease with
    which pores of a saturated soil transmit water (μm s-1); the amount of water that
    would move vertically through a unit area of saturated soil in unit time under
    unit hydraulic gradient. SAR Continuous Sodium adsorption Ratio A measure of the
    amount of sodium (Na) relative to calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in the water
    extract from saturated soil paste. Soils with high SAR values, say greater than
    13, may be characterized by an increased dispersion of organic matter and clay
    particles, reduced Ksat, and aeration, and a general degradation of soil structure.
    Soil Order Categorical Taxonomic soil order The highest level in the soil classification
    system where soils are grouped into twelve orders based on distinct soil characteristics
    and ecological significance. Soil orders are typically defined by a dominant characteristic
    affecting soils in that location including the type of prevalent vegetation, the
    type of parent material, climate variables that influence soil formation, the
    amount of physical and chemical weathering present, and/or the relative amount
    of soil profile development that has taken place. ICC Categorical Irrigated capability
    class Describes the general suitability of soils for most kinds of field crops
    where irrigation is used, including chemical, physical, and biological soil parameters.
    ICC values range from one to eight, and lower numbers indicate better growing
    conditions. For example, fields with ICC of two or less have few to moderate limitations
    that reduce the choice of plants that could be grown. While fields with ICC of
    three or greater require special conservation practices or have severe limitations
    that reduce the choice of plants. Throughout our model tuning process, variable
    importance scores were often tied or closely ranked. To establish a clear order
    of variable importance, the variable importance computation was executed 200 times
    across the training data, and the variables were ranked based on their mean effect
    on the AUC score. 2.2.6. Model application Once a subset of the important features
    was identified, expected target responses were computed while accounting for the
    average effect of the other predictors in the model. This produces a partial dependence
    plot (PDP), which is a method of visualizing the effect of each soil variable
    on the model outcome (yhat) (Hastie et al., 2009). PDPs were built in R’s ‘DALEXtra’
    package (Maksymium et al., 2020). PDPs were built for the three most important
    soil variables from the variable importance plot. Another primary objective was
    to estimate the area of continuous rice fields that have the soil features of
    a rotated rice field based on the three most important soil variables determined
    by the model. Rather than examining Fp, which can be heavily influenced by sampling
    schemes (i.e. up sampling or down sampling) (Woznicki et al., 2019), we developed
    a ‘manual approach’ using partial dependence data to determine thresholds, i.e.
    ranges for each of the three important soil variables supporting a higher likelihood
    of rotation. All continuous rice fields were then examined to determine how many
    of them met each of these three soil criteria, both individually and combined.
    For all the fields in each group, we computed the acreage (sum), and median predicted
    probability that the field is rotated (denoted as yhatm and shown as a percentage).
    This manual method allowed us to investigate how soil properties may act as a
    barrier to crop rotations and to quantify the acreage of continuous rice fields
    that have some of the properties of a rotated field. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Continuous rice and rotated rice According to our analysis, annual rice production
    area ranged from 227,000 to 161,000 ha, which is consistent with USDA reported
    acreage, and represents approximately 95% of California’s rice growing area (USDA
    NASS, 2020). Across the eight major counties in the growing area, agreement between
    our data set and USDA NASS acreage was strong (R2 = 0.99) and fell along the 1:1
    line (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (142KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. County-level agreement between NASS planted area and reclassified
    CDL prediction of rice area. Agreement is measured by the coefficient of determinization,
    R2, across the eight major rice growing counties in the study area from 2007 to
    2021 (dashed line is 1:1). 58% of the study area was in continuous rice production
    (Fig. 2, Table 2). Rotation with rice occurred more in the southern portion of
    the Sacramento Valley (Colusa, Sutter, and Yolo counties), which is consistent
    with previous studies (Rosenberg et al., 2022; Carter et al., 1994). While the
    area under rotation area was considerably smaller than the area under continuous
    rice, there was high diversity of rotation schemes. Most fields under rotation
    transitioned from rice to another crop on two to three occasions. A small number
    of fields in the study area transitioned out of rice up to seven times during
    the 15-year study period, meaning these fields were planted back to rice every
    other year. According to our definition of continuous rice and rotated rice, which
    we used for binomial classification (Table 2), there were 155,640 ha in continuous
    rice (7550 fields) and 16,650 ha of rotated rice (470 fields) (Table 2). The other
    dominant field types in the region are ‘rice + other’ and ‘annuals’, which occupy
    15.8% and 6.3% of the study area, respectively. Continuous rice production is
    common due to high prices for rice, consistent high yield, high efficiency of
    the production system (Hill et al., 2006), as well as farmer experiences or perceptions

    to 8000 ha were exchanged annually between rice and other crops including summer
    annuals, winter annuals, alfalfa, and grasses (Fig. 3). This exchange is dominated
    by summer annuals and winter annuals, on average 3030 ha and 2430 ha are exchanged
    between rice and summer annuals and rice and winter annuals each year, respectively.
    A smaller portion are rotated with grasses and alfalfa. The area in rotation also
    decreased throughout the study period (’08-’21) from roughly 8000 ha to 4000 ha.
    This decrease is likely because of specialization of agricultural operations.
    Interviews with rice farmers suggest that farmers that used to rotate have stopped
    due to market changes and labor and equipment requirements for alternative crops
    (Rosenberg et al., 2022). Furthermore, efficient irrigation methods such as subsurface
    drip are becoming increasingly widespread in non-flooded agricultural systems
    in the region due to political and economic motivations to maintain or improve
    production while using less water (Samuel Sandoval-Solis et al., 2022). Processing
    tomatoes, for example, have seen greater than 70% conversion to subsurface drip
    irrigation due to increased water savings (Ayars et al., 2015). These are semi-permanent
    crop specific systems that make it difficult to rotate with crops using different
    spacing or irrigation strategies, such as flooded rice. Download : Download high-res

    data set. Conversion to walnuts and almonds occupied 2.4% and 0.95% of the study
    area, respectively (Table 2). Conversion to perennial tree crops may be increasing
    due to increasing walnut and almond crop prices, despite increasing drought conditions
    (Gebremichael et al., 2021). This represents a shift from annual cropping to a
    system that is more permanent. Walnut and almond fields have comparable water
    use to rice (Cody and Johnson, 2015) but they must be watered annually to prevent
    tree mortality, meaning these fields cannot be fallowed during drought periods
    without significant economic loss. 3.2. Soil properties supporting crop rotations
    The overall classification accuracy of continuous rice and rotated fields evaluated
    on the validation data set using random forest models was 93.9%. While our overall
    accuracy score was high, previous studies have suggested that, when there is class
    imbalance in the training data, other criteria for model evaluation should also
    be considered. After hyperparameter tuning and choosing an optimal sampling strategy,
    an F1 score of 0.62 was possible (precision was 0.52, recall was 0.76) (Table
    S2). Our F1 score of 0.62 suggests that the model performed well at binomial classification
    given the severity of class imbalance in the training data. A recall score of
    0.76 suggests the model correctly classified 76% of the rotated rice area. This
    performance indicates that soil properties are a good predictor of crop rotation
    in the region, but that there may also be other important considerations not observed
    in this model, such as the economic, cultural, or logistical factors described
    by Rosenberg et al. (2022). Overall, this performance is consistent with other
    large-scale land cover modeling efforts using soil predictor variables (Woznicki
    et al., 2019; Olimb and Robinson, 2019; Sangwan and Merwade, 2015; Wing et al.,
    2017). Another objective was to assess the relative importance of soil variables
    in predicting rotated fields in the rice growing area. Fig. 4 shows variable importance
    plots based on the mean decrease in AUC when each variable is permuted (Greenwell
    et al., 2018). The red dots show the variable importance score of the initial
    model execution. EC and Ksat had very similar variable importance scores, so we
    repeated the model execution 200 times and computed variable importance for each.
    The box and whisker plot shows the median and interquartile range of the 200 variable
    importance scores from this approach, while the violin plot shows the distribution
    of VI scores. Of the six soil properties included in our analysis, pH was the
    most influential, followed by EC and Ksat. The importance of each of these variables
    is discussed below. Soil order was the least important variable in the model.

    Fig. 4. Variable importance (VI) scores for the soil variables used in the random
    forest model based on the permutation method using AUC as the metric. To stabilize
    the VI scores, the model was repeated 200 times. The violin plot shows the distribution
    of the 200 VI scores, the left and right side of the box are the upper and lower
    quartiles, the vertical line inside the box is the median, and the whiskers extend
    to 1.5 times the interquartile range. The red dot shows the VI score from the
    initial model execution. While variable importance plots can help rank the influence
    of different variables, they do not indicate the behavior (i.e. linear, monotonic,
    or more complex) or direction (i.e. positive or negative) of the interaction between
    an input feature and the target response (Hastie et al., 2009). To understand
    how the three most important variables (pH, EC and Ksat) influenced the likelihood
    of rotations, we used PDP to predict outcomes across each variable while marginalizing
    the model output over the distribution of the other features (Fig. 5a-c). Including
    data density curves with each PDP allows us to examine the distribution of values
    for each soil variable, which aids our interpretation of the PDP. Download : Download

    black lines show regression point estimates from spline fits on the partial dependence
    data, and the colored ribbons show bootstrapped 95% CIs. The histograms at the
    bottom show the distribution of fields in the training data set. The grey background
    indicates the manually selected thresholds for each variable where the probability
    of rotation (yhat) is higher, used to estimate proportion of the continuous rice
    region that could accommodate rotations. Soil pH in the study region ranged from
    five to greater than nine (Fig. 5a). The partial dependence data indicates that
    rotated fields are more likely between 6.5 and 8.0, while fields with pH less
    than 6.5 or greater than 8.0 are likely to be continuous rice. Annual crops, including
    rice, have highest productivity in neutral pH ranges (Havlin, 2020). Acidic soils
    can be managed with limestone, and alkaline soils can be managed with elemental
    sulfur, but both soil types can be costly and difficult to remediate, particularly
    alkaline soils (Fernandez and Hoeft, 2021). Soil flooding for rice production,
    however, results in the convergence of alkaline or acidic soil pH to neutral,
    allowing rice growers to maintain high yields without additional inputs (Sahrawat,
    2012; Ponnamperuma and Kozlowski, 1984). Furthermore, flooding for rice production
    improves the availability of nutrients such as ammonium, phosphorous, potassium,
    and other exchangeable cations, which are mobilized in soil solution (Ponnamperuma,
    1972). Soil electrical conductivity (EC) is a metric of the salt content (salinity)
    in the soil, which is an indicator of mineral nutrients in the soil that can be
    quickly utilized by plants, and an indicator of salt ions in soil that could limit
    crop growth (Friedman, 2005). Most of the fields in the study area had relatively
    low EC (Fig. 5b). Fields with EC ranges between 0.5 and 1.5 had a higher likelihood
    of being rotated, while fields with higher EC were more likely to be in continuous
    rice. Low EC values could indicate that nutrients needed for plant growth are
    insufficient (Friedman, 2005), while high salinity has been shown to reduce agricultural
    productivity by causing reduced water uptake by plants (Machado and Serralheiro,
    2017). High salinity can cause reduced osmotic pressure and ion imbalance as plants
    accumulate salt ions over time (Munns and Tester, 2008). Previous studies have
    indicated that the salinity threshold for field crops ranges from 1 to 2.5 dS
    m-1 (Ayers and Westcot, 1985, Maas and Grattan, 2015, Grattan and Stephen, 2002,
    Machado et al., 2017). In non-flooded agriculture, salinity can be managed by
    leaching salts, but in regions where there is also poor drainage this practice
    often requires installing costly drainage systems (Hanson et al., 2006). In rice
    production, however, high soil salinity can be managed with flood irrigation.
    For example, in the growing season, maintaining high water depth and allowing
    for tailwater drainage early in the season can help manage salinity (Marcos et
    al., 2018). In the winter season, flooding of rice fields, which is commonly done
    to decompose rice straw and to promote habitat for waterbirds in this region (Linquist
    et al., 2006), can lead to diffusion of salts into the water column, where it
    can potentially be percolated out of the root zone or exported in surface water
    drainage (Bachand et al., 2014). Ksat represents how easily water can pass through
    saturated soil. Fields with low Ksat values will have little water loss to percolation
    and relatively high-water use efficiency for flooded crops (LaHue and Linquist,
    2021). Ksat values in the study ranged from 0 to greater than 50 µm s-1 and most
    fields in the study area have Ksat values below 15 µm s-1 (Fig. 5c). Where Ksat
    is above 2 µm s-1, fields were increasingly likely to be rotated. Ksat values
    can vary based on a range of soil and hydrologic factors including soil texture,
    soil structure, bulk density, field water height, and ground water elevation (Bouman
    et al., 2007; LaHue and Linquist, 2021). Many fields in the region have low Ksat
    either because they have very high clay content or because they have a cemented
    subsurface soil layer. In some parts of Glenn and Colusa counties, clay content
    was greater than 60%. These clayey soils are used for continuous rice because
    high clay content can lead to poor tilth, making it difficult to prepare a seed
    bed, and low water availability and poor aeration in non-flooded soils (Lund,
    1959). A cemented subsurface soil layer can lead to poor root-ability and poor
    workability, which is also determinantal to plant growth for non-flooded crops
    (Dexter, 2004). While sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) was not one of the three most
    important variables in the model (Fig. 4), some fields in the study area had sodic
    and saline-sodic soil properties, which likely limits their suitability for rotation.
    Sodic soils have high pH ( > 8.5) and are also high in exchangeable sodium (Na+)
    ( >15%) (Sumner, 1993). Saline-sodic soils have both high salinity and high Na+.
    Sodium toxicity causes dispersion of soil particles leading to soil degradation
    and poor tilth, making them detrimental to growth of most plants (Qadir and Oster,
    2004). Ameliorating sodic soils requires increasing calcium (Ca2+) to replace
    Na+ on the exchange, then leaching with excessive irrigation. This process is
    difficult, costly, and time consuming, especially in soils with low Ksat limiting
    drainage capacity (Qadir and Oster, 2004). Water management in rice, however,
    can help the crop tolerate sodic and saline-sodic soil properties with irrigation
    techniques such as maintaining flooded conditions and excess drainage (Munns and
    Tester, 2008). 3.3. Feasibility of expanding crop rotations We used the partial
    dependence data to determine ranges of the three soil properties (pH, EC, Ksat)
    that have a higher likelihood of rotation given historical land use decisions
    in this region (grey shading in Fig. 5a-c). Fields with pH between 6.5 and 8,
    EC values between 0.5 and 1.5 ds m-1, and Ksat values > 2 µm s-1 had a higher
    likelihood of rotation. Most data lay within these ranges for pH and EC, however
    most of the fields in our study region have low Ksat (Fig. 5a-c). We examined
    all the continuous rice fields in our study that meet each of these soil criteria
    to determine the extent and location of similar soil properties associated with
    rotations (Table 3). Around 69,000 ha (47%) of the continuous rice region has
    pH values between 6.5 and 8.0. These fields are mostly in the northern and central
    portions of the study region (Butte, Glen, and Sutter counties) (Fig. 6a). Meanwhile
    73,000 ha (50% of the continuous rice fields) had EC values between 0.5 and 1.5
    dS m-1. These fields are mostly in the center and west of the region (Sutter and
    Colusa counties) (Fig. 6b). Lastly 55,000 ha (37% of the continuous rice area)
    had Ksat > 2 µm s-1. These fields are in the east (Yuba and Sutter counties) (Fig.
    6c). For all the continuous rice fields in each group, we computed the median
    predicted probability of rotation (yhatm). Continuous rice fields that met the
    pH criteria had a yhatm value of 32%, while fields meeting EC and Ksat criteria
    had a median yhatm of 28% and 21%, respectively. Table 3. Soil criteria where
    fields are more likely to be rotated, the area that meet the criteria, and the

    rice fields that meet each of the three soil criteria for rotation (pH, EC, and
    Ksat). Map d shows current rotated rice fields (red) and continuous rice fields
    that meet all three of the soil criteria. Combining these thresholds allowed us
    to examine how multiple soil factors affect the scope for agroecological diversification
    in this rice-based system (Table 3). A total of 38,720 ha met the combined pH
    and EC criteria. This accounts for about 26% of the continuous rice fields, and
    these fields have a 50.7% median predicted probability of rotation. Only 11% (16,710 ha)
    of the continuous rice area met all three of the combined criteria. These fields
    have yhatm of 54.1%. Most of these fields are nearby and to the east of current
    rotated rice fields, which are in the southern and central portion of the rice
    growing region (Sutter, Yolo, and southeastern Colusa Counties; Fig. 6d), a region
    known for having a high diversity of agricultural systems including continuous
    rice (Carter, 1994, Rosenberg et al., 2022). The area that meets all three criteria
    is approximately 12,000 ha larger than the size of the decrease in rotation area
    over the past ten years (∼4000 ha) (Fig. 3). The remaining area under continuous
    rice production that does not meet the combined pH and EC criteria (74%), or all
    three combined criteria (89%) is 115,170 ha and 138,910 ha, respectively. This
    finding is comparable to the Carter et al. (1994) report on the Sacramento Valley
    rice area which stated that “on at least [120,000 ha] (…) it would be very difficult
    under any circumstances to produce another crop”. While only 11% of the continuous
    rice area meets all three criteria, incentivizing rotation in this area could
    help manage weeds concurrently with reduced water use while maintaining agricultural
    revenue for farmers. In California, pesticide regulations have limited the number
    of herbicides available to farmers and have limited how the existing herbicides
    can be applied, leaving limited options for chemical weed management aside from
    increasing the number of herbicide applications, which has increased herbicide
    resistance challenges (Hill et al., 2006, Rosenberg et al., 2022). Crop rotation
    allows for integrated weed management approaches including aerobic irrigation
    and cultivation techniques and the use of herbicides with different modes of action,
    which can support weed control and limit herbicide resistance (Beckie, 2004, Kayeke,
    2017, Vencill, 2012). Currently, due to severe drought conditions in the region,
    many rice farmers are forced to fallow their fields in water districts with limited
    access to water rights (Pancorbo, 2023, Medellin-Azuara, 2022). Fallowing, however,
    is not an ideal solution to water scarcity as fallow fields inherently do not
    provide a harvestable cash crop or other ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat,
    and leaving bare soil causes soil erosion and degradation due to wind and water
    exposure (Pimentel and Burgess, 2013, Kaspar and J. W, 2015, Wendt, 1986). Alternative
    summer annual crops in the region such as processing tomatoes or dry beans use
    30% and 5%, respectively, of the annual water requirements for flooded rice (Cody
    and Johnson, 2015). Winter annual crops such as wheat, oats, and rye, are predominantly
    rainfed and require little to no irrigation water unless it is a drought year.
    As droughts increase in severity (Cayan et al., 2010), rotating rice with less
    water intensive crops, where possible, could help limit agricultural demand for
    water across the region while maintaining agricultural productivity. 3.4. Limitations
    of the study Agricultural systems are coupled human-natural systems that depend
    on complex food supply chains and international trade (Liu et al., 2007). There
    are numerous drivers fueling agricultural decision making including soil type,
    economic variables, socio-cultural factors, government policy, climate change,
    and distance to networks and terminal markets for agricultural products (Flora,
    2011, Rosenberg et al., 2022). This study focuses only on the role of soil properties.
    To do so, this study utilizes soil survey (SSURGO) information, which is only
    one of multiple options for investigating soil barriers to rotation. SSURGO information
    in California offers a comprehensive, detailed spatial assessment of soil variables
    and is an excellent resource for local and regional land use planning. However,
    SSURGO has a few key limitations. SSURGO does not always integrate land use information
    and changes to soil management over time, it has variable spatial detail between
    soil surveys of different vintage, and there are sometimes artificial discontinuities
    at political boundaries (Li, 2012; Du, 2015, Gatzke, 2011, Subburayalu, 2014;
    Nauman and Thompson, 2014). Results of our study align with Rosenberg et al. (2022)
    and other’s (Hill et al., 2006, Carter, 1994); however, SSURGO data does not replace
    on-the-ground soil sampling or field-based experiments that test the efficacy
    of planting row crops in unfavorable soils. 4. Conclusions This research uses
    satellite-derived land cover information and soil survey data to examine the feasibility
    of crop rotation in California’s Sacramento Valley, a region with a history of
    continuous rice production and growing sustainability challenges. Our analysis
    shows that rotation occurs in a limited portion of the region, and that there
    is a high diversity of rotation schemes including rotation with summer annuals,
    winter annuals, alfalfa, and grasses. By comparing the soil properties of continuous
    rice fields to rotated rice fields using a random forest model, our analysis suggests
    that chemical and physical soil properties such as alkalinity, salinity, and low
    saturated hydraulic conductivity are key variables that may limit the potential
    for crop rotations to be easily implemented in the region. This research highlights
    the importance of including biophysical considerations such as soil properties
    into broader efforts to diversify modern agricultural systems. Research and extension
    efforts to implement crop rotation practice in the region should focus on identifying
    pathways to overcome soil barriers alongside access to markets and equipment for
    rotated crops. Field scale experiments may be necessary to better understand potential
    rotated crops that can tolerate the soil conditions in this region while providing
    water savings, weed management benefits, and economic value. Funding This work

  description: The most noticeable sector for the survival of the huge population
    needs the proper technique for the upliftment of the agricultural sector. Various
    factors make the agriculture sector more complex, such as season-based cultivation
    of crops, irrigation management, crop monitoring, pesticide spraying, harvesting,
    climate disorders, and many more. In order to make the process easier, the irrigation
    management and farmland monitoring sectors are being considered and the issues
    are resorted by using a deep learning algorithm. The Deep Bi-directional Long
    Short-Term Memory (DBLS-TM) algorithm is utilized as a proposed algorithm to address
    the issues mentioned by developing an irrigation scheduling unit named Deep Data
    Logger and Irrigation Activator Unit (D2LIAU). The dataset from Virucham farm,
    Virudhunagar district, Tamil Nadu has been collected to train the machine. Based
    on the collected dataset, the machine is trained and attained RMSE value is 0.0088,
    MSE value is 7.75e−05, and NRMSE value is 0.0129 as the performance metrics for
    soil moisture. The trained system is implemented with a hardware controller at
    the farm. The results are obtained and reveal that the proposed DBLS-TM-based
    D2LIAU provides efficient irrigation scheduling and irrigation monitoring by saving
    63.05%, 52.68%, 48.27%, 40.81%, 32.73%, and 21.96% of water when compared with
    manual, time-based, fuzzy-based, FFANN, t-based and DLiSA irrigation practices,
    respectively.

    farm, Virudhunagar district, Tamil Nadu has been collected to train the machine.
    Based on the collected dataset, the machine is trained and attained RMSE value
    is 0.0088, MSE value is 7.75e−05, and NRMSE value is 0.0129 as the performance
    metrics for soil moisture. The trained system is implemented with a hardware controller
    at the farm. The results are obtained and reveal that the proposed DBLS-TM-based
    D2LIAU provides efficient irrigation scheduling and irrigation monitoring by saving
    63.05%, 52.68%, 48.27%, 40.81%, 32.73%, and 21.96% of water when compared with
    manual, time-based, fuzzy-based, FFANN, t-based and DLiSA irrigation practices,

    weather station Article Open access 23 April 2020 Introduction The present population
    of the world is 7.97 billion as of 2022 out of which 17.7% the population belongs
    to India (which is 2nd largest populated country in the world). And it is expected
    that in near future 2023, India becomes the most populated country. Upon looking
    at the drastic increase in the population cautious steps which needs to be taken
    care of food requirements, resource requirements (such as oil, gas, fuel, etc.,),
    technology requirements, land requirements, etc., The food sector is considered
    in this work as it is the most important necessity for survival. The agricultural
    farming sector is considered for the problem statement in this paper which meets
    the survival of humankind utilizing lesser resources. But for the farming purpose,
    the challenges which are to be taken into the light are, 1. Effective water resources
    management 2. Proper irrigation scheduling based on the climate changes 3. Crop
    health monitoring. By considering the water resources for irrigation purposes,
    it is about 4% of the world’s freshwater resources have to serve 17.7% of the
    world’s population (India’s population). Also, nearly three-quarters of India’s
    population relies on rural agricultural income. Whereas, the agriculture sector
    alone consumes nearly 80% of groundwater through canals, wells, tanks, etc., On
    the other hand, another main challenge faced by farmers while carrying out farming
    is that, the unstable climate conditions. Due to the stochastic variation in climate
    conditions, such as frequent droughts and heavy rainfalls, the irrigation is not
    proper and the crops are not healthy, it is completely damaged. The fields which
    depend upon rainfall for irrigation remain in a drought without water which leads
    to heavy loss in farming. At last, the next generation agronomist is not paving
    interest in taking part in agriculture and it is unnoticed. So our Country’s economic
    growth is affected. In order to bring the younger generation into the agriculture
    field with the latest technologies, this system is developed which takes care
    of the field by climate changes with proper irrigation scheduling. On considering
    the irrigation challenges, the Indian agriculture procedure consumes more water
    by manually seeing the irrigation requirements and watering system. Also, unexpected
    rainfall on an irrigated farm further reduces crop health and reduces yields.
    This leads to the wastage of available water resources as well as crop yield.
    During earlier stages, the flood-based irrigation practice has been carried out
    which is still in practice. As a result, it is efficient up to the range of 25–40%.
    To address these issues various controlled irrigation systems have been introduced
    such as the sprinkler-based irrigation method, which is 60–85% efficient. Similarly,
    another method says the drip irrigation method is utilized which is 80–90% efficient
    when compared with earlier methods. It is further summarized in the following
    Table 1 (Li et al. 2020). Table 1 Various irrigation practices Full size table
    The above table reveals all the methods employed for irrigation and their corresponding
    efficiency of water usage. Despite of, all these irrigation practices, it is unnoticed
    how efficiently the water is utilized to the required quantity of a particular
    crop and how depth it reached to increase the crop yield. In many cases, it leads
    to irritation and in some cases, it leads to irrigation which in turn reduces
    the nutrient content to be available to the crop. Thus, it is the need of urgent
    to bring an intelligent precise irrigation pattern that utilizes fewer water resources
    with proper scheduling based on climate changes and soil moisture content. So
    that it could save thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop loss
    due to uncertain climate changes. The precision agriculture practice considers
    the weather parameters, such as wind speed, soil moisture, rainfall status, temperature,
    humidity, and many more to monitor and irrigate the farm to reduce water consumption
    and manpower. Nowadays, there is various research that is carried out in smart
    precision agriculture with the Internet of Things (IoT). It is mainly utilized
    to monitor the farm environment with the help of sensors connected to the crop
    field ensuring the growth and health of the plant by monitoring the nitrogen,
    phosphorous, and potassium (NPK) levels (Grimblatt et al. 2021). Depending on
    the monitored data, the farmer can control the irrigation process from a remote
    location. The problem is not solved by only monitoring the farm and controls from
    a remote location, it is resolved by incorporating various algorithms which gives
    the decision about irrigation scheduling and predicting the weather condition
    of the near future which facilitates the irrigation process. Since agriculture
    plays a vital role for every individual, various research algorithms are being
    implemented to meet the need of the agronomist. The conventional algorithm involves
    various approaches with manual calculations for finding evapotranspiration (Ravichandran
    et al. 2022). The evapotranspiration-based approach is less efficient as the method
    is not a self-supervisory numerical calculation-based method had saved water consumption
    to the level of 40–45%. While the same plant-based irrigation approach calculates
    the crop water stress index (CWSI) (Jamroen et al. 2020) which evolved from traditional
    theoretical calculations. At the same time, many have started concentrating on
    simple algorithm-based approaches to monitor the irrigation process. As technologies
    started to improve, agricultural technologies also started developing. In context
    to it, an automated weed detection system (Rani et al. 2022) has been developed
    for the identification of weeds amidst the crops, agricultural monitoring based
    energy indicators (Forster-Carneiro et al. 2017) to find out the total energy
    consumption and models designed with simulation environment, such as OMNET +  + (Gangwar
    et al. 2019) or else developing a prototype model with Arduino (Senpinar 2019)-based
    hardware setup to the monitor the farm. The same hardware setup can be further
    enhanced for wireless monitoring of environmental weather conditions with wireless
    sensor units and wireless processing units (Poyen et al. 2020). The same concept
    was established for predicting rainfall (Janarthanan et al. 2020) based on the
    simulations using logic and linguistic rule with antecedent condition (IF) and
    consequent condition (THEN) using the FIS modeling tool without hardware implementation.
    Besides, the fuzzy logic system is a simple sensor connected with a relay sensor
    to precise the agriculture irrigation (Lu et al. 2021) through the wireless mode
    of communication. Besides all these prediction methods, the lagging part is that
    it does not have any connection with the real-time environment. Alongside, a decision
    support system involving the longest common subsequence (LCSS) (Khan et al. 2021)-based
    fusion scheme to enhance accuracy and precision level was also considered in taking
    decisions for irrigation. As these conventional algorithms are error and time-consuming
    and do not suit all climatical conditions, many types of research have been started
    with neural network-based algorithms (Altikat 2021) which consists of a controller
    that has been trained for all environmental conditions. So automatic systems come
    into play. Recently, researches are being carried out with numerous machine learning
    algorithms (Khan et al. 2012) and (Kumar and Pande 2022) along with prediction
    methods (Murthy et al. 2019) which redress the issues faced by conventional methods.
    The machine learning algorithm is categorized into supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised,
    and reinforced learning methods(Sharma et al. 2021). Machine learning predicts
    irrigation by training methodologies with the measured data (Hanoon et al. 2021).
    At the same time, machine learning resolves multiple tasks such as smart farming,
    smart irrigation, and monitoring crops concentrating on the volume of water requirements
    and velocity for a variety of crops (Alfred et al. 2021). In machine learning
    also, mathematical programming approaches are used to resolve the computational
    complexity with neural network algorithms (McCarthy et al. 2013). The algorithm
    based on machine learning includes a coevolutionary neural network (CNN) (Chen
    et al. 2020a, b), support vector regression technique (Goap et al. 2018), random
    forest algorithm (Glória et al. 2021), and many more. But these models are limited
    to be utilized at a particular area or a field since the controller is not trained
    with other location details. Though there are various techniques and schemes available
    to automate the system, everything lags to design and develop a prediction model.
    The prediction models are widely possible with deep learning algorithms. There
    are various deep learning algorithms available which is being detailed in Sect.
    2 as follows. The remaining sections are organized in such a way that, Sect. 2
    deals with the related works of deep learning in the irrigation process. Then,
    Sect. 3 summarizes the proposed novel Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
    for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Sect. 4 comprises the results obtained on
    deploying the device on the farm and analyzed. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the
    paper. Related works Owing to the evolution in the technological era which does
    the job trendily with lesser time consumption, compact and cost-effective devices
    are developed with the latest deep learning algorithm. This article is concentrated
    on human-less irrigation process automation. So, with that subject area, the detailed
    discussion of various deep learning algorithm utilization and implementation is
    discussed in this section. Much research is being carried out in deep learning
    since it is the subset of machine learning. Complex machine learning issues are
    being solved with the help of deep learning. The deep learning algorithm utilizes
    multilayer perception (Madhukumar et al. 2021) to forecast the best out of the
    collections. Reference (Chen et al. 2021) uses deep Q-based learning applied to
    the collected data at Nanchang from 2012 to 2019. This method has a strong generalization
    ability in order to make decisions based on the training procedure. This method
    offers 23 mm of water saving and reduced the drainage of water by 21 mm with a
    reduction in irrigation time by 1.0. Similarly, the deep learning algorithm is
    widely utilized for various forecasting applications (Wang et al. 2020), such
    as weather forecasting, predicting fertility patterns for livestock, rainfall
    prediction, flood prediction, cyclone forecasting (Chen et al. 2020a, b), and
    many more. The various algorithm involved in deep learning includes convolutional
    neural networks, long short-term memory networks, recurrent neural networks (RNN),
    generative adversarial networks (GAN), radial basis function network (RBFN), multilayer
    perceptron (MLP), deep belief network (DBN), self-organizing map (SOM), autoencoders,
    etc., In view of the mentioned prediction algorithms, many are effectual in the
    field of object prediction and textual prediction. The RBFN and LSTM are better
    utilized for time-series prediction. Out of which, LSTM architecture contains
    blocks which are recurrent connected units consisting of one or more memory cells
    to store and access the information for a certain period in order to improve the
    performance and with lesser gradient error (Farzad et al. 2019). Also, LSTM is
    one of the types of RNN (Valadkhan et al. 2022) which has self-looped cells which
    help in preserving the information available in previous time steps (Adeyemi et
    al. 2018). This LSTM-based network is employed for many weather monitoring applications
    for carrying out irrigation works based on the data acquainted from sensors through
    IoT (Yang et al. 2020). Alike, five years of weather data has been collected from
    New York City from April 2019 to May 2020 and at first processes the sensor data
    then the weather is predicted from the measured data (Yu et al. 2021). In the
    other case, based on the soil moisture data and temperature data the weather is
    predicted for irrigation purposes using DLiSA (Kashyap et al. 2021). Similarly,
    a case study in Bhutan has been carried out for monthly prediction over the Simtokha
    region, Thimphu. Based on the data obtained from the National Center of hydrology
    and meteorology department (NCHM), the monthly rainfall is predicted with Deep
    bi-directional LSTM with the help of Tensor flow. The predictive compatibility
    is compared with linear regression, MLP, CNN, LSTM, GRU, and Bi-directional LSTM
    (Chhetri et al. 2020) and the results reveal that Bi-directional LSTM performed
    better when compared with the other algorithms. The summary of all the algorithms
    used for agricultural applications is tabulated in Table 2 below. Table 2 Summary
    of algorithms utilized for agricultural monitoring Full size table By considering
    all the algorithms utilized for weather monitoring and irrigation scheduling based
    on weather prediction, the Deep Bi-directional LS-TM suits well for the required
    application for developing a device called Deep Data Logger and Irrigation Activator
    Unit (D2LIAU). Owing to the trials encountered with the machine learning algorithm
    and errors encountered with the earlier manual and mathematical algorithms, a
    subset of the machine learning algorithm is employed in the proposed method. The
    progression of the work is listed as follows. 1. A human-less precise agricultural
    farm monitoring unit that masters the irrigation operation without supervision
    called Deep Data Logger and Irrigation Activator Unit (D2LIAU) is developed and
    deployed on farmland. 2. Then, the monitored data are utilized to predict the
    climatical condition of the farm for the day ahead with the proposed Deep Bi-directional
    Long Short-Term Memory Algorithm for the irrigation planning procedure. 3. Next,
    the D2LIAU intimates the farmer with the next day’s environmental condition and
    irrigation schedule with water capacity and timing requirements using the monitored
    data. 4. At last, the developed D2LIAU has been tested on an agricultural farm
    located in Virudhunagar District, Tamil Nadu, India for analyzing the performance
    of the D2LIAU. The monitored performance is compared with existing state-of-art
    prediction algorithms focusing on water consumption, energy consumption, and crop
    yield along with cost analysis. The main reason to choose Bi-directional LS-TM
    is that every input meteorological data has some past and present information
    which may determine whether the weather is fine or worse. Since the weather is
    unpredictable in nature, the system is equipped with the said algorithm so that
    the machine will check in both of its cases and provide a worthy output that is
    efficient. This algorithm mainly concentrated on looking at its forward and backward
    information to decide for the future. So far none of the real-time models has
    been developed with a Bi-directional LS-TM algorithm for irrigation application.
    Materials and methods Novel deep bi-directional long short-term memory (DBLS-TM)
    technique for irrigation scheduling The design of the Deep Data Logger and Irrigation
    Activator Unit (D2LIAU) using Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory is detailed
    briefly in this section. The overall block diagram of the system is shown in Fig.
    1 as follows. Fig. 1 Overall block of the deep data logger and irrigation activator
    unit (D2LIAU) Full size image The figure reveals that the system consists of three
    sub-blocks which are essentially required for irrigation purposes. The sub-blocks
    are classified as (i) Data logging unit, (ii) ET0 Estimator, (iii) Weather predictor,
    and (iv) Irrigation scheduling unit. All these four things are essential for carrying
    out the irrigation process without any manual intervention. Each of the modules
    are the most essential part of making the task successful and efficient. Initially,
    the data logger takes care of the aggregation of the sensors deployed for monitoring
    purposes and the logged farm’s parameter is useful to estimate the Evapotranspiration
    (ET0) of the crops in order to find out the water requirements. Once the ET0 is
    estimated, the weather predictor will analyze and predict the soil moisture requirements
    in comparison with the trained data set using Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term
    Memory. Finally, the predictor allows the scheduler to schedule the irrigation
    process by intimating the water requirements and duration of how much water is
    required for irrigation purposes. Simultaneously, the valve connected to the particular
    crop gets activated as and when required with the command from the device. The
    ultimate goal is achieved with the help of the Deep Data Logger and Irrigation
    Activator Unit (D2LIAU). The process flow of the system is shown in Fig. 2 as
    follows. Fig. 2 Workflow of the deep data logger and irrigation activator unit
    (D2LIAU) Full size image Data logging unit Farming is considered by taking care
    of three criteria into the consideration for successful yield products, such as
    weather considerations, soil parameters, and crop health. On looking at the weather
    considerations, it cannot be modified but can be monitored with the help of a
    data logging unit which is the initial process. The data logging unit consists
    of information on the sensors, such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor, soil
    moisture sensor, rainfall monitoring sensor, anemometer, and a few more, which
    are deployed in the agricultural field. The sensors fixed at each location of
    the crop are being monitored by the data logging unit from a remote location through
    the internet of things. The data logging unit considers the parameters at the
    irrigation field If, consists of N number of nodes with sensors fixed at various
    slave nodes of crop field SNn = (fn, t) € If, n = 1,2, …. N. Each sensor node
    consists of information about each node''s environmental details such as air temperature
    ST(fn, t), humidity SH(fn, t), soil moisture SSM(fn, t), rainfall status SR(fn,
    t), and wind speed SWS(fn, t), where t is the time at which monitoring occurred.
    So, the slave nodes consist of a collection of sensors deployed at each location,
    \\(SN_{n} = \\left\\{ {S_{T,n} , S_{H,n} , S_{SM,n} , S_{R,n} , S_{WS,n} } \\right\\}
    \\euro \\; If, \\;n = 1,2, \\ldots . N\\). Each of the sensor modules is connected
    at the slave nodes are communicated to the master node MN. The aggregated values
    from the slave nodes are compiled at the master node in such a way that, \\({\\text{MN}}
    = \\left( {{\\text{SN}}_{1} ,{\\text{SN}}_{2} ,{\\text{SN}}_{3} , \\ldots . {\\text{SN}}_{n}
    } \\right) \\euro {\\text{ If}},\\; n = 1,2, \\ldots . N\\). The slave nodes are
    connected at various locations of the irrigation field and powered with renewable
    energy. The sensor nodes can be monitored from a remote location with the help
    of IoT through the master node. Additionally, the master node actuates the irrigation
    valves located at each slave node connected with sensors. Depending upon the status
    of each node and water requirements the farmer can remotely control the valves
    through manual mode as well the system can act automatically through auto mode.
    From the master node, the commands reach the sprinklers or water valves. Here,
    the data logger is considered a master node that does information retrieval. The
    data retrieval pattern of the data logger is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Data retrieval
    pattern of data logger Full size image ET 0 estimator Evapotranspiration (ET0)
    is the comparison of evaporation and transpiration rates considered as the total
    water loss that occurred during the irrigation process. Evaporation is considered
    the vaporization of water due to heavy sun or wind. Likewise, transpiration is
    the supply of water or nutrients to the leaves and when the evaporation rate is
    higher the transpiration is also higher. Ultimately, this evapotranspiration helps
    in cloud formation and rainfall occurrence. In India, the evapotranspiration rate
    is higher during the month of April, May, and June. Estimating the ET0 level for
    each irrigation node helps in finding out the exact water requirements for the
    period, whether it may be summer, winter, or rainy season. Evapotranspiration
    is widely based on soil type and crop type. Each crop requires a different proportion
    of water requirements. The basic form of calculating the ET0 is the Penman–Monteith
    (PM) method (Umair 2010) of determination based on various references. The equation
    is, $${\\mathrm{ET}}_{0}= \\frac{0.404 \\Delta \\left({R}_{n}-G\\right)+ \\gamma
    \\frac{900}{T+273}{u}_{2}({e}_{s}- {e}_{a})}{\\Delta + \\gamma (1+0.34{u}_{2})}$$
    (1) where, \\({\\mathrm{ET}}_{0}\\)–Reference ET [mm day−1]. Rn–Net crop surface
    radiation [MJ m−2 day−1]. G–Flux density of soil [MJ m−2 day−1]. T–Air temperature
    at the height of 2 m [°C].u2–Wind speed at the height of 2 m [m/s]es–Vapor pressure_saturation
    [kPa]ea–Vapor pressure_actual [kPa]e0(T) = es–ea = vapor pressure_deficit [kPa]
    D–Slope of vapor pressure curve [kPa °C−1].\\(\\gamma\\)–Psychometric constant
    [kPa/°C] The \\(\\Delta\\) is calculated by the following equations, $$\\Delta
    = \\frac{4, 098 \\left[0.6108\\, \\mathrm{exp} \\left(\\frac{17.27 {T}_{\\mathrm{mean}}}{{T}_{\\mathrm{mean}}+237.3}\\right)\\right]}{{\\left({T}_{\\mathrm{mean}}+237.3\\right)}^{2}}$$
    (2) $$\\gamma = \\frac{{C}_{p}P}{\\varepsilon \\lambda }$$ (3) where, P–atmospheric
    pressure [kPa], Cp is specific heat (1.013 × 10–3 MJkg−1.0C−1), \\(\\lambda\\)
    is the latent heat (MJkg−1), \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the ratio of water vapor and
    dry air (0.622) (Quej et al. 2019). However, this method of ET estimation has
    some constraints, it is region specific. The irrigation scheduling system must
    not be region specific since the system is portably installed at all locations,
    it should not be more region specific. Another author proposes an equation that
    is not region specific and it is by Hargreaves and Samani method (Fraisse et al.
    2019). It is stated as follows, $${\\mathrm{ET}}_{0}= {C}_{0} {R}_{a}^{^{\\prime}}{\\left({S}_{\\mathrm{T}\\_\\mathrm{max}}-
    {S}_{\\mathrm{T}\\_\\mathrm{min}}\\right)}^{0.5}({S}_{T}+17.8)$$ (4) where Ra’
    is the solar irradiation in W/m2 per day (1,366 W/m2), C0 is the parameter used
    for conversion (0.0023). By looking at the above-revolutionized equation, it is
    clear that with the help of the temperature one can able to calculate the ET0.
    The measured temperature value ST is enough for computing the evapotranspiration
    value before the scheduling algorithm. The measured temperature value provides
    the maximum and minimum temperature values. Hence, the ET0 is estimated by, finding
    the maximum temperature ST_max(fn,t) = \\(\\underset{t}{\\mathrm{min}}({S}_{T}(fn,t))\\)
    and minimum temperature ST_min(fn,t) = \\(\\underset{t}{\\mathrm{max}}({S}_{\\mathrm{T}}(fn,t))\\)
    where n = 1,2,…, N and t = 1,2,3,…. ∞. Ultimately, the ET0 is ET0_n = ET0(ST_max
    and ST_min). Weather prediction unit (deep bi-directional long short-term memory)
    The weather prediction is carried out efficiently with the deep learning algorithm.
    Especially, the prediction process of various time series forecasts is achieved
    with the help of a weather prediction algorithm. The prediction algorithm considered
    in this work is Deep Bi-directional LSTM. The LSTM is nothing but long short-term
    memory which is the revolutionized version of RNN – Recurrent neural network.
    The problem that occurred at RNN is a lack of short-term memory and as a result,
    the gradients are lost as the layers progress so that the weight factors are not
    updated. In order to overcome the issues, this LSTM is taken into account where
    it consists of short-term memory and if it is in bi-directional means, it persists
    the information in both directions. Even though LSTM and GRU are revolutionary
    methods of RNN each one has some drawbacks associated with it. LSTM is included
    in the picture because LSTM suits well for training the data set as it has a memory
    element and it suits well for efficient predictions for long data sequences. The
    DBLS-TM process is detailed in the following Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Process flow of LSTM
    Full size image Input data sequence In this section, the proposed DBLS-TM interpretation
    in the prediction process of weather prediction has been carried out. The DBLS-TM
    is nothing but the interconnection of LSTM forward and backward positions. At
    first the memory units of LSTM process the measured environmental conditions of
    the farm through the data logging unit MN and ET0 estimating unit ET0_n. The measured
    temperature \\({S}_{\\mathrm{T},n}\\left(t\\right)\\), humidity \\({S}_{\\mathrm{H},n}\\left(t\\right)\\),
    soil moisture \\({S}_{\\mathrm{SM},n}(t\\)), rainfall status \\({S}_{\\mathrm{R},n}(t)\\)
    and wind speed \\({S}_{\\mathrm{WS},n}\\) for the prediction of soil moisture
    content and rainfall occurrence for the data taken duration of days. The input
    sequence for the LSTM network considers the daily average of irrigation field
    data, If for the respective duration If = [If1 + If2…Ift….Ifk], where the time
    duration is (1 ≤ t ≤ k) and k is the number of days and t is the time duration.
    Now the input sequence is sequenced as, Ift = [MN1(t), MN2(t), ….MNk(t)] and the
    average and standard deviation are found out for subsequent days in order to get
    the normalized input. It is achieved in such a way that, If_avg = [If1 + If2…Ift….Ifk]
    and If_std = [If1 + If2…Ift….Ifk]. Now, the input sequence for the model is achieved
    successfully. Deep bi-directional LS-TM architecture The get into the study of
    DBLS-TM first we understand the LSTM concept of working. The architecture of LSTM
    consists of three gates in it, they are input gate, output gate, and forget gate.
    Each of the gates is like a filter that removes the unrequired data. At first,
    the forget gate two senses the two states, input state it and previously hidden
    state ht-1 and outputs the value between zero and one, which implies that zero
    refers to removing the value and one implies keeping the value ℂt-1. The forget
    gate output vector is derived as, $${f}_{t}= R\\left({W}_{\\mathrm{f}}.\\left[{h}_{t-1},{i}_{t}\\right]+
    {b}_{\\mathrm{f}}\\right)$$ (5) where, ft € (0,1) is the sigmoid function, Wf
    is the weight factor, \\(R\\) is the ReLU activation function and bf is the bias
    vector. This equation is called the learnable coefficient. With the forget gate
    layer, the cell state is updated by two steps. First, the input layer with the
    sigmoid function decides the values needed to be updated and then tanh layer derives
    the new cell vector ℂt. $$i_{t} = R\\left( {W_{i} .\\left[ {h_{t - 1} ,i_{t} }
    \\right] + b_{i} } \\right)$$ (6) $${\\mathfrak{C}}_{t}=\\mathrm{tanh}({W}_{\\mathrm{c}}.\\left[{h}_{t-1},{i}_{t}\\right]+
    {b}_{\\mathrm{c}})$$ (7) where, \\({\\mathbb{C}}_{t}\\) € (− 1, 1) and \\({W}_{c}\\)
    and \\({b}_{c}\\) are the learnable coefficients. \\(i_{t}\\) € (0, 1) is the
    sigmoid function. \\({W}_{i}\\) and \\({b}_{i}\\) are also other learnable coefficients.
    Using the previous two equations, the cell memory state is updated. $${\\mathbb{C}}_{t}=
    {f}_{t}*{C}_{t-1}+ {i}_{t}* {\\mathfrak{C}}_{t}$$ (8) where * is the multiplication
    between the gate element and cell memory state \\({\\mathbb{C}}_{t}\\). The next
    stage is the output stage which is based on the cell memory state. Initially,
    the sigmoid layers decide which cell state is taken to the output layer, and then
    it is applied with tanh function to fix the values between {− 1 and 1}. The output
    layer also decides the next hidden state. $${O}_{t}= \\left({W}_{o}.\\left[{h}_{t-1},{i}_{t}\\right]+
    {b}_{o}\\right)$$ (9) $${h}_{t}= {O}_{t}*\\mathrm{tanh}\\,({\\mathfrak{C}}_{t})$$
    (10) Here it is gated with tanh for the memory cell so that the values lie in
    the interval (− 1,1). In this case, if the output reaches one, the memory information
    is passed to the predictor stage once it reaches 0, the information is retained
    within the memory cell for further process. In the case of Bi-directional LSTM,
    at every time stamp, the networks allow the system to move the information both
    forward and backward. Mostly, DBLS-TM models are applied for circumstances where
    the sequence of data is continually available. As DBLS-TM is the extension of
    traditional LSTM models it enhances the model to further train through one LSTM
    in a forward direction while the other is in the backward direction. By doing
    this the information about the time series data increases so that it paves way
    for the classification and clarification of data in a better sense. The obtained
    hidden state information is computed in both forward and backward directions.
    The layering process is shown in Fig. 5 as follows. Fig. 5 Deep bi-directional
    LS-TM process Full size image In the Deep Bi-directional LS-TM architecture, the
    forward hidden state \\(\\overrightarrow{{h}_{t}}\\) and backward hidden state
    \\(\\overleftarrow{{h}_{t}}\\) are obtained for each corresponding time stamp.
    It is equated as follows. $$\\overrightarrow{{h}_{t}}= \\sigma \\left({W}_{\\mathrm{h}}^{\\mathrm{f}}.\\left[\\overrightarrow{{h}_{t-1}},{i}_{t}\\right]+
    {b}_{\\mathrm{h}}^{\\mathrm{f}}\\right)$$ (11) $$\\overleftarrow{{h}_{t}}= \\sigma
    \\left({W}_{\\mathrm{h}}^{\\mathrm{b}}.\\left[\\overleftarrow{{h}_{t-1}},{i}_{t}\\right]+
    {b}_{\\mathrm{h}}^{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)$$ (12) where, \\({W}_{\\mathrm{h}}^{\\mathrm{f}}\\)
    and \\({W}_{\\mathrm{h}}^{\\mathrm{b}}\\) are the weights of forward and backward
    hidden units and \\({b}_{\\mathrm{h}}^{\\mathrm{f}}\\) and \\({b}_{\\mathrm{h}}^{\\mathrm{b}}\\)
    are the bias for forward and backward. After achieving the forward and backward
    hidden states, it is concatenated in order to be fed to the dense output layer
    to get the predicted output \\({y}_{\\mathrm{pred}}\\) through \\({O}_{t}\\).
    It is calculated as follows. $${y}_{\\mathrm{pred} }= {w}_{\\mathrm{d}}{h}_{t+n}+
    {b}_{\\mathrm{d}}$$ (13) where, \\({h}_{t+n}\\) is the output of the last LSTM
    layer, \\({w}_{\\mathrm{d}}\\) is the weight coefficient of the dense layer and
    \\({b}_{\\mathrm{d}}\\) is the bias term of the dense layer. Irrigation scheduler
    The irrigation scheduler will schedule the irrigation process by solving the issues
    like when to irrigate, how much to irrigate and how to irrigate. The main goals
    for irrigation scheduling are depending on the maximization of yield depending
    on the unit area, water quantity, and energy requirements. Based on the results
    obtained from the predicted weather conditions of soil moisture and rainfall status,
    the precipitation quantity is found. It is calculated by the following equation.
    $${S}_{\\mathrm{SM},n+1}= {S}_{\\mathrm{SM},n}-100\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{ET}}_{0\\_n}-
    {I}_{V}}{{D}_{\\mathrm{rz}}}\\right)+ {S}_{\\mathrm{R},n}$$ (14) where, \\({S}_{\\mathrm{SM},n+1}\\)
    is the predicted soil moisture content from the DBLS-TM algorithm, \\({S}_{\\mathrm{SM},n}\\)
    is the measured current soil moisture content, \\({\\mathrm{ET}}_{0\\_n}\\) is
    the evapotranspiration level estimated from the temperature, \\({I}_{\\mathrm{V}}\\)
    is the volume of irrigation, \\({D}_{\\mathrm{rz}}\\) is the root zone depth of
    each crop. \\({D}_{\\mathrm{rz}}\\) is obtained from an irrigation guide developed
    by USDA (United States Department of Agriculture and Service, 2005). From the
    above equation, the irrigation volume is derived as, $${I}_{\\mathrm{v}}= {\\mathrm{ET}}_{0\\_n}-
    \\left(\\frac{{S}_{\\mathrm{SM},n}- {S}_{\\mathrm{SM},n+1}+{S}_{\\mathrm{R},n}
    }{100}\\right) {D}_{\\mathrm{rz}}$$ (15) The irrigation should be applied only
    up to the level for each crop as over or under-irrigation damages the crop yield.
    The entire volume of irrigation required for the farm is calculated by the following
    formula. $${I}_{\\mathrm{v}\\_\\mathrm{tot}}= \\frac{1}{N} {\\sum }_{n=1}^{N}{I}_{v}\\left({\\mathrm{SN}}_{n},t\\right)$$
    (16) The total water capacity requirement required for irrigation is found out
    by averaging the water requirement at each slave node positions \\({\\mathrm{SN}}_{n}\\)
    for corresponding locations 1,2, …N. In the irrigation planning process, the water
    needed in the farmland for the particular actuator and the flow rate can be fixed
    at the master node with the information gathered at the master node. Each slave
    node SNn consists of one actuator node An at positions 1,2, …N. The period of
    irrigation at each node is given by: $${I}^{a}(t)= \\frac{1}{{\\mathrm{SN}}_{n}}{\\sum
    }_{n=1}^{{A}_{n}}{I}_{v}({\\mathrm{SN}}_{n},t)$$ (17) This \\({I}^{\\mathrm{a}}(t)\\),
    generates the total capacity of water requirements found from each of the actuator
    nodes at each slave node. Thus, the predicted soil moisture content, rainfall
    occurrence estimation, irrigation time, and irrigation quantity were estimated
    with the help of the Deep Data Logger and Irrigation Activator Unit (D2LIAU).
    The gathered information is informed to the farmer at the remote location and
    the D2LIAU will check whether the system is in auto mode or manual mode. If the
    farmer''s requirements are met and it is in manual mode means the farmer will
    activate the irrigation process from a remote location through a smartphone otherwise
    it is carried out automatically without manual intervention. The process algorithm
    of the Weather Prediction Unit with Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
    pseudo code is shown as follows. Performance metrics The performance of the designed
    D2LIAU is verified for its functionality with the performance metrics, such as
    Mean Square Error (MSE), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) and Normalized Root-Mean-Square
    Error (NRMSE). The square difference of the measured value and predicted value
    is represented by the Mean Absolute Error. It calculates the dataset''s residual
    variance and the minimum value of RMSE to show the best fit between the predicted
    and measured values. Likewise, the square root of the MSE is RMSE. The NRMSE is
    calculated to find the goodness of fit with various values, so if the NRMSE is
    less, it is good to fit. The corresponding equations for MSE, RMSE, and NRMSE
    are shown below. $$\\mathrm{MSE}= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{({y}_{i}- \\widehat{y})}^{2}$$
    (18) $$\\mathrm{RMSE}= \\sqrt{\\mathrm{MSE}}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{({y}_{i}-
    \\widehat{y})}^{2}}$$ (19) $$\\mathrm{NRMSE}= \\frac{\\mathrm{RMSE}}{{y}_{\\mathrm{max}}-
    {y}_{\\mathrm{min}}}$$ (20) Results and discussion The advanced step of the designing
    part was carried out in the simulation part for the analysis of the Deep Data
    Logger and Irrigation Activator Unit (D2LIAU) for its functionality. Depending
    upon the various working conditions the system has been further extended for the
    prototype implementation. This section is further divided into the data collection
    part, the simulation part carried out during the training process, then the hardware
    implementation analysis has been carried out, and finally comparison with recent
    algorithms. The sections in elaborate are as follows. Data collection To train
    the algorithm, real-time data on the location are required. The required data
    for the training purpose are relative humidity and temperature, soil moisture,
    rainfall status, and wind speed which are essential for future weather estimation.
    The data are collected through the period of January 2020–December 2021 at Virudhunagar
    District located in Tamil Nadu, India. The GPS location of the data measured is
    location 9°25′33.9\"N 77°28′23.9\" E which is the sandy soil type farmland. The
    data are obtained through NASA website and data accounts for a daily average correspondingly
    731 days. This is accounted for by training the system with all climatic conditions.
    Simulation analysis The measured data are being normalized and executed with Anaconda
    Python software environment. This tool is utilized to implement the simulation
    of the Deep LSTM Technique for implementing the Deep Data Logger and Irrigation
    Activator Unit (D2LIAU). Under the considered dataset, about 90% is utilized for
    training, and the remaining 10% is utilized for testing the algorithm. To achieve
    a better fit and avoid divergence, it is standardized with zero mean and unit
    variance. It is set to have 20 hidden neurons in each LSTM layer. The proposed
    model is trained with consecutive input of two years of data from 2020 to 2021
    which accounts for 731 days, and the input data are daily average data. The set
    solver is ‘adam’ solver for 500 epochs with a gradient threshold of 1. The learning
    rate is 5e−05 in the piecewise schedule. With the above specifications, the D2LIAU
    is designed with various weather conditions with the data. Before beginning the
    prediction process the real-time data of the mentioned location is measured and
    shown cased in Fig. 6 where, 6a implies the temperature data ST,n, 6b refers to
    humidity SH,n, 6c denotes rainfall SR,n and 6d represents the wind speed at 10
    m height SWS,n. Fig. 6 Measured sensor values a temperature in °C, b relative
    humidity in%, c rainfall in mm/day and d wind speed in m/s Full size image By
    the iterative training process, the system adopts the measured value by prediction
    process. As the training process increases, the predicted values are relatively
    closer to the measured value. This is demonstrated in Figs. 7, 8 for the soil
    moisture content prediction SSM+1,n. Fig. 7 Measured and predicted soil moisture
    content by D2LIAU Full size image Fig. 8 Percentage error for the training site
    Full size image It is depicted from the results of soil moisture estimate that
    the proposed D2LIAU learns with more ability about the forthcoming weather condition.
    Figure 7 says the soil moisture content varies from 0.53 to 0.97 m3/m3. Similarly,
    Fig. 8 shows the respective error percentage between the measured sensor data
    of the soil moisture content to the predicted soil moisture content data. It is
    calculated by dividing the difference between the predicted values and measured
    values by measured values. For some of the training periods, it is clear from
    the illustration that few values reach negative. It shows that the predicted soil
    moisture content is lesser than the measured value. This may relatively help the
    farmer in irrigating the agricultural field in most care if the next day''s irrigation
    requirement is known. The RMSE value obtained is 0.0088, MSE is 7.757e−05 and
    NRMSE is 0.0129 which implies that the model is adapted to the environment of
    the measured site. After the training period, the data are tested with the remaining
    dataset. Hence, it is evident from the above training and testing process that
    the proposed D2LIAU is best suited for predicting the weather which paves way
    for saving water for the growth of various crops. Hardware analysis The designed
    Deep Data Logger and Irrigation Activator Unit (D2LIAU) is further enhanced for
    its operation with hardware implementation. The hardware prototype of the developed
    irrigation activating unit tested at the farm is shown in Fig. 9a as follows.
    The main items that are embedded in the prototype are a temperature sensor (DHT22),
    humidity sensor (DHT22), soil moisture sensor (REES52-AR605), rainfall sensor
    (LM393), Arduino UNO board with WIFI module (ESP8266), relays, power to voltage
    converter modules, power supply unit, many connectors and compact container dimension
    of 6 × 4 × 2 inch. The detailed list of components is shown in Table 3 as follows.
    This irrigation scheduling is utilized for the verification of the scheduling
    process. By connecting the Arduino board to the computer through the USB cable
    connector the LSTM-trained program of the irrigation schedule has been compiled
    through the Anaconda compiler. It is being trained with a Deep Bi-directional
    LSTM algorithm with the obtained dataset. So, the machine is ready to get the
    predicted soil moisture. The Arduino IDE 1.8.19 which is connected to the monitoring
    sensors once connected to the machine, looks at the current weather and soil moisture
    and intimates the predicted soil moisture content for the required time duration.
    Once the predicted data are received by the controlling unit, it intimates the
    predicted conditions to the farmer, and at the same time whenever it is necessary
    the farmer can monitor the farm from a remote location. Depending upon the irrigation
    scheduled output, the farmer schedules accordingly for the irrigation process.
    The intimated message of the unit on the hand-held device is shown in the following
    Fig. 9b. Fig. 9 Prototype model of deep data logger and irrigation activator unit
    (D2LIAU) a hardware prototype model b remote monitoring system Full size image
    Table 3 List of components utilized for testing Full size table The field experiment
    has been conducted at 9°25′33.9\"N 77°28′23.9\" E located in Tamil Nadu, India
    for a single slave node operation for our farm planted with coconut tree, banana
    tree, mango tree, papaya tree, and grape plant at various depths for analyzing
    its water usage and crop growth with and without prediction algorithm. The node
    acts as a slave for verification purposes of the algorithm in hardware setup.
    Along with the experimental verification, the system is further compared with
    the state-of-art irrigation traditions. The experiment was conducted for nearly
    3 months at the farm grape plant for its irrigation with the predicted irrigation
    level based on soil moisture content. The field experimentation is carried out
    for the grape plant at the mentioned location in Tamil Nadu. The roots of the
    grape plant may reach up to 10 to 40 cm so the soil moisture is placed at a distance
    of 30 cm as shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10 Field experimentation for the grape plant
    at 30 cm depth Full size image The above table infers that the developed prototype
    model of D2LIAU which has been evaluated at the farm for 31 days. It predicts
    the soil moisture level based on the present climate conditions. Further, it also
    calculates the ET0 required for the plant to grow, depending upon the value obtained,
    and the prediction is carried out. The data monitoring and the intimation regarding
    the weather conditions are being carried out through the hand-held device. The
    intimations received at the hand-held device is shown in Fig. 9a, b. Also, the
    irrigation process is being carried out from a remote location which is shown
    in Fig. 10. The data logging unit fetches the information of the farm and the
    corresponding ET0 value is found. Simultaneously, the deep learning unit after
    capturing the monitored values of the irrigation activation unit will predict
    the future climatic condition and estimate the amount of water required for irrigation.
    The measured data reveals that the irrigation based on the developed device consumes
    less amount of water when compared with the manual irrigation process. It is found
    that the device achieves nearly 63–75% of less water consumption when compared
    with manual irrigation. On the whole, the D2LIAU performs well for all climatic
    condition-based irrigation systems based on the Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term
    Memory technique efficiently. Comparative analysis The proposed Deep Data Logger
    and Irrigation Activator Unit (D2LIAU) algorithm have been compared with some
    of the states of art algorithms for its functionality such as irrigation time
    and irrigation volume required for each of the recent algorithms. The considered
    methods are, manual irrigation, time-based irrigation, fuzzy-based irrigation,
    FFANN, T-based, DLiSA, and proposed Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory.
    Depending upon the validation of the proposed Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term
    Memory, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is verified with several algorithms
    as shown in Fig. 11. The irrigation has been carried out for 15 alternate days
    a month at Virutcham farms located in Virudhunagar district, Tamilnadu, India
    for seven activator points covering 10 coconut plants at each point. Each activator
    unit experiments with one algorithm where irrigation was carried out for alternative
    days. Finally, the D2LIAU based on Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
    achieved a 63.05% reduction in water consumption when compared with manual irrigation,
    52.68% when compared with timely irrigation, 48.27% when compared with fuzzy-based
    irrigation method, 40.81% when compared with FFANN algorithm, 32.73% when compared
    with t-based irrigation and finally achieves 21.96% when compared with DLiSA model
    of irrigation. It is inferred from days 19 and 21 that during those days due to
    rain less quantity of irrigation was carried out. On the whole, the D2LIAU performs
    well for all climatic condition-based irrigation systems based on the Deep Bi-directional
    Long Short-Term Memory technique efficiently. Fig. 11 Comparison of water consumption
    with various algorithms Full size image Novel deep bi-directional long short-term
    memory (DBLS-TM) technique for irrigation scheduling, as represented in Table
    4. Table 4 Performance Evaluation with D2LIAU at the FARM Full size table The
    developed prototype model has been compared with the commercially available modules
    shown in Table 5. Table 5 Hardware Comparison with various commercially available
    irrigation monitoring system Full size table The above discussion clearly explains
    the comparison of various algorithms with the Anaconda Python software platform-based
    hardware software analysis. While the developed prototype model has been compared
    with the commercially available models. Both the hardware and software comparisons
    have been carried out and the results show the developed deep learning-based irrigation
    activation unit performs well at the more advanced level. The main thing to be
    taken into account is that no hardware model has been developed yet with a deep
    learning-based bi-directional LSTM model. And this algorithm achieves accurate
    prediction as the computation is carried out in both directions which can be helpful
    for real-time implementation of time series forecasting with less complexity.
    Conclusion In this article, a Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory has been
    proposed for irrigation activation from a remote location with Deep Data Logger
    and Irrigation Activator Unit (D2LIAU). It mainly focuses on the peak requirement
    of irrigation in agriculture, such as irrigation water volume and period required
    for irrigation by controlling the D2LIAU. The developed device with the proposed
    algorithm has been designed in an Anaconda Python compiler and validated with
    a prototype model. The data for the entire 2020 and 2021 are taken from the NASA
    website for training the system. The training metrics achieved gave RMSE as 0.008,
    MSE as 7.75e−05, and NRMSE as 0.012. After the training process, the system has
    been validated with the hardware setup and compared with the conventional state-of-art
    algorithms and commercially available irrigation models for analyzing the functionality
    upon prediction. On the whole, the proposed D2LIAU performs well when compared
    with the other irrigation practices. Also, the Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term
    Memory has got a higher degree of reliability, consumes less water in a shorter
    period, and reduces water consumption by 63.05% in manual irrigation, 52.68% in
    time-based irrigation, 48.27% in fuzzy-based irrigation, 40.81% in FFANN irrigation,
    32.73% t-based, and 21.96% DLiSA irrigation practices. And the system outperforms
    by predicting the future soil moisture content. If this system is implemented
    in real-time, the farmers will be more benefitted and strengthened as well as
    the confidence of the young generation to become a farmer with the latest technologies
    at affordable cost and efficient instruments which does irrigation smarter with
    the internet of things. Data availability The datasets generated during and/or

  description: 'The precision agriculture scientific field employs increasingly innovative
    techniques to optimize inputs, maximize profitability, and reduce environmental
    impacts. Therefore, obtaining a high number of soil samples to make precision
    agriculture feasible is challenging. This data bottleneck has been overcome by
    identifying sub-regions based on data obtained through proximal soil sensing equipment.
    These data can be combined with freely available remote sensing data to create

    aggregated and interpreted for soil heterogeneity through management zones. Thus,
    this work aimed to create and combine soil management zones from proximal soil
    sensing and remote sensing data. To this end, data on electrical conductivity
    and magnetic susceptibility, both apparent, were measured using the EM38-MK2 proximal
    soil sensor and the contents of the thorium and uranium elements, both equivalent,
    via the Medusa MS1200 proximal soil sensor for a 72-ha grain-producing area in
    São Paulo, Brazil. The proximal soil sensing attributes were mapped using ordinary
    kriging (OK). Maps were also made using kriging with external drift (KED), and
    the proximal soil sensor attributes data, combined with remote sensing data, such
    as Landsat-8, Aster, and Sentinel-2 images, in addition to 10 terrain covariables
    derived from the digital elevation model Alos Palsar. As a result, three management
    zone maps were produced via the k-means clustering algorithm: using data from
    proximal sensors (OK), proximal sensors combined with remote sensors (KED), and
    remote sensors. Seventy-two samples (0–10 cm in depth) were collected and analyzed
    in a laboratory (1 sample per hectare) for concentrations of clay, calcium, organic
    carbon, and magnesium to assess the capacity of the management zone maps created
    using analysis of variance. All zones created using the three data groups could
    distinguish the different treatment areas. The three data sources used to map
    management zones produced similar map zones, but the zone map using a combination
    of proximal and remote data did not show an improvement in defining the management
    zones, and using only remote sensing data lowered the significance levels of differentiating
    each zone compared to the OK and KED maps. In summary, this study not only underscores
    the global applicability of proximal and remote sensing techniques in precision
    agriculture but also sheds light on the nuances of their integration. The study’s
    findings affirm the efficacy of these advanced technologies in addressing the
    challenges posed by soil heterogeneity, paving the way for more nuanced and site-specific

    Keywords: management zones; proximal soil sensing; remote sensing; precision agriculture;
    geostatistics 1. Introduction The diverse economic and environmental pressures
    on crop-producing farms are growing in tandem with the demands for food, given
    a growing world population [1]. The increase in agricultural productivity is much
    needed due to the challenges of distributing food and commodities. However, it
    is challenged by rising debates on environmental protection and conservation,
    soil, fertilizer, and water use regulation, and social and economic equity [2].
    A promising alternative to optimize the use of fertilizers and irrigation water,
    avoiding their overuse and waste while increasing crop production on farms, is
    applying them at different rates across a field, which has been proposed in the
    precision agriculture (PA) scientific field [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Many farms manage soil
    using fixed-rate applications, through which fixed amounts of fertilizers, amendments,
    and water are applied. This approach considers an area homogeneous, disregarding
    soil, relief, and plant variations. From the farmers’ point of view, it is a practical
    and convenient method to manage the farm, as it simplifies the management process.
    On the other hand, this approach may overestimate the inputs in some areas, leading
    to high costs for farmers and more significant environmental impacts, and underestimate
    them in other areas, leading to suboptimal production and potential soil degradation
    [3,9,10,11]. Nevertheless, the delimitation of subregions with distinct soil properties
    in homogeneous areas has been practiced for a long time in history [12]. The interdisciplinary
    field of PA recognizes this approach as management zones (MZs). Doerge (1999)
    defines an MZ as a sub-region of a field that expresses a homogeneous combination
    of yield-limiting factors for which a single rate of a specific crop input is
    appropriate [13]. However, one of the most time-consuming and expensive activities
    for identifying and delineating MZs within an agricultural area for variable-rate
    applications in PA is obtaining many samples to characterize the variations in
    soil, relief, and plant properties. Traditionally, as Nawar et al. (2017) [3]
    describe, the agricultural conditions of the soil are assessed using a limited
    number of deemed representative samples (usually a few composite samples in an
    area), which are analyzed in the laboratory via wet chemistry [14]. However, sampling
    and analyzing soils via wet chemistry is costly, limiting the number of samples.
    As such, the explicit recognition of variations and the delineation of homogeneous
    areas inside a plot to support variable-rate input applications needs a better
    solution to overcome the high costs and time invested in collecting and analyzing
    many soil samples. With new equipment sensitive to soil properties, it is possible
    to distinguish them in productive sub-regions for a given crop with greater efficiency
    than in the past [14]. Proximal soil sensors (PSSs) have been used to overcome
    this issue, as they obtain more data, covering a field more efficiently. PSSs
    constitute geophysical equipment that measures up to 2 m from the target [14].
    They can be mounted to vehicles or transported manually, allowing measurements
    of soil properties correlated with other properties conventionally measured in
    the laboratory, including clay, carbon, and moisture content [15,16,17]. Among
    the properties measured via PSSs, the apparent electrical conductivity (aEC) and
    magnetic susceptibility (aMS), as well as the equivalent contents of thorium (eTh)
    and uranium (eU), have been widely studied in soil science [3,18,19,20,21,22].
    The aEC data measured using the Geonics EM38-MK2 sensor has been used to identify
    and map the spatial variation of soils affected by salts due to irrigation [23,24,25].
    This property has also been measured to predict and map soil properties, such
    as soil texture and organic matter [16,26,27], and to assess soil electrical conductivity
    variation in a grain-production farm [22]. In addition, gamma-ray proximal sensors
    have been used to predict and map soil properties at various spatial scales [28,29,30,31].
    In agricultural areas, proximal gamma-ray sensors such as the Medusa MS1200 have
    shown potential for predicting the soil water retention curve of the gravimetric
    moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content [16,32,33]. The procedure
    of datafusion expects to use more than one data source with different resolutions
    to perform a more accurate mapping procedure. This practice is widely studied
    in soil science and is known as data fusion [15,16,34,35,36]. Remote sensors mounted
    on satellites hundreds of kilometers away or on aerial vehicles hundreds of meters
    from the ground have also been used to model and map soil properties in the field
    [7,37,38,39]. Using statistical modeling, they can be combined with proximal sensors
    to increase the multivariate correlation with soil properties. Fusing data from
    remote and proximal sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions may
    lead to better soil property maps and more robust management zones for PA [16,35,40,41].
    De Benedetto et al. (2013) fused data from a hyperspectral remote sensor with
    a ground penetration radar (GPR) data amplitude, aEC data from a PSS, and vegetation
    indices from a remote sensor to define management zones in a 300 m × 30 m production
    field in southeastern Italy [20]. First, they performed individual clustering
    algorithms for each sensor group and merged the data. Finally, they managed to
    identify three major management zones. From principal component analysis, they
    identified that the GPR amplitude data were sufficient to identify one of the
    management zones. In contrast, two other clusters were identified using the aEC
    data and the vegetation indexes. Horney et al. (2005) performed a cookbook-style
    study, presenting practical MZ implementation methods [23]. They used the aEC
    dataset obtained via the EM38-MK2 as an example. They studied two areas in the
    San Joaquin Valley, CA, USA. They defined two objectives to describe a generalizable
    methodology for other cultivated varieties. Moreover, a second objective was to
    test the first methodology in experiments with a low germination rate. Fraisse
    et al. (2001) used aEC data from the EM38-MK2 and fused it with data derived from
    a digital elevation model (DEM) obtained via GPS in two study areas of 36 and
    28 ha near Centralia, Missouri, USA [18]. Unsupervised classification and principal
    components analysis of the aEC data and topographic attributes derived from the
    DEM were used to define clayey soil management zones. They concluded that the
    ideal number of management zones could vary yearly, depending mainly on the climate
    and the crop. Li et al. (2008) used bulk electrical conductivity (ECb) measurements
    for the soil profile (0–20 cm) using a portable WET (W stands for water, E electrical
    conductivity, and T temperature) sensor, the cotton yield, and normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) data measured in a 396 grid-sampling scheme to define
    soil management zones in a 15-ha field on saline coastal land in Zhejiang Province,
    China [42]. Maps for ECb and yield produced via geostatistics and the NDVI map
    were merged using fuzzy c-means clustering to define the MZ modeled to the soil
    and yield 396 data points via analysis of variance to assess how well the designated
    management zones reflected the soil properties and yield level. The analysis of
    variance indicated significant differences between the soil’s chemical properties
    and the cotton yield among the three delineated management zones. Hence, it was
    hypothesized that PSSs combined with remote sensing (RS) data can better identify
    the soil heterogeneity during the MZ mapping process and improve operations in
    PA procedures. During fieldwork, the operator follows transects and generates
    considerable data points. There is a frequent question about the optimal density
    and spacing of the transects, which involves a trade-off between the intensity
    and costs of the fieldwork and the accuracy of the resulting MZ maps. The objective
    of this study was to compare MZ maps produced via ordinary kriging (OK) using
    aEC, aMS, eTh, and eU maps and kriging with external drift (KED), considering
    them together with RS satellite images and digital-elevation-model-derived covariates
    to evaluate the potential of using these covariates together with a different
    mapping procedure. Finally, both MZ maps’ accuracy was assessed to determine whether
    fusing proximal and remote sensor data fusion increases the accuracy in MZ delineation
    by relatively improving the index. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The
    study area was a crop field under center pivot irrigation of 72 ha. It was in
    the municipality of Itaí, in the state of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil (Figure
    1A–C), with central coordinates 23.5854° south and 48.9395° west and elevation
    of approximately 685 m (Figure 1D). The field was cultivated with a no-till crop
    rotation system of wheat, bean, and oat. In the study pivot area, the soils were
    described explicitly as a Latossolo Vermelho Distrófico típico (“Ferralsols” in
    WRB (FAO, 2015)), with a clayey texture in the surface layer (515 g kg−1) and
    a very clayey texture in the subsurface (600 g kg−1) [43]. Figure 1. (A) Map of
    Brazil in Latin America; (B) contour of the state of São Paulo; (C) contour of
    the municipality of Itaí; (D) map of the study area with a digital elevation model
    in the background, the vehicle route equipped with proximal soil sensors (PSSs),
    and points collected for analysis in a laboratory. To assess the region’s climatology,
    two weather stations close enough to contribute to the temperature estimate at
    Itaí: Bauru Airport (62%, 121 km north) and Viracopos International Airport (38%,
    168 km east). The historical models were built with data from 1 January 1980 to
    31 December 2016. The season with the most significant precipitation occurs from
    October to March. However, it rains throughout the year in Itaí at a monthly average
    of 190 mm. Throughout the year, the temperature generally ranges from 14 °C to
    30 °C and is rarely below 10 °C or above 34 °C. 2.2. Proximal Soil Sensor Data
    Preparation Apparent electrical conductivity (aEC) and magnetic susceptibility
    (aMS) were measured using an EM38-MK2 electromagnetic induction conductivity meter
    (Geonics Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada) in Vertical Mode with 1-m coil spacing.
    This sensor was placed on a foam cushion inside a wooden box free of metallic
    parts mounted on a 1-cm-thick rubber mat. The rubber mat was tied to the rear
    of a 4 × 4 pickup truck using a 3-m-long nylon ribbon, avoiding metallic interference
    from the truck (Figure 2A). In addition, equivalent thorium (eTh) and uranium
    (eU) contents were measured using the gamma-ray spectrometer Medusa MS1200 (Medusa,
    Groningen, the Netherlands) mounted on the brush grille guard of the vehicle and
    tied with a nylon ribbon, staying approximately 50 cm from the ground (Figure
    2B). Figure 2. (A) MS1200 gamma-ray spectrometer mounted to the vehicle’s brush

    occurred right after harvest, with the soil covered by leftover straw. The fully
    equipped vehicle (Figure 2C) was driven along parallel survey lines about 40 m
    apart, totaling 26 lines, at a constant speed of approximately 15 km/h, totaling
    90 min for the operation. Measurements were taken from both sensors every second.
    The EM38-MK2 sensor measured aEC and aMS at 5790 points, while eTh and eU via
    the MS1200 sensor were measured at 6563 points. The difference between the total
    values measured using the EM38-MK2 and the Medusa MS1200 was due to the moments
    required to start the measurement process with each sensor. During the original
    EM38-MK2 data exploratory analysis, highly conductive aEC outliers and corresponding
    aMS samples close to the irrigation equipment were identified and removed. Also,
    some locations were oversampled due to vehicle stops and other maneuvers during
    data acquisition. The zerodist function from the sp package [44] in the software
    R (version 3.4.2) [45] was applied to filter, in both EM38-MK2 and MS1200 datasets,
    data recursively measured at the exact location. After data filtering, the remaining
    PSS dataset had 4306 and 4896 samples from the EM38-MK2 and MS1200 sensors, respectively.
    The EM38-MK2 sensor data showed more values to be removed due to the more significant
    influence of the metal parts of the irrigation pivot close to the vehicle path.
    The Medusa MS1200 data set only had the points recursively measured at the exact
    location removed, allowing for a more significant number of points to be maintained.
    Before the mapping procedure, the last preprocessing step was to reserve a set
    of data points from the PSSs to validate the maps of the attributes measured using
    the PSS produced by OK and the KED. The sample function of the dplyr package [46]
    was used in the software R [45] to select the external validation dataset of the
    produced maps. Four hundred points were reserved for all datasets of the two PSSs,
    and the accuracy of the produced maps was evaluated using the root of the mean
    square error (RMSE, Equation (1)) index and the external validation dataset. RMSE=
    ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 (𝑦− 𝑦 ̂ ) 2 𝑁 − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ , (1) where N is the number
    of observations, 𝑦 is the original value, and 𝑦 ̂ is the predicted value. 2.3.
    Remote Sensor Data Preparation Since the data from the PSSs were obtained in the
    first field campaign (September 2018) and the data analyzed in the laboratory
    were from the second campaign (October 2019), it was decided to select RS satellite
    data for the two dates of the campaigns to contemplate the two scenarios in which
    the soil of the area had been used. More about the soil sampling data for laboratory
    analysis is better described below. This approach consisted of maintaining a pool
    of orbital image data to allow the selection of possible correlations and influences
    between the spectrum values of the bands with the proximal sensor variables so
    as not to restrict the soil scenario to only that without till or cover [47].
    The DEM obtained from the Alos Palsar satellite was used to complement the information
    about the RS covariables. Ten relief covariables were derived using the R software’s
    RSAGA package [48]. The description of the satellite images and the relief variables
    derived from the DEM and their abbreviations can be seen in Table 1. Also, the
    satellite images described in Table 1 are summarized in abbreviation given that
    two scenarios were contemplated (2018 and 2019) during the analysis and modeling.
    Table 1. Resolution and description of the bands of the images used and covariates
    derived from the DEM. All the different bands’ satellites and all the rasters
    of the covariates derived from the DEM were resampled to the final resolution
    of 10 m so that it was possible to stack them and extract the information from
    each raster to the respective coordinates of the data of PSS. For this, the resample
    function of the raster package [49] using the bilinear interpolation method in
    the R software and the extraction process were performed using the extract function
    in the raster package. 2.4. Selection of Remote Sensing Covariates The many remote
    sensor covariates required filtering to identify those most significant to integrate
    the PSS data and optimize the model. These models would be used to build maps
    using RS and the PSSs via KED and finally define the MZ maps. The following sections
    better describe the fusing process to determine the MZ. The regression method
    via linear models was used to model data from the PSSs as a function of RS data,
    and multicollinearity was minimized. The number of covariates was reduced using
    Pearson’s correlation r values between all predictive covariates (the remote sensing
    satellite and DEM derivates). For this, all variables that showed Pearson’s r
    values greater than 0.9 absolute were identified, and then these covariates were
    correlated again with the PSSs dataset. Those with the highest Pearson correlation
    absolute r values were maintained. Finally, the remaining group of RS was applied
    to the regsubsets function present in the leaps package [50] in the R software
    [45]. This function allows for testing all possible linear combinations between
    the remaining satellite covariates with the proximal sensors’ data. Then, the
    combination that presented the lowest value for Schwarz’s information criterion
    (BIC) [51] was selected to integrate the prediction model of the PSS attributes
    as a function of the RS data. 2.5. Mapping via Ordinary Kriging and Kriging with
    External Drift It’s observed that different interpolation methods can generate
    more reliable thematic maps to represent specific areas, especially in locations
    with limited sampling units [52]. Thus, two sections describe the mapping of the
    original data from the PSSs and the predicted data from the PSSs according to
    the data from RS selected from the covariate selection procedure described above.
    First, the original PSS data were mapped using the ordinary kriging method (OK).
    Then, the data from the PSSs predicted via the selected RS covariables were mapped
    using kriging with external drift (KED). 2.5.1. Proximal Soil Sensing Mapped via
    Ordinary Kriging All data from the PSSs were assessed for spatial distribution
    patterns to evaluate the normality distribution to interpolation using OK. Using
    isotropic adjustment variograms, the least-squares reduction adjustment procedure
    was performed via variogram analysis tools in the gstat package [53] in the R
    software. The semivariogram works to estimate a value for a region in which the
    semivariogram distance is known using data in the neighborhood of the estimation
    location [54]. The semivariograms of the aEC, aMS, and eTh data were adjusted
    using the spherical model (Equation (2), while the eU data were adjusted for the
    Gaussian model (Equation (3); then, these data were interpolated using OK (Equation
    (4) [55]. Finally, all data from the proximal sensors (aEC, aMS, eTh, and eU)
    were interpolated using a spatial resolution of 10 m. 𝛾(ℎ)={𝑐 { 3ℎ 2𝑎 − 1 2 (ℎ/𝑎)
    3 } 𝑐 }, ℎ⩽𝑎 ℎ≥𝑎 , (2) where 𝑐 is the sill variance, and 𝑎 is the range. ℎ is
    the separator, being the vector of the separation of the pairs of points in which
    ℎ= 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 𝑗 and where 𝐶( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )=∑[{𝑍( 𝑥 𝑖 −𝜇)}{𝑍( 𝑥 𝑗 )−𝜇}] , which is a
    constant for any ℎ . This constancy of the mean, variance, and covariance depends
    only on the separation and not the absolute position [55]. 𝛾(ℎ)=𝑐{1−𝑒𝑥𝑝( − ℎ 2
    𝑟 2 )}, (3) where 𝑐 is the sill variance, 𝑟 is the distance parameter, and ℎ is
    the vector of the separation of pairs of points [56]. 𝑍 ∘ 𝐾𝑂 ( 𝑥 0 )= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1
    𝜆 𝑖 𝑍( 𝑥 𝑖 ), (4) where 𝑍 ∘ 𝐾𝑂 ( 𝑥 0 ) is the value of the random variable to
    be estimated via ordinary kriging (OK), 𝜆 𝑖 is the optimal weights calculated
    under two constraint conditions ((a) the estimator is not skewed and (b) the variance
    of the estimate is minimal), and 𝑍( 𝑥 𝑖 ) is the values of the random variable
    at the n sample points [56]. 2.5.2. Predicting and Mapping Proximal Soil Sensing
    Data via Kriging with External Drift The kriging method with external drift (KED)
    consists of identifying the presence of a trend. Therefore, it is necessary to
    show how to separate the deterministic trend from the random component and estimate
    the components’ contribution via restricted maximum likelihood [56]. The external
    drift method integrates into the kriging system supplementary universality conditions
    about one or several external drift variables measured exhaustively in the spatial
    domain [57]. If a target variable’s tendency is the spatial coordinates, it indicates
    that this may be one of several cases of mixed linear models to be considered,
    for example. The deterministic effects may be modeled by others like 𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2
    ,… . In the present study, these variables were the RS covariables, which can
    be linearly related to 𝑍 . In this case, Z will be the PSS attribute. Hence, measuring
    and calculating the target locations and the Z points is possible. Under these
    circumstances, it is possible to observe Equation (5). 𝑍(𝑥)= ∑ 𝐾 𝑘=0 𝛽 𝑘 𝑦 𝑘 (𝑥)+𝜀(𝑥)=
    𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 𝑦 1 (𝑥)+ 𝛽 2 𝑦 2 (𝑥)+…+ 𝛽 𝑘 𝑦 𝑘 (𝑥)+𝜀(𝑥), (5) What was done was to replace
    the coordinates in the function with the values of one or more variables. The
    y_1(x), y_2(x), …, y_k(x) were known, and β_k was the unknown coefficients to
    be determined [54]. y_k, being k = 1, 2, … was the “external” variables distinct
    from the internal Z_x and kriged with them; therefore, it was known as “kriging
    with external drift”. The KED incorporates the local trend within a neighborhood
    search window as a linear function of a secondary variable that varies smoothly,
    and the trend of the primary variable must be linearly related to the secondary
    variable [57]. Since the primary variable trend must be linearly related to the
    secondary variable, only the proximal sensor aEC and aMS data presented satisfactory
    R2 and adjustable R2 values of linear model adjustments (>0.7) using RS data as
    covariates. The eTh and eU data did not show a significant linear relationship,
    with no possible combination of RS data used in the present study. Although KED
    was not performed for eU and eTh, the best models were adjusted and would be shown,
    and these attributes would be mapped using OK only. Thus, only the aEC and aMS
    data were interpolated with KED using the krige function of the gstat package
    [53] associated with the pre-selected satellite covariate models. All maps were
    interpolated using 10 m as the spatial output resolution. The regression modeling,
    followed by ordinary kriging of the residues for the aEC and aMS maps, was tested
    since these two attributes presented high adjusted R2 values. For this, the simple
    linear model (lm function) and the predicted functions present in the R software
    [45] were used to perform the regression after applying the selected regression
    model to the entire spatial pixel area of the RS covariates. Then, these maps
    were also evaluated for accuracy through the external validation RMSE index using
    the 400 previously separated samples. 2.6. Management Zones Three management zone
    maps (MZs) were defined based on three combinations. The first MZ map was built
    using only the PSS maps via OK. Then, the second MZ map was constructed from the
    PSS associated with the best RS covariates through KED mapping. In this second
    MZ map, the eTh and eU data were used, but the OK map version was considered since
    KED did not show high linear adjustment. Finally, the third MZ map was built using
    all the RS covariates described in Table 1. The kmeans function in the stats package
    presented natively in the R software [45] was used. The algorithm chosen within
    this function used the calculation of Hartigan and Wong (1979) [58]. The three
    datasets (PSS; PSS + RS; RS) were organized in a data matrix format and grouped
    using the k-means method. This method partitioned the dataset into k groups. The
    sum of the distance for the centers of the designated clusters was minimized.
    In the present study, three zones were chosen for k since many zones would not
    be operationally practical for the farmers. The k-means clustering algorithm aims
    to partition n observations into k clusters, where each observation will belong
    to a cluster with the average value closest to each other. The centers are in
    the mean of their sets of Voronoi polygons, which are the sets of points closest
    to each cluster’s center. The value “1” was set to reproduce the same arrangement
    using the function set.seed present in the stats package in the R software [45].
    Considering that the PSS and RS data were obtained from different sources all
    data used in the kmeans function were parameterized for the zero values of mean
    and variance one using the scale function present in the stats package of the
    R software. 2.7. Soil Laboratory Data Sampling as Field Truth Soil data collected
    traditionally were used to validate the design of the three MZ maps. Seventy-two
    disturbed samples were collected at the soil surface (0–10 cm depth) and arranged
    in a regular grid (one sample per hectare; Figure 1C) using a Dutch auger (Figure
    3A) in a second field campaign. Figure 3. (A) Soil sampling at 0–10 cm using a
    Dutch auger; (B) study area in September 2019 with irrigated beans; (C) view of
    the study area showing the bean plantation. This campaign was carried out on 6
    October 2019, and beans covered the study area in an early stage of growth (Figure
    3B,C). The stratify function in the spcosa package [59] was used to define and
    locate the points in the regular grid. This function allows to separate an area
    of interest in sub-areas with exact sizes, and then the spsample function present
    in the same package was used to locate the center of each section of the area.
    The 72 disturbed samples were analyzed for soil texture and chemical contents.
    For texture analysis, the clay contents were measured using the sieve-and-pipette
    method Teixeira et al., 2017 [60]. 2.8. Management Zone Validation The 72 points
    analyzed in the laboratory validated the three MZ maps produced from PSSs mapped
    via OK, using PSS data combined with the best RS covariate models mapped via KED,
    and using only RS data. The zone classes were extracted from the three MZ maps
    for the 72 coordinates associated with the laboratory data using the extract function
    present in the raster package [49] in the R software [45]. Finally, the variance
    analysis method (ANOVA) was used to identify whether the management zones could
    distinguish the variance of the values of the laboratory attributes regarding
    their classes of management zones. The aov function of the stats package in the
    R software [45] was used for that. 3. Results and Discussion The descriptive statistics
    of the PSS data for the training and validation dataset and the laboratory data
    are shown in Table 2. For all PSS datasets, the mean and median values were close.
    Also, the standard deviation values did not contrast much. Therefore, the asymmetry
    values for all PSS data can be considered moderately positive except for the aMS
    data. The kurtosis coefficients for the eTh and eU data, including validation
    data, can be regarded as leptokurtic. The coefficient corresponds to a less flat
    distribution than the same area’s standard curve, as they are below the absolute
    value of 0.263 [61]. Table 2. Descriptive statistic of proximal soil sensing and
    laboratory data. The distribution pattern of the aEC and aMS attributes and laboratory
    data could be classified as platykurtic, corresponding to a flatter distribution
    than the normal curve of the same area, except for aEC for the leptokurtic training
    dataset. Despite the asymmetry and kurtosis values of the aEC data, it was impossible
    to consider a normal distribution, and therefore, for mapping via OK, it was necessary
    to transform the data to fit the normal distribution using natural logarithmic
    distribution. The other attributes of the PSS (aMS, eTh, and eU) and the separate
    data for external validation showed a normal distribution. The distribution pattern
    of the values for all data sensors (the training and validation dataset) and laboratory
    datasets is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. aEC: apparent electrical conductivity
    in mS/m (millisiemens per meter); aMS: apparent magnetic susceptibility in ppt
    (parts per thousand); eTh: equivalent thorium in ppm (parts per million); eU:
    equivalent uranium in ppm (parts per million); clay in g kg−1; Ca: calcium in
    g kg−1; C: organic carbon in g kg−1; Mg: magnesium in g kg−1. First line: histograms
    of proximal sensor data used for mapping via OK and KED; second line: histograms
    of proximal sensor data used to validate the OK and KED maps; third line: histograms
    of soil data collected with a Dutch auger. The electrical conductivity and magnetic
    susceptibility values were similar to those presented by Castrignanò et al., 2012
    [62] on an 80-ha cropping field in Corrigin, Western Australia. The thorium and
    uranium values were similar to those found in the study by Wong et al., 2009 [63],
    in which the lowest values of eTh and eU occurred as opposed to the highest values
    of electrical conductivity for a 200-ha experimental study area field situated
    350 km north of Perth at Buntine, Western Australia. The prediction models adjusted
    for the sensor attributes are shown in Table 3. The RS covariates selected from
    the selection procedure described in Section 2.4 via the regsubset function and
    lower BIC values are shown in the “Coefficient” column of Table 3 (first column).
    The intercept values represent the estimated response variable values when all
    predictors were zero. Notably, the aspect variable showed a positive association
    with log(aEC), indicating that an increase in aspect was linked to a slight rise
    in electrical conductivity (log(aEC)) by 0.01 mS/m. Conversely, the variable “chnb”
    exhibited negative associations with log(aEC) (−0.02 mS/m), aMS (−0.02 ppt), and
    eTh (−0.24 ppm), suggesting that higher values of “chnb” were associated with
    decreased values of these response variables. The DEM (Digital Elevation Model)
    variable demonstrated positive relationships with aMS (0.09 ppt), eTh (0.33 ppm),
    and eU (0.02 ppm), implying that an increase in DEM led to higher values of these
    response variables. Plan curvature (“plan_curv”) negatively influenced aMS, indicating
    that higher plan curvature significantly decreased aMS by 15.63 ppt. Additionally,
    the variable “twi” showed a positive association with log(aEC) (0.01 mS/m), suggesting
    that increased topographic wetness index (twi) values were linked to higher electrical
    conductivity. Table 3. Linear models’ adjustment parameters of the proximal sensor
    attribute as a function of the remote sensing data using the best combination
    from Pearson’s selection in addition to the BIC criterion and, finally, using
    a regsubset function. The variable “rsp” exhibited negative associations with
    log(aEC) (−1.18 mS/m), aMS (−6.42 ppt), and eTh (−0.65 ppm), indicating that higher
    “rsp” values led to decreased values in these response variables. Table 3 also
    highlights the importance of context-specific interpretation, as certain variables,
    such as “ast_B1”, “land_2018_B3”, “land_2018_B5”, and others, did not show significant
    associations with any of the response variables within the specified confidence
    intervals. Considering the observed R-squared values ranging from 0.20 to 0.81,
    the regression models explained a substantial proportion of the variance in the
    respective response variables. Adjusted R-squared values provide a more accurate
    measure of goodness of fit by considering the number of predictors, ensuring a
    balanced evaluation of the model’s explanatory power. The R2 and adjusted R2 values
    for the aEC and aMS attributes were close to 0.8, indicating a high potential
    correlation with the identified satellite attributes. Finally, the graphs containing
    the predicted and original values for the PSS attributes according to the best
    models of RS covariates are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. Predicted versus experimental
    plots of proximal sensor data as a function of remote sensor data using the training
    dataset. The continuous black lines adjust the intercept and slope for the models,
    while the dashed lines are the intercept and model idealized as 1 and 0, respectively.
    R2 adj.: R2 adjusted value; aEC: apparent electrical conductivity in mS/m (millisiemens
    per meter); aMS: apparent magnetic susceptibility in ppt (parts per thousand);
    eTh: equivalent thorium in ppm (parts per million); eU: equivalent uranium in
    ppm (parts per million). Since the aEC and aMS data were well adjusted for the
    RS covariates, pixel-by-pixel regression from the created estimation model was
    also used. However, this method did not show significant results when using the
    external validation dataset through the RMSE index to evaluate the aEC and aMS
    maps. There was also no spatial dependence on the predicted map residues, so the
    regression procedure and subsequent ordinary kriging of the residues could not
    be performed. Then, it was considered to remain with the KED method to compose
    the maps from which the MZ would be delineated. Semivariograms were adjusted by
    removing the RS covariates’ trend, as shown in Figure 6. The parameters used in
    the PSS semivariograms to map using OK and KED are shown in Table 4. All attributes
    of the aEC, aMS, and eTh data were adjusted for the spherical model (Figure 6),
    while the sensor eU was better adapted for the Gaussian model (Figure 6). The
    low values of the nugget parameter may have indicated a reduction in the values
    of variance and standard deviation of the maps. Figure 6. Empirical (circles)
    and adjusted (lines) semivariograms of proximal sensor variables aEC: apparent
    electrical conductivity in mS/m (millisiemens per meter); aMS: apparent magnetic
    susceptibility in ppt (parts per thousand); eTh: equivalent thorium in ppm (parts
    per million); eU: equivalent uranium in ppm (parts per million). First line: semivariogram
    of aEC using OK and KED; second line: semivariogram of aMS using OK and KED; third
    line: semivariogram of eTh and eU using OK. There was no adjustment of the semivariogram
    via KED for the last two attributes of the gamma radiometer. It did not reasonably
    adjust regression models in the previous steps. Table 4. Semivariogram parameters
    for proximal sensor variables for ordinary kriging (OK) and kriging with an external
    drift (KED). The nugget/sill ratio is shown in Table 4, column 6, to present the
    nugget parameter’s impact on the spatial structure of variation in the final representation
    of the semivariance. Those ratio values were multiplied by 100 to express percentages,
    allowing us to better understand and discuss the errors of semivariance. The KED
    method for the attributes of the aEC and aMS sensors presented 34% and 17%, respectively.
    These values were higher than the ratio when using the OK method. The analysis
    of this ratio suggested that the distance of 150 m, represented by the aEC data
    set, for example, was the maximum adequate distance for data collection with sensors
    since, from the removal of the trend identified using the RS covariates, from
    this distance, there may have been a significant influence of randomness on the
    semivariance. The interpolated maps showed similar distribution patterns for the
    OK method (Figure 7A) and KED (Figure 7B). The high concentrations of aEC were
    in the southwestern portion of the map (Figure 7A), where an ephemeral drainage
    channel could be observed. Although the survey with the EM38-MK2 was carried out
    in a dry season (July), with the soil not cultivated (therefore, without a pivot
    irrigation schedule) and only protected with previous harvest wheat straw, the
    high concentration values of aEC may have been associated with higher soil moisture
    related with the clay presence concentrations, as found in similar studies by
    Fulton et al. (2011) [64] and Islam et al. (2011) [65]. However, in the present
    study, the values of this sensor attribute did not have significant Pearson correlation
    values (−0.17) with clay (Table 5). In contrast, the lower aEC values in the northern
    part of the study area suggest a well-drained region with higher elevation and
    more sandy soils. The aEC data showed high correlation values with the chemical
    attributes of C and Mg. In contrast, the attributes measured via gamma radiometric
    sensors showed high correlation values for all measured attributes, among which
    C and clay presented the highest (0.57 and 0.46, respectively). Figure 7. (A)
    shows the apparent electrical conductivity maps by ordinary kriging (KO) and (B)
    external drift kriging (KED). aEC: apparent electrical conductivity in mS/m (millisiemens

    0.28 *), magnesium content (r = 0.25 *), apparent magnetic susceptibility (r =
    0.28 *), equivalent thorium concentration (r = 0.50 **), and equivalent uranium
    concentration (r = 0.46 **). Calcium content exhibited strong positive correlations
    with carbon content (r = 0.75 **), moderate positive correlations with magnesium
    content (r = 0.60 **), apparent magnetic susceptibility (r = 0.28 *), and equivalent
    thorium concentration (r = 0.42 **), and a slightly weaker positive correlation
    with equivalent uranium concentration (r = 0.43 **). Carbon content showed moderate
    positive correlations with magnesium content (r = 0.58 **), moderate negative
    correlations with apparent electrical conductivity (r = −0.42 **), and strong
    positive correlations with apparent magnetic susceptibility (r = 0.48 **), equivalent
    thorium concentration (r = 0.65 **), and equivalent uranium concentration (r =
    0.57 **). Magnesium content had a weak negative correlation with apparent electrical
    conductivity (r = −0.24 *), moderate positive correlations with apparent magnetic
    susceptibility (r = 0.32 **) and equivalent thorium concentration (r = 0.44 **),
    and equivalent uranium concentration (r = 0.39 **). Apparent electrical conductivity
    exhibited strong negative correlations with apparent magnetic susceptibility (r
    = −0.93 **), moderate negative correlations with equivalent thorium concentration
    (r = −0.68 **), and weak negative correlations with equivalent uranium concentration
    (r = −0.28 *). Apparent magnetic susceptibility showed strong positive correlations
    with equivalent uranium concentration (r = 0.79 **) and moderate positive correlations
    with equivalent thorium concentration (r = 0.76 **). The aMS maps shown in Figure
    8 presented a distribution inversely proportional to the distribution of the concentration
    values of the aEC maps (Figure 7). In addition, the OK mapping methods of the
    aMS (Figure 8A) and KED (Figure 8B) data showed similar distribution patterns
    for the entire study area. Figure 8. (A) Apparent magnetic susceptibility maps
    via ordinary kriging (KO) and (B) external drift kriging (KED). aMS: apparent
    magnetic susceptibility in ppt (parts per thousand). The attributes of the Medusa
    MS1200 sensor showed concordant distributions between eTh and eU (Figure 9A,B,
    respectively). According to the literature, the high values of the ratio of eU
    over eTh may indicate a tendency to erode since the eU attribute is more mobile
    in the environment [66]. However, in Figure 9, it is possible to observe that
    the two attributes present patterns of distribution of values in similar regions,
    indicating that agricultural practice, even if implementing no-till, can minimally
    revolve the soil and homogenize the soil’s attributes that control the preferential
    distribution of eU compared to eTh. Furthermore, from the spatial structure represented
    in the eU semivariograms and the map produced via OK, it was possible to notice
    monotonous variability in the study area, indicating growth in values towards
    the southeast. Figure 9. (A) Equivalent thorium and (B) equivalent uranium maps
    produced via ordinary kriging. eTh: equivalent thorium in ppm (parts per million);
    eU: equivalent uranium in ppm (parts per million). The values of the uncertainties
    of the sensor maps are presented in Table 6. Although the hypothesis of the work
    was to use RS covariables to optimize the mapping of the data from proximal sensors,
    the values of the aEC and aMS attributes mapped using both OK and KED presented
    values close to each other, indicating that there were no benefits of using satellite
    variables to optimize data from proximal sensors. The aEC and aMS maps produced
    with OK did not differ when mapped with the RS variables via KED. This was expected
    since the RMSE values were also close to each other. Table 6. Root mean square
    error (RMSE) of the external validation of the proximal sensor data variables
    mapped via ordinary kriging (OK) and kriging with an external drift (KED). The
    maps of the management zones based on PSS (OK) and PSS plus RS (KED) classified
    via the k-means cluster algorithm are presented in Figure 10A and B, respectively.
    It is possible to observe that the zones outlined using the PSS maps via OK and
    KED were remarkably similar. This pattern may have resulted from implementing
    eTh and eU data in an OK format to compose the management zone map representative
    of the KED method. Figure 10. (A) Management zones made via k-means using proximal
    sensor maps with ordinary kriging (OK) and (B) management zones made via k-means
    using proximal sensor maps with external drift kriging (KED). The remote sensing
    covariables that collected information from the irrigation pivot area when the
    soil was planted (2019) did not optimize or significantly improve the distribution
    of the observed patterns of the PSS attributes spatially. When beans were grown,
    the satellite images representative of 2019 had a significative edge effect, recognizing
    the transition between exposed soil and planting on the pivot area’s borders that
    can be observed in the management zone map using only RS data (Figure 11). On
    the other hand, DEM-derived data did not present edge problems. Therefore, the
    DEM-derived attributes selected to compose the KED models described in Section
    2.4 and shown in Table 3 could represent the variables controlling the study area’s
    water behavior. Figure 11. Management zones produced from all remote sensing data
    rasters using a k-means clustering algorithm. The MZ created from RS data alone
    (Figure 11) could only separate the zone to the north of the study area, similar
    to the MZ maps via OK and KED (Figure 10A,B). It is possible to observe that the
    orange management zone in Figure 11 was like the zones in Figure 10 for both methods
    used (OK and KED). The management zone in the blue area of Figure 11 needed to
    be better classified due to the edge effect of some satellite images in 2019 that
    identified the planting limits between beans and exposed soil. Although it was
    impossible to identify improvements for optimizing the PSS data via KED, generating
    an MZ map to separate soil management zones was possible using only RS data via
    satellite images and DEM covariates. Table 7 shows that the classes created with
    the PSS data groupings via OK, KED, and RS only could distinguish the distribution
    regions for all the soil data analyzed in the laboratory. However, the MZ map
    using only remote sensor data could not be determined, with the same level of
    significance as OK and KED, the Ca and Mg attributes. The potential to treat different
    growth areas using proximal soil sensing was also presented by Van Meirvenne et
    al. (2013) [67] and De Benedetto et al. (2013) [68], who also tested the inclusion
    of remote sensor variables associated with the cluster clustering method. Table
    7. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the classes of the management zone map produced
    from the data of proximal sensors via OK (PSS); proximal sensors combined as the
    best satellite covariates via KED (PSS and RS); and remote sensing (RS) data raster.
    Although the MZ map using only RS data decreased in the degrees of significance
    to distinguish soil attributes, it was possible to observe that there was potential
    for distinguishing between heterogeneous soil zones using only RS data. This approach
    reveals the strong opportunity to implement remote sensing by-products into data
    fusion mapping to distinguish management zones in precision agriculture. 4. Conclusions
    The maps of proximal sensor attributes produced with ordinary kriging showed the
    same external validation errors as the maps of proximal sensors built via kriging
    with external drift using the remote sensing data as covariables. There was no
    improvement in mapping proximal sensor attributes from the fusion of remote sensor
    data for the 72-ha analysis scale. The ordinary-kriging and kriging-with-external-drift
    management zone maps produced with the k-means cluster algorithm were similar.
    However, the remote sensing management zone map delineated the management zones
    with less accuracy but similar spatial pattern. Furthermore, it shows promise
    for implementing and analyzing agricultural areas with more significant extensions.

    TwinDecision-Making 1. Introduction The industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigm is changing
    business practices, through the spread of new concepts and technologies such as
    the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), cyber-physical systems, big data, digital
    twins, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (Boyes et al., 2018; Wang et al.,
    2022). Nowadays, companies need to effectively and efficiently exploit the opportunities
    offered by all these innovations to be competitive on a global basis. In this
    context, the manufacturing industry is continually characterized by new challenging
    issues such as maintaining a high quality and level of customization of the product,
    while ensuring limited costs (Adamczyk et al., 2020). Basically, in recent years
    there has been a shift away from standardized and mass manufacturing to production
    more oriented to individual customer needs. This has made planning and executing
    business practices very complex and challenging. The ongoing digital transformation
    is completely redefining the way of designing, producing and distributing products
    towards more sustainable and resilient manufacturing systems and supply chains
    (Rajesh, 2021, Ambrogio et al., 2022). One of the main consequences of the advent
    of I4.0 technologies concerns the significant growth of data generated, not only
    in terms of volume, but also and above all in terms of variety. A large number
    of systems and therefore actors are today connected to each other to exchange
    data and information (e.g., suppliers, customers, other stakeholders, etc.). For
    this exchange to be successful, it is necessary to guarantee adequate levels of
    interoperability, considering that each system has its own rules and communication
    protocols. The term interoperability indicates “the ability of two or more systems
    components to exchange information or to and use the information that has been
    exchanged” (Chapurlat and Daclin, 2012). The lack of coherence from a semantic
    and/or syntactic point of view can make collaboration, communication and decision-making
    very difficult during the entire product life cycle (Ameri et al., 2022). Common
    examples of Semantic Interoperability Conflicts (SICs) are (Melluso et al., 2022):
    different interpretations of the same domain (e.g., two or more different acronyms
    for the same concept, same term to represent concepts with different meaning),
    different attributes to represent the same concept in different sources, different
    representations in terms of scale or precision value for refer to the same concept
    (Chen et al., 2008, Jirkovský et al., 2016, Orgun et al., 2008). In this challenging
    context, FIWARE represents one of the most promising frameworks. It is an open-source
    solution, which provides users with various tools such as standard Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs), enablers (generic and specific), data models, aimed
    at the effective and efficient building of smart applications in several domains
    such as Industry 4.0, Smart Cities, Agri-Food, Energy (FIWARE, 2023). FIWARE is
    able to offer various functions, according to the user''s needs, such as management
    of context information, translation of multiple communication protocols into a
    single basic protocol, support in the design and development of smart ecosystems
    (Alves et al., 2023). To date, significant efforts have been made in using FIWARE
    to support smart farming (López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Zamora-Izquierdo et al.,
    2019). Interesting applications are present in various other areas such as smart
    cities (Araujo et al., 2019), education (Zaharov et al., 2018), energy (Terroso-Saenz
    et al., 2019), healthcare (Fazio et al., 2015), supply chain management (Muñuzuri
    et al., 2020). However, today it represents a promising tool to enable and support
    the Digital Twin paradigm. Indeed, the use of FIWARE is crucial especially in
    the twinning process, which involves the physical and virtual world (Conde et
    al., 2022): any change of the physical entity is captured through an IoT sensor
    and translated into an update in the virtual world; correspondingly, each update
    on the virtual entity is translated into an update of the state of the physical
    entity by means of an IoT actuator. In this context, the IoT Agents offered by
    FIWARE can work as a bridge between the different protocols used in the real environment
    (different standards could be present, considering the multitude of sensors existing
    today) and the virtual environment. Although there is today a very high interest
    around FIWARE, there is still much to do: the contributions are all very recent
    and efforts are needed for this solution to become mature and recognized. Currently
    a query on Scopus, generically using “FIWARE” (field: “Article title, Abstract,
    Keywords) generates less than 300 results. Among these documents, none explicitly
    and specifically focuses on the needs of the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
    In accordance with the EU recommendation 2003/361, SMEs are firms with a turnover
    of less than 50 million euros and fewer than 250 employees. In the scientific
    literature, many I4.0-driven solutions have been recently designed to support
    business operations (Zutshi and Grilo, 2019, Mourtzis, 2020, Sahal et al., 2020,
    Kabugo et al., 2020, Longo et al., 2022, Christou et al., 2022, Tolio et al.,
    2023), but only a few have been thought to meet the specific needs of SMEs. Liu
    et al. (2022) designed and implemented DIGICOR, an I4.0 platform to dynamically
    support collaborations between SMEs along supply chains. Among the services offered,
    support in production planning and control, and in logistics. Collaboration issues
    were also addressed by Cotrino et al. (2021), who designed and developed Industry
    4.0 HUB, a web-based platform aimed at transferring knowledge to SMEs in a cooperative
    manner. Kumari et al. (2015) proposed a self-adaptive and multi-agent system to
    help SMEs in the decision-making process, with a focus on outsourcing related
    decisions. Integrating the new I4.0 tools into SMEs is extremely challenging for
    numerous reasons, as reported by Orzes et al. (2020), who detected five main types
    of obstacles: (i) the vast majority of SMEs have significant constraints from
    a financial point of view, which limit their ability to invest in innovative technologies,
    whose expected benefits may not be clearly known; (ii) the limited level of advanced
    knowledge and technical skills can discourage the adoption of very complex and/or
    still little-known I4.0 technologies; (iii) another reason for the limited diffusion
    of the I4.0 paradigm in SMEs concerns the lack of adequate IT infrastructures
    in terms of connectivity (Mourtzis et al., 2021) and platforms/architectures capable
    of ensuring interoperability and compatibility between systems (Müller et al.,
    2018); (iv) moreover, many SMEs rely on not very well skilled managers, who are
    quite conservative and unwilling to introduce risky innovations; (v) the processes
    of integration and consequent implementation of new technologies within already
    existing SMEs can be very complex, in the absence of adequate management and experience
    in managing changes in business models (Sjödin et al., 2018). 2. Research gaps
    and our contribution With the aim of identifying the main current research gaps,
    the most relevant and recent I4.0 platforms currently existing in the literature
    were analyzed and classified in Table 1, based on 5 fundamental dimensions: •
    focus on interoperability: the feature is considered present if it is explicitly
    explained how to guarantee interoperability; the absence of the feature in Table
    1 does not necessarily imply that the platform is non-interoperable, but rather
    that this topic is not the focus of the paper, therefore it is not very well explained.
    • modularity: the feature is considered present if the platform has a modular
    structure; • focus on SMEs: the feature is considered present if the platform
    has characteristics that meet the specific needs of SMEs; • integration with commercial
    software: the feature is considered present if integration with one or more commercial
    software is explicitly mentioned. • Real case study: the feature is considered
    present if the platform is validated through one or more case studies. Table 1.

    Summarizing, there is a need for solutions that can support the transition of
    SMEs towards the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. This need is urgent because
    they need to remain competitive in a constantly changing landscape (Masood and
    Sonntag, 2020). From the analysis of the scientific literature, some relevant
    research gaps clearly emerge: • currently, there is a shortage of ready-to-use
    I4.0 solutions for SMEs, which are often unable to implement this novel paradigm
    effectively and efficiently, due to significant financial, technical, social,
    and cultural constraints (Orzes et al., 2019); • despite the recent proliferation
    of I4.0-driven solutions, there is still little focus on interoperability issues.
    This makes their lifecycle and reusability extremely limited, as they cannot interface
    properly with additional internal or external business modules. According to Ameri
    et al. (2022), one of the keys to the successful implementation of Industry 4.0
    paradigm is the ability to effectively and efficiently collect, process, analyze,
    communicate and store data; • FIWARE is an extremely promising solution, but significant
    research efforts are still needed for it to reach full maturity and be recognized
    on a large-scale. Furthermore, despite its countless benefits, it is currently
    not known to SMEs; • there is a need for general I4.0 platforms/architectures,
    which encompass multiple functionalities, with the aim of limiting the number
    of interfaces and facilitating data exchange. To overcome the research gaps highlighted
    above, this paper proposes an I4.0 multi-purpose platform, aimed at supporting
    SMEs in the transition towards the new paradigms of the fourth industrial revolution.
    The platform aims to increase the adoption of the new Industry 4.0 concepts in
    the SMEs, through its high usability, to the point that even users with poor IT
    knowledge can use it effectively and efficiently, through a web-based interface.
    Furthermore, the proposal is based on the use of FIWARE to face the current challenges
    related to interoperability. Despite of the numerous theoretical solutions present
    in the literature, the platform is tested and validated with promising practical
    results on a real-life case study, which refers to the furniture sector. The rest
    of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 concerns the materials and methods,
    therefore the proposed I4.0 multi-purpose platform is presented and described.
    In Section 3, concerning the calculation, the real-life case study is described,
    the results of which are reported in Section 4. Conclusions are in Section 5.
    3. Materials and methods The proposed research work has been devoted to develop
    a multi-purpose platform that can be used by SMEs as support tool in order to
    optimize the design of production processes and products. The starting point of
    the research activities has been the definition of a reference methodological
    approach that outlines the roadmap for the design of the conceptual architecture
    being used to develop a concrete technological platform. The proposed platform,
    based on a layered infrastructure, combines different modules and it fulfils the
    requirements of interoperability, accessibility and usability. The modules can
    easily communicate each other by exchanging input (design parameters) and output
    (KPIs) data; the syntactic and semantic interoperability makes the platform usable
    by different companies adopting also different internal procedures and standards.
    The platform is also easy to use and does not require specific technical competences.
    In this section, the authors present a detailed description of the research work
    material and methods. In particular, section 2.1 presents the methodological reference
    approach whose technological translation results in the proposed multi-purpose
    platform being described in section 2.2. 3.1. Reference methodological approach
    The reference methodological approach can be conceptualized in the following steps:
    ‐ STEP1: PROCESS AND PRODUCT MAPPING This step aims at assessing the current status
    of SMEs production process and product design features. Production flow and layout,
    equipment and tools, machinery type, machine and workers number, workers characteristics,
    work methods and operations, products dimensions and weight, materials, sub-components
    number and quantity can be considered as information and data which may be used
    to define an “AS IS” status. It is important to remark that the selection of the
    information and data to be collected changes based on the reference context being
    considered. ‐ STEP2: PROCESS AND PRODUCT DIGITALIZATION Based on the data and
    information collected during the STEP1, next step is to proceed with the digitalization
    of SMEs production processes and products. The idea is to create digital mirrors
    of the real systems (processes and products) which can be used for optimization
    purposes. Software and tools being used for the digitalization are mentioned in
    section 2.2.1. ‐ STEP3: KEY PERFOMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs) DEFINITION The reference
    methodological approach proceeds by the definition of the KPIs which SMEs would
    like to monitor and optimize. Among the others, flow time, machine and workers
    utilization rate may be examples of KPIs characterizing the production processes,
    while, for instance, product physical characteristics such as materials deformations
    levels or sub-components number that can be produced by using the same raw materials
    quantity can be noted as KPI examples for product design optimization. KPIs definition
    can definitely vary according to the reference context and company’s targets.
    The full list of the defined KPIs for the developed platform is reported in Appendix
    (please refer to Table A1). ‐ STEP4: DESIGN PARAMETERS DEFINITION At this stage
    the proposed approach requires an analysis for detecting the main design parameters
    that could have an impact to the production processes and product KPIs. Workers
    number and efficiency or production batch sizes may be good examples of design
    parameters related to the production processes, while dimensions and material
    types can be listed as design parameters for products design optimization. As
    for the KPIs definition, the selection of the design parameters is definitely
    specific to the reference context. The complete list of the proposed design parameters
    within the platform is reported in Appendix (please refer to Table A1). ‐ STEP5:
    DECISION MAKING PROCESS The decision-making process is the core of the proposed
    reference methodological approach and it enables a set of what-if analyses to
    improve and optimize the KPI based on the variation of the design parameters values.
    The conceptual architecture of the approach results in a sort of cycle of continuous
    performance improvement carried out by SMEs, in a digital way, by means of the
    proposed platform: at first step, the current state of the production process
    and product is assessed in terms of the selected KPIs (STEP 5.1 in Fig. 1), then
    alternative manufacturing process and product configurations are generated by
    changing the values of design parameters (STEP 5.2 in Fig. 1) and, finally, the
    impact of those configurations to the selected KPIs is evaluated (STEP 5.3 in
    Fig. 1). The cycle can be repeated till the KPIs are optimized. ‐ STEP6: RESULTS

    in the physical systems of the design parameters values leading to the KPIs optimization
    of the production processes and products completes the proposed approach. The
    aforementioned approach is depicted in Fig. 1. 3.2. The multi-purpose platform
    The technological translation of the conceptual architecture (discussed in section
    2.1) results in the development of the multi-purpose platform. End users can easily
    access the platform through a Web Application (Web App), thus beginning a what-if
    analysis process devoted to improve and optimize the product and/or production
    process KPIs. Basically, SMEs can select, in the Web App, specific product and/or
    production process design parameters, change their values and ask the multi-purpose
    platform for the quantitative evaluation of the effects of those design parameters
    to the selected KPIs. Design parameters values are distributed along the platform
    infrastructure to the modules. The platform modules that receive those data, implement
    the design parameters values in their application and run the simulations. The
    simulation runs provide as output updated KPIs values which are sent back from
    modules to the end users through the Web App. The end users can assess the KPIs
    values and decide whether to keep the design parameters values (which have been
    given from SMEs as input to the platform to get the update KPIs values) or to
    start a further optimization run. The platform is based on a layered infrastructure
    whose preliminary view is depicted in Fig. 2. The infrastructure is characterized
    by three layers: the Decision-Making Layer (DML), the Data Exchange Layer (DEL)
    and the User Management Layer (UML). Looking at Fig. 2 from a top-down perspective,
    DML consists of the Simulation based Digital Twin (SDT) module, the Finite Element
    Analysis module (FEA) and the Nesting module (NES), DEL leverages on the open
    standards-based cloud FIWARE and UML consists of the Starter Kit module. It''s
    important to note that the platform has been intentionally designed to be modular.
    Consequently, within the DML, the potential exists for the incorporation of additional
    modules in the future, based on the evolving requirements and demands of manufacturing
    systems. Examples of such modules include those for quality control and supply
    chain management. Nevertheless, it''s important to highlight that in the current
    stage of platform development, specific software for these modules, along with
    the corresponding design parameters and KPIs, have not yet been selected. These
    decisions will be made as part of future research, as outlined in the conclusion.
    Fig. 2 includes a generic module denoted as ''X'' with a dashed line to illustrate
    the platform''s adaptability and potential for modularity. Download : Download

    and multi-purpose platform infrastructure. Furthermore, system latency, which
    refers to the time it takes to respond to a user''s request, and the level of
    end users’ expertise required to provide necessary input, can be also quantified.
    The transmission times between UML and DEL (and vice versa), as well as between
    DEL and DML (and vice versa), are in the order of milliseconds. Concerning the
    processing times of each module within the DML, these are typically in the order
    of seconds. Among these modules, the SDT module is the most critical in terms
    of processing time, as it depends on the complexity and duration of the production
    process. However, in order to minimize this processing time, the authors have
    configured the SDT module to operate at maximum simulation speed by utilizing
    a feature called ''Start fast forward simulation,'' which is provided by the software
    employed for its development (see Section 2.2.1). Consequently, the overall time
    from when an end user clicks the button to send process/product design parameters
    values to when they receive a response from the platform falls within the range
    of seconds. As for the end user experience required to use the platform, the level
    of IT knowledge needed is basic. No specific or deep IT expertise is necessary,
    and the interaction is similar to using a standard web page online. However, end
    users are expected to possess expertise in their respective domains of work. They
    should be knowledgeable about manufacturing system production processes and products
    in order to select and configure the design parameters correctly. Additionally,
    an understanding of manufacturing system KPIs is essential to make informed decisions.
    Following, in sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, the layers description is presented,
    while section 2.4 lists and shortly present the software and hardware used for
    the development and the implementation of the platform. 3.2.1. Decision-Making
    Layer (DML) The DML enables to run products and production processes simulations
    in order to evaluate the quantitative effects of selected design parameters on
    several KPIs. Basically, each module within this layer, receives design parameters
    values as input, run either products or production processes simulations and provides
    KPIs values as output, thus enabling end users to carry out a set of what-if analyses
    devoted to the products and production processes optimization. The DML consists
    of the following 3 modules: ‐ SDT module: this module recreates the simulation
    model of the real SMEs’ production processes with the aim of carrying out the
    quantitative evaluation of the effects of the design parameters on the production
    processes KPIs. Plant Simulation from TECNOMATIX is the software that has been
    integrated within the platform in order to develop the simulation models. Further
    information on Plant Simulation software can be found at https://www.dex.siemens.com/plm/tecnomatix/plant-simulation;
    ‐ FEA module: this module aims at running finite element analysis (FEA) in order
    to either properly design new products from a structural point of view or to improve
    the structural design of existing ones. Autodesk Inventor Nastran is the software
    that has been integrated within the platform to conduct FEA studies. Further information
    on Autodesk Inventor Nastran can be found at https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor-nastran/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription;
    ‐ NES module: this module has been developed to conduct nesting studies in order
    to optimize efficiency in terms of flat raw material yield in the manufacturing
    process of a product. Basically, SMEs can assess different products design in
    terms of product dimensions with the aim at optimizing the raw material utilization
    rate. Based on the data received in input, the module generates a series of suggested
    nest aiming at reducing raw material wastes and therefore costs. Autodesk Inventor
    Nesting is the software that has been integrated within the platform in order
    to carry out the nesting studies. Further information on Autodesk Inventor Nesting
    can be found at https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor-nesting/. 3.2.2. Data
    Exchange Layer (DEL) One of the main research issues to be tackled by the authors
    is that applications and software behind each platform module are neither syntactically
    nor semantically interoperable and therefore not able to communicate as well as
    to exchange data each other. In order to proper address and solve this issue the
    multi-purpose platform leverages on FIWARE (further information on FIWARE can
    be found out at https://www.fiware.org/), an open-source framework for IoT platforms
    whose aim is to build sustainable ecosystems for smart solution development that,
    through the joint use of standard components and architectures, enables interoperable
    data exchange among the platform modules as well as between the platform and the
    outside world (i.e., SMEs). The interoperable data exchange is guaranteed by the
    adoption of data models, which define the harmonized representation of data formats
    and semantics being used by applications and software within the platform. A data
    model can be defined as a list of data that need to be processed by each platform
    module. For each platform module, two data models have been defined: the first
    one to manage the data in input to the module (i.e., design parameters) and the
    second one to manage the data in output from the module (i.e., KPIs). A data model
    consists of a list of attribute and types; an attribute identifies either the
    design parameters or the KPI that can be processed by a module, while the type
    represents a classification of type of data (i.e., int, double, Boolean, etc.)
    that an attribute can hold and that can be easily interpreted by a computer system.
    Table 2 offers an overview of the number of design parameters and KPIs for each
    DML module, while the data models details including descriptions, attributes and
    types is reported in Table A1, in the Appendix. Table 2. Number of design parameters
    and KPIs. DML Design parameters # (input data #) KPIs # (output data #) SDT Module
    8 7 FEA Module 7 4 NES Module 15 4 Following the data exchange flow within the
    platform is detailed. The data flow management involves the use of FIWARE''s Orion
    Context Broker (CB) component. The CB has the following functionalities: (1) receive
    data from the modules, (2) store the received data, and (3) send the data to the
    modules. Basically, the CB component can be seen as a message dispatcher through
    which the different platform modules can communicate each other. Each module can
    send data to the CB through the Sender software application (the sending operation
    is named publish) and, at the same time, receive data from the CB through the
    Receiver software application (the receiving operation is named subscribe). The
    aforementioned software applications are implemented within the Middleware component
    located within the modules. Each module can send data to the CB and receive from
    the CB the data for which a subscription has been done. Moreover, it has to be
    pointed out that the CB can receive and send data only in NGSIV2 format, while
    each module processes data in its own format that may differ from the NGSIV2 format.
    Therefore, to ensure the data exchange interoperability among the modules, a NGSIV2
    JSON Parser software application has been integrated within each module. This
    application has the task of transferring data from the module specific format
    into the NGSIV2 format and vice versa. In the case where a module sends data to
    the CB, the NGSIV2 JSON Parser application transfers the data from the module-specific
    format to the NGSIV2 format, thus making it readable to the CB. Conversely if
    it is the CB that needs to send data to a module, the NGSIV2 JSON Parser application
    transfers the data from the NGSIV2 format to the module-specific format, thus
    making it readable to the module. As an example, Fig. 3 depicts, on the left side,
    a data NGSIV2 format for a publish operation from the Web App to FIWARE (related
    to the input data to be sent to the FEA module) and, on a right side, a data NGSIV2
    format for a publish operation from the FEA module to FIWARE (related to the output
    data to be sent to the Web App). Download : Download high-res image (284KB) Download

    operations. 3.2.3. User Management Layer (UML) This layer results in the development
    of a starter kit module, whose main goal is to allow SMEs to easily interact with
    the platform. The starter kit module consists of a Web App and a set of API. The
    Web App allows the SMEs to submit and receive data, while the API set supports
    the data exchange flow with the platform. As far as the Web App development is
    concerned, the authors efforts have been similarly addressed to both Web App Back-End
    and Front-End design and implementation. The Back-End rules basically all the
    functionalities (e.g., end users’ profile creation, log-in/log-out process, etc.)
    offered by the platform and it includes as well the server on which the Web App
    runs and the database with its related tables for managing the data and which
    are uploaded to the platform. The Front-End consists of ad-hoc and easy to use
    graphic users’ interfaces (GUI), whose detailed description is reported in section
    3.2. As far as the set of API is considered, it consists of a set of methods whose
    implementation has been necessary in order to establish the connection between
    the Web App Back-End and FIWARE, thus allowing the operative transfer of data
    from SMEs to the platform modules and vice versa. Fig. 4 depicts a high-level
    architecture of the data flow between SMEs and the multipurpose platform. Download

    Data flow high-level architecture. 3.2.4. Software and hardware infrastructure
    This section aims at consolidating and briefly presenting the list of hardware
    and software components that were used for the development of the platform. While
    some of these elements are already individually introduced and discussed within
    various sections of this research work, it is definitely beneficial to offer a
    short summary here, thus providing the readers with quick and easy access to this
    information. For the hardware setup, the platform employs three distinct servers.
    One server is dedicated to hosting the Web App, while another serves as the infrastructure
    for FIWARE. The third server is tasked with supporting all three DML modules,
    which include the SDT module, FEA module, and NES module. For the development
    of the Web App, the authors have employed Laravel, a robust web application framework
    (further details about Laravel can be found at https://laravel.com). Among the
    technologies of this framework, MySQL has been used to deploy the Web App database,
    Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) as scripting language to implement the processes
    logics behind the Web App (Back-End) and HTML Visualization together with Bootstrap
    and jQuery to develop Web App graphics (Front-End). Moving forward, each DML module
    has been developed using specialized software. The SDT module leverages Plant
    Simulation from Tecnomatix, the FEA module is built upon Autodesk Inventor Nastran
    and finally the NES module utilizes Autodesk Inventor Nesting (see section 2.2.1).
    The interoperable data exchange between the DML modules and the Web App is facilitated
    by the use of FIWARE, an open-source framework tailored for IoT platforms (see
    section 2.2.2). Finally, to ensure the data flow, the platform employs specific
    communication protocols: HTTP is used for data transmission from the Web App to
    FIWARE and from the DML modules to FIWARE, while MQTT is implemented for data
    exchange from FIWARE to the Web App, as well as from FIWARE to the DML modules,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2. 4. Calculation This section presents an application
    of the multi-purpose platform conducted by a SME, located in Calabria (Italy)
    and operating in the furniture sector. The objective of this case study is to
    showcase the validity and potentiality of the developed platform, by presenting
    its application for the optimization of a new bookcase design and the optimization
    of its production line. Through this case study, the authors aim at demonstrating
    how the use of a multi-purpose platform can help SMEs to achieve their business
    objectives, by enabling them to develop and manufacture products more efficiently
    and effectively. The following sub-sections detail the use of a platform to optimize
    the design and the manufacturing process of the bookcase through the application
    of the platform modules. Section 3.1 presents the reference context, including
    a description of the bookcase, its manufacturing process as well as the objectives
    intended to be achieved by using the platform. Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 describe
    respectively the application of specific modules to achieve these objectives.
    Section 3.2 outlines the use of the of the SDT module being used to define the
    manufacturing process design guidelines. In section 3.3, the FEA module is used
    to perform finite element analysis for structural design purposes. Lastly, section
    3.4 details the application of the NES module to identify the most efficient arrangement
    of the bookcase sub-components (shelves) on a raw material sheet in order to minimize
    waste and reduce costs. 4.1. Reference context This section presents the design
    and the technical features of the bookcase, the production steps to manufacture
    it and the objectives that the SME aims at achieving by using the multi-purpose
    platform. Bookcase design and technical features The product in question is a
    new bookcase that is currently being developed by the SME. The design and technical
    features of the bookcase have already been established, with the exception of
    the thickness of the shelves. The bookcase consists of five oak shelves, four
    feet, and eleven aluminum tubes. The shelves have been designed with different
    shapes and dimensions to optimize weight distribution and enhance the overall
    structural dynamics of the bookcase. Fig. 5 depicts on the right side the CAD
    model and on the left side the dimensions of each of its main components. Download

    Bookcase CAD model and sub-components main dimensions. The shelves are positioned
    at a distance of 350 mm from each other, with the central shelf measuring 700
    mm in length (L) and 400 mm in depth (D). The other two sets of shelves measure
    800 mm (L) x 400 mm (D) and 900 mm (L) x 400 mm (D), respectively. To ensure stability,
    each foot of the bookcase is secured to the structure through the use of standard
    wood screws and five brackets per foot. The bookcase''s design is not yet finalized,
    as the thickness of the shelves remains to be determined by using the FEA module.
    Bookcase production process The production steps for the manufacturing of the
    bookcase have been previously identified by the SME, and an initial configuration
    of the plant resources has been already established. However, it is still necessary
    to finalize, optimize and validate the configuration of plant resources (i.e.,
    number of workers, number of machines, etc.), which will be achieved by utilizing
    the SDT module. The following macro-operations have been identified. • Macro-operation
    1A: oak panel manufacture; • Macro-operation 2A: aluminum tubes manufacture and
    assembly; • Macro-operation 3A: components packaging before delivery to final
    customers; A brief description of each macro-operation is reported below. • Macro-operation
    1A consists of the following production steps: 1) Step 1A.1: shelves cut based
    on the designed dimensions starting from a raw material oak panel whose dimensions
    are 2 m (L) x 2 m (D). The SME currently plans to use a horizontal band saw to
    properly cut and dimension the shelves; 2) Step 1A.2: shelves planning to reach
    the shelves thickness (to be still finalized), starting from a raw material oak
    panel thickness of 25 mm. A planer machine is foreseen to perform this operation;
    3) Step 1A.3: shelves sanding to prepare them for the next drilling operation.
    The SME plans to use a double belt sander to carry out this production step; 4)
    Step 1A.4: shelves drilling in order to make the holes necessary for the future
    assembly. One drilling machine is foreseen to perform this operation; 5) Step
    1A.5: shelves painting and drying; oak aesthetical characteristics are preserved
    by using wood stain instead of varnish. In terms of plant resources, SME plans
    to use one panting and drying machine. • Macro-operation 2A consists of the following
    production steps: 1) Step 2A.1: aluminum tubes cut based on the designed dimensions
    starting from raw material tubes 6 m in length. A circular saw is planned to be
    used to perform this operation; 2) Step 2A.2: aluminum tubes bending operation
    in order to reach the X shape as shown in Fig. 5. A roller bender is currently
    planned to be used to perform this operation and a bending angle of 10° has to
    be set to avoid a possible bookcase structure future collapse; 3) Step 2A.3: aluminum
    brackets welding to the tubes. Those brackets represent the supports where the
    final customers place the shelves and fix them to the bookcase structure by using
    standard wood screws. An automated welding machine is currently planned to be
    used to perform this operation; 4) Step 2A.4: aluminum tubes painting and drying
    by using primers and paints suitable for aluminum processing. One painting and
    drying cabin is currently foreseen to perform this production step; 5) Step 2A.5:
    assembly of the welded fit in aluminum by inserting two tube tops. • Macro-operation
    3A consists of the following production steps: 1) Step 3A.1: preparation of packaging
    set 1 which includes the 5 oak shelves and the wood screws to fix them to the
    bookcase aluminum structure and decorative aluminum tubes; 2) Step 3A.2: preparation
    of packaging set 2 which includes the bookcase feet (4 pieces) and the pivot being
    used for positioning the decorative aluminum tubes between the shelves as shown
    in Fig. 5. Packaging set 1 and packaging set 2 are sent to the customers which
    have to complete by their own the final Bookcase assembly. Case study objectives
    The SME has set clear objectives that it aims to achieve by using the multi-purpose
    platform. The objectives are as follows: 1) The SME aims at using the SDT module
    to either confirm or optimize the production lines design in terms of currently
    planned resources, such as the number of operators and machines to be used. The
    objective is to ensure that the production process is optimized for maximum efficiency
    and productivity. By using the SDT module, the SME can model and simulate the
    production process, analyze the factors that impact its efficiency, and identify
    areas where improvements can be made. This will help the SME to make data-driven
    decisions about the number of operators and machines required for each stage of
    the process, and to optimize the production process for maximum efficiency and
    profitability; 2) The SME aims at using the FEA module to conduct finite element
    analysis to properly design the bookcase from a structural point of view. This
    includes defining the bookcase shelves'' thickness based on the maximum load it
    can hold and other parameters given as input by the SME. The objective is to ensure
    that the bookcase is structurally sound and can hold the intended load. By using
    the FEA module, the SME can accurately simulate and analyze the bookcase''s structural
    behavior under various loading conditions and optimize its design accordingly;
    3) The SME aims at using the NES module to define a nesting study that optimizes
    the production of a number of shelves full set from a single oak panel. The objective
    is to minimize material waste and optimize the production process to increase
    efficiency, reduce costs as well as to ensure the highest quality of the final
    product. 4.2. Web application – User interface This section goes into the details
    of the Web-App being used by the end users to access and interact with the platform.
    The Web App is composed of a Front-End and a Back-End, which work together seamlessly
    to provide end users with a user-friendly and powerful platform. The Back-End
    of the web application has been developed to manage the platform''s functionalities;
    among the others the main ones are described below: • The Back-End allows that
    different types of end users (administrators and non-administrators) can configure
    and use the platform functionalities. To this end, the authors have defined the
    permissions and roles for different type of end users (i.e., manager, operator,
    product design engineer, FEA product engineer, etc.) by implementing authentication
    and authorization processes, and enforcing security policies to protect the application
    and its data; • The Back-End ensures the management of users by administrators
    (such as creating, modifying, or deleting users). This includes implementation
    of user validation and verification processes and enforcing password policies;
    • The Back-End ensures user registration, authentication and authorization processes.
    The user registration requires mandatory field such as name, surname, role (i.e.,
    manager, operator, product design engineer, FEA product engineer, etc.) and password
    (with a minimum of 8 characters, including letters and numbers). Moreover, the
    OAuth protocol (Hardt, 2012) has been implemented to secure end users’ login and
    logout; • The Back-End provides differentiated access to the platform''s functionalities
    and modules based on the user''s role and permissions. This has been reached by
    implementing role-based access control, defining user groups and permissions,
    and enforcing restrictions on sensitive operations and data. For instance, the
    manager user group is granted to access to all platform modules, whereas the FEA
    product engineer is granted to access only the FEA module; • The Back-End ensures
    the management of the personal area where end users can modify their information.
    User interface components have been implemented for managing user profiles, enforcing
    data validation and verification, and logging all user activities related to profile
    management. As far as the Web App Front-End development is concerned, an ad-hoc
    and easy-to-use graphic user interfaces (GUI) has been developed. In Fig. 6, the
    login page is displayed. Here, the end users have the option to enter username
    and password and by clicking the “LOGIN” button, they can gain access to the platform.
    Additionally, this page offers the “Forgot your password” button, which allows
    end users to initiate a password recovery process. End users will receive an email
    containing a link to reset their password. Fig. 7 depicts a form for creating
    new user accounts by the administrator. The form contains several fields for inputting
    user information, including a dropdown menu for selecting the user''s role within
    the SME. The available roles may vary depending on the SME, but typical options
    include administrator, manager, operator, product design engineer, FEA product
    engineer, etc. Once the user''s role has been selected, the administrator can
    input the user''s personal details, such as their name, surname and email address,
    and define a unique username and password for the new account. The form also includes
    validation checks to ensure that the username and password meet the organization''s
    security requirements. Upon submission of the form, the web application creates
    a new user account and adds it to the SME''s user database. The administrator
    can then view and manage the user accounts, including editing or deleting them
    as needed. Basically, the web application provides a convenient and efficient
    way for administrators to create and manage user accounts within the SME, helping
    to ensure that the right people have the right level of access to the platform
    modules and therefore to the SME''s resources and information. Download : Download

    3 calculates the maximum number of clicks needed to perform a what-if analysis
    related to the optimizations of either the production process (SDT module) or
    the product (FEA and NES modules). For each module, the following considerations
    are made regarding the number of clicks: 1) # Clicks required to select the module
    main page 2) # Clicks to access the module input section 3) # Clicks needed to
    select the design parameters 4) # Clicks for selecting the desired KPIs for analysis
    5) # Clicks to send the data to the platform 6) # Clicks to access the module

    important to note that these calculations represent the maximum number of clicks
    required, assuming the end user wishes to input all design parameters and analyze
    all available KPIs. For the NES module, no clicks are considered for KPI selection,
    as a nesting study requires evaluation of all KPIs, implemented within the platform,
    to be effective. Please be aware that these calculations do not include clicks
    for registering and logging into the platform or for entering values for the design
    parameters (essentially, the process of digitizing values). 5. Results This section
    summarizes the most noteworthy results as outcome of the use of the multi-purpose
    platform. In particular, section 4.1 presents the main results achieved by using
    the SDT module, while section 4.2 and section 4.3 report respectively the outcomes
    of the FEA and NES modules. 5.1. SDT Module: Production process design The SDT
    module deals with recreating the real production processes of the SME, through
    appropriate simulation models, with the aim of providing quantitative evaluations
    about the effects that different input parameters have on well-defined KPIs. In
    this context, Plant Simulation, a TECNOMATIX solution, has been integrated within
    the platform. As highlighted in the previous sections of the paper, the SME of
    the case study has already identified the production phases for the realization
    of the new product, however it is crucial to find the most suitable configuration.
    In this context, simulation represents a very powerful tool because it enables
    the execution of “offline” tests, where it is possible to eventually make errors
    without impacting the real system. Only after having verified, through appropriate
    what-if analyses, the goodness of each solution, it is possible to proceed with
    the actual implementation on the real system. The construction of the simulation
    model, which represents the real production system, is out of the scope of this
    paper. In fact, the SDT Module has the only purpose of guiding a user, even one
    who is inexperienced from the point of view of digital technologies, in choosing
    the most suitable input parameters to achieve specific KPIs. However, to improve
    the reader''s understanding, it is relevant to say that the entire production
    process has been divided into 3 simulation frames: manufacturing, assembly, packaging.
    As it is possible to see in the next figures, the Web App provides a very simple
    and intuitive interface. Fig. 8 illustrates the end user''s selection of inputs
    necessary to conduct a what-if analysis. The page presents a list of all available
    design parameters on the left side, and on the right side, it lists the desired
    output criteria for the analysis. Regarding input parameters, end users can select
    each one by simply checking the box next to the design parameter and subsequently
    assigning the desired values. As for output selection, end users on this page
    can choose only the specific outputs for which they want to run the analysis.
    Once the input information has been provided, end users can initiate the analysis
    by clicking the “SEND” button. Plant Simulation begins processing, and within
    few seconds, the results are returned to the end user in an intuitive and usable
    way, as shown in Fig. 9. In the Web App''s SDT module outputs page, the list of
    outputs is presented. This page specifically showcases the values of all the outputs
    that were previously selected on the input page. However, for outputs that were
    not selected, no values are displayed, and they appear in a light grey color to
    make them less prominent and easily distinguishable. Download : Download high-res

    simulation scenarios, the SME was able to identify the best configuration of input
    parameters, aimed at maximizing productivity and profitability. It is out of the
    scope of the paper to list the results of all simulation scenarios, which supported
    the SME in this decision-making. However, for the convenience of the reader some
    insights are listed below. Through the SDT Module, the SME discovered that the
    number of machines is the input factor with the most significant impact on flow
    time, especially in the manufacturing workplace which is less manual than assembly
    and packaging ones. This analysis was important in determining the number of duplicate
    machines to be placed in parallel. The number of workers to be employed for the
    manufacturing of the new product and their level of specialization (i.e., worker''s
    efficiency) were identified through a cost-benefit analysis: costs, i.e., salary
    to be paid to each of them; benefits, i.e., reduction of the flow time and increase
    in the production capacity of the plant due to the use of each additional human
    resource. Many other input parameters were determined through a careful analysis
    of the above-mentioned simulation scenarios. 5.2. FEA Module: Structural design
    optimization of the bookcase shelves This section provides a detailed description
    of the FEA Module application in order to determine the optimized thickness of
    bookcase shelves. The SME has set two key requirements for the bookcase shelves:
    uniform thickness across all shelves and a maximum deformation of 0.5 mm for each
    shelf when loaded. Uniform thickness across all shelves ensures aesthetically
    consistent among the shelves. The maximum deformation of 0.5 mm when loaded is
    a critical factor in ensuring that the shelves do not sag or bend beyond an acceptable
    limit, which could result in damage to the books or the overall structure of the
    bookcase. In order to ensure structural integrity, the SME decided to determine
    the thickness of the shelves on the worst-case scenario, defined the longest shelf,
    which is expected to experience the greatest stress and deformation under load.
    To use this module, the SME has entered relevant data through the web application,
    which has been then used as input from the FEA module. Once the analysis has been
    completed, the FEA module provided back the SME with specific KPIs such as maximum
    deformation and contour displacement, whose values determined whether further
    evaluation was required. The SME inputted data on the longest shelf (900 mm) cad
    model, max load (270 N), analysis type (linear static), material (oak), load type
    (distributed), load direction (normal to surface), and shelf degrees of freedom
    (none). The KPIs selected for calculation were the max deformation value and contour
    displacement. Upon running the analysis with a shelf thickness of 10 mm (value
    as per CAD model dimensions), the FEA module displayed a deformation level higher
    than the 0.5 mm requirement. Therefore, the analysis was repeated with a shelf
    thickness of 20 mm (through an updated of the Cad model), while all other parameters
    remained unchanged. The analysis resulted in a maximum deformation of 0.415 mm,
    which is below the specified deformation limit. In conclusion, the first run of
    the analysis did not meet the SME''s requirements, however, the second run with
    a shelf thickness of 20 mm resulted in a deformation value which satisfied the
    requirements. Based on these results, the SME could make an informed decision
    on the appropriate thickness of the bookcase shelves. Fig. 10, Fig. 11 display
    the Web App pages containing the input data and output results, respectively,
    for the final configuration of the shelf with a thickness of 20 mm, which was
    the result of the second attempt carried out by the SME. From the FEA module inputs
    page, end users have the capability to enter values for all design parameters,
    along with the option to upload the CAD model of the product to be analyzed. This
    page provides a “BROWSER” button that allows end users to select the CAD file
    from their saved location. After selecting the file, end users can initiate the
    upload process by clicking the “UPLOAD” button. Additionally, end users can choose
    the desired outputs (KPIs) for the analysis from the list of the ones implemented
    within the module. When it comes to the FEA module outputs page, the end users
    can view the list of KPIs implemented within the module. However, it''s important
    to note that results from the analysis are available for visualization only for
    those KPIs that were selected during the input process. Download : Download high-res

    which is used by the SME to optimize the cut of a number of shelves from a single
    oak panel. The SME has set two key requirements: maximizing the number of full
    set of shelves that can be cut from a single oak panel and minimizing waste. The
    NES module has been designed to meet these requirements by providing a nesting
    study that determines the most efficient way to cut the shelves from the oak panel,
    minimizing the amount of waste generated. As done for the FEA module application,
    the SME has entered the relevant data through the web application. The input data
    includes the dimensions of the oak panel raw material, which is 2 m in length
    and 2 m in depth and the type of material, which is oak. Moreover, the SME has
    also provided the CAD model of each shelf type to be cut, which in this case consists
    of 2 sub-components of dimensions 900 mm x 400 mm, 1 sub-component of dimensions
    700 mm x 400 mm, and 2 sub-components of dimensions 800 mm x 400 mm. The minimum
    number for each sub-component to be cut is also specified (two pieces each for
    shelves 900 mm and 800 mm in length and one pieces for the shelf 700 mm in length)
    as well as the minimum distance between subcomponents (0 mm in X and Y directions)
    and the cutting methodology (band sawing). The left, right, bottom and upper trim
    lines, which define the area to be trimmed, are set to zero in order to use the
    full surface of the raw material panel. Once the input data is entered through
    the web application, the NES module analyses the data and provides a 2D visualization
    of the nesting study as output. The output shows the optimized placement of the
    sub-components on the oak panel, with each sub-component represented by a rectangular
    shape. In addition, the NES module has also provided the SME with specific KPIs,
    such as the total number of sub-components that can be cut and the raw material
    panel utilization rate (in %). Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 display the web application
    page containing the input data for the NES module, while Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 show
    the output of the NES module, which is the number pieces to be cut for each component,
    the raw material utilization rate and the 2D visualization of the nesting study.
    During the input process, end users can provide input data, including CAD files
    related to the components for which nesting analysis needs to be performed. End
    users have the option to upload CAD files using the “BROWSER” and “UPLOAD” buttons.
    Additionally, they can choose to add more components by clicking the “ADD COMPONENT
    +” button, which creates a new input section for uploading another CAD file. Download

    as components quantity, raw material utilization rate, and visualization of the
    nesting study. Display buttons within the page enable end users to visualize the
    analysis results. 6. Conclusions Based on the research activities carried out,
    this study has developed a multi-purpose platform that can be used by SMEs as
    an easy-to-use support tool to run what-if analysis in order to optimize the design
    of production processes and products. The proposed platform, based on a layered
    infrastructure, combines different modules and fulfils the requirements of interoperability,
    accessibility, and usability. The platform''s layered structure was described,
    along with its Decision-Making Layer, Data Exchange Layer, and User Management
    Layer, each consisting of specific modules. The authors successfully integrated
    Plant Simulation, Autodesk Inventor Nastran, and Autodesk Inventor Nesting software
    into the platform, allowing SMEs to simulate production processes, to run finite
    element analysis, and to optimize raw material utilization. The interoperability
    and data exchange were ensured through the adoption of FIWARE, an open-source
    framework for IoT platforms, which enabled the harmonized representation of data
    formats and semantics among different applications and software within the platform.
    The research work concludes also with an application of the multi-purpose platform
    conducted by a SME, located in Calabria (Italy) and operating in the furniture
    sector. The SME in question set clear objectives to achieve optimal design and
    production of a new bookcase, with the aim of minimizing material waste, increasing
    efficiency, and maximizing profitability. The SDT module was used to model and
    simulate the production process, identifying areas where improvements could be
    made and optimizing the process for maximum efficiency and productivity. Additionally,
    the SME utilized the platform''s FEA module to conduct structural analysis of
    the bookcase design, ensuring that the bookcase shelves'' thickness was optimized
    to withstand the intended load. Finally, the NES module was utilized to optimize
    the production of shelves from a single oak panel, resulting in reduced material
    waste and increased efficiency. This case study highlights the value of utilizing
    a multi-purpose platform as an accessible and user-friendly tool to support SMEs
    in taking data-driven decisions that improve their products and production processes
    design, resulting in increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved profitability.
    In addition to the platform''s current capabilities, the modular structure of
    the platform enables the easy integration of new modules, providing further potential
    benefits for SMEs. For example, the platform could be expanded to include quality
    control and supply chain management modules, allowing SMEs to streamline their
    production processes even further and increase their competitiveness in the market.
    It''s important to note that these activities will require further research efforts;
    specifically, the selection of the software for integration within the platform
    along with the identification of the modules design parameters and KPIs needs
    to be further investigated. Another possible future development concerns the integration
    of mathematical and statistical tools (e.g., Minitab (Alin, 2010)) within the
    SDT module, with the aim of directly providing the user with easily interpretable
    graphs and improving decision-making. Furthermore, as additional potential area
    of improvement, it''s worth noting that although, theoretically, the direct and
    automatic DML inter-module (SDT/FEA/NES) data exchange is feasible, thanks to
    the integration of FIWARE, this feature has not yet been implemented. Therefore,
    to further enhance the platform capabilities, additional research efforts are
    definitely needed towards enabling direct and automatic data exchange among the
    modules. CRediT authorship contribution statement Antonio Cimino: Conceptualization,

  description: Film mulching with deficit irrigation is considered an effective way
    to maximize water productivity and ensure a stable crop yield in the arid region
    of Northwest China. Deficit irrigation requires precise knowledge of crop response
    to drought conditions, whereas the canopy temperature and the related crop water
    stress index (CWSI) monitor crop water stress status. Although canopy temperature
    and CWSI are closely related to meteorological conditions, cultivation measure
    and crop growing conditions, it is unclear how film mulching influences the canopy
    temperature and CWSI. A two-year field experiment was conducted in a maize field
    with three irrigation levels and different film mulching conditions, i.e., non-mulching,
    plastic film mulching and biodegradable film mulching treatments, in the Shiyang
    River Basin of Northwest China. The study aimed to quantify the effects of film
    mulching on canopy temperature and CWSI, as well as to compare CWSI values obtained
    from the nearby meteorological station data (CWSI_M), and in situ (field) measurements
    (CWSI_I). The results showed that plastic film and biodegradable film significantly
    (p < 0.05) reduced the canopy temperature. The non-water-stressed baseline based
    on the air temperature and relative humidity of the nearby meteorological station
    was significantly (p < 0.05) different from those of the field measurement at
    both the vegetative and the reproductive stages. No significant differences in
    the non-water-stressed baselines (p > 0.05) were observed among different film
    mulching conditions. CWSI was calculated using the air temperature and relative
    humidity data from the aforementioned two sources. The results revealed showing
    that CWSI_I better correlated with the crop yields of various treatments when
    compared to CWSI_M. Irrigation scheduling based on CWSI_I could save 83 mm of
    irrigation amount. This underscore the preference of using CWSI_I (if available)
    as the primary choice for irrigation scheduling. These findings highlight the
    impact of meteorological and planting conditions on the canopy temperature, non-water-stressed
    baseline and CWSI, which may be valuable for diagnosing crop water status more
    accurately by regional water managers.

    Film mulching with deficit irrigation is considered an effective way to maximize
    water productivity and ensure a stable crop yield in the arid region of Northwest
    China. Deficit irrigation requires precise knowledge of crop response to drought
    conditions, whereas the canopy temperature and the related crop water stress index
    (CWSI) monitor crop water stress status. Although canopy temperature and CWSI
    are closely related to meteorological conditions, cultivation measure and crop
    growing conditions, it is unclear how film mulching influences the canopy temperature
    and CWSI. A two-year field experiment was conducted in a maize field with three
    irrigation levels and different film mulching conditions, i.e., non-mulching,
    plastic film mulching and biodegradable film mulching treatments, in the Shiyang
    River Basin of Northwest China. The study aimed to quantify the effects of film
    mulching on canopy temperature and CWSI, as well as to compare CWSI values obtained
    from the nearby meteorological station data (CWSI_M), and in situ (field) measurements

    of the three major grain crops in China and is thus crucial for food security
    in the country (Ali et al., 2020, Jiang et al., 2014, Ran et al., 2017). Located
    in the Hexi Corridor region, the Shiyang River Basin is an important maize production
    region in the arid area of Northwest China. It has an annual precipitation of
    150–300 mm and an annual potential evaporation of 1300–2000 mm. Farmland irrigation
    water use accounts for more than 80 % of the total water use in the basin (Kang
    et al., 2003, Li et al., 2020, Shi et al., 2018). The shortage of water resources
    has become a key factor restricting crop production and agricultural development
    in this basin. Increasing irrigation water use efficiency is crucial for the sustainable
    development of agriculture and economy (Karthe et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2018,
    Yang et al., 2022). The technique of plastic film mulching intended to improve
    crop water productivity has been applied extensively in the semi-arid areas of
    Northwest China (Fan et al., 2019, Li et al., 2013, Rosa et al., 2021, Zhang et
    al., 2021). Several studies have shown that the combination of plastic film mulching
    and deficit irrigation under traditional drip irrigation could both save water
    and ensure a higher yield (Bo et al., 2022, Datta et al., 2022, Zhao et al., 2020).
    Deficit irrigation is defined as the deliberate application of water at a rate
    lower than the crop water requirement to balance yield and irrigation water productivity
    (Cui et al., 2008, Fereres and Soriano, 2007, Romero-Trigueros et al., 2017).
    Evidence suggests that deficit irrigation can enhance the function of guard cells
    and thereby decrease water loss through transpiration and increase the ratio of
    photosynthesis to transpiration (Schroeder et al., 2001, Shabani et al., 2013,
    Sun et al., 2013). Deficit irrigation can also induce improvement of morphological
    traits, e.g., increased root to shoot ratio and improved nutrient uptake and recovery
    (Chai et al., 2015). However, in a practical application, crop response to deficit
    irrigation is influenced by many factors, e.g., the stage of crop growth, irrigation
    frequency and method of deficit implementation (Li et al., 2022). To avoid severe
    yield reduction and excessive cost of irrigation equipment, a scientific understanding
    of the mechanisms involved in physiological and biochemical processes is needed
    before adopting deficit irrigation (Chai et al., 2015). Therefore, it is important
    to apply effective methods for monitoring crop water stress status to better understand
    and to save water (Geerts and Raes, 2009, Han et al., 2016). Hence, obtaining
    accurate and real-time information regarding crop water stress status is critical
    for successful deficit irrigation implementation. Methods of monitoring crop water
    stress rely on the measurements of soil moisture, the photosynthetic rate, and
    crop characteristics (e.g. the crop height and the leaf area index) (Ben-Gal et
    al., 2009). Most of these methods are time consuming, laborious and, in some cases,
    destructive to plants. Because these measurements are often limited to a small
    portion of the field, the results might not be representative of the actual crop
    water needs or the overall field moisture conditions (Ihuoma and Madramootoo,
    2017). The canopy temperature (Tc) has long been recognized as an indicator of
    plant water status (DeJonge et al., 2015, Fan et al., 2005, Han et al., 2016,
    Jackson et al., 1981, Osroosh et al., 2016). With the development of remote sensing
    technology, measuring canopy temperature via remote sensing technology to diagnose
    the crop water deficit has more promising applications than most of other methods
    (Bellvert et al., 2016, Osroosh et al., 2016). The crop water stress index (CWSI)
    based on canopy temperature is a method for quantifying water status to inform
    irrigation scheduling (King et al., 2016). It has been used for monitoring plant
    water status, detecting the onset of moisture stress, predicting yield, and scheduling
    irrigation for different crops (Akkuzu et al., 2013, Bellvert et al., 2016, Kumar
    et al., 2019, Yildirim et al., 2013). Two popular models are available in the
    literature for calculating the CWSI: the Idso empirical model and the Jackson
    theoretical model (Idso et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1981). The calculation of
    the CWSI based on Jackson’s model requires more environmental variables than those
    based on Idso’s, for example, an estimation of the crop minimum surface resistance
    at the time of the potential transpiration. Compared with the theoretical method,
    the empirical method is easier to apply as it requires canopy temperature, air
    temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RH). The main difficulty that limits its
    use is the establishment of the baselines, including the non-water-stressed baseline
    (NWSB), which represents a fully watered crop, and the maximum stressed baseline,
    which corresponds to a non-transpiring crop (stomata completely closed). The relationship
    between Tc-Ta and air vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for well irrigated trees was
    used to establish the NWSB which defines the lower limit for a given evaporative
    demand (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014). Different crops could show different NWSBs
    and maximum stressed baselines (Idso, 1982). The canopy temperature of wheat varies
    greatly among genotypes, resulting in different CWSI baselines (Fan et al., 2005).
    Differences in baselines can exist for the same crop at different stages of crop
    growth in CWSI calculation (Bernardo et al., 2007, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008). Previous
    studies showed that crop varieties, crop growth and development conditions, and
    soil physical and chemical properties could greatly influence the CWSI baseline
    establishment (Testi et al., 2008, Yazar et al., 1999). In addition, the differences
    in the baselines of the CWSI might stem from various climate conditions. Some
    researchers concluded that solar radiation, wind speed and cloud cover could affect
    canopy temperature, thus causing a variation in the baselines (Jensen et al.,
    1990, Payero and Irmak, 2006, Testi et al., 2008). Film mulching changes the microclimates
    of farmlands, which could affect canopy temperature and CWSI. Collecting Ta and
    RH from nearby meteorological stations is convenient. However, the ambient environmental
    conditions differ from the targeted farmland, especially under film mulching (Tarara,
    2000), which could induce errors in estimating the CWSI. Hence, the impacts of
    environmental microclimatic variations and cultivation measures on canopy temperature
    and CWSI deserves dedicated study and thorough analysis. With the abovementioned
    aspects taken into consideration, the objectives of this study were (i) to investigate
    how film mulching affects canopy temperature; (ii) to compare the impact of different
    data sources (the Ta and RH from a nearby meteorological station or from in situ
    field measurements) on the NWSB and CWSI; and (iii) to examine the impact of different
    film mulching types on the NWSB and CWSI. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experiment
    location A two-year field study was carried out in 2020 and 2021. This field experiment
    was conducted at the National Field Scientific Observation and Research Station
    on Efficient Water Use of Oasis Agriculture in Wuwei of Gansu Province of China
    (37°52′N, 102°52′E, altitude: 1581 m). The mean annual precipitation is 164 mm,
    and the mean annual pan evaporation is 2000 mm. The average annual duration of
    sunshine is 3000 h, the mean annual Ta is 8 °C and the mean annual air cumulative
    temperature (> 0 °C) is 3550 °C (He et al., 2018, Qin et al., 2018, Ran et al.,
    2017). The soil classification is silt loam. The groundwater table is 40–50 m
    below the ground surface. 2.2. Experiment design Xianyu 335, a major spring maize
    cultivar in the region, was planted in 27 plots (8 m × 5.6 m) with a crop row
    spacing of 40 cm and a plant spacing of 25 cm. The experimental treatments (Fig.
    S1) included non-mulching (NM), transparent polyethylene plastic film mulching
    (PM), and biodegradable film mulching (BM) under three drip irrigation levels:
    full irrigation (FI) (Table S1), medium irrigation (MI, 70 %FI), and low irrigation
    (LI, 40 %FI). Drip lines were placed between every two rows of spring maize with
    a spacing of 80 cm. Drippers were located every 30 cm along the drip lines and
    the discharge rate was 2.5 L·h–1. Nine treatments (the location of each treatment
    was unchanged in the two experimental years) with three replicates were arranged
    in a completely randomized design. During the experimental period, the crop was
    irrigated about every 10 days from June 13, 2020 (or June 11, 2021) to September
    3, 2020 (or August 27, 2021). The basal fertilization was adopted according to
    the local fertilization practice. Each plot received a basal dose of fertilizer
    before planting (68 kg·N ha−1), and they all received the same amounts of fertilizer
    at the jointing stage (209 kg·N ha−1). 2.3. Meteorological data and field data
    collection Meteorological data (solar radiation, the wind speed, Ta and RH) were
    monitored at an automatic meteorological station (Hobo, Onset Computer Corp.,
    Bourne, MA, USA). The station was located about 300 m from the experimental field.
    The canopy temperature, Ta and RH were collected simultaneously in the field from
    the jointing stage to the filling stage of maize. Data from meteorological station
    were measured at the same time with the same frequency. The Ta and RH were collected
    with a temperature and humidity sensor (WS-C, Penhe Ellectronic Technology Co.,
    Shanghai, China). The temperature measurement range of the sensor is − 40 to 80
    °C with a sensitivity of 0.1 °C and an accuracy of ± 0.1 °C. The sensitivity and
    accuracy of the RH are 0.1 % ± 0.1 %, respectively. The data (the Ta and RH) from
    the sensors installed in the field were calibrated with the data from the meteorological
    station. The sensor installed in the field was first located near the temperature
    and humidity sensors at the automatic meteorological station, and the Ta and RH
    values were obtained by measuring them together for 48 h continuously. The regression
    formula of the Ta was set up between the values from two origins of meteorological
    data, and so was the regression equation of the RH, (1) Ta_M = 0·98(±0·01) Ta_I
    + 0·66(±0·19) (N=192, R2=0·99, p < 0·001) (2) RHM = 0·92(±0·01) RHI + 5·43(±0·70)
    (N=192, R2=0·97, p < 0·001) where the Ta_M and Ta_I are air temperature (℃) from
    a nearby automatic meteorological station and a temperature and humidity sensor
    of situ field, respectively. The RHM and RHI are relative humidity ( %) from a
    nearby automatic meteorological station and a temperature and humidity sensor
    of situ field, respectively. Then, regression formulas were used to calibrate
    the values from the sensors (the Ta and RH) installed in the field for more accurate
    results. An infrared thermal imager (as explained below) was used to measure canopy
    temperature. Images of the canopy of spring maize were captured using an infrared
    thermal imager (UTi160V, UNI-T, China) with a 320 × 240 pixel focal plane array
    and a 30 × 23 field of view lens. The temperature measurement range of the thermal
    camera is − 20 to 350 °C with a sensitivity of 0.1 °C and an accuracy of ± 2 °C.
    The emissivity for the measurements of plant canopies was set at 0.97. Infrared
    thermal images were collected at solar noon (12:00–14:00) on sunny and cloudless
    days. Fixed observation points were set in the field, and a chair 1 m height was
    used to extend the sensor height. The height difference between the crop canopy
    and the imager was about 0.5 m at an angle of 15° with respect to the horizon.
    The imager’s height was adapted according to the growth stage of maize. Maximum
    height difference between the ground and the imager was about 2.5 m. The camera
    was held in a position facing east or west to avoid a shadow in the measurement
    area (maize planted in a north-south direction). Glnfrared analysis (UNI-T, China)
    (https://meters.uni-trend.com.cn/) was used to evaluate the maximum, minimum and
    average temperature on the infrared thermal images. 2.4. Calculation of crop water
    stress index The empirical form of the CWSI based on the NWSB was applied to evaluate
    the water stress condition of maize in the study region. According to Idso’s definition
    (Idso et al., 1981), the CWSI can be expressed as, (3) where the ΔTMWS is the
    maximum difference in the canopy and air temperature that is representative of
    a water-stressed crop (the maximum stressed baseline), and the ΔTNWS is the lower
    bound of the canopy and air temperature difference that is representative of a
    well-watered crop (the non-water-stressed baseline). The ΔTNWS was calculated
    using canopy temperature under full irrigation treatment, and the data were screened
    to ensure that the temperature value of each plot used to calculate the ΔTNWS
    were not in a state of water stress. In this study, the Ta and RH were collected
    from a nearby meteorological station and a temperature and humidity sensor in
    the experimental field. The formula for calculating CWSI_M is as follows: (4)
    (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) where es_M (Ta_M) is the saturated vapor pressure (kPa) at
    the air temperature Ta_M; ea_M is the actual vapor pressure (kPa); VPDM is the
    air vapor pressure deficit (kPa), which was obtained from the RHM and Ta_M (Gu
    et al., 2021), and nM (slope) and bM (intercept) are the linear regression coefficients
    of the lower limit canopy and air temperature difference on the VPDM; VPGM is
    the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated at Ta_M and Ta_M
    + bM. The ΔTNWS_M and VPDM relationships denoted using NWSB_M. The nM and bM from
    Eq. (7) were used for the calculation of the ΔTMWS_M (Eq. (8)), the maximum stressed
    baseline of the CWSI is based on Idso et al. (1981); also Taghvaeian et al. (2014).
    The formula for calculating CWSI_I using the in situ meteorological data follows
    the same procedure. The formula for calculating CWSI_I is as follows: (10) where
    the ΔTNWS_I and VPDI (the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated
    at Ta_I and Ta_I + bI) relationships denoted using NWSB_I. 2.5. Methods and analysis
    SPSS 20.0 software (IBM, Inc., USA) was used for an analysis of variance (ANOVA).
    The ANOVA was conducted with mulching condition and irrigation level as fixed
    factors to compare the effects of different mulching conditions, irrigation levels
    and their interactions on maize canopy temperature and CWSI. Linear regression
    was applied to analyze the relationship between the VPD and the Tc-Ta. To test
    whether a difference existed between the NWSBs, the application “Compare Linear
    Fitting Parameters and Data Set” in OriginPro 2021 (OriginLab Software, Inc.,
    USA) was used to analyze the covariance (ANCOVA). When the slopes or intercepts
    of the relationship between Tc-Ta and VPD were significantly different between
    the sources of meteorological data, we concluded that NWSB_M and NWSB_I are significantly
    different, i.e., the source of meteorological data had a significant effect on
    NWSB and CWSI. The coefficient of determination (R2) was employed as a metric
    to assess the quality of the fit. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Response of canopy
    temperature to field mulching conditions The average meteorological data during
    the maize growth stages in 2020 and 2021 are summarized in Table 1. Both the net
    solar radiation and Ta initially rose and then fell during the daytime, reaching
    the maximum values (about 600–850 W m−2 and 28–38 °C) at around 12:30–14:30 (data
    not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, with a minimum average canopy temperature of 30.5 °C,
    water stress was minimized under the BMFI treatment (biodegradable film mulching
    and full irrigation). Water stress was largest under the NMLI treatment (non-mulching
    and low irrigation), with a maximum average canopy temperature of 34.4 °C. During
    the entire crop growth period, maize average canopy temperature of both plastic
    film and biodegradable film mulching treatments were lower than the non-mulching
    treatment under the same irrigation level (Fig. 1). This effect was shown to be
    significant. That is, both film mulching types and irrigation levels significantly
    (p < 0.05) affected the maize canopy temperature. Table 1. Average daily meteorological

    image Fig. 1. Average canopy temperature of maize throughout the entire growth
    period in 2020 (a) and 2021 (b) under different treatments. Note: The text inside
    the figures reflects the outcomes of the statistical analysis regarding the impacts
    of film mulching types, irrigation levels, and the interplay between film mulching
    and irrigation levels on canopy temperature. Data bars and error bars illustrate
    the mean (n = 10) and standard error of canopy temperature during the entire maize
    growth period for each treatment. Film mulching may impact crop canopy temperature
    in three ways. First, film mulching promotes the growth and photosynthesis of
    maize (Duan, 2020, Duan et al., 2018) as it enhances soil temperature and reduces
    evaporation losses (He et al., 2018, Ran et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2017, Yang
    et al., 2012). Positive effect supported by the fact that the leaf area and canopy
    coverage of maize under film mulching were greater than that without film mulching
    during the growing season (Fig. S2). The larger transpiration area of leaves can
    further promote transpiration and accelerate latent heat loss, thus decreasing
    canopy temperature (Azad et al., 2007, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2019, Hu et al.,
    2021). Second, film mulching can affect the microclimate environment surrounding
    crops by modifying the surface reflectance and absorptivity (Idso, 1977, Tarara,
    2000). The surface reflectance of the plastic film is higher than that of bare
    soil (Ham and Kluitenberg, 1994, Liakatas et al., 1986). Cebula (1995) demonstrated
    that twice as much reflected photosynthetically active radiation was measured
    above plastic mulch than above bare soil in a pepper canopy, potentially increasing
    the heat load on the canopy. Third, in the understory surface energy balance,
    film mulching can lower the latent heat flux by suppressing soil evaporation (Zhao
    et al., 2021), and it can weaken the sensible heat exchange between the soil surface
    and the canopy atmosphere. This potentially leads to a higher canopy temperature
    (Qin, 2020, Tarara, 2000, Zhao, 2021). Previous studies (Liu et al., 2010) showed
    that at higher soil temperature after film mulching the early growth and development
    of maize accelerated, resulting in increased consumption of nutrients and water,
    which decreased the availability of the supply of resources for the late reproductive
    period (Qi et al., 2022, Zhou and Feng, 2020). Film mulching caused an high soil
    temperature of the root zone during the flowering and filling stage of maize in
    the studies of Yin et al. (2020) and Bu et al. (2013), which could lead to early
    root and leaf senescence in the later stage. Therefore, the photosynthesis of
    crops was relatively weak in the late filling stage. When the photosynthetic and
    transpiration rates were reduced, this could have resulted in a relatively high
    canopy temperature. Thus, in combination with previous studies (Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2019, Poirier-Pocovi and Bailey, 2020, Taghvaeian et al., 2014), the difference
    in canopy temperature was the product of the combination of environmental ecological
    conditions and the status of the plants. Tillage practices and cultivation methods
    influenced the difference in the crop canopy temperature. This is a phenomenon
    that requires further in-depth study. 3.2. Comparison of NWSBs and CWSI from a
    nearby meteorological station and field measurements NWSBs for different growth
    stages of maize were obtained using the Ta and RH from field measurements or from
    a meteorological station near the experimental site, which were denoted by NWSB_I
    and NWSB_M, respectively. Fig. 2 shows NWSBs for the vegetative and reproductive
    growth stages of maize in 2020 and 2021. The R2 values of the NWSB regression
    equations for the vegetative and reproductive stages were 0.53, 0.70 for the NWSB_I,
    and 0.81, 0.71 for the NWSB_M, respectively, indicating that the NWSB_I and NWSB_M
    were suitable for estimating the CWSI for maize in the study region. During the
    vegetative growth stage of maize (Fig. 2(a)), both the slope (p < 0.05) and intercept
    (p < 0.01) of the two NWSBs were significantly different, which means that the
    NWSB_I and NWSB_M were significantly different. During the reproductive growth
    stage of maize (Fig. 2(b)), both the slope (p < 0.01) and intercept (p < 0.001)
    of the two NWSBs were significantly different. Therefore, NWSB_I and NWSB_M of
    the reproductive growth stage of maize were also significantly different. Download

    humidity (RH) at vegetative stage (a) and reproductive stage (b) of maize from
    pooled data of 2020 and 2021 cropping seasons. Note: NWSB_I and NWSB_M are NWSBs
    calculated by field measured data and from meteorological data, respectively.
    The slopes and intercepts between NWSB_M and NWSB_I are compared with the ANCOVA
    test at vegetative stage (a) and reproductive stage (b), respectively. Significance
    level: *, **, and *** represent significance at p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001.
    The origin (measurement location) of the weather data affected the values of the
    NWSBs (Zhang et al., 2018). This was probably because the NWSBs were sensitive
    to water stress, and at the same time, they retained sensitivity to ambient environmental
    conditions (e.g., Ta, RH and radiation) (Yazar et al., 1999). Previous studies
    by Poirier-Pocovi and Bailey (2020) and Taghvaeian et al. (2014) suggested that
    different solar radiation, wind speed and cloudiness values affected the value
    of Tc-Ta, thus altering the slope and intercept of the NWSB. Testi et al. (2008)
    found that the slopes and intercepts of the NWSBs were not identical for crops
    in three wind speed ranges (less than 2.7 m s−1, 2.7–3.5 m s−1, more than 3.5 m s−1).
    The intercept of NWSBs under cloudy conditions were generally lower than those
    established under sunny conditions, and this difference averaged 3.8 °C (Idso,
    1982). In this study, the meteorological station was 300 m away from the experimental
    site, and the crop grown nearby was alfalfa. It was grown under the single cultivation
    condition (without film mulching and the rain-fed condition). The field microclimate
    of meteorological station was completely different compared with the experimental
    maize fields with three film mulching conditions and three irrigation levels.
    These could partly explain the significant difference between the NWSB_M and NWSB_I.
    Therefore, it was necessary to establish separate NWSBs based on the observation
    methods of the Ta and RH (e.g., from a meteorological station next to the experimental
    site, or from field measurements) for the CWSI calculation. Furthermore, the NWSB
    obtained for the post-tasseling stage (reproductive stage) showed a smaller slope
    compared with the pre- tasseling stage (vegetative stage) under the same origin
    of the weather data (Fig. 2). This might be because the leaf area index reached
    the highest values after filling (which were 6.71, 6.31 and 6.20 under the FI,
    MI and LI, respectively.). Also, the fully formed maize tassel, silks and cobs
    reduced the transpiration cooling at the surface of the canopy. Kumar et al. (2019)
    found that the NWSB obtained for the post-flowering stage of the Indian mustard
    showed a milder slope compared with the pre-flowering stage. They explained that
    flowering heads effectively reduced the relative transpiration cooling at the
    canopy surface. Similar findings for wheat by Gontia and Tiwari (2008) showed
    a decrease in the slope of the NWSB after seed-head formation (the post-heading
    stage) compared with the pre-heading stage. This was due to the fact that seed
    heads provided effective aerodynamic resistance against sensible heat transfer
    on the transpiring surface (Fritschen et al., 1964), which caused lower evaporative
    cooling for a given incremental increase in the VPD. Fig. 3, Fig. 4 show that
    the CWSI was calculated based on data from the meteorological station next to
    the experimental site and field measurements, respectively. Because the monitoring
    of canopy temperature started on July 10, 2020, and July 4, 2021, respectively,
    when the crop coverage rate reached 85 %, the CWSI values shown in Fig. 3, Fig.
    4 are also during this period. The CWSI values near 0 represented no stress conditions,
    whereas those near 1 represented maximum stress conditions. Download : Download

    CWSI_I, obtained from field monitoring, appeared to reflect the differences among
    different irrigation levels across all growth stages much better than CWSI_M (from
    a nearby meteorological station) did (Table 2). The microclimate of the meteorological
    station was different from the experimental maize fields and may not represent
    the actual Ta and RH of the latter, which is consistent with the studies of (Ihuoma
    and Madramootoo, 2017, Taghvaeian et al., 2014). Table 2. The ANOVA of CWSI_M

    was consistently significant (p < 0.05) in affecting the CWSI from the jointing

    (p < 0.05) in affecting the CWSI at the jointing stage of maize in 2020 and 2021.
    No interaction between film mulching and water stress on the CWSI was found (Table
    2). The relationships between average CWSI_M and CWSI_I and yields (Fig. 5 (a))
    and irrigation amount (Fig. 5 (b)) are shown in Fig. 5. Both the average CWSI_M

    by field measured data and meteorological data, respectively. Significance level:
    * and *** represent significance at p < 0.05 and p < 0.001. The CWSI_I effectively
    reflected the trends of differences among irrigation treatments and also accurately
    quantified the slight differences between irrigation volumes (Gu et al., 2021,
    Kumar et al., 2019, Pagay and Kidman, 2019). It was observed that the values of
    the CWSI decreased after effective irrigation/rainfall, then rose slowly, responding
    to irrigation/rainfall events. This was probably because after a wetting event
    (irrigation/rainfall), the soil moisture increased and water stress on the maize
    was alleviated significantly. Then, the CWSI value decreased (Erdem et al., 2010,
    Irmak et al., 2000). The negative or zero value of CWSI indicated that the crop
    was not experiencing any water stresses as explained by Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2019)
    for transpiring at the potential rate. Kumar et al. (2019) suggested that irrigation
    should be provided when the CWSI value exceeds 0.4 to alleviate crop stress and
    ensure seed yields, thus maximizing the water productivity. To avoid water stress
    on maize, irrigation was applied whenever CWSI exceeds 0.4, in which case irrigation
    scheduling based on CWSI_I could save 83 mm of irrigation amount compared with
    that based on CWSI_M. We also found that the maize yield had a higher correlation
    with the CWSI_I (R2 =0.76) and the absolute value of the slope of the regression
    line between irrigation amount and CWSI_I was greater compared with the CWSI_M
    (Fig. 5). Therefore, the CWSI_I should be the first choice over the CWSI_M for
    irrigation scheduling. 3.3. NWSBs under different film mulching types Fig. 6 shows
    the NWSBs that were established under different film mulching types based on meteorological
    data (NWSB_M). Fig. 7 shows the NWSBs which were established under different film
    mulching types based on the field measured data (NWSB_I). As can be seen, the
    slopes and intercepts of the NWSBs did not significantly differ between different
    film mulching conditions. Download : Download high-res image (281KB) Download

    2020 and 2021 cropping seasons. Note: Significance level: ns means no significant
    difference (p < 0.05). Previous research showed that five factors might cause
    differences between the NWSBs of the same crop. They are (1) the observation sites
    for the Ta and RH (Han et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2018); (2) the observation
    angle of a handheld infrared thermometer (Yazar et al., 1999); (3) the crop varieties
    (Bellvert et al., 2016, Gutiérrez-Gordillo et al., 2020); (4) the crop growth
    stage (Bellvert et al., 2016, Gu et al., 2021); and (5) the influence of meteorological
    factors (such as the wind speed and cloud cover) (Taghvaeian et al., 2014). Among
    these factors, the first three factors can be avoided if the same methods for
    calculating the NWSBs are selected. Meanwhile, the influence of the last two factors
    were not easily eliminated, which could cause the differences in the NWSBs. Our
    results support this view. Among the latter two factors, no consistent conclusion
    has been reached regarding which is the dominant factor, for example, cultivation
    practices or climatic differences (Poirier-Pocovi and Bailey, 2020). This study
    showed no significant effect of different film mulching conditions on NWSBs, whereas
    significant differences were found when NWSBs were calculated using meteorological
    data (i.e., Ta and RH) from meteorological stations or field measurements, respectively.
    This provides a reference for suitable NWSB establishment by distinguishing the
    main influencing factors. 4. Conclusions During the growing seasons of 2020 and
    2021, we studied the impacts of different film mulching conditions and data (i.e.,
    Ta and RH) sources on canopy temperature, NWSB and CWSI in maize fields in the
    Shiyang River Basin of Northwest China. The main conclusions were as follows.
    (1) Both plastic and biodegradable film mulching treatments significantly reduced
    canopy temperature of maize compared to non-mulching treatment (p < 0.05). Canopy
    temperature under biodegradable film mulching treatment was generally lower than
    that of plastic film mulching treatment, with no significant difference. (2) The
    NWSB_M and NWSB_I of the CWSI based on the Ta and RH from the meteorological stations
    and field monitoring were significantly different (p < 0.05). The CWSI_I exhibited
    a stronger correlation (R2 =0.76) with the crop yields of various treatments compared
    to CWSI_M. Consequently, using CWSI_M for irrigation scheduling could save 83 mm
    irrigation amount when compared to using CWSI I. (3) No significant differences
    were observed between NWSBs with different film mulching conditions, indicating
    that consistent water stress baselines could be applied for the same growth stages.

    With the development of remote sensing technology, numerous high-spatial-resolution
    remote sensing images can be obtained through sensors installed on aircraft or
    satellites (Huang et al. 2018). The automatic extraction of multiple objects from
    aerial and satellite images is important in many applications such as land use
    analysis (Alshehhi et al. 2017). Recently, remote sensing researchers have used
    various sensors and extracted images to study classification tasks. In particular,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be equipped with still and video cameras as
    well as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), multispectral, hyperspectral, and
    thermal infrared sensors, and they can quickly acquire various images of the ground
    data with a high resolution and a wide spectral band range. From various remote
    sensing data to extract land cover information, such as aerial photos, satellite
    images, hyperspectral images, thermal images, radar and laser datasets, which
    have different resolutions in spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal (Jensen
    2015). Owing to the difference between acquisition of data and the use of sensors,
    even for similar or identical applications, these practices are quite disparate,
    and compared with traditional image acquisition methods, the use of UAVs offer
    greater flexibility (Yao et al. 2019). UAVs are lightweight aerial vehicles that
    are equipped with observation sensors and can be operated, through various ground-based
    control systems, without a pilot on board (Nex and Remondino 2014). UAVs comprise
    three main systems: the aircraft, a ground control station, and a payload system.
    The aircraft is the complete aerial vehicle system without the payload system
    and is capable of flying and takeoff and landing. The ground control station refers
    to the system on the ground that can receive real-time information transmitted
    by the UAV and its payload system; the ground control station can display UAV-related
    information to the operator for the operation of the UAV and payload system. The
    payload system refers to any equipment that can be installed on the UAV to carry
    out a specific mission. UAV remote sensing has also accelerated data collection
    and aided the monitoring of task implementation (Unger et al. 2014). Because of
    improvements are in spatial and temporal resolution, UAV remote sensing technology
    has gained considerable advantages in small areas to study various land covers.
    For example, classification of wetland land cover (Liu and Abd-Elrahman 2018),
    urban land use classification (Zhang et al. 2018), and land cover mapping (Horning
    et al. 2020). Because UAVs have only been recently adopted as an emerging vehicle
    of aerial photography, satellite image data are still more commonly used to classify
    ground surface structures (Ahmad 2012; Guo et al. 2011). In particular, satellite
    image classifications are commonly used to study a particular crop or structure,
    such as in the identification of orange orchards or tea plantations (Amoros-Lopez
    et al. 2011; Chuang and Shiu 2016) and the extraction of roads (Riahi Bakhtiari
    et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2020). The improvement of resolution and data convenience
    of remote sensors as well as the advancement of machine learning classification
    techniques have contributed to the maturity of applications of satellite images
    in classifying of ground surface structures. However, satellite remote sensing
    faces a constraint in terms of revisiting the same area on a frequent basis, which
    poses a challenge to achieving high temporal resolution (Suomalainen et al. 2014).
    With respect to spatial resolution, UAV images are generally superior to satellite
    images (Vetrivel et al. 2015). Dong and Shan (2013) reported that compared with
    the increasing number of types of aerial photographic image substitutes, satellite
    images are limited by their spatial resolution. Moreover, most classification
    methods are based on supervised learning, which requires many training samples
    to establish accurate models. In addition, spatial resolution is a crucial factor
    in determining classification detail and accuracy (Chen et al. 2004) and in the
    selection of classification methods (Atkinson and Aplin 2004). Standard methods
    using various types of satellite imagery (with different spectral and spatial
    resolutions) have not fully achieved accurate land use and land cover (LULC) mapping,
    but the utilization of high-resolution UAV images presents an opportunity for
    improved mapping (Yao et al. 2019). When selecting telemetry data for land cover
    classification, resolution plays a crucial role, with a preference for high-resolution
    imagery. One of the major strengths of UAV surveys is their ability to rapidly
    provide non-destructive information with a high spatial resolution, allowing for
    detailed detection of features variations (Ronchetti et al. 2020). Particularly,
    very high-resolution images are advantageous for extracting geometric and contextual
    features, enabling detailed LULC classification (Yang et al. 2010). Therefore,
    the ultra-high resolution offered by UAV imagery acquired at low altitudes is
    well-suited for LULC mapping (Kalantar et al. 2017). Furthermore, the development
    of UAV platforms and various sensors has stimulated the application of remote
    sensing, and advanced data analysis technologies developed in the fields of computer
    vision and machine learning have facilitated automated UAV data analysis (Yao
    et al. 2019). Moreover, the high accuracy of machine learning in classification
    images is supported by the use of UAVs in supplying the dataset. UAV remote sensing
    images feature relatively low cost, high mobility, high spatial and temporal resolution,
    and less susceptibility to interference from low-altitude clouds. These benefits
    are favorable considerations for acquiring remote sensing images in this study.
    Machine learning methods in the field of remote sensing primarily concentrate
    on image classification. For example, a weighted approach combining multiple machine
    learning techniques improved classification accuracy in mapping susceptibility
    (Achu et al. 2021). However, the theoretical basis varies among learning algorithms,
    leading to significant variability in image classification. Support vector machine
    (SVM) is a nonparametric classifier and the most commonly used image classification
    and recognition method in the previous decades. SVM is the best classifier for
    small-scale training datasets because of its optimal generalization capacity,
    which enables the algorithm to work with small training samples (Mountrakis et
    al. 2011). Chi et al. (2008) used a small training dataset to conduct differentiation
    analysis on SVM land-cover classification. In addition, SVM has the advantages
    of high classification accuracy, the availability of high-dimensional space, and
    the ability to use small training datasets (Pal and Foody 2010). These advantages
    enable the algorithm to perform correctly in cases with complicated terrain or
    multiple categories of structures. For example, La et al. (2015) selected five
    feature categories, namely tree, grass, water, agriculture, and man-made structures,
    for the SVM classification procedure; tree areas were extracted from hyperspectral
    images, and 92% of low-density forests were detected in the results. Chuang and
    Shiu (2016) compared between SVM, random forest (RF), maximum likelihood (ML),
    and logistic regression with respect to accuracy in tea plantation classification,
    determining that SVM was the most accurate (84.7%). RF is capable of processing
    high-dimensional feature spaces through only light computation and is insensitive
    to noise from training samples (Belgiu and Drăguţ 2016). RF was chosen as the
    classifier because of its ability to operate at high efficiency in large datasets
    and measure the feature importance of each category (Guo et al. 2011). RF has
    been widely applied to multiple image-classification (Ludwig et al. 2016; Pham
    et al. 2016). Other classifiers used to classify feature images include the machine
    learning algorithms of ML (Ahmad 2012). ML is a supervised classification method,
    based on Bayes’ theorem, that uses the discriminant function to assign pixels
    to the maximum-likelihood category. In other words, the technique uses the training
    sample to derive an optimal probability model for the conduct of classification.
    When sufficient training samples become available and the dataset feature exhibits
    a normal distribution, ML can generate accurate classification results (Lu et
    al. 2004). Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning technique that
    is suitable for use in cases where computational resources are low. Furthermore,
    as the number of very high resolution remote images continue to increase, a simply
    yet effective and highly automated image-classification technique is needed. Therefore,
    the concept of unsupervised examination has become of utmost necessary. Unsupervised
    classification requires only simple statistical methods to conduct image classification
    and is therefore capable of (relatively) quickly determining the number of clusters
    required for classification. Anchang et al. (2016) used two fully unsupervised
    techniques (the Jenks algorithm with agglomerative hierarchical clustering) to
    extract the coverage of trees, bushes, and ground vegetation from the soil adjusted
    vegetation index based on IKONOS images. Leichtle et al. (2017) adopted k-means
    clustering to differentiate changed from unchanged buildings. A particularly powerful
    example, convolutional neural network (CNN), is a vision-based deep learning method,
    which can automatically identify image features and has been used extensively
    in image applications. The main difference between the deep learning CNN methods
    and traditional machine learning is that CNNs use deeper networks with more parameters
    to perform classification tasks, requiring intensive computation to build models
    from the training data. CNN needs to continuously adjust the number of network
    layers, the number and size of filters, and set hyperparameters, such as learning
    rate, activation function, and loss function, and consider more epochs. Through
    the process of repeated training and testing, an optimal classification model
    can be constructed. However, one of the main problems with deep learning methods
    is the black box nature of the hidden layer, which leads to insufficient interpretability
    (Habib et al. 2009). Another limitation is the high reliance on the availability
    of large amounts of high-quality ground real data, as well as the processing process
    requiring expertise and dedicated hardware to implement CNNs, resulting in high
    computational costs (Sheykhmousa et al. 2020). Overall, this study did not use
    advanced convolutional neural networks for the following reasons: (1) Data availability
    and size: CNNs often require a large amount of labeled training data to achieve
    optimal performance. In some cases, researchers may have limited access to such
    datasets, making it challenging to train CNNs effectively. Traditional machine
    learning models can sometimes handle smaller datasets more efficiently. Recent
    research work suggests that SVM and RF can process learning tasks with a small
    number of training datasets, but have competitive results with CNNs (Mboga et
    al. 2017). (2) Interpretability: Traditional machine learning models tend to be
    more interpretable compared to CNNs. This interpretability can be crucial in certain
    domains where understanding the reasons behind the model’s predictions is important.
    (3) Computational resources: CNNs can be computationally demanding, requiring
    powerful hardware and significant computational resources. In cases where researchers
    have limited access to high-performance computing infrastructure, traditional
    machine learning models can be more practical. (4) Specific research focus: Traditional
    machine learning models may be more appropriate or aligned with the scope of this
    research. Not all research projects require the use of CNNs, and traditional models
    can still provide valuable insights and results. Although deep learning is transforming
    in image feature extraction, machine learning methods still receive great attention
    in the classification of remote sensing images due to their lower computational
    complexity and higher interpretability compared to deep learning models. The primary
    focus of this study is to assess the effectiveness of both supervised and unsupervised
    machine learning methods for classification purposes. To achieve this objective,
    the machine learning methods will be trained using sample features extracted from
    UAV images, and their performance will be evaluated through the classification
    of five ground surface structures (forest, grassland, bare land, built-up area,
    and road). The findings of this study will provide valuable insights in selecting
    the most appropriate methods to enhance the accuracy of structure classification
    in UAV images. Research methodology and materials Research area The research area’s
    landscape complexity, remote sensing data selected, and image processing and classification
    methods used may affect classification accuracy (Lu and Weng 2007). Therefore,
    this study chose Fengshan area, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, as the research area;
    this area is a mixed-used and agricultural area and is covered by natural and
    artificial structures. This area has a latitudinal extension of 22°37′09′′N to
    22°37′10.5′′N and a longitudinal extension of 120°22′29′′E to 120°22′37′′E (Fig.
    1). The images used in this study were 3000 pixel × 4000 pixels in size, and the
    observed structures included both man-made features (e.g., built-up area and roads)
    and natural elements (e.g., forest, grassland, and bare land). The aerial photography
    covered an area of 0.03 km2 measuring 180 m in length and 158 m in width. The
    UAV was flying at an approximate height of 160 m for a duration of approximately
    5 min. Fig. 1 Aerial photograph of research area Full size image Processing of
    UAV remote sensing images In this study, the flying height and flying speed of
    a DJI Phantom 3 were set to be 160 m above the ground and 2.5 m/s, respectively.
    The camera model used was FC300C (focal length: 4 mm). The minimum aerial time
    interval between two images was about 2 s, the image overlap at the end lap rate
    was approximately 80%, and the side lap rate was 75%. The acquired images were
    characterized by three channels (RGB), a ground resolution of about 2–5 cm/pixel,
    and a resolution of 4000 pixels × 3000 pixels. These sensor-taken photographs
    contain records of the longitude, latitude, and height (i.e., the three-dimensional
    x, y, z coordinates), and the World Geodetic System (WGS84) was chosen to correct
    for the accurate geographical coordinates. The orthorectification was conducted
    using aerial triangulation on the aerial-photograph coordinates; known ground
    control points were used for orthorectification and to produce orthophotos (2.5
    cm/pixel), and the absolute geographic coordinates were introduced to integrate
    UAV high-resolution images with the Geographic Information System (ESRI ArcGIS).
    Subsequently, the classification was conducted according to the following structure
    categories: forest, grassland, bare land, built-up area, and road. The working
    procedure of this study comprised three parts. The first part involved training
    sets: the supervised machine learning algorithm first sets the UAV-obtained RGB
    images as the base line, and the training pixels in the areas containing the five
    structures were manually digitalized to determine the training sample areas. Table
    1 provides a detailed description of each surface structure class and its corresponding
    feature space in the study area. Five classes of structures were considered in
    this study: forests (trees, wood, or dense shrubs), grassland (herbs, grass, scattered
    vegetation, turf, or meadows), bare land (arable land, agricultural land, bare
    soil, open land, or barren land), built-up area (human-made structures, residential
    areas, buildings, and houses), and roads (asphalt or concrete roads). The second
    part involved testing sets: 499 ground-truth checkpoints were randomly generated
    from the research area, and, based on the characteristics of different RGB spectral
    compositions for different structures, the prediction variable (structures) was
    calculated based on the image. Subsets of the training set were then used to evaluate
    between SVM, RF, and ML through classification using UAV remote sensing images.
    The third part involved unsupervised machine learning: cluster analysis was employed
    to iteratively classify pixels into different clusters based on five predetermined
    classes. Each pixel was randomly assigned to a cluster or based on predefined
    criteria. The iterative process continued until a convergence criterion was achieved.
    The objective was to identify inherent groupings or clusters in the data without
    any prior assumptions about the classes. However, assigning meaningful class labels
    to the identified clusters required careful interpretation and validation. Table
    1 The surface structure classes in the research area and the corresponding spatial
    feature components Full size table Machine learning algorithms Conventionally,
    image classification employs supervised and unsupervised classification methods.
    Supervised classification requires the user to manually select training samples
    before applying the classification algorithm to other remaining samples (Gonzalez
    and Woods 2008). Supervised feature-learning methods can directly learn about
    a specific feature, and its expression is based on the pixels in the learning
    image data (Bengio et al. 2013). Unsupervised classification does not require
    the user to select a training sample area, it simply uses clustering algorithms
    to group clusters based on the natural distribution characteristics of the image
    pixels. Unsupervised classification is based on the principle that individuals
    of a similar nature tend to gather together, which enables automatic image classification
    of the entire area (Lillesand and Kiefer 2000). Commonly used supervised classification
    methods include SVM, RF, and ML, and the commonly used unsupervised classification
    method is clustering analysis. Support vector machine Support vector machine (SVM)
    is a machine learning technique proposed by Vapnik (1995). It is one of a few
    supervised classification algorithms and is based on statistical learning theory.
    The principle underlying SVM is as follows. First, we establish a linear equation,
    for example, Eq. (1), that draws hyperplanes in the sample space. In this equation,
    the training sample is a set D = {xi, yi}, where yi = {−1, 1} and w = (w1, w2,
    ….,wn) are normal vectors that determine the direction of the hyperplane, and
    b is the deviation value that determines the distance between the hyperplane and
    the original point; the distance between any point x in the sample space and the
    hyperplane is r. $${w}^{\\textrm{T}}x+b=0$$ (1) If these training data are linear
    separable, the two hyperplanes separating two categories are wT + b = 1 and wT
    + b = −1 (Fig. 2). The area within the two hyperplanes is called the margin, and
    the distance is 2/‖w‖; to maximize the distance, ‖w‖ must be minimized. The hyperplane
    that is situated in the center of the maximum margin is the optimal hyperplane.
    Fig. 2 SVM and hyperplanes Full size image There is a several body of literature
    that compares SVMs with other image classification techniques in remote sensing
    data, consistently demonstrating the superior accuracy of SVMs in many cases.
    For instance, in a study by Poursanidis et al. (2015), Landsat OLI and Landsat
    TM images were employed to evaluate different classifiers, including SVM, ML classifier,
    KNN classifier, and Feature Analyst. The findings indicated that SVM outperformed
    the other classifiers, exhibiting the highest accuracy specifically in urban land
    cover mapping. Similarly, Noi and Kappas (2017) conducted a comparative analysis
    of RF, KNN classifier, and SVM for land use/cover classification using Sentinel-2
    image data. Across the evaluation of three classifiers and 14 subdatasets, SVM
    consistently demonstrated the highest overall accuracy, showcasing its robustness
    against varying training sample sizes. RF and KNN followed in consecutive order
    in terms of performance. Random forest Random forest (RF) is a machine learning
    algorithm that was proposed by Breiman (2001). The RF algorithm is an ensemble
    learning method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve
    the accuracy and robustness of the model. The RF algorithm is based on the CART
    concept. In the CART training process, a subset with k attributes is randomly
    selected from the attribute sets of the tree nodes, and an optimal attribute in
    this subset is then selected to partition. By contrast, a conventional decision
    tree selects the partitioning attribute from the current node’s attribute set.
    For such an attribute set with d attributes in a k = d conventional decision tree
    where k = 1 is randomly selected as the attribute for partition, the general recommendation
    is for k to be such that k = log2 d (Breiman 2001). RF creates nonlinear decision
    boundaries though ensemble learning, which is a technique that trains multiple
    decision trees in the random subset of training data; the forest is represented
    by the numerous decision trees that are created and trained, and the final classification
    is the statistical model of predictions collected by the trees (Castagno and Atkins
    2018). Meyer et al. (2018) revealed that to differentiate the correlation between
    each tree, a subset of prediction variables should be randomly selected in each
    partition, and the optimal prediction variable of each random subset should be
    used to divide the data at the corresponding partitioning area. In doing so, an
    optimal trade-off between underfitting and overfitting can be struck. Due to their
    ease of use and superior spatial accuracy, RF algorithms are experiencing growing
    popularity. When applied to land cover mapping, RF models utilize imagery to predict
    the land cover class of individual pixels within a map (Sales et al. 2021), and
    land use classification (Feng et al. 2015; Wagner and Egerer 2022). Maximum likelihood
    ML classification first assumes normality in the data in each band’s category.
    Based on this assumption, ML classification calculates a specific pixel’s probability
    of belonging to a particular category; each pixel is then assigned to the category
    with the highest probability, or maximum likelihood, of belonging. If the highest
    probability is lower than the designated threshold, the pixel remains uncategorized
    or unknown. Mathematically, the ML of each pixel in the image is obtained by calculating
    the discriminant function, as presented in Eq. (2) (Richards 1999). $$P\\left(x|i\\right)={\\left(2\\pi
    \\right)}^{-n/2}{\\left|{\\sum}_i\\;\\right|}^{-1/2}\\exp \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}{\\left(x-
    mi\\right)}^T{\\sum}_i^{-1}\\left(x- mi\\right)\\right]$$ (2) Specifically, where
    i is the category; x is the n-dimensional image data (n is the number of bands)
    and P(x|i) is the probability of x being in category i, assuming that the value
    is identical for all categories. Σi is the variance covariance matrix of category
    i. Where Σi−1 is the inverse matrix of Σi, |Σi| is the determinant of Σi, mi is
    the mean vector of category i, (x–mi) is the transpose of (x–mi)T. Based on these
    training pixels, the covariance matrix and mean vector of the spectral band are
    used to calculate the probability that x belongs in category i. This probability
    is then used to assign pixels to their ML categories, thus completing the classification.
    During the classification process, sample x is classified into the category for
    which its likelihood function is at its maximum, as selected in the matrix. Figure
    3 (for one-dimensional, i and j categories) illustrates the rules governing whether
    x belongs to some category i or some category j. The rules are as follows: (1)
    if x > x0 and P(x|j) > P(x|i), then x is classified into category j; (2) if x
    < x0 and P(x|j) < P(x|i), then x is classified into category i; (3) if x = x0
    and P(x|j) = P(x|i), then the probabilities for the classification of x into category
    i and into category j are equal. Fig. 3 Diagram of maximum likelihood decision
    rule Full size image Cluster analysis Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine
    learning method that is typically used to conduct classification on samples of
    unknown categories, dividing these samples into various groups in accordance with
    a plan and subsequently gathering similar (short distance) samples into the same
    cluster, while separating different samples into different clusters, to reveal
    the nature of and relationships between the samples. Cluster analysis often adopts
    the k-means algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm randomly selects k seeds from
    the data according to the estimated number of clusters (k) and sets these seeds
    as the initial center of these clusters. Once k seeds are determined, the remaining
    samples p (pixels) are assigned to the closest cluster (according to the spectral
    distance), and the center of each cluster is then recalculated. Subsequently,
    the spectral distance between each pixel and the new cluster center is compared
    for reclustering. This computation is repeated until the sum of the squared error
    (SSE) of the total distance is minimized. The equation for the k-means calculation
    is presented in Eq. (3), where k is the number of clusters, p is the number of
    samples in the space, mi is the mean value of all samples in category ci, and
    SSE is the sum of the squared errors of all the samples. $$\\textrm{SSE}={\\sum}_{i=1}^k{\\sum}_{p\\in
    ci}{\\left|p- mi\\right|}^2$$ (3) Evaluation metrics The error matrix is the most
    common method used to evaluate classification accuracy (Foody 2002). Error matrix
    evaluates the classification model’s prediction data against the testing data
    to assess the classification performance of the model. An ideal classification
    is when the ground-truth is determined to be category A and the prediction is
    also category A and when an item belonging to category B is predicted to be in
    category B. In fact, most classifiers do not have 100% predictive accuracy, and
    the error matrix is thus needed to evaluate the model’s effectiveness in terms
    of its recall and accuracy. The Kappa coefficient was first formulated by Cohen
    (1960) to represent the distance between classification results and the corresponding
    true values. The coefficient was then widely applied in the literature to evaluate
    the accuracy of remote sensing image classifications. The Kappa coefficient represents
    how consistent an approach is when the test is repeated; it can also be used to
    evaluate between two approaches with respect to the accuracy and consistency in
    their classification results, doing so by taking the percentage of the errors
    from the classification approach and from completely random classification. The
    Kappa coefficient is calculated based on the overall statistical consistency of
    the error matrix when considering the nondiagonal categories. The Kappa coefficient
    is regarded as an effective method for analyzing an error matrix and identifying
    differences between error matrices (Foody 2004). The Kappa coefficient lies between
    0 and 1, where a higher coefficient indicates higher proximity between items.
    A coefficient of 0.6–0.8 is considered substantial and that of 0.81–1 is considered
    almost perfect. In the context of machine learning and evaluation of classification
    models, the area under the curve (AUC) refers to the area under the receiver operating
    characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is a graphical representation that shows
    the performance of a classifier as the discrimination threshold is varied. It
    plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different
    threshold settings. The AUC represents the overall performance of the classifier
    in distinguishing between the positive and negative classes. It provides a single
    scalar value that summarizes the classifier’s performance across all possible
    threshold settings. A higher AUC suggests better classifier performance. It means
    that the classifier has a higher probability of ranking a randomly chosen positive
    instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance. The gain chart is a
    commonly used chart for evaluating the effectiveness of classification models.
    It also helps to find the best predictive model among multiple models. The horizontal
    axis represents the probability of the testing data, and the vertical axis represents
    the percentage of actual predictions. A steeper gain curve indicates better model
    effectiveness; a gain curve with a 45° slope indicates a random (and thereby useless)
    model. Results and discussion This study conducted ground surface structure classification
    using the supervised machine learning methods of SVM, RF, and ML and the unsupervised
    machine learning method of cluster analysis. The structures were categorized into
    five groups: forest (dark green), grassland (light green), bare land (brown),
    built-up area (pink), and road (grey). The classification results for SVM, RF,
    and ML are presented in Fig. 4a–c, respectively. The classification results for
    cluster analysis are presented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Classification results of ground
    surface structures for the machine learning methods Full size image In the context
    of machine learning and classification models, recall is a performance metric
    that measures the ability of a model to correctly identify all relevant instances
    or examples of a particular class. More specifically, recall is the ratio of true
    positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances in the dataset.
    Recall = number of accurately predicted categories / total number of actual categories.
    For example, 78 forest were in the classification results, and the total number
    of forest was 88, thus yielding a recall of 78 / 88 = 0.89 (Table 2). The recall
    value ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better performance
    of the model in capturing the positive instances correctly. The ML classifier
    in this study had inferior recall in road prediction (0.55) because the categories
    of road and built-up area, in the RGB images, were similar in their spectral nature
    and pixel distribution. This similarity resulted in the classifier often mistaking
    roads for built-up areas. Supervised classifiers also commonly mistook forest
    for grassland. Moreover, the substantial variability among bare land increases
    the susceptibility of the classifier to erroneously categorize them as the remaining
    four structures. Table 2 SVM error matrix of ground surface structure classification
    Full size table Accuracy refers to the percentage of predictions that belong in
    the correct category. A high accuracy entails a low misjudgment rate. For example,
    the RF accurately classified five structure categories: 79 forest, 11 grassland,
    226 bare land, 108 built-up area, and 34 road. With the total number of structures
    at 499, the RF had the accuracy of [ (79 + 11 + 226 + 108 + 34) / 499 ]*100% =
    91.78% (Table 2). Tables 3, 4, and 5 presents the accuracy values for SVM, ML,
    and cluster analysis as 88.97%, 78.96%, and 73.75%, respectively. These accuracy
    values indicate the percentage of correctly classified instances or predictions
    made by each method. A higher accuracy value suggests better performance in terms
    of correctly classifying the data. The selected ground-truth was used to evaluate
    the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Table 3 RF error matrix of ground
    surface structure classification Full size table Table 4 ML error matrix of ground
    surface structure classification Full size table Table 5 Clustering error matrix
    of ground surface structure classification Full size table In addition, the ROC
    curve represents how well classifiers avoid false classifications. In the performance
    analysis of classification models, the best-performing AUC of the ROC is 1; greater
    test accuracy is represented by a greater distance between the curve and the reference
    line. The AUC values indicate the discriminatory power and overall performance
    of machine learning method in distinguishing between the positive and negative
    classes. A higher AUC value suggests better performance, with a value of 1 representing
    a perfect classifier. In this study, RF had the best-performing AUC of 0.93, followed
    by SVM, ML, and cluster analysis at 0.91, 0.79, and 0.75, respectively. The Kappa
    coefficients indicate the level of agreement or accuracy achieved by each method
    in relation to the evaluated criteria or classification task. A higher Kappa coefficient
    generally indicates better agreement or performance. In this study, the RF achieved
    the highest agreement with a Kappa coefficient of 0.88, followed by SVM with 0.84.
    The ML had a Kappa coefficient of 0.70, while cluster analysis achieved a coefficient
    of 0.65. According to the results, RF had optimal gain (100%), followed by SVM
    and ML (97%). As for cluster analysis, the unsupervised classifier, the first
    50% of its testing data were able to predict 95% of the actual value. The prediction
    results for all four classifiers were similar (Fig. 5). The ML shows a step-like
    pattern at 92.05% of the Y-axis (Gain). This indicates a sudden change in the
    model’s performance as it progresses through the ranked groups. It suggests that
    the model is capturing distinct patterns or characteristics in the data, leading
    to this step-like behavior. If the relationship between the predictor variables
    and the ground-truth is not continuous but rather exhibits distinct jumps or breaks,
    it can lead to a step-like pattern in the gain chart. However, the shape of the
    gain chart alone does not provide conclusive evidence of the model’s performance.
    It is essential to interpret the chart in conjunction with other evaluation metrics
    and domain knowledge to gain a comprehensive understanding of the model''s effectiveness.
    Fig. 5 Gain chart of all four machine learning algorithms Full size image Lloyd
    et al. (2004) argued that different classifiers must be compared to determine
    which classifier is optimal relative to a specific study. Therefore, this study
    evaluated the classification results of different machine learning methods using
    the four aforementioned comprehensive indicators of accuracy, AUC, the Kappa coefficient,
    and gain. According to results, RF had the best classification effectiveness for
    all five structures. Supervised machine learning was also superior to unsupervised
    learning, especially in terms of accuracy, AUC, and the Kappa coefficient (Fig.
    6). Specifically, these results indicate that supervised machine learning is better
    at distinguishing between ground surface structures and at analyzing the spectral
    composition and distribution of man-made (built-up area and road) and natural
    (forest, grassland, and bare land) items. Furthermore, supervised machine learning
    can also make better classificatory judgments based on RGB images. Fig. 6 Comparison
    of overall evaluation indicators Full size image In the classification of remote
    sensing images, classification methods perform differently depending on the type
    of dataset and on classification plans—such as spectral bands, ancillary data,
    and the nature of the study area. Apart from the classifier, the choice of image
    features plays a crucial role in the performance of the classification (Vetrivel
    et al. 2016). Although some image-classification methods can extract image features,
    such extraction requires massive image datasets for training and computation,
    resulting in high costs. This study used high-resolution UAV images, which are
    capable of clearly representing the textures, colors, shapes, and sizes of ground
    surface structures. Such clarity eliminated problems with shadow changes, which
    facilitated accurate classification. Compared with other similar studies, this
    study has the following three points of efficient: (1) Utilization of UAV remote
    sensing: The use of highly-efficient UAV remote sensing photography can provide
    high-resolution and up-to-date imagery, enabling detailed analysis of ground surface
    structures. This can lead to more accurate classification results compared to
    studies that rely on lower-resolution or outdated imagery. (2) Combination of
    supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms: By incorporating three supervised
    machine learning algorithms (SVM, RF, ML) and performing cluster analysis using
    an unsupervised learning algorithm, this study explores a variety of approaches
    for ground surface structure classification. This comprehensive analysis allows
    for a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different methods,
    enhancing the overall efficiency of the study. (3) Evaluation of multiple performance
    metrics: This study reports multiple performance metrics, including accuracy,
    AUC, Kappa coefficient, and gain. By considering various metrics, this study provides
    a more comprehensive assessment of the classification methods’ effectiveness and
    enables a more thorough comparison with other similar studies that may focus on
    only a subset of performance metrics. Conclusion Low spatial resolution and numerous
    environmental factors hinder the effectiveness of image classification. Therefore,
    the adoption of high-resolution remote sensing images, and selection of an adequate
    classifier are vital for improving classification accuracy. Researchers have developed
    advanced classification methods, such as machine learning, to improve classification
    effectiveness. These studies are of great value to the selection of an adequate
    classification procedure. Such selection is important because classification results
    are crucial to many applications. This study applied UAV remote sensing images
    and machine learning methods to establish classification models for five types
    of ground surface structures, namely forest, grassland, bare land, built-up area,
    and road. The main purpose of this study was to apply a fast and automatic classification
    method, using high-resolution images and machine learning, to mathematically distinguish
    various image features of ground surface structures for classification. Subsequently,
    various evaluation indicators were used to verify the effectiveness and accuracy
    of each classification model. The classification results revealed that of the
    four machine learning methods, RF was the best performing in the overall indicator
    evaluation and with respect to its accuracy, AUC, Kappa coefficient, and gain.
    In other words, RF is most effective when classifying these five structures, followed
    by SVM and ML, and cluster analysis. Improvements to UAVs with respect to operational
    cost and limits have benefited large-scale investigations, monitoring, and reconnaissance.
    The integration of various automatic machine learning techniques enables the rapid
    classification and prediction for classifying structures, useful for practical
    applications. This study of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods
    helps to provide a framework for selecting the right image classification tool,
    using the classification of five structures in UAV images to train and test the
    features of different structures. However, ground objects in remote sensing images
    can vary dramatically in shape, color, and texture; to be applied to other structures,
    additional training data and further validation may be required to assess the
    applicability of the classification. Data availability The data is available from

  description: Precision agriculture (PA) is an agronomic management that allows the
    parsimonious use of agronomic inputs according to the crop's actual spatiotemporal
    needs. The most important agronomic practice of PA is the site-specific management
    (SSM) of agronomic inputs. To apply SSM, the number and location of homogeneous
    zones must be defined. Nowadays, many approaches are used to define the number
    of zones in an arbitrary and constant way, such as high-, medium-, and low-input
    zones, without a priori statistical analysis. Two combined field experiments were
    carried out on durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum Desf.) in central Italy
    to agronomically validate an automatic approach aimed at defining the number and
    position of the homogeneous zones using multispectral images. For both sites,
    at stem elongation and anthesis, the dry biomass per square meter and Soil Plant
    Analysis Development (SPAD) readings were measured, while at crop maturity the
    yield was measured. This approach uses multispectral images as source data and
    uses the gap statistic index to determine the correct number of zones. The management
    zones created were well-fitted with the experimental design of both sites, and
    the validation was made by the statistical analysis performed on yield data, SPAD,
    dry biomass, and normalized difference red edge index with an average difference
    of 40.2%, 28.5%, 57.5%, and 37.4%, respectively, between the management zones.
    The approach could be scaled by using the multitemporal multispectral images provided
    by satellite constellation, which enables farms and societies to take advantage
    of all the economic and environmental benefits of PA.

    site-specific management (SSM) of agronomic inputs. To apply SSM, the number and
    location of homogeneous zones must be defined. Nowadays, many approaches are used
    to define the number of zones in an arbitrary and constant way, such as high-,
    medium-, and low-input zones, without a priori statistical analysis. Two combined
    field experiments were carried out on durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum
    Desf.) in central Italy to agronomically validate an automatic approach aimed
    at defining the number and position of the homogeneous zones using multispectral
    images. For both sites, at stem elongation and anthesis, the dry biomass per square
    meter and Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) readings were measured, while
    at crop maturity the yield was measured. This approach uses multispectral images
    as source data and uses the gap statistic index to determine the correct number
    of zones. The management zones created were well-fitted with the experimental
    design of both sites, and the validation was made by the statistical analysis
    performed on yield data, SPAD, dry biomass, and normalized difference red edge
    index with an average difference of 40.2%, 28.5%, 57.5%, and 37.4%, respectively,
    between the management zones. The approach could be scaled by using the multitemporal
    multispectral images provided by satellite constellation, which enables farms
    and societies to take advantage of all the economic and environmental benefits
    of PA. Abbreviations ANOVA analysis of variance C/N carbon-nitrogen ratio CT conventional

    UAV unmanned aerial vehicle 1 INTRODUCTION The agriculture sector is the major
    source of diffusion and pollution of nitrogen (N), which impacts several issues
    such as economic, environmental, and social ones (Puertes et al., 2021). When
    nitrogen use efficiency is not high, groundwater quality (Rath et al., 2021),
    air pollution (Peng et al., 2020), and net farm profit are negatively affected
    (Langholtz et al., 2021). Moreover, the technology that allows N fixation leads
    to the generation of mineral fertilizers and requires large amounts of energy,
    mostly provided by fossil fuel energy (Chai et al., 2019). The European Commission
    is requesting an effort from the agronomic scientific community to perform a transition
    from traditional farming systems to more sustainable ones (Wesseler, 2022) to
    accomplish the “Farm to Fork” strategy, which constitutes one of the critical
    components of the European Green Deal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/europe-an-green-deal-communication_en.pdf)
    and Farm to Fork Strategy (https://ec.europa.eu/food/farm2fork_en-15/01/2021).
    The Farm to Fork strategy aims to reduce nutrient losses by at least 50%, while
    ensuring no deterioration in soil fertility. At the same time, a reduction in
    fertilizer use by at least 20% is expected by 2030. To achieve this ambitious
    goal, the scientific community is focusing on the development of innovative cropping
    systems (Deligios et al., 2019), spread of conservative agriculture (Capmourteres
    et al., 2018), application of the principles of organic farming (Migliorini et
    al., 2014), and precision agriculture (PA; Argento et al., 2020). Although N fertilization
    has several negative environmental and social impacts, it improves crop yield
    and income. Without N input, it is estimated that only about half of the current
    global population can be supplied with sufficient food, energy, and protein (Dawson
    & Hilton, 2011). In the Mediterranean, winter cereals are the dominant crops (Tsialtas
    et al., 2018), and the most important key driver for achieving maximum productivity
    in durum wheat is the N fertilization if water is not a limiting factor (Orsini
    et al., 2019a). An opportunity exists to further enhance the yield, profitability,
    and nutrient use efficiency of these systems through site-specific management
    (SSM), which is the most common practice of PA applications. The PA technologies
    and applications can lead to higher N use efficiency, therefore reducing the environmental
    impact of agriculture activities and the overall cost of production (Capmourteres
    et al., 2018). In order to apply SSM, it is necessary to perform a continuous
    monitoring activity of the crop status during the growing seasons with spatial-temporal
    data, which can be performed by using (1) a network of proximal sensors (Aqeel-Ur-Rehman
    et al., 2014), or alternatively (2) remote-sensing technologies (Maes & Steppe,
    2019), or through a (3) combination of remote and proximal sensors (Munnaf et
    al., 2021). Core Ideas Multi-site/year field experiments were carried out on durum
    wheat in central Italy. Agronomic validation of automatic zone management delineation
    approach was set up. The management zone well-fitted with the experimental sites.
    The approach could be scaled up by using satellite multispectral data. Greater
    attention is currently being devoted to data fusion techniques (Pantazi et al.,
    2020) that have the capability to fuse data with different spatial–temporal resolutions
    for delineating zone management for PA applications. Castrignanò et al. (2018)
    propose a multivariate geostatistical sensor data fusion approach to combine ground
    penetrating radar and electromagnetic induction sensor for delineating homogeneous
    zones in terraced olive groves under organic cropping. Other data fusion techniques
    are developed using machine learning (Fiorentini et al., 2022) and deep learning
    (Schillaci et al., 2021) methods to handle different types of inputs and nonlinear
    tasks (Chlingaryan et al., 2018). Based on the type of spatial–temporal data,
    we can perform different workflow analyses to delineate management zone (Nawar
    et al., 2017). Whelan and Mcbratney (2003) suggested five steps to create and
    verify zones based on (1) creation of data layers, (2) interpolation of data layers,
    (3) cluster analysis, (4) determining the confidence of interval, and (5) guided
    soil sampling to assess the soil-related causes of between-zone variability. Albarenque
    et al. (2016) suggested an approach based on the use of a crop deterministic model
    to determine the spatial–temporal variability of soil–crop–climate data and then
    define the homogeneous zones. However, to apply SSM, it is important to define
    the number and location of homogeneous zones, which have a great impact on the
    agronomic input efficiency, the potential yield per unit area, and the environment-economic
    benefit of the PA (Denora, Fiorentini, et al., 2022). Nowadays, there are several
    approaches to define the number and location of homogeneous zones a priori using
    operational software, without performing an analysis. Several authors reported
    the presence of three different homogeneous zones (e.g., high, medium, and low)
    without specifying the approach or calculation that led to the creation of that
    number of homogeneous zones, and these arbitrary choices impact negatively the
    environmental and economic benefit of the PA. As SSM is an operational practice,
    all methods must be designed and validated for use at an operational scale. For
    a method to be considered operational, it must meet the following five criteria:
    (1) it must be automatic, (2) scalable, (3) its data source must be free and temporally-spatially
    accurate (e.g., multispectral satellite data), (4) it must be applicable to use
    in any field, (5) it must be easy to use, and (6) scientifically validated (Zhang
    et al., 2010). Several authors explored different source data to define zone management,
    such as yield mapping data (Gavioli et al., 2019; Stettmer et al., 2022), electromagnetic
    sensors (Denora, Amato, et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2022), and grid-georeferenced
    soil samples (Ali et al., 2022; Vallentin et al., 2020), but such data sources
    are difficult to put into operational because they are expensive, time-consuming,
    have a low temporal resolution, and use proximal sensors. In this manuscript,
    an advancement in knowledge has been proposed by agronomically validating an automatic
    workflow analysis that can define the number and location of the zone management
    with multi-site/year yield data and different experimental designs. Once validated,
    this approach could be scaled up by using the source data of the multispectral
    images acquired by the private and public satellite constellations to automate
    the generation of prescription maps for rainfed Mediterranean durum wheat and
    thus facilitate the adoption of these agronomic techniques, enabling farms and
    society to take advantage of all the economic and environmental benefits of PA.
    2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Long-term experiment description The long-term experiment
    (LTE) is located at the “Pasquale Rosati” experimental farm of the Polytechnic
    University of Marche in Agugliano, Italy (43°32′ N, 13°22′ E, 100 a.s.l.). According
    to the Walter and Leith climatic classes, the climate of the study area (Figure
    1) is attenuated meso-Mediterranean, and it is characterized by a mean annual
    precipitation of approximately 798 mm and a mean annual temperature of 15.5°C
    with monthly means ranging from 7.4°C in February to 24.1°C in August. FIGURE

    Agroalimentare delle Marche [ASSAM]). During the 2017–2018 crop growing season,
    the highest cumulative precipitation (647 mm) was recorded, while the 2018–2019
    and 2019–2020 growing seasons recorded a contraction of 36% (414 mm) and 22% (506
    mm), respectively. The mean yearly temperature in the 2019–2020 growing season
    was 1°C higher than the previous growing seasons (Table 1). TABLE 1. Thermo-pluviometric

    26.7 mEq 100 g−1 of cation exchange capacity, pH of 8.1, 29.6% of field water
    capacity of the weight, 17.6% of wilting point, and a slope of approximately 10%.
    2.1.1 LTE design and management practices The LTE, established in 1994 and still
    in use (Seddaiu et al., 2016), consists of a rainfed 2-year rotation of durum
    wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum Desf.) cv. Tyrex (Apsov Sementi) and
    maize (Zea mays L.) cv. DK440 (hybrid, FAO Class 300, Dekalb—Monsanto Agricoltura
    Italia S.p.A). The crop rotation was duplicated in two adjacent fields to allow
    for all crops to be present each year (Figure 2). FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer
    Long-term experiment (LTE) site (center) and farm site (right), planimetry, and
    georeferenced positions of sampling biomass points. Within each field, three soil
    management (main plot, 1500 m2 each) systems (conventional, reduced tillage, and
    no tillage) and three N fertilizer (subplot, 500 m2 each) levels were arranged
    according to a split-plot experimental designs with two randomized blocks and
    repeated in the same plots every year. The conventional tillage (CT), which is
    representative of the business-as-usual tillage practice in the study area, and
    the reduced tillage plots were plowed along the maximum slope every year by a
    mouldboard (with two plows) at a depth of 40 cm or a chisel at a depth of 25 cm
    in autumn for wheat and in summer for maize, respectively. The seedbed was prepared
    by harrowing before the sowing date. The three N fertilizer treatments were N0,
    N90, and N180, corresponding to 0, 90, and 180 kg N ha−1 distributed in two rates
    for wheat and maize. In this manuscript, the research activity focused on durum
    wheat plots where CT and the three N levels were applied for 3 years (2018–2020)
    in growing seasons. The CT plots were chosen because it was comparable with the
    soil management conducted at the “Guzzini” farm. The N90 treatment was compliant
    with the agri-environmental measures adopted within the rural development plans
    at a local scale. The N180 treatment was the business-as-usual N rates in the
    study area at the start of the experiment. Durum wheat was sown at the beginning
    of autumn at a seeding rate of 220 kg ha−1 with a between-row distance of 0.17
    m. Each year, N fertilization in the form of urea (46%) was split into two applications:
    50% at the end of tillering and 50% before head emergence. Weeds, pests, and diseases
    were chemically controlled. The sequence of agronomic practices applied at the
    LTE is reported in Table 2. TABLE 2. Agronomic management practices adopted during

    experiment description Farm-scale experiment (Farm) was carried out during the
    2019–2020 growing season in the “Francesco Guzzini” farm located in Recanati (43°
    23′ N, 13° 31′ E, 115 a.s.l.), central Italy (Figure 2). The climate is attenuated
    meso-Mediterranean. The mean annual precipitation is 711 mm and the mean annual
    temperature is 15.9°C with monthly means ranging from 7.7°C in February to 24.7°C
    in August. During the 2019–2020 crop growing season, the farm site was characterized
    by a seasonal rainfall close to 400 mm (about 100 mm lower than the precipitation
    recorded at the Agugliano weather station during the same growing season) and
    mean temperatures of 1.5°C lower than temperature recorded at Agugliano (Table
    3). TABLE 3. Thermo-pluviometric trend during the study period (2019–2020) and

    mEq 100 g−1 of cation exchange capacity, 8.1 of pH, 28.5% of field water capacity
    of the weight, 16.2% of wilting point, and a slope of about 6%. 2.2.1 Farm-scale
    experiment design and management practices The farm site was chosen because it
    had the same agronomic management (Figure 3) as that of the LTE site. Indeed,
    the farm site has a rainfed 2-year crop rotation with durum wheat and maize. In
    both cases, the same cultivars were adopted in the LTE experiment in detail cv.
    Tyrex and cv. DK440 (hybrid, FAO Class 300, Dekalb—Monsanto Agricoltura Italia
    S.p.A). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer Walter and Lieth climate diagram of Recanati
    weather station. Period of observation: 1990–2010. The soil is managed with CT,
    where two N levels were applied in two adjacent areas (Figure 2). The preparation
    of the seedbed was performed as reported in the LTE site, with plowing performed
    along the maximum slope by a mouldboard plow (with two plows) at a depth of 0.4
    m in autumn. Before seeding, a harrowing operation has been performed while the
    sowing has been done with a seed rate of 220 kg ha−1 with a row spacing of 0.17
    m. The two N levels correspond to 90 and 222 kg N ha−1 and were distributed at
    two rates. Each rate contains half of the total N and was applied to the crop
    in the form of urea (46% N) at the end of tillering and the last rate is applied
    before head emergence. Weeds, pests, and diseases were chemically controlled.
    The sequence of agronomic practices applied at the farm site is reported in Table

    a soil sampling campaign was carried out in 2019 for both sites, with a hand auger
    (model: Suelo HA-3, Zhejiang Lujian Instrument Equipment Co., Ltd.) immediately
    before sowing. From each plot of the LTE site, three samples were taken at a depth
    of 0–0.3 m and georeferenced using the Leica Zeno 20 (Leica Geosystem). While
    for the farm site for both N areas, four samples were taken using the same procedure
    reported for the LTE site. Using the soil organic matter with the Walkley–Black
    chromic acid wet oxidation method and the total N availability with the Kjeldahl
    method, it has been analyzed that the ratio of carbon-nitrogen (C/N) is the same
    as the ratio of previous measures. For each field survey day, Soil Plant Analysis
    Development (SPAD) readings (Konica Minolta Sensing 2003, Osaka, Japan) and the
    dry biomass per square meter (g m−2) at stem elongation and anthesis phenological
    stages (ZS35 and ZS60 respectively where ZS = Zadoks Scale) were recorded (Zadoks
    et al., 1974). For each plot of the LTE site, three test areas were randomly selected
    and georeferenced by using the Leica Zeno 20 (Leica Geosystem). At each test area,
    10 leaves were chosen to make the SPAD readings. The readings were taken on the
    central and distal portion of the leaves, at the same tune slot, around midday
    (11:00 a.m.–13:00 p.m.). For the farm site, test areas were randomly selected
    in the N90 and N222 areas (Figure 2) and on which the SPAD readings were performed.
    After performing the SPAD readings, at each test area, fresh plant biomass was
    manually cut and collected in a 0.5 m long row. The fresh plant biomass was oven-dried
    at 80°C for 48 h and weighed (g). Starting from the dry biomass weight (g), we
    calculated the dry biomass per square meter (g m−2) by using the equation: where
    a is the length of the sampling area, and b is the row spacing. Before each sampling
    activity, multispectral images were acquired (MAIA S-2, SAL engineering) by using
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform (DJI Matrice 600 pro, SZ DJI Technology
    Co., Ltd.) to compute the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) (Barnes
    et al., 2000). At crop maturity (ZS92), the grain yield (t ha−1) has been measured
    by using a laboratory thresher for three test areas (1 m long row) per plot. 2.3.1
    Remote sensing application Multispectral images were acquired at stem elongation
    (ZS35) and anthesis (ZS60) phenological stages for each growing season under analysis.
    To avoid the variation in sun radiation during the flight, the UAV was equipped
    with an incident light sensor that can record the light variation and then correct
    the nine spectral bands of the MAIA S-2. Moreover, six ground control points have
    been positioned for the image post-processing to improve the spatial accuracy
    of the image. All the relevant flight settings are given in Table 5. TABLE 5.

    operation to reduce noise, convert to the right file format, and prepare all image
    datasets for the orthomosaic map generation process. The image processing is composed
    of four main steps: (1) convert raw image file format to tiff image file format,
    (2) orthomosaic reflectance map generation, (3) computation of vegetation index
    map, and (4) data extraction. The raw multispectral images were exported from
    the multispectral cameras to the computer. The dedicated software MultiCam Stitcher
    Pro (SAL engineering & Eoptis) was used to convert the raw format image to the
    multichannel tiff format. In this process, the light variation correction to the
    images was also performed, thanks to the incident light sensor equipped on the
    UAV platform. To generate the orthomosaic reflectance maps, the Agisoft Metashape
    (Agisoft LLC) was used. The software is based on a structure from a motion algorithm
    (Verhoeven, 2011). To complete the third and fourth main steps, the orthomosaic
    reflectance map was imported into R statistical software (ver. 3.5.1., 2018),
    and then the “stack” function of the raster R package (Hijmans et al., 2011) was
    used. Based on the previous studies (Orsini et al., 2019b), the NDRE (Barnes et
    al., 2000) vegetation index had a higher correlation accuracy with the durum wheat
    crop parameters than the other vegetation indexes, so the NDRE was computed by
    using the following formula: where NIR is the near-infrared spectral band (865
    nm) and Red Edge is the red edge spectral band (705 nm). To extract the NDRE values
    only at the points where the biomass fresh samplings were obtained, we imported
    in R in the xlsx file format that contained the georeferenced positions of samples
    by using the “read_excel” function of readxl R package (Wickham, 2016). Then the
    “extract” function of the raster R package (Hijmans et al., 2011) was used to
    extract the values corresponding to the crop sampling in a data-frame format.
    Then the data-frame object created was exported in a csv file format by using
    the “write.csv” function of the Utilis R package (R Core Team, 2018). 2.4 Statistical
    analysis All statistical analyses were performed with R statistical software (ver.
    3.5.1., 2018). In order to select the model that could fit better with the data,
    several models were built and then the best model was selected based on the statistics
    that put a penalty on “complexity,” such as the Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike,
    1974) the Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz, 1978) and likelihood ratio
    tests (Wilks, 1938). The best model that fits better with the data is the mixed
    model, as reported by several studies (Onofri et al., 2016; Piepho et al., 2004).
    For data acquired during crop development (SPAD, dry biomass per meter square,
    and NDRE), the fixed factors of the mixed model were N and Zadoks scale and the
    random factors of the mixed model were year, block, plot, and zone management.
    While for the yield and soil data, the fixed factor of the mixed model was the
    N input, and the random factors of the mixed model were block, plot, and year.
    Before performing the analysis of variance (ANOVA), it has been verified if the
    model meets the three assumptions of the ANOVA. The normality distribution of
    the model residual was checked both graphically (QQ plot) and by performing the
    Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Moreover, the homoscedasticity was checked using
    the Levene test. The last ANOVA assumption was satisfied by the experimental design
    and the random sampling. When all three ANOVA assumptions were met, the ANOVA
    was applied to the model. Only when the ANOVA showed a significant difference
    between the factors (p-value < 0.05), the estimated marginal means post hoc analysis
    was performed by using the “emmeans” function with the Bonferroni adjustment of
    the emmeans R package (Lenth, 2019). 2.4.1 Zone management delineation The zone
    management map creation workflow was entirely performed with R statistical software
    (ver. 3.5.1., 2018). The workflow to generate the management zone map is composed
    of several steps, which could be summarized as (1) stack layer generation, (2)
    subset stack layer only on the undistributed area, (3) cluster analysis, and (4)
    zone management map creation. To create a single stack layer on which to perform
    the analysis, the single NDRE raster layers must have the same spatial resolution.
    To obtain two raster layers with the same spatial resolution, the “resample” function
    of the raster R package (Hijmans et al., 2011) was used, which transfers values
    between nonmatching raster layers in terms of spatial resolution. The unique stack
    layer contained NDRE raster layers created by using the “stack” function of the
    raster R package on the previously elaborated single raster layers. The cluster
    analysis was performed by using the “kmeans” function of the stats R package (3.5.1.,
    2018). To define the right value associated with the “centers” parameter of the
    “kmeans” function, the gap statistic index was performed, which calculates the
    goodness of clustering and defines the optimal number of clusters (Maechler et
    al., 2015). The gap statistic compares the total intracluster variation for different
    values of k with their expected values under the null reference distribution of
    the data. Based on the gap statistic index, the k-means cluster analysis was performed,
    and the zone management map was created and then exported in an ESRI Shapefile
    file format with the “writeOGR” function of the rgdal R package (Bivand et al.,
    2013). 3 RESULTS 3.1 Soil properties The ANOVA applied to the mixed model fitted
    with the soil properties data showed that the N input did not significantly affect
    the C/N, soil organic matter (g kg−1), and soil N (g kg−1) content in both sites
    (Table 6). TABLE 6. Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) applied to the mixed

    Abbreviations: C/N, carbon-nitrogen ratio; LTE, long-term experiment. The estimated
    marginal means analysis did not raise any difference between the different N levels
    (Table 6). The LTE site showed a mean value of C/N higher than the farm site of
    +0.04, while for the other two soil properties, the farm site showed a higher
    mean value of +0.44 and +0.042 than the LTE site, respectively, for soil organic
    matter (g kg−1) and soil N (g kg−1). 3.2 Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD)
    readings, dry biomass, and remote sensing The ANOVA applied to the mixed model
    fitted with the SPAD readings, dry biomass (g m−2), and NDRE showed that the N
    input and the ZS single effects can affect significantly all the variables in
    both sites (Table 7). Moreover, the combined effect of N input and ZS showed a
    significant difference in all the variables, and this led us to perform a statistical
    post hoc analysis on the combined effect to raise the differences between all
    the combinations (Table 7). TABLE 7. Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) applied

    marginal means post hoc analysis showed that the higher the amount of nitrogen
    applied to the crop, the greater the response of each variable, site, and phenological
    stage (Table 7). In more detail, the mean value of all variables obtained for
    N180 at the LTE site over the 3 years was statistically different from N0 and
    N90 treatments for each phenological stage and variable (Table 7). After the first
    N fertilization application at the end of tillering (ZS35), N180 over the 3 years
    had higher mean values of SPAD, dry biomass per square meter (g m−2), and NDRE,
    respectively, of +7.9 (+15.2%), +194.7 (+49.8%), and +0.1 (+29.0%) than the N90
    treatment. While after the second dose of fertilization, before head emergence
    (ZS60), N180 showed higher mean values of +6.5 (+12.0%), +448.8 (+36.0%), and
    +0.10 (+19.0%), respectively, for SPAD readings, dry biomass per square meter
    (g m−2) and NDRE over the three years than N90 treatment (Table 7). 3.3 Yield
    data The ANOVA showed that the single effect of N input significantly impacts
    the grain yield (t ha−1) in both sites (Table 8). TABLE 8. Results of analysis

    n.s., not significant at p > 0.05. According to the estimated marginal means analysis
    results for the grain yield (t ha−1), the higher the amount of N input applied
    to the crop, the greater the response of grain yield (t ha−1) for both sites (Table
    8). The grain yield (t ha−1) measured at the LTE site at the N180 showed higher
    values of +2.00 (+31.2%) and +5.17 (+80.5%) than N90 and N0. Instead, N90 showed
    a higher value (+71.7%) of grain yield (t ha−1) than N0. At the farm site during
    the 2019–2020 growing season, the N222 showed a statistically higher value of
    +1.6 (+24.6%) grain yield (t ha−1) than N90. The N222 treatment at the farm site
    yielded 1.8% higher than treatment N180 at the LTE site, and therefore the 42
    units of higher N does not justify an increase in yield. While considering the
    N90 treatment of the farm site and LTE, no notable differences are shown (Table
    8). 3.4 Zone management map—Long-term experimental site The six NDRE vegetation
    index maps of the LTE were set to the same scale as the farm site, which helps
    in better understanding the changes resulting due to different years, phenological
    stages, and sites. Moving from one phenological stage to the next (ZS35 and ZS60),
    the NDRE maps (Figure 4) show an increase in values as reported in Table 7 and
    also allow us to strongly emphasize the differences related to the experimental
    design and the different levels of fertilization applied to the crop. FIGURE 4
    Open in figure viewer Experimental design and normalized difference red edge index
    (NDRE) vegetation index at stem elongation (ZS35) and at anthesis (ZS60) of the
    three growing seasons at the long-term experiment (LTE) site. The gap statistic
    index was applied in the stack layer object and showed that the optimal number
    of clusters of the “kmeans” function in the LTE site for both years under analysis
    was 3 (Figure 5), and the results of this unsupervised machine learning algorithm
    are shown in Figure 5. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer The optimal number of clusters
    based on the gap statistic index for both growing seasons (2018, 2019, and 2020)
    and the zone management of the long-term experiment (LTE). The three resulting
    clusters fitted well with the LTE experimental design, where the N0 was related
    to the first cluster, the N90 was related to the second cluster, and the N180
    was related to the third cluster. 3.5 Zone management map—Farm site Starting from
    the phenological stage ZS35 until reaching the ZS60 phenological stage (Figure
    6), the NDRE maps showed an increase in values as reported in Table 7. Moreover,
    the NDRE maps (Figure 6) emphasize the differences between the two areas at different
    doses of N fertilization applied to the crop. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer Normalized
    difference red edge index (NDRE) vegetation index at stem elongation (ZS35) of
    2020 growing season of the farm site. ZS60, anthesis. The gap statistic index
    showed that the optimal number of clusters of the “kmeans” function in the farm
    site was 2 (Figure 7), and the results of this unsupervised machine learning algorithm
    are shown in Figure 7. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer The optimal number of clusters
    based on the gap statistic index of the 2020 growing season and the zone management
    of the farm site. The two resulting clusters fitted well with the farm experimental
    site where the N90 was related to the first cluster and the N222 was related to
    the second cluster. 4 DISCUSSION 4.1 Soil properties The chemical soil properties
    such as C/N, soil organic matter (g kg−1), and soil N availability (g kg−1) were
    not affected by different levels of N fertilization, this is due to the well-known
    N high mobility in the soil (Bhattacharyya et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2014).
    Several authors reported that when a longer time frame is considered, different
    N rates can significantly affect many chemical soil properties such as soil acidification,
    salinity, oxidation reactions, and exchange capacity (Ata-Ul-Karim et al., 2020).
    When these chemical soil properties change, it indirectly affects the soil microbial
    composition, which are the bio-producers of organic matter, and so the soil nitrogen
    availability (Deligios et al., 2017). Moreover, Ata-Ul-Karim et al. (2020) and
    Bhattacharyya et al. (2017) reported several studies where excessive N fertilization
    may impair soil health through negative effects on the soil biological community,
    which are the bio-producers of the N form that the crops then absorb to complete
    the biological cycle. 4.2 Remote-proximal sensing and crop variables The higher
    the N input is applied to the crop, the greater the biomass produced by the crop
    for each year, site, and phenological stage under analysis (Pro et al., 2021).
    This pattern of crop development was also detected by remote and proximal sensing
    tools (Fiorentini et al., 2021). These tools can be used to continuously monitor
    the spatial-temporal variability during the entire growing season, which is fundamental
    to the SSM applications. A review performed by Mulla (2013) reported that remote
    sensing technologies can effectively follow the leaf area index, biomass, crop
    density, yield potential estimation, and detection and mapping of biotic and abiotic
    stresses. In Spain, seven different inorganic N rates were applied in maize, and
    Maresma et al. (2016) showed that the higher the N input applied to the crop,
    the greater the NDVI, WDRVI, GRVI, and SPAD values. Also, Argento et al. (2020)
    in four different sites in Switzerland showed that the vegetation index is well
    related to crop variables such as dry matter, N uptake, and nitrogen nutrition
    index. Moreover, Argento et al. (2020) showed that NDRE was the best vegetation
    index to be related to the crop variables as reported by Fiorentini et al. (2019).
    Moreover, Schillaci et al. (2020) reported that the vegetation indexes could offer
    a picture of the nutritional status of the crop and could be integrated into a
    spatial-temporal decision support system to optimize the maize N fertilization
    at the farm scale. But it is also equally true that each vegetation index has
    its specific expression of green vegetation, its suitability for specific uses,
    and some limiting factors. Therefore, for practical applications, the choice of
    a specific vegetation index needs to be made with caution by comprehensively considering
    and analyzing the advantages and limitations of existing vegetation indexes and
    then combining them to be applied in a specific environment. In this way, the
    use of vegetation indexes can be tailored to specific applications, instrumentation
    used, and platforms (Xue & Su, 2017). Therefore, it is essential that the scientific–agronomic
    community test and validate which vegetation index is most appropriate to use
    based on the soil and climate conditions, crops, and cultivars used in the area.
    4.3 Management zones and yield data The environmental and economic benefits of
    PA pass through the most famous applications such as the SSM (Albarenque et al.,
    2016; Pantazi et al., 2020). Therefore, the determination of the number and location
    of homogeneous zones is fundamental, and nowadays many approaches and operational
    software define the number of zones in an arbitrary and constant way, such as
    high-, medium-, and low-input zones, without a priori statistical analysis and
    validation. These methods must be validated using statistical analyses of yield
    data before being implemented on an operational scale (Gavioli et al., 2019; Nawar
    et al., 2017). Several authors study the best approaches that can determine such
    areas (Janrao & Palivela, 2015; Yuan et al., 2022) but such approaches should
    be designed to be used at an operational scale. For a method to be considered
    operational, it must be automatic, must have as its data source that is free and
    temporally-spatially accurate (e.g., multispectral satellite data), must be used
    in any field, and scientifically validated. Gavioli et al. (2019) evaluated 20
    different algorithms for defining and validating zone management in commercial
    fields of soybean and maize in Brazil with yield data. The number of clusters
    analyzed were two, three, and four, and after the comprehensive analysis, the
    number of zones was set for each field. While Denora, Fiorentini, et al. (2022)
    and Yuan et al. (2022) used source data as input of the workflow to generate the
    zone management of the soil data that can be measured with hand-acquired data
    or with the aid of electromagnetic sensors. All the previous works use proximal
    sensing data as source data, and the procedures for determining the number and
    location of zones were not performed automatically so it is difficult to scale.
    Our contribution to this theme was to test an automatic approach to delineate
    the homogeneous zones starting from multispectral images in two different sites
    and then agronomically validate this approach with the typical agronomic crop
    sampling activity and statistical analysis. The approach was able to fit with
    the experimental design of both sites, and statistical analysis showed differences
    in yields between the zone management due to the different N levels for both sites
    (Karpinski et al., 2015). This approach could be scaled at a large scale by using
    the freely accessible multispectral images obtainable by Sentinel 2 Copernicus
    constellation. 5 CONCLUSIONS Although N fertilization has several negative environmental
    and social impacts, it also improves crop yield, farmer income, and global food
    security. An opportunity exists to further enhance the yield, and profitability,
    and reduce the environmental impacts of agricultural activity through the SSM,
    which is the most common and operational activity of the PA applications. To implement
    the SSM, it is necessary to perform a continuous monitoring activity of the crop
    status during the entire growing season with spatial-temporal data and define
    the number and location of homogeneous zones. Nowadays, many approaches are used
    to define the number of zones in an arbitrary and constant way, such as high-,
    medium-, and low-input zones, without a priori statistical analysis, and it is
    difficult to use them as source data at the operational level. The approach here
    reported showed the potential of multispectral images to be used as input data
    of an automatic workflow to delineate the management zones to apply the SSM. The
    management zones delineated by the automatic approach were agronomically validated
    by on-season crop sampling and multi-site/year yield data. The workflow could
    be scaled to bigger areas by using as source free multispectral data of the “Sentinel-2”
    Copernicus Satellites constellation. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Roberto Orsini: Conceptualization;

  description: Soilless farming systems are currently considered a viable production
    technique reducing environmental impacts due to use of chemical factors, soil
    and water This study analysed the first high-tech hydroponic greenhouse in Southern
    Italy, using a Life Cycle Assessment approach. The environmental performances
    of equipped with automated systems for monitoring the growth environment (high-tech)
    and soil based without automation of climate and lighting (low-tech) greenhouses
    were compared. The analysis of high-tech greenhouse was based on primary data
    from field surveys. For low-tech greenhouse, secondary data from literature were
    used. The system boundary was from ‘cradle-to-farm-gate’, the functional unit
    1 ha of cultivated area. Soil-based cultivation had the highest overall environmental
    impacts primarily attributable to consumption of fossil fuel and the fertilisers.
    The results showed that in the high-tech greenhouse, the use of renewable energy
    and soilless closed-loop cultivation system electronically controlled and managed,
    significantly reduced the environmental burden. Results suggest solution for the
    expansion of greenhouse farming improving their environmental performances by
    renewable energy and closed-loop systems. This study regarding an advanced and
    almost unique reality is suitable to be reapplied in any context vocated to greenhouses
    vegetable farming with the foresight to appropriately complement it by economic
    and social assessments.

    The environmental performances of equipped with automated systems for monitoring
    the growth environment (high-tech) and soil based without automation of climate
    and lighting (low-tech) greenhouses were compared. The analysis of high-tech greenhouse
    was based on primary data from field surveys. For low-tech greenhouse, secondary
    data from literature were used. The system boundary was from ‘cradle-to-farm-gate’,
    the functional unit 1 ha of cultivated area. Soil-based cultivation had the highest
    overall environmental impacts primarily attributable to consumption of fossil
    fuel and the fertilisers. The results showed that in the high-tech greenhouse,
    the use of renewable energy and soilless closed-loop cultivation system electronically
    controlled and managed, significantly reduced the environmental burden. Results
    suggest solution for the expansion of greenhouse farming improving their environmental
    performances by renewable energy and closed-loop systems. This study regarding
    an advanced and almost unique reality is suitable to be reapplied in any context

    to FAO forecasts, the global growing population of 9.9 billion by 2050 will require
    twice as much water and land to produce food. Furthermore, agriculture should
    take into account the challenges due to changing climatic conditions and the incidence
    of biotic stresses (Raza et al., 2019; Teshome et al., 2020). Competition for
    natural resources and the pressure on the environment of farming activities rise
    to the need to develop strategies favouring a shift towards less impactful farming
    methods. The Sustainable Development Goals state that to be sustainable, agriculture
    requires major improvements in resource efficiency, mitigation of negative effects
    on the environment and guarantee of global food security. Protected cultivation
    has spread significantly in recent decades as its controlled environment provides
    a means of facing adverse weather events. This cultivation system allows year-round
    production, higher yields and more efficient use of natural resources and agronomic
    inputs (Padmanabhan et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2008). However, several studies
    report that greenhouse cultivation is associated to environmental impacts mainly
    due to the large consumption of energy for heating and lighting (Ntinas et al.,
    2017a; Omer, 2016; Paris et al., 2022a). Heating and cooling of greenhouses positively
    influences yields (Soussi et al., 2022); however, the use of electricity for microclimate
    conditioning and lighting of greenhouses is mostly dependent on fossil sources,
    resulting in considerable greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) (Paris et al., 2022b).
    According to the literature, energy consumption increases significantly where
    temperatures are colder and the weather is generally cloudy, as in northern European
    countries (Acosta-Silva et al., 2019; Gorjian et al., 2021). The need to reduce
    GHG from fossil fuels sets the goal of accelerating the transition to clean energy
    to achieve international climate targets. The limitations of this farming system
    highlight the need for suitable technologies to address the environmental footprint
    of farms. The choices of the growers regarding the production techniques utilised
    have a long-term impact on environmental quality and natural resources availability;
    therefore, polluting production activities make the transition to more environmentally
    friendly cultivation systems indispensable. In recent years, increasing attention
    has been paid to so-called high-tech greenhouses. These greenhouses have emerged
    in response to the need to increase yields by efficiently using resources such
    as water, fertilisers and energy (Moons et al., 2022). Modern greenhouses are
    equipped with various technological devices, such as fertigation sensors (Canaj
    et al., 2021), supplementary lighting (Palmitessa et al., 2021), software for
    microclimate control (Nicolosi et al., 2017) and photovoltaic systems for electricity
    generation (Liantas et al., 2023). The challenge for modern and sustainable greenhouses
    is to optimize input management, such as water, fertilisers, pesticides and energy.
    Soilless cultivation systems (SCS) are applied in most high-tech greenhouses (Gruda
    et al., 2019). SCS is a modern greenhouse cultivation technology, that represents
    an example of innovative production process (Savvas and Gruda, 2018). SCS does
    not use soil for cultivation but includes hydroponic and substrate-based cultivation.
    Hydroponic cultivation involves a liquid medium such as the Floating System (floating
    hydroponics) and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) in which the plant root is immersed
    directly into the nutrient solution; substrate-based cultivation is a system that
    uses various inert organic (e.g., coconut fibre) or inorganic (e.g., rockwool
    or perlite) substrates. In addition SCS offer the great advantage to prevent the
    proliferation of soil pathogens, strongly affecting greenhouses, (Gonnella and
    Renna, 2021a), as soil is replaced by inert substrates free of pests and diseases
    due to their production process (Raviv et al., 2019). The continuing transition
    to soilless cultivation is also due to the possibility of improving system performance
    through better control of several crucial factors. Soilless greenhouse cultivation
    is characterised using sophisticated structures and equipment that allow for greater
    efficiency in the use of inputs resources in production processes. The fertigation
    can be precisely controlled by a decision support system based on sensors that
    detect the real needs of the plants, and the closed-loop system allows drainage
    to be recovered and reused several times in the same production cycle. These technologies
    make efficient use of inputs and limit losses into the environment (Bacci et al.,
    2005; Massa et al., 2020a; Putra and Yuliando, 2015). The increasing attention
    to environmental concerns related to food supply chains, requires the need for
    evaluating the different production technologies. There are an increasing number
    of technical innovations that can be used in greenhouses to increase productivity;
    however, their effects on natural resources and environmental impacts have to
    be carefully evaluated and considered. In this multifaceted framework, it is crucial
    that each technological innovation was accurately evaluate regarding to its own
    environmental performances and impacts. For this purpose, efficient and shared
    analysis tools and methodologies are needed and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is
    currently widely recognized and applied by the scientific community. The importance
    of the production stage in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (De Boni et al., 2022a)
    of vegetable products draws attention on a careful assessment of efficiency of
    the farming systems and inputs; an urgent consideration should be devoted to environmental
    impacts reduction strategies of greenhouses cultivation. The aim of this study
    was to evaluate and compare, through a LCA analysis, the environmental sustainability
    of two different greenhouse production systems for tomatoes: 1) soilless cultivation
    in a high-tech glasshouse; 2) soil-based cultivation in a low-tech greenhouse.
    LCA was used to quantify the energy demand, resources consumption and pollutant
    emissions of technological improvements of the greenhouse production system. Among
    horticultural crops, tomato has been selected as a representative crop for the
    study as it represents the most widespread greenhouse crop. Thus, growing tomatoes
    in greenhouse in considered the most efficient method to produce quality tomatoes
    while saving water resources, whereas open-field tomato cultivation is hampered
    by high incidence of pests and diseases, and is extremely sensitive to heat and
    water shortage stress (Amoako Ofori et al., 2022). Insights from this research
    may contribute to improve the sustainability of crop productions because it quantifies
    precisely all the environmental impacts due to the different input and technologies
    involved in the tomato cultivation. It may be of particular interest of practitioner
    interested in optimising input consumption. That may reduce costs and may allow
    to boast an environmental quality certification to enhance its product. Policy
    makers may be particularly interested in the results and methodology used to calibrate
    support tools to foster the sustainability of specific companies and products
    in accordance with the European Green Deal guidelines, that under the United Nations
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), were used as targets to assess the sustainability
    of production systems. To address the environmental issues involved in greenhouse
    systems, sustainable agricultural practices using technological solutions are
    required. Soilless cultivation in high-tech greenhouses is a possible pathway
    to sustainable intensification. In high-tech greenhouses, management practices
    and environmental performance can be improved through the adoption of solutions
    that reduce dependence on natural resources and fossil fuels and improve production
    yields. Considering the environmental impacts caused by agriculture and the scarcity
    of natural resources, more sustainable practices and technologies are needed.
    In this LCA study, a benchmark was used to show how soilless cultivation system
    in high-tech greenhouse can be used to produce vegetables with a more sustainable
    use of resources and energy, mitigating the environmental impacts of low-tech
    greenhouses. 1.1. Literature review The development of smart greenhouses is crucial
    to achieve sustainable agricultural production. Intensive greenhouse production
    allows production efficiency; however, it involves several environmental risks.
    The main one is represented by the emissions related to the considerable amount
    of electricity needed for temperature control and artificial lighting (Gołasa
    et al., 2021; Mahdavian and Wattanapongsakorn, 2017). Reducing energy use and
    carbon neutrality are the most important global environmental goals in response
    to the climate emergency (Feng, 2022). Recent studies have provided important
    information on several innovations in protected greenhouse cultivation. Various
    researchers reported that the use of renewable energy improved carbon footprint
    by 24% (Chel and Kaushik, 2011a; Ntinas et al., 2020). Gorjian et al. (2021) and
    Ntinas et al. (2017b) have investigated the use of natural gas and solar energy
    in greenhouses in Southern Europe, the results suggest that up to 60% of the carbon
    footprint can be reduced through renewable energy. In greenhouses, electricity
    is also used for supplementary light to extend the growing season and increase
    yields in seasons with low levels of solar radiation (Paucek et al., 2020a). Recently,
    high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps have been replaced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
    Recent technological advances have made high-intensity LED lamps more attractive
    as lighting sources as they save energy by being more efficient in converting
    electricity into light (Katzin et al., 2021a). Regarding energy use in greenhouse
    sector, there is great potential in reducing GHG through the energy transition
    towards renewables; however, few studies exist examining the use of renewable
    energy in greenhouse production (Paris et al., 2022b). Moreover, some research
    results suggest that the adoption of renewable energy is hindered by the high
    cost of the initial investment (Acosta-Silva et al., 2019). Therefore, policies
    should take into account the need for subsidies to encourage farmers to use renewable
    energy. Each sector must consider how to respond and the use of renewable energy
    in greenhouses is a field that has been hardly investigated so far. Since in protected
    cultivation systems the use of electricity plays a dominant role, renewable energy
    source is a possible solution for reducing GHG emissions from electricity consumption
    and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Soilless cultivation systems,
    applied in high-tech greenhouses, is a cultivation method that can ensure food
    safety, thanks to the high yields and products quality (Gruda, 2009; Lykogianni
    et al., 2023; Malik et al., 2018). Higher tomato yields have been observed in
    high-tech greenhouses in Spain and the Netherlands, mainly due to the use of supplementary
    light (Zhou et al., 2021). According to Torrellas et al. (2012c), the recycling
    of nutrient solution through a closed-loop system in soilless cultivation results
    in significant water savings compared to low-tech systems. A study compared greenhouse
    soil cultivation in Germany with hydroponic cultivation in Greece (Ntinas et al.,
    2017b). The authors stated that soilless cultivation resulted in significant water
    savings, 458.4 L m−2 and 216.1 L m-2 respectively. Other studies have shown that
    switching to a closed-loop system in soilless cultivation substantially reduces
    nitrate pollution of water resources, moreover the recycling of the nutrient solution
    optimises water and fertiliser use (Gartmann et al., 2023; Massa et al., 2010).
    Fertigation sensors and the closed-loop system allow optimal use of water and
    fertilisers, reducing their negative impacts on the environment (Pardossi et al.,
    2009). Considering the need for increasing automation and reduce pollution, the
    adoption of these techniques appears to be an evolution of protected crops. Scientific
    findings provide evidence for optimising production processes, which is useful
    for improving knowledge for decision-makers and stakeholders. Reducing emissions
    from food production is one of the greatest global challenges, so particular attention
    should be paid to potential strategies for improving the sustainability of greenhouse
    crop production. To respond to the growing world-wide food demand and the need
    for sustainable production processes, these high-tech greenhouses must be constructed
    quickly and in quantity (Alvarado et al., 2020a). In the literature, there are
    few studies conducted on soilless production in high-tech greenhouses, especially
    in Mediterranean regions where they are not yet widespread (Incrocci et al., 2020;
    Bakker et al., 2008)). Most Mediterranean greenhouses are still low-tech with
    plastic coverings and no climate monitoring systems (Antón et al., 2007; Cellura
    et al., 2012a) in which vegetable production takes place in soil (Incrocci et
    al., 2020; Thompson et al., 2020). In these regions, heated greenhouses and the
    adoption of technological innovations are still limited due to the higher costs
    of technological facilities and the lack of knowledge of growers about the potential
    benefits (Blanco et al., 2022; Castilla et al., 2004). Therefore, most studies
    on performance and environmental impacts have focused on unheated low-tech greenhouses
    (Alvarado et al., 2020b; Khapte et al., 2022; Passam et al., 2001; Rojas-Rishor
    et al., 2022; Tuzel et al., 2017). Considering that the several published studies
    on high-tech greenhouses mainly cover the areas of Northern Europe, Asia and the
    United States (Blanco et al., 2022), a study in the Mediterranean area, such as
    Italy, could be useful for stakeholders and policy makers to know the progress
    of greenhouse cultivation and the environmental implications. Technologies for
    greenhouse sector are continually developing and currently there is little data
    on these in Italy. To our knowledge, there are no detailed analyses of high-tech
    greenhouse production systems. Furthermore, few studies have compared the environmental
    performance of low-tech and high-tech greenhouses. Thus, this study discusses
    the environmental performance of relevant developments of a high-tech greenhouse
    in cultivation techniques (soilless), fertirrigation management (closed-loop system
    for recirculation, automated sensors), electricity-saving systems (photovoltaic
    panels, LED light). The objective of this research was to provide scientific evidence
    useful to transfer information to growers and policy makers. The results may be
    useful to improve the level of knowledge about the potential advantages of increasing
    the technological level of greenhouses and to outline strategies to encourage
    their diffusion. This study addresses the environmental sustainability of a high-tech
    hydroponic greenhouse in Italy. For comparison with the performance of a low-tech
    greenhouse, the analysis draws on literature studies in four Mediterranean regions.
    However, the general conclusions are applicable to other regions worldwide. 2.
    Materials and methods A reference point is needed to assess the environmental
    performance of a technologically improved greenhouse management system. Therefore,
    the environmental impact of two greenhouse tomato production techniques was evaluated
    by modelling two scenarios with two different technological levels, called high-tech
    greenhouse and low-tech greenhouse. For the production scenario in a high-tech
    greenhouse, primary data collection was conducted through a direct interview with
    the owners of a production company located in Monopoli (BA), (40.9027253 N,17.3277492
    E), in the region of Apulia, southern Italy (reference year 2022). During the
    survey, greenhouse growers and managers described their operations and quantified
    material and energy inputs for the production process. Specifically, it is an
    innovative semi-closed commercial greenhouse with photovoltaic panels for energy
    production and a closed-loop system for nutrient solution management. Tomatoes
    are grown on rockwool substrate using precision sensors for fertigation and supplemental
    LED light. The greenhouse was considered as a case study as it is representative
    of high-tech agricultural practices. Moreover, it should be underlined that for
    the high-tech greenhouse scenario, it was possible to use data from a single farm
    as it is not yet widespread in Italy, but it can be considered a pilot firm in
    Apulia region. For the comparison with the low-tech greenhouse, data from the
    literature were used. The studies in the literature were selected according to
    the following criteria: (i) tomato production in greenhouses, (ii) southern European
    regions, (iii) low-tech greenhouses with soil cultivation. Since energy consumption
    between greenhouses is strongly influenced by climate, case studies conducted
    in Mediterranean basin were selected. Moreover, a limited number of studies were
    used for modelling the low-tech greenhouse production system in order to improve
    data consistency. From the reviewed publications, the inventory data of four studies
    were chosen and average values were used as representative data to be applied
    in the analysis of tomato production in a low-tech greenhouse. The four selected
    representative case studies concern the cultivation of tomatoes on soil in low-tech
    greenhouses in four Mediterranean regions: Italy, Spain, Albania and France (Boulard
    et al., 2011a; Canaj et al., 2020; Cellura et al., 2012b; Torrellas et al., 2012a).
    Two representative production systems were modelled and evaluated starting from
    data collected both in field surveys and in desk analyses: (1) soilless cultivation
    in high-tech glasshouse with steel structure, (2) soil-based cultivation in low-tech
    greenhouse with plastic covering and structure in steel. In the high-tech glasshouse,
    plants are grown on rockwool substrate, the most used in heated greenhouses. Irrigation
    is managed using high-precision irrigation sensors, which detect the real water
    needs of the plants, and a closed-loop system, in which excess nutrient solution
    is recovered and recirculated after a process of filtration, correction and disinfection.
    Concerning the energy inputs, the farm is powered by solar photovoltaic energy
    and a cogeneration plant that uses natural gas. Moreover, the plants are grown
    with supplemental LED lighting as a solution to ensure year-round productivity
    (Palmitessa et al., 2020a; Paucek et al., 2020b). For the low-tech greenhouse
    production, the tomatoes are planted on soil, tillage involves ploughing and levelling,
    fertirrigation is via a drip system and there is no heating system. Table 1 summarises
    an average of the input-output data of the two production systems. Table 1. Main

    LCA is a methodology to systematically assess the environmental performance of
    a product or service system throughout its life cycle (Alhashim et al., 2021;
    De Boni et al., 2022b; Muralikrishna and Manickam, 2017; Roy et al., 2009). The
    analysis considers all stages of the life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials
    to the production phase and disposal. Through the compilation of inputs and outputs
    in the life cycle inventory and the assessment of potential environmental impacts,
    LCA a powerful tool for interpretation of disparity among different phases of
    production processes. In the agricultural sector, LCA is mainly used to assess
    the environmental issues of agricultural activities. The results of this methodology
    allow more environmentally friendly agricultural practices to be identified to
    support decision-making processes (Torres Pineda et al., 2021). The LCA study
    was performed in conformity with ISO 14040 standards (ISO, 2006), aiming to assess
    the environmental impact of tomato production in order to identify the environmental
    hotspots and suggest improvements for increasing sustainability of the production
    system. The representative greenhouses were the primary source of data, while
    the secondary data for the background processes were obtained from the Ecoinvent
    database (Frischknecht et al., 2005). The impact assessment was performed using
    the software Simapro 7.3., the evaluation methods used were EPD 2008 (Environmental
    Product Declarations) and Eco-indicator 99. The EPD is based on the ISO 14025
    standard to conduct a type III environmental declaration (Del Borghi et al., 2020).
    Type III labels are based on life cycle assessment and report multiple environmental
    impacts (Hospido et al., 2022). Other authors have recognized EPDs as one of the
    most important environmental impact assessment systems, because they are based
    on a common methodology and because their transparency contributes to the comparability
    of different declarations (Lauri et al., 2020; Rangelov et al., 2021). Furthermore,
    with EPDs it appears that overestimation of potential environmental impacts can
    be avoided (Del Rosario et al., 2021). We focused on five impact categories that
    investigated the main potential environmental impacts: Global Warming Potential
    with a timeline of 100 years (GWP) in kg CO2 eq., Ozone layer Depletion (OLD)
    in kg CFC-11 eq., Eutrophication (EU) in kg PO4 eq., Acidification (AC) in kg
    SO2 eq., and Non-renewable, fossil (NRF) in MJ (Nicolo’ et al., 2017). Eco-indicator
    99 is an environmental impact assessment method that enables impact categories
    (midpoints) to be aggregated into three damage categories (endpoints) called eco-indicators:
    human health, ecosystem quality and resources (Goedkoop and Spriensma, 2001).
    The main advantage is that it is possible to obtain a single environmental score
    through the weighting procedure (i.e. eco-indicator). Therefore, the methodology
    of Eco-indicator 99 simplifies the interpretation of LCA results by limiting the
    number of impacts to be assessed. Damage to human health is expressed in disability-adjusted
    life year (DALY) and includes six impact categories: carcinogens, respiratory
    organics and inorganics, climate change, radiation, ozone layer. Damage to ecosystem
    quality, expressed in potentially disappeared fraction (PDF)*m2*year, refers to
    the loss of species over a certain area, during a certain time. This eco-indicator
    aggregates three impact categories: ecotoxicity, acidification/eutrophication,
    and land use. Damage to resources is measured in the surplus energy needed for
    future extractions of minerals and fossil fuels (MJ surplus); the impact categories
    included are minerals and fossil fuels. All resources utilization and emissions
    were assigned to a functional unit of 1 ha of harvested land; the study set the
    system boundaries from raw material extraction to the farm gate. Since the goal
    was to improve production techniques, the system boundaries included the main
    agricultural operations: pest management, fertilisation, irrigation, soil tillage,
    as well as energy consumption. The background processes included: the extraction
    of raw materials and the production of pesticides, fertilisers, fossil fuel, electricity
    and natural gas (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (195KB) Download

    to environmental impact (construction, maintenance and disposal) was not included
    in the analysis because, due to its generally long lifespan, it may be considered
    insignificant versus that of the other inputs (Torres Pineda et al., 2021). The
    high-tech greenhouse was intended as representative of the more advanced cultivation
    technologies for the improvement of Mediterranean greenhouses. Several alternatives
    that could be applied to improve the environmental performance of low-tech greenhouses
    were analysed, such as the use of renewable energy, hydroponic cultivation and
    recirculation of the nutrient solution. 3. Results 3.1. Life cycle impact assessment
    The most relevant aspects focused on are the reduction of the use of fossil fuels,
    the application of water and fertilisers and the recycling of the nutrient solution.
    Comparison of the two systems showed that soilless cultivation in the high-tech
    greenhouse is more environmentally friendly than cultivation on soil in the low-tech
    greenhouse. In the high-tech greenhouse, electricity is used for temperature control,
    supplemental lighting and nutrient circulation, therefore it is more energy intensive
    (1,310,070 kWh ha−1) than the low-tech greenhouse (10,979 kWh ha−1) (Table 1),
    which reduces the sustainability of this system. However, it also depends on the
    sources of energy production. The use of renewable energy in the Apulian greenhouse
    resulted in negative values of GWP and AC (−2.15 kg CO2 eq and −0.011 kg SO2 eq,
    respectively) (Table 2), which means that the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide
    (CO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are sequestered from the atmosphere during the
    life cycle. These results confirm that environmental performances may be improved
    through the use of renewable energy systems for regulation of greenhouse habitat
    (Acosta-Silva et al., 2019). Furthermore, LED lights are more energy efficient
    than HPS lights (Katzin et al., 2021b), offering potential to reduce overall energy
    consumption. Table 2. Results of LCA analysis related to 1 ha of cultivated area

    MJ 13.6 16.4 These results are confirmed by a study conducted in a high-tech multi-tunnel
    greenhouse in Almeria, Spain (Torrellas et al., 2012b). The analysis showed that
    with 40% renewable energy used in the electricity generation, the environmental
    loads can be reduced of up to 32%. Furthermore, achieving higher yields of 25
    kg m−2, as in our case, by increasing the efficiency of production systems leads
    to a 34% reduction in inputs and environmental impacts. Natural gas, for the heating
    system, is a major burden in all impact categories. The greatest burden is in
    terms of NRF (35%), GWP (32%) and OLD (32%) due to the emissions of CO2 and nitrous
    oxide (N2O) from combustion, as well as methane (CH4) emitted during production.
    Results for heated greenhouses in France (Boulard et al., 2011a) confirm that
    around 90% of the total impact is due to the use of non-renewable fossil energy
    for heating greenhouses. Natural gas provided 85% of the NRF impact category and
    caused 80% of the total GWP. Fertilisation had the highest environmental impact
    on the OLD (52%) and PO (43%) categories, that are higher for soilless cultivation
    than for soil based. The higher consumption of fertilisers is justified by the
    higher planting density (4.73 stems m−2) than soil-based cultivation (2.5 stems
    m−2). The emission of acidifying compounds from fertiliser manufacturing was the
    main process causing the impacts. On the other hand, recycling the nutrient solution
    results in lower losses of fertilisers to the environment (Giuffrida et al., 2003);
    closed loop system significantly reduced EU by 69% compared to the soil-based
    system (0.0004 against 0.0013 kg PO4 eq). This is also confirmed by comparing
    the results obtained in greenhouses in Spain (Anton et al., 2005). The study found
    a 40% reduction in eutrophication impact in transition from soil-based to soilless
    tomato crop. Concerning the substrate used, rockwool production caused an environmental
    impact mainly determined by acidifying emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), with
    a 10% contribution to the impact category AC. Moreover, the inert substrate does
    not contain soilborne pathogens, which reduces the need for pesticides. It is
    evident that the low-tech system presents a highest impact for most categories.
    The results showed that fertilisers and electricity were major contributors to
    all environmental impact categories. In particular, fertiliser production caused
    85% of the 0.0003 kg of C2H4 eq (PO) and 64% of the 0.002 kg of SO4 eq (AC). The
    main contributing emissions were SO2, NOx and ammonia (NH3) (Brentrup et al.,
    2004). Nitrogen leaching and the emission of phosphorus to soil (assuming 20%
    of the input) resulted in EU with an incidence of about 53%. The case studies
    on unheated greenhouses in the Mediterranean regions report that in low-tech greenhouses,
    the management of fertilisation is often not optimal, leading to an excessive
    use of inputs. The results identified the use of fertilisers as the main contributor
    to most impact categories. In particular, fertilisation contributed significantly
    to EU, from about 25% to 51%, and GWP, from 30% to 45%, impact categories. Electricity
    consumption, used to pump water for fertigation, contributed mainly to NRF (43%),
    that is almost twice the value of the high-tech greenhouse, GWP (36%) and OLD
    (36%), due to the emission of GHGs: CO2, CH4, and N2O. This is coherent with the
    other LCA studies on low-tech greenhouses confirming that energy for irrigation
    is the second main factor contributing to environmental footprint. environmental.
    The insights of this study indicated that it is possible to achieve improvements
    in the production system and at once lower environmental impacts with greenhouse
    optimisation. The LCA results showed that the switch to renewable energy and a
    closed-loop system can significantly reduce the environmental impacts of soilless
    cultivation in high-tech greenhouses. In an effort to increase understanding of
    the two different production systems, a further comparative analysis was carried
    out using the Eco-Indicator 99 environmental assessment method. The results are
    shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2. Table 3. LCA results from damage assessment (Eco-Indicator

    categories to endpoint impact categories by Eco-Indicator 99 method: human health
    (a); ecosystem quality (b); resources (c). Soilless cultivation in the high-tech
    greenhouse generated a positive performance regarding damage to human health,
    190% less damage with respect to the low-tech greenhouse. The negative endpoint
    category score (−4.7*10−5 DALY) indicates an avoided environmental impact. This
    is due to the use of renewable solar energy that avoids the emission of inorganic
    compounds (respiratory inorganics) and greenhouse gases (climate change, radiation).
    This result confirms the importance of the transition to renewable energy in agri-food
    systems (FAO, 2021). Regarding the ecosystem quality and resources indicators,
    high-tech greenhouse showed relatively higher damage values, 1.2 times and 1.8
    times greater than low-tech greenhouses. For ecosystem damage, the major contribution
    arises from the ecotoxicity impact category. Fertiliser production was the process
    with the greatest impact, due to emissions of nitrogen oxides. Therefore, ecotoxicity
    for high-tech greenhouse is higher in comparison to low-tech one due to the greater
    use of nutrients. For the low-tech greenhouse, acidification/eutrophication was
    the second most important cause of damage to ecosystem quality, with 31% of the
    impact. This was dominated by non-renewable energy consumption and the emission
    of nitrogen and phosphate compounds. On the other hand, the same category generated
    an avoided impact in the high-tech greenhouse (−409%), attributed to the adoption
    of renewable energy, which avoids the emission of acidifying compounds into the
    air, and the closed-loop system that avoids the emission of the eutrophicating
    compounds into the water. The resources category was influenced by fossil resources
    depletion. In high-tech greenhouse, approximately 90% of the impact is due to
    the use of natural gas for greenhouse heating and the production and transport
    of fertilisers. In low-tech, the input that was identified to contribute the most
    is non-renewable energy for fertigation (80%). Damage analysis at the endpoint
    level showed slightly higher environmental impacts for the ecosystem quality and
    resources categories of the high-tech greenhouse; however, these are offset by
    the positive environmental performance (avoided impact) in the acidification/eutrophication
    midpoint impact category and human health endpoint damage. Moreover, it should
    be underlined that the yield is 1.5 times higher for the soilless technique in
    a high-tech greenhouse. Fig. 2 shows the contribution of the midpoint impact categories
    on the three endpoint categories. 3.2. Scenario sensitivity analysis A scenario
    sensitivity analysis was performed for LCA results of the high-tech greenhouse,
    considering the variability of electricity consumption and fresh tomato yield,
    as those are the most important input in heated greenhouses and output, respectively.
    For the analysis, the One-At-a-Time (OAT) method was applied (Pianosi et al.,
    2016); the influence of reduction and increase was evaluated by assigning each
    parameter a range of variation between −10% and +10%, according to the specifications
    of the Apulian high-tech greenhouse technicians. Stochastic modelling was performed
    to estimate the probability of variation with a number of 100 simulations. From
    the probabilistic approach, the highest probability levels were selected, −9%,
    +3%, +10% for the energy requirement and −4%, +5% for the yield (Fig. 3). Download

    Probability distribution of: (a) percentage variation in energy consumption; (b)
    percentage variation in yield. The results in Table 4 show that the 10% increase
    in energy consumption is the variation that most influences the LCA results. The
    worsening of environmental performance is due to the dependence on the electricity
    grid to satisfy the increased energy demand not met by photovoltaic panels. In
    detail, the negative variations in GW and AC show that higher energy requirement,
    satisfied by fossil fuels, reduces the positive effect on avoided pollutant emissions
    of the base case (photovoltaic energy only). The sensitivity analysis highlighted
    that the use of renewable energies sources is determinant for the viability of
    greenhouse production systems. Otherwise, the −9% reduction in electricity utilization
    would increase GHG emissions savings by +1.5% and +1.2% for GW and AC respectively.
    Yield variations have proportional influences on environmental loads, so negative
    yield variations negatively affect environmental performance. In general, the
    average variations showed that the varied parameters did not significantly affect
    the relative results, demonstrating the viability of the results and the robustness
    of the model. Table 4. OAT sensitivity analysis. Impact categories Variation Electricity

    emissions depend on the greenhouse type and the source used. The most innovative
    element of Apulian high-tech greenhouse lies in the energy approach. The results
    of this study showed that the use of photovoltaic panels allowed large savings
    in terms of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The findings of the
    literature confirm that the environmental loads can be reduced considerably with
    renewables sources reducing CO2 emissions (Achour et al., 2021; Chel and Kaushik,
    2011b; Nicolosi et al., 2017). In addition, as reported by Palmitessa et al. (2020b),
    to be more energy efficient, LED lights offer stable output on an annual basis
    and the increase in output could mitigate environmental impacts per unit of product.
    The eutrophication potential, mainly due to nitrate leaching, depends on fertilisation
    management. In the soil-based system, the absence of fertigation sensors and recirculation
    system means that the crop is always fed with fresh solution delivered more than
    the actual needs of the plants. Excess solution leads to nutrient leaching and
    consequent pollution of water bodies (Bres and Politycka, 2016). In the high-tech
    greenhouse analysed fertigation sensors and the closed-loop system reduce excessive
    fertiliser use, moreover, not using the soil prevents nutrient leaching and the
    loss of irrigation water through gravity. These results are in accordance with
    those of other studies (Gonnella and Renna, 2021b; Massa et al., 2020b), which
    reported an improved input use efficacy in soilless cultivation with closed-loop
    systems. Other authors stated that sensors and micro-irrigation, at reduced flow
    rates, save water by optimising distribution in proportion to the absorption capacity
    of the plants (Fan et al., 2020; Nikolaou et al., 2019). According to Pardossi
    et al. (2009) Pardossi, the high-water efficiency makes closed-loop systems interesting
    for areas with a climate with low water availability. An important negative impact
    derives from the waste of rockwool substrate used in soilless technique. The use
    of rockwool is criticised by the problem of landfilling, which is responsible
    for significant pollutant emissions. However, some studies report that sustainability
    can be improved through recycling, for example by mixing it with peat to create
    a potting substrate (Boulard et al., 2011b; Bussell and Mckennie, 2004a). Currently,
    very few studies have evaluated the possibility of composting rock wool, which
    is mainly hampered by the presence of plastic. A study showed that after a grinding
    and drying process, plastic residues can be separated from rock wool, which can
    be reused again as a substrate or for the production of bricks (Bussell and Mckennie,
    2004b). Therefore, further research is needed to increase the sustainability of
    soilless cultivation from a circular economy perspective. The results of this
    study are in line with previous studies which showed that high-tech greenhouses
    and hydroponic growing techniques can reduce the environmental impact of greenhouse
    horticulture (Gruda et al., 2019; Koukounaras, 2020; Pomoni et al., 2022; Van
    Tuyll et al., 2022). However, the literature review revealed that there are economic,
    governmental and technological barriers to renewable energies adoption. The high
    initial investment required, the difficulty in obtaining funding and the low availability
    of skilled technicians are the main factors affecting the renewable energy sector
    (Omer, 2016; Seetharaman et al., 2019). Similar obstacles have been encountered
    for the development of soilless cultivation and high-tech greenhouses, which to
    date represent a small percentage compared to low-tech greenhouses. The biggest
    challenge for entrepreneurs is the high initial investment cost for the construction
    and operation of the greenhouse (Rahman and Alam, 2023; Velazquez-Gonzalez et
    al., 2022). In addition, there are difficulties in finding proper know-how and
    technical support for control systems and software management (Azizoglu et al.,
    2021; Kavga et al., 2018). In our view, considering the various obstacles, political
    decisions will be crucial for the development and diffusion of state-of-the-art
    production techniques and renewable energies. Governments and public bodies should
    ensure adequate subsidies to support expensive technologies, promote training
    programmes for competent technicians, and support research to improve the efficiency
    of production techniques and renewable technologies. We want to emphasise that
    to compare the performance of the Apulian high-tech greenhouse with a low-tech
    one, we modelled the low-technology scenario on data from literature studies on
    greenhouse tomato production in Mediterranean regions. The authors of the selected
    studies affirm that the inventory data are representative of greenhouse tomato
    cultivation in the country. Therefore, we acknowledge that the comparison is not
    absolute because management practices in greenhouses vary according to their regional
    location. Although the reference system was representative, the quantitative part
    of our study was limited in terms of the sample size of smart greenhouses; unfortunately,
    the adoption of high-tech innovations is not widely spread in Apulian greenhouses.
    The analysis of the environmental sustainability of more high-tech greenhouses
    in the study area could improve the reliability of the results. Therefore, we
    hope that in future research, following the diffusion of high-tech greenhouses,
    a larger sample can be considered to provide a more representative analysis. 5.
    Conclusions The transition to sustainable agriculture requires the development
    of new techniques and management practices that are efficient in terms of water,
    nutrients and energy. It is therefore a matter of implementing a process of technological
    innovation in greenhouse cultivation, aimed at reducing environmental impact and
    standardising production systems, as far as quality and quantity. The main aim
    of this study was to investigate the environmental performance of cherry tomato
    cultivation in Italy''s first high-tech hydroponic greenhouse using life cycle
    analysis methodology. The Apulian high-tech greenhouse was intended as representative
    of the more advanced cultivation technologies for the improvement of Mediterranean
    greenhouses. Through a comparison with the environmental performance of the low-tech
    greenhouse scenario, this study provided an understanding of possible technological
    and production innovations that can be used to reduce the environmental impacts
    of greenhouse production. By means of application of LCA it has been achieved
    the definition of the main environmental burdens and the evaluation of possible
    alternative reduction methods. The results of the comparison of the two greenhouse
    cultivation systems showed that electricity and fertigation are the main hotspots
    in greenhouse cultivation. This LCA study showed that the switch to renewable
    energy and a closed-loop system is crucial to improve the environmental sustainability
    of the greenhouse sector. The results obtained showed that the use of renewable
    energy in the high-tech was of great importance. Photovoltaic panels generated
    considerable avoided impacts on global warming and acidification potential, −2.15
    kg CO2 eq and −0.011 kg SO2 eq, respectively. Moreover, the use of supplementary
    LED light results in higher yields in the high-tech greenhouse, 25 kg m−2 compared
    to 16 kg m−2 for the low-tech greenhouse. In soilless cultivation, recycling the
    nutrient solution results in lower fertilisers losses to the environment. In fact,
    the closed loop system significantly reduced the eutrophication potential by 69%
    compared to the soil-based system (0.0004 vs. 0.0013 kg PO4 eq). The sensitivity
    analysis highlighted that the use of renewable energies sources is determinant
    to improve the sustainability of greenhouse production systems. The analysis also
    showed that the higher yields achieved in soilless cultivation in high-tech greenhouses
    reduce the overall environmental load. High-technology greenhouses offer the opportunity
    to improve yields while reducing environmental impact using energy-efficient and
    water-saving technologies. In this study, it was shown that a high-tech greenhouse
    can be environmentally sustainable with the use of renewable energy, fertigation
    sensors and a closed-loop system. However, nowadays, high-tech greenhouses are
    not widespread in some Mediterranean regions such as Italy, which are dominated
    by unheated greenhouses with reduced technological equipment. Technological advances
    require considerable investment by the agricultural entrepreneurs. Therefore,
    economic feasibility is another important aspect to consider. Consequently, the
    analysis will be integrated with the assessment of the economic sustainability
    of soilless cultivation in high-tech greenhouse. Future research will deal with
    monitoring of performances and practicability of this innovative technology over
    time. Funding This work was supported by the Rural Development Programme of the

  description: Soil salinization and the shortage of water resources have become important
    factors affecting the sustainable development of agriculture in the southern Xinjiang.
    Agricultural flooding in winter or spring is the main means to reduce the damage
    of secondary soil salinization in southern Xinjiang. However, the spatial heterogeneity
    of soil salinization is not considered in previous irrigation strategy. Excessive
    irrigation always leads to a serious waste of agricultural water resources. Irrigation
    zones delineation based on the degree of soil salinization is beneficial for the
    management of agricultural salinized land and the improvement of water use efficiency
    in arid areas. This study used 1599 sets of apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    data obtained before winter irrigation and after crop harvest to characterize
    soil salinity directly. And the spatial heterogeneity of soil salinity in the
    study area was analyzed directly using ECa values and statistical as well as geostatistical
    methods. Three main variables obtained from apparent electrical conductivity measurements
    (EC0.375, EC0.75, EC1.5), vegetation information (NDVI, GNDVI, SAVI), which indirectly
    reflected the degree of salinity, and environmental factors (Clay, Sand, Silt,
    DEM), which affecting the distribution of salinity, were used as auxiliary variables.
    Four zoning models including soil information, soil + vegetation information,
    soil information + environmental factors and soil + vegetation information + environmental
    factors were constructed. A multi-scale segmentation algorithm was used to delineate
    for four zone patterns and evaluate the results of management zones based on the
    different information. The results showed that there was a strong spatial heterogeneity
    of soil salinity in the study area, with the coefficients of variation of ECa
    all higher than 74 %. But the mean of coefficient of variation intra-zone in each
    zone after delineation was less than 24 %, which was significantly lower than
    the value before delineation. The zoning result based on only soil information
    was more fragmented than other zoning results, and the homogeneity intra-zone
    and heterogeneity among zones were both lower. This result was not desirable to
    the development and effective implementation of water resource allocation. Management
    zones delineation with additional vegetation information or environmental factors
    showed a better zoning result. Delineation using multisource data of soil, vegetation
    information and environmental factors not only had the highest homogeneity intra-zone
    and heterogeneity among zones, but also facilitated the implementation of variable-rate
    irrigation. Consequently, salinity management zoning, which integrates soil, vegetation
    information and environmental factors, will facilitate the implementation of efficient
    irrigation with variable irrigating rate.

    • We use different information variables to delineate salinity management zones.
    • The multi-scale segmentation algorithm can effectively delineate homogeneous
    regions. • Management zones delineation using multisource information is more
    scientific and reasonable. • Multi-source information on salinity management zones
    facilitates the provision of effective irrigation strategies. Abstract Soil salinization

    issue, soil salinization has a negative impact on the utilization of limited global
    land resources and the sustainability of irrigated agriculture (Zaman et al.,
    2018, Peng et al., 2019, Chen et al., 2021, Zhou et al., 2022). According to FAO
    (2021), the global salt-affected soils have exceeded 800 million hectares. About
    1/5 of the cultivated land and 1/3 of the totally irrigated land are affected
    by salinization around the world (Wang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020; Corwin,
    2021). Meanwhile, with the intensification of global climate change and human
    activities, soil salinization and water shortage are becoming increasingly prominent
    in agricultural production, seriously threatening the development of irrigated
    agriculture (Measho et al., 2022, Khasanov et al., 2022). Irrigated agriculture
    accounts for over 40 % of global yield, and plays a critical role in global food
    security (World Bank, 2021). In order to meet the increasing demand for food,
    water shortage and soil salinization in irrigated farmland has attracted great
    attention (Mansour et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2022). Especially
    in arid and semi-arid areas where salt is easily accumulated and agricultural
    irrigation water resources are scarce, soil salinization and shortage of agricultural
    irrigation water have become vital factors affecting the development of sustainable
    agriculture. (Minhas et al., 2020, Hou et al., 2022). Therefore, a method for
    variable-rate irrigation of farmland based on soil salinization is needed to promote
    efficient use of the limited water resources in arid areas for achieving sustainable
    agricultural development. Precision agriculture is considered to be the most effective
    measurement to achieve sustainable agricultural development (Haghverdi et al.,
    2015, Ouazaa et al., 2022). Management zoning is an important research component
    of precision agriculture, and is an effective method to achieve efficient management
    of large-scale farmland. Precision management zoning delineate the same homogeneous
    subzones according to soil properties, crop growth and environmental factors to
    adjust agricultural inputs and management practices (Cisternas et al., 2020).
    Unlike conventional management systems, management zoning is an approach considering
    field variability (Vrindts et al., 2005, Cisternas et al., 2020). Nowadays, management
    zoning is mainly based on nutrient management and precision fertilization to delineate
    management zones (Yao et al., 2014, Zeraatpisheh et al., 2020). Traditionally,
    the field investigation method is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and is not
    feasible to be applied in a large area. With the development of remote sensing
    technology, scholars began to use multi-scale segmentation algorithms for zoning
    using remote sensing image data (Liu et al., 2018, Damian et al., 2019). However,
    most studies were based on vegetation information through spectral indices, but
    did not include soil information. Liu et al. (2017) used soil and vegetation information
    for zoning management with an object-oriented multiscale segmentation algorithm.
    But this method is still time-consuming and labor-intensive in acquiring soil
    attribute data, and can only be applied in a small area. Few studies aimed at
    achieving precision irrigation and water use efficiency. In arid and semi-arid
    areas, especially in southern Xinjiang, soil salinization is a prominent problem
    with a strong spatial variability. It is necessary to take different management
    measures based on soil salinization situation, such as irrigation volume quotas
    for winter or spring irrigation, and reasonable layout of crop planting structures.
    Therefore, the variation of soil salinity should be used as a key factor to delineate
    management zones in southern Xinjiang. Then variable-rate irrigation should be
    conducted according to different zones to promote efficient water use and agricultural
    management. Salinization management zoning has an important task which is to obtain
    soil salinization and the related information affecting soil salinization accurately.
    Obtaining soil salinization information at the regional scale needs to assess
    sampling costs. Conventional soil salinization information acquisition requires
    field collection of a large number of soil samples and then laboratory analysis,
    which is time and labor consuming (Hu et al., 2019). In the past decades, the
    EM38-MK2 earth conductivity meter based on the principle of electromagnetic induction
    allows fast, efficient and non-invasive acquisition of apparent soil conductivity
    at different depths with the development of proximal sensing techniques near-ground
    sensing technology. Numerous studies have proved that the apparent soil conductivity
    has a high positive correlation with soil salt content, and can effectively calculate
    the salt content at different soil depths (Hu et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2022,
    Wang et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2022). Moreover, apparent conductivity has been
    used as a proxy for soil salinity in salinity detection (Paz et al., 2020; Barnard
    et al., 2022). At the same time, proximal sensing techniques are recommended by
    the U.S. salinity laboratory for regional-scale salinity surveys (Corwin and Scudiero,
    2019). Therefore, the EM38-MK2 proximal sensing techniques can significantly improve
    the efficiency of soil salinity information acquisition, especially at the regional
    scale. Additionally, remote sensing technology is also considered as an effective
    way to monitor soil salinity (Peng et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2022, Wang et al.,
    2022). In vegetation covered areas, soil salinity directly affects vegetation
    growth. The vegetation cover usually shows a decreasing trend with the increase
    of soil salinity, and vegetation reflectance in the visible near-infrared band
    responds significantly to plant salinity stress (Wang et al., 2018, Seifi et al.,
    2020). Hence, the degree of salinity can be indirectly reflected by the growth
    of the crop. Meanwhile, many previous researchers have constructed a series of
    vegetation indices (Scudiero et al, 2014; Wang et al., 2022c) using visible and
    near-infrared bands, which can reflect soil salinity and crop growth information
    (Minhas et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2021, Ge et al., 2022). Among them, Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and
    Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) can reflect salinity and
    crop growth information in vegetation covered areas very well (Nguyen et al.,
    2021, Ma et al., 2021, Aksoy et al., 2022). Although apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa) data can directly characterize soil salinity, remote sensing data can also
    indirectly reflect the degree of soil salinity through crop growth. Environmental
    factors such as soil texture and topographic data are also play crucial role in
    indicating soil salinity (Ren et al., 2019, Ge et al., 2022). In particular, high
    sand content of the soil indicates the low water-holding capacity, as well as
    the poor adsorption capacity of soil salt. Meanwhile, the high clay content of
    the soil indicates the high water-holding capacity, as well as the better adsorption
    capacity of soil salts. This then make it is more difficult for salts to leach.
    The soil salt content gradually increases from higher to lower elevations (Zhang
    et al., 2022). Currently, soil texture and topographic data are mainly used in
    soil salinity monitoring and mapping, but are rarely applied in soil salinity
    management zoning. Currently, soil salinity zoning primarily employs soil information
    to delineate management zones by fuzzy K-mean clustering algorithm. For example,
    Guo et al. (2019) adopted geostatistics and the fuzzy K-mean clustering algorithm
    to delineate salinity management zones using proximal sensor data. Barman et al.
    (2021) established a soil quality index through soil information and delineated
    salinity management zones using clustering algorithm. However, none of the above
    studies considered the influence of vegetation information and environmental factors
    on zoning. Likewise, there is a lack of integrated investigations of soil, crop
    information and environmental factors for management zoning. Multiscale segmentation
    algorithms can integrate multisource information to delineate the management zones
    efficiently with the development in the field of image classification (Liu et
    al., 2018). Above all, in this study, we took a multi-scale segmentation algorithm
    to delineate optimal salinity management zones in Alar Reclamation, a typical
    oasis in the arid zone of Xinjiang, China. We integrated soil information that
    directly characterizing salinity, vegetation information that indirectly reflecting
    salinity, and environmental factors affecting salinity distribution to scientifically
    delineate management zones. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i)
    reveal the spatial variability of soil salinization in the study area; (ii)evaluate
    the salinity management zones delineated by different information, and determine
    the optimal input variables of salinity management zoning; (iii) identify a management
    zoning strategy suitable for saline soils in arid regions. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Study area The study area is located in the Alar Reclamation (40°22′N - 40°57′N,
    80°30′E - 81°58′E) in southern Xinjiang, China (Fig. 1), with an area of 3924.32
    km2. Alar Reclamation is located in the northwest of the Tarim River Basin, and
    is adjacent to the northern edge of the Taklamakan Desert and the southern foot
    of the Tianshan Mountains, which is a typical artificial oasis in the arid region.
    Climatically, this area has cold winter, hot summer, long sunshine, scarce precipitation
    and strong evaporation, which is a typical continental warm temperate arid climate.
    The annual average precipitation is 60 mm, while the inter-annual evaporation
    is 1800 mm. Owing to the stronger evaporation than precipitation, resulting severe
    salinization in the study area. The land in the study site is divided into agricultural
    land, construction land and unused land based on land use. Agricultural land is
    distributed along both banks of the Tarim River, with an area of 2188.27 km2,
    accounting for 55.76 % of the reclaimed area. The main crop grown on agricultural
    land is cotton. The agricultural land is irrigated by drip irrigation 7 ∼ 9 times
    during the crop reproduction period from the end of March to the end of August,
    with an average irrigation volume of 450 m3 per hectare each time. After evapotranspiration
    throughout the reproductive period, the salinity accumulated in the topsoil reaches
    its maximum amount between years, and remains steady during the fallow period.
    In order to reduce salt stress, farmers conduct the winter irrigation in November
    and spring irrigation in March during the fallow period. Both irrigations drenched
    the salt accumulated in the topsoil to below the cultivated layer by flood irrigation
    (Wang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2022a) with the average irrigation
    volume of 3000 m3 per hectare. Winter and spring irrigation were carried out by
    the farmers from the whole town with the same amount of water, and irrigation
    water mainly came from the Tarim River and reservoirs. Download : Download high-res

    Collection ECa data The EM38-MK2 electromagnetic induction device was used to
    obtain apparent conductivity data. Soil apparent conductivity data were collected
    from late October to early November during after the 2021 crop harvest to before
    the winter irrigation. Firstly, the EM38-MK2 was turned on for 30 min to warm
    up before collecting the apparent conductivity data, and then the instrument was
    zeroed and calibrated according to the user manual. Finally, ECa data was collected
    after the instrument was calibrated. The instrument automatically recorded the
    geographic coordinate information of the sample point and collected the ECa data
    at 0 ∼ 0.375 m depth (EC0.375), 0 ∼ 0.75 m depth (EC0.75) and 0 ∼ 1.5 m depth
    (EC1.5) when each sample point was carried out. Additionally, the distance between
    the neighbor sampling points was less than 3000 m. A total of 1599 sets of ECa
    data were collected in the agricultural land area. 2.2.2. Remote sensing data
    and processing The Landsat8 OLI remote sensing images of study area (Path 146/Row32)
    were obtained from United States Geological Survey (USGS, http://glovis.usgs.gov).
    The date of acquisition of the image (08/07/2021) was at the peak crop growth
    period with cloud cover less than 2 %. The images were pre-processed by radiometric
    calibration and FLAASH atmospheric correction to obtain the crop canopy reflectance
    data more conveniently. Afterward, these images can reflect the crop growth information
    and salinity information in the study area. Therefore, this study calculated these
    three vegetation indices to characterize crop growth (Fig. 2), which were used
    to reflect the degree of soil salinity. In particular, NDVI (NDVI = (NIR-R)/(NIR+R))
    is sensitive to green vegetation. Reflectance increased in the red band and reduced
    in the near-infrared band, respectively, in vegetated areas with high salinity
    (Seifi et al., 2020). Instead, GNDVI (NDVI=(NIR-G)/(NIR+G)) was chosen because
    it could reflect the Nitrogen content in crop leaves better. Nitrogen content
    was decreased in plants subjected to salinity stress so that GNDVI was used for
    monitoring salinity (Datt et al., 1999). There were sparsely vegetated areas in
    the agricultural land area, and soil exposure affected the reflectance values
    in the NIR band but affecting the NDVI estimation results. Otherwise, SAVI (SAVI=((NIR-R)/(NIR+R+0.5))
    * (1 +0.5)) could effectively eliminate the effect of soil background. Download

    DEM: Digital Elevation Model.). 2.2.3. Environmental data This study considered
    the application of soil environmental data to delineate salinity management zones
    more reasonable. First of all, soil texture could impact the accumulation of soil
    salts and salt leaching. A set of texture dataset with a spatial resolution of
    90 m (Liu et al., 2022) was downloaded from the Soil Subcenter of the National
    Earth System Science Data Center of the National Science and Technology Infrastructure
    of China (http://soil.geodata.cn). Specifically, the content of clay, silt and
    sand from topsoil (0–30 cm) were used (Fig. 2). Moreover, topographic factors
    could also essentially affect transport and accumulation of salt. Digital Elevation
    Model (DEM) data (Fig. 2) were downloaded with a spatial resolution of 30 m through
    Geospatial Data Cloud (http://www.gscloud.cn), and pre-processing including depression
    filling and correction was completed using ArcGIS v.10.7. Cubic convolutional
    interpolation method in ArcGIS v.10.7 was used to resample each pre-processed
    raster data to 30 m. All the environment data could match the resolution of Landsat8
    OLI remote sensing image, as Park et al. (2009) concluded that the 30 m grid size
    is most suitable for soil landscape analysis. 2.3. Spatial variability analysis
    The structure of the spatial variability of soil attributes can be explored through
    the variance function (Xia et al., 2020, Ge et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022). Additionally,
    the dependence of adjacent observations could be estimated by equation. It was
    formulated as: (1) where was number of experimental pairs of observations, was
    the spatial distance between point pairs, was number of sample point pairs with
    distance on the space, was observed value of point was the observed value of other
    points with distance from . Different types of semi-variance functions were tested
    using the geostatistical software GS+ , and the optimal fit model was selected
    based on the maximum coefficient of determination and the minimum residual sum
    of squares. The nugget effect coefficients (C0), the threshold (C0 +C) and the
    variance were used to test the degree of variation between adjacent observations
    (Iqbal et al., 2005). The nugget effect (C0/(C0 + C)) indicated the degree of
    autocorrelation of the target variable. When C0/C0 +C < 25 %, the spatial autocorrelation
    was strong, indicating that structural factors were the dominant factor of systematic
    variation; when 25 % < C0/C0 +C < 75 %, the spatial autocorrelation was moderate,
    indicating that structural and stochastic factors were the common dominant factor
    of systematic variation; when C0/C0 +C > 75 %, the spatial autocorrelation was
    weak, indicating that random factors were the dominant (Cambardella et al., 1994;
    Hu et al., 2022). 2.4. Multiresolution segmentation algorithm Object-oriented
    multiscale segmentation was a merging process of image objects (Benz et al., 2004,
    Liu et al., 2018). The appropriate shape and compactness factors were determined
    in eCognition9.0, and then the segmentation scale parameter was adjusted to maximize
    salinity heterogeneity among zones and salinity homogeneity intra-zone, respectively.
    The principle of multi-scale segmentation was high homogeneity within segmented
    objects and highest heterogeneity between segmented objects (Chang et al., 2014).
    Searching for the optimal segmentation scale was essential to improve homogeneity
    intra-zone and heterogeneity among zones. According to scholars, the variation
    of the average segmentation evaluation index could be used to determine the optimal
    segmentation scale (Feng et al., 2018, Qiu et al., 2019). The average segmentation
    evaluation index and scale parameter were plotted as a curve graph. Additionally,
    the corresponding scale parameter was the optimal segmentation scale parameter
    when the average segmentation evaluation index reached the maximum value (Feng
    et al., 2018, Qiu et al., 2019). The segmentation scale parameter was adjusted
    to divide the study area into M regions in the multi-scale segmentation algorithm.
    And the standard deviation of each raster layer in each region and the absolute
    value of the mean difference between each region and its neighbors under different
    segmentation scales were calculated. The homogeneity index was represented by
    the standard deviation ( ) and the heterogeneity index was represented by the
    absolute value of the mean difference ( ). Their equations were shown in (2),
    (3). At the same time, the segmentation evaluation index ( ) and the average segmentation
    evaluation index ( ) of the objects were also formulated and calculated as shown
    in (4), (5) (Liu et al., 2018). (2) (3) (4) (5) Where is the number of pixels

    study area, is the area of -th regions, is the number of regions divided, is the
    segmentation evaluation index of the -th region, and ASEI is the average segmentation
    evaluation index. 2.5. Zoning evaluation Evaluation of optimal salinity management
    zone using multisource information could determine the optimal zone for salinity
    management. The results were evaluated using homogeneity intra-zone and heterogeneity
    among zones. The homogeneity of intra-zone was calculated by the coefficient of
    variation (CV) intra-zone based on the standard deviation and the mean value of
    the attribute values of the pixels. Meanwhile, considering the different size
    of each zone, we assigned the corresponding weight to each zone, and denoted the
    mean value of the intra-zone CV as homogeneity (Zhang et al., 2008, Chen et al.,
    2010). The global Moran index (I) was used to identify the heterogeneity among
    zones(Kim et al., 2008; Gonzalo-Martín et al., 2016). The specific formulas were
    shown in (6) and (7). (6) (7) ̅ ̅ ̅ Where is the coefficient of variation of the
    -th zone, is the area of the -th zone, and is the number of zones delineated.

    otherwise . The smaller the CV, the smaller the variance intra-zone, indicating
    greater homogeneity intra-zone. Generally, indicates the degree of spatial correlation,
    the smaller the I, the lower the spatial autocorrelation, the higher the heterogeneity
    among zones. 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive statistics of ECa values Descriptive
    statistics of soil ECa values were shown in Table 1. The minimum, maximum, and
    mean values of the EC0.375 measurement were the lowest, and the values increased
    with the increase of detection depth. The results indicated that the soil content
    of salts before winter irrigation increased with depth, but the surface layer
    accumulation of salts reached a maximum value between years and tended to remain
    steadily (Li et al., 2020). Otherwise, the CV values of ECa measurements gradually
    decreased with the increase of soil depth. The maximum value was obtained at EC0.375
    and the minimum value was obtained at EC1.5. The variability of soil salinity
    gradually decreased less due to the increase of depth. But the CV of apparent
    soil conductivity at different depths was higher than 74 %, indicating that the
    ECa at different depths in the study area had a strong variability. Table 1. Descriptive

    the variance function was obtained by GS+ , and its model parameters were shown
    in Table 2. The optimal model for the ECa at each depth was an exponential model
    with R2 higher than 0.76 and residual sum of squares (RSS) lower than 0.05, which
    indicated that the model could well reflect the spatial distribution of the ECa
    of the soil in the study area. The nugget values of the ECa of each soil layer
    ranged from 0.14 to 0.49, and the abutment values ranged from 0.24 to 0.58. The
    ratio of nugget values to abutment values was close to 40 %, demonstrating that
    both anthropogenic random factors and structural factors influenced the spatial
    heterogeneity in the study area. In addition, the random factors and structural
    factors jointly influenced the spatial heterogeneity of the soil ECa in the study
    area. In the study region, the random factors mainly included various anthropogenic
    activity factors, such as tillage practices, cropping systems, irrigation patterns,
    and land-use types. The structural factors mainly consisted by natural factors,
    such as vegetation, climate, soil texture, and topography. The variation range
    of the ECa of each soil layer ranged from 6000 to 7400 m. And the distance of
    each sampling point was controlled within 3000 m when collecting the ECa data,
    which was less than the variation range. It indicated that our soil samping strategy
    is able to reveal local variation of soil ECa in the study area. Table 2. Optimal

    at different depths in the study area, the distribution of ECa of each soil layer
    was produced using ordinary kriging interpolation(Fig. 3). The ECa increased with
    the increase of soil depth, which implied that the soil salt distribution was
    bottom-clustered. The high value of ECa was observed in the northeastern part
    of the study area (Fig. 2). This area was the lowest part of the study area in
    terms of elevation, and where the soil had more clay and chalk grains leading
    to the accumulation of soil salts more facilitate. There was also a low vegetation
    index values in this area. Download : Download high-res image (163KB) Download

    zoning based on different variables Soil texture and elevation data were environmental
    factors that affected the distribution of salinity. Consequently, the management
    zone was delineated mainly based on soil information and the rest of information
    was supplemented. Then the following four different management zones were constructed:
    management zone delineation based on soil information (M1), delineation based
    on soil information and vegetation information (M2), delineation based on soil
    information and environmental factors (M3), and delineation based on multisource
    information of soil information, vegetation information and environmental factors
    (M4). Their specific information was shown in Table 3. Table 3. Information and

    SAVI: Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index; DEM: Digital Elevation Model. The optimal
    shape factor of 0.3 and compactness factor of 0.5 were determined by multiple
    multi-scale segmentation. The optimal segmentation scale of M1 was 87 and the
    number of zones was 125, as we can see from the optimal zone evaluation index
    curve (Fig. 4). This result was under the condition that the shape factor and
    the compactness factor were limited to be constant. The optimal zoning scale of
    M2 was 89 and the number of zones was 120; the optimal zoning scale of M3 was
    107 and the number of zones was 90; the optimal zoning scale of M4 was 99 and
    the number of zones was 106. The management zoning under multisource information
    were shown in Fig. 5. As it could be seen from Fig. 5, the multi-scale segmentation
    algorithm was able to effectively zone the regions with different degrees of salinization
    based on salinization information. It was demonstrated that the multi-scale segmentation
    algorithm could effectively delineate homogeneous areas. Download : Download high-res

    in the zoning results based on different inputs. From the perspective of agricultural
    irrigation, the zoning results of M1 had so much more narrow and longer or fragmented
    and smaller zones that such zoning was not conducive to the development and effective
    implementation of the water rights allocation scheme. When vegetation information
    and environmental factors were used, the zoning results became better, and beneficial
    for the implementation of variable-rate irrigation. From the segmentation effect,
    M1 only considered single soil information, and the zoning results were more fragmented.
    The zoning results were better after adding the environmental factors and vegetation
    information. The above comparison is only a qualitative comparison of the results
    of different zones without quantitative evaluation. The quantitative evaluation
    of the zoning results should be based on the principle of maximum homogeneity
    intra-zone and maximum heterogeneity among zones. That means the smaller the mean
    value of the intra-zone CV and the closer to zero the value of the Moran index
    among the zoning areas, the better the zoning effect. The mean coefficient of
    variation within the zone and the Moran index between the zones using different
    input of EC0.375, EC0.75, EC1.5, GNDVI, NDVI, SAVI, DEM, Silt, Clay and Sand were
    shown in Fig. 6. The mean coefficient of variation intra-zone of each evaluation
    factor was ranged from 12 % to 24 %, and the Moran index among zones was ranged
    from 0.2 to 0.6. Moreover, the evaluation factor was different in the zoning of
    different information sources according to the different inputs. The coefficients
    of variation and the Moran index intra-zone for the EC0.375, EC0.75, and EC1.5
    measurements were the lowest in M4, followed by M3, and showed the highest values
    in M1. The coefficients of variation and Moran index in the zone for GNDVI, NDVI,
    and SAVI were all the lowest in M4, followed by M2, and the highest in M1. The
    coefficients of variation and Moran indices intra-zone for DEM, Silt, Clay, and
    Sand were all the lowest in M4, followed by M3, and the highest in M1. It indicated
    that among the four management zones, the intra-zonal coefficient of variation
    and inter-zonal Moran index of each evaluation factor were the lowest for M4,
    and the intra-zonal coefficient of variation and inter-zonal Moran index of each
    evaluation factor were the highest for M1. Above all, M4 was the optimal input.
    This was because this zoning result not only had the highest homogeneity intra-zone
    and the highest heterogeneity among zones, but also facilitated the implementation
    of variable-rate irrigation. M3 and M2 were the followed. And M1 was the worst,
    because the zoning results were not only the lowest homogeneity of intra-zones
    and heterogeneity among zones, and the zoning results had more smaller and fragmented
    zones, which was not conducive to the development and effective implementation
    of the water resource allocation. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download

    of soil salinity Classical statistics method could effectively depict the variation
    of ECa at different soil depths, but not able to provide information on relation
    to the spatial correlation of ECa. Meanwhile, the geostatistical method could
    fill this gap. Our results showed that the coefficient of variation of ECa decreased
    gradually as soil depth increasing, and the coefficients of variation of ECa were
    all higher than 74 %. It indicated that the ECa at different depths in the study
    area showed a strong variation. Meanwhile, when studying soil salinity at different
    depth profiles in the Tarim River basin, Xinjiang, China, Wang et al. (2021) found
    that the CV of ECa varied as the same as the present study, which indicated that
    salinity of the region exhibited a strong variability. The accuracy of salinity
    monitoring was proved to be improved using vegetation information and topographic
    data (Peng et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). Meanwhile, Ma
    et al. (2017) found that topographic data and soil texture had a strong influence
    on the distribution of soil salinity when simulating the characteristics of soil
    salinity changes in the arid oasis of the Tarim River Basin. These conclusions
    strongly proved that vegetation information, soil texture information and topographic
    data were strongly linked to soil salinity. Therefore, it is crucial to pay attention
    to the role of vegetation information, soil texture information and topographic
    data in soil salinity zoning. 4.2. Optimal segmentation scale for multi-scale
    segmentation In terms of research methods, multi-scale segmentation algorithm
    was one of the most commonly used methods in conducting farmland management zoning
    studies (Liu et al., 2017, Liu et al., 2018, Qiu et al., 2019). Comparing the
    management zoning by fuzzy k-means algorithm, Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis
    (ISODATA) algorithm, hierarchical algorithm and multiscale segmentation algorithm,
    our research results showed that multiscale segmentation algorithm could provide
    the most scientific results (Lajili et al., 2021). The number of zones of the
    multiscale segmentation algorithm was determined by the optimal segmentation scale.
    It can not only eliminate the influence of artificial factors, but also accurately
    and efficiently delineate the management zones. Yet the optimal segmentation scale
    was affected by several factors including shape, compactness factor, image spatial
    resolution, and the size of the study area. Compared with the results of Liu et
    al. (2017), who carried out the precise management zoning of field-scale in black
    soil areas using remote sensing images, we found that image resolution was an
    important factor affecting the optimal zoning scale. And the optimal zoning scale
    decreased with the increase of spatial resolution, which was consistent with results
    reported by Ma et al. (2017). Whereas the higher the resolution, the more fragmented
    the segmentation results, so, the zoning results may not be suitable for such
    a highly mechanized mode of operation locally. Meanwhile, the optimal segmentation
    scale was related to the size of the study area. According to Drăguţ et al. (2014),
    when multi-scale segmentation was performed on images of different areas, it was
    found that the optimal segmentation scale became larger as the acreage of the
    study area increased. Therefore, to determine the optimal segmentation scale for
    object-oriented multiscale segmentation, it is essential to consider the scale
    of the study area and a suitable resolution. 4.3. The selection of management
    zoning data sources Management zoning data were transitioning from management
    zoning using only soil or vegetation information (Fontanet et al., 2020, Barman
    et al., 2021, Ouazaa et al., 2022) to management zoning using multisource information
    including soil, vegetation and topography (Ohana-Levi et al., 2019). But there
    are limited studies which comparatively analyzed the effects different combinations
    of information on delineating management partitions. In this study, we compared
    the management zoning results which using only soil information (M1), the management
    zoning with only vegetation information (M2), only environmental factors (M3),
    respectively. And it was found that both the zoning results with vegetation information
    and environmental factors were better than the management zoning with single soil
    information, which was highly consistent with the results of De Benedetto et al.
    (2013). Otherwise, we compared the management zoning with multisource information
    (M4), the management zoning with only vegetation information (M2), and only environmental
    factors (M3), respectively. We found that the results of the management zoning
    using soil information, vegetation information, and environmental factors showed
    a greater improvement in intra-zone homogeneity and inter-zone heterogeneity than
    the results of the other two zoning results, which was similar to the results
    of Ohana-Levi et al. (2019). The results of the multisource information management
    zoning eliminated the overly fragmented zoning, and significantly improved the
    homogeneity intra-zone- and heterogeneity among zones. However, in this study,
    we did not consider the weighting allocation problem and data redundancy of each
    data in the zoning. Thus, it is necessary to solve above problems in the future
    researches to achieve more accurate soil salinity zoning for the implementation
    of variable-rate irrigation. 5. Conclusion Water shortage and soil salinization
    are prominent problems in southern Xinjiang, so improving water resource utilization
    in salinized agricultural land is the key to the sustainable development of local
    agriculture. Variable-rate irrigating by zones is an effective method based on
    the spatial heterogeneity of salinity in agricultural land. This study analyzed
    the spatial heterogeneity of salinity with statistics and geostatistics. Four
    management zoning strategies with soil information, soil information + vegetation
    information, soil information + environmental factors, and soil information + vegetation
    information + environmental factors were explored. Our results showed that a strong
    spatial variation in soil salinity in the study area. The mean CV within each
    zone variable after zoning was dramatically lower than CV before zoning. The zoning
    results based on single soil information were more fragmented than other zoning
    results, and the homogeneity intra-zone and heterogeneity among zones were lower,
    which was also not conducive to the development and effective implementation of
    water resource allocation. By adding vegetation information or environmental factors,
    the zoning results became better, and the homogeneity intra-zone and heterogeneity
    among different zones were improved. had better zoning results. Not only management
    zoning based on multisource information had the highest homogeneity intra-zone
    and heterogeneity among zones, but also zoning results were better, which is facilitated
    the implementation of variable-rate irrigation. Therefore, management zoning based
    on multisource information was proved as the optimal result, which proved the
    potential of implementing variable-rate irrigation by incorporating vegetation
    information and environmental factors. Consequently, variable-rate irrigation
    can be conducted based on management zoning of multi-source information to improve
    water utilization in salinized areas, and this management zoning has an huge potential
    in promoting sustainable development of local agriculture. Declaration of Competing

    07 June 2021 1 Introduction Water is one of the most indispensable resources on
    the planet, yet, due to various anthropogenic factors and climate change, the
    quality and quantity of water are rapidly deteriorating. Alarming population growth,
    climate change, urbanisation, agricultural expansion, and industrialization are
    reducing water resources (Asif et al. 2023; Cook et al. 2022; Echeverria 2021).
    To make matters worse, there is at least a 50% chance that global warming will
    reach or exceed 1.5 °C soon (2021–2040) (IPCC 2022). As the world’s population
    continues to grow rapidly, the demand for water resources is expected to increase.
    For instance, the global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050,
    which is anticipated to increase the demand for water (UN 2022). Currently, 2.3
    billion people live in water-scarce locations, of which 733 million are from the
    global south, including Asia, Africa, and Latin America (UN Water 2021). Furthermore,
    two-thirds of the world’s population (4.0 billion people) live in areas with acute
    water shortages at least one month of the year (Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2016). The
    report by UN Water highlights that agriculture is the largest water consumer,
    accounting for 72% of water consumption (UN Water 2021). The Food and Agricultural
    Organisation (FAO 2023) also indicates that water usage is distributed, with 70%
    attributed to agriculture, 19% to industry, and 11% to municipal demand. To improve
    water use and mitigate water scarcity challenges, numerous efforts are underway
    worldwide. The United Nations announced the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
    agenda in 2015, with SDG 6 focusing on clean water and sanitation (UN Water 2023).
    In 2015, the UN defined eight targets and 11 indicators for SDG 6 (UN Water 2021).
    The targets of SDG 6 form an interconnected framework for achieving comprehensive
    and sustainable water management. Safe drinking water (SDG 6.1.1) and safe sanitation
    and hygiene (SDG 6.2.1a) are foundational for ensuring water quality, complemented
    by handwashing facilities and water availability at households (SDG 6.2.1b) (UN
    Water 2018). Proper wastewater management (SDG 6.3.1a and SDG 6.3.1b) is crucial
    for maintaining ambient water quality (SDG 6.3.2) (UN Water 2021). Water use efficiency
    (SDG 6.4.1) optimises resource allocation and complements the evaluation of freshwater
    stress (SDG 6.4.2) (FAO and UN Water 2021). Integrated water management (SDG 6.5.1)
    is essential for harmonising water use, while transboundary water cooperation
    (SDG 6.5.2) emphasises international collaboration (Barua et al. 2019). Monitoring
    the changes in river basins (SDG 6.6.1) reflects overall water management impact,
    and rehabilitating water ecosystems (SDG 6.A.1) supports sustainability efforts
    (UN Water 2018). Engaging water users (SDG 6.B.1) fosters effective water management
    (Cook et al. 2022). Together, these targets address global water challenges holistically
    and promote sustainable water practises for present and future generations. Sustainable
    water management occurs within a complete framework that follows core principles
    and crucial components. The framework comprises governance, legislative and institutional
    framework, infrastructure, policies, technology, and financial resources (SIWI
    2023; WB 2023). While the principles are good governance, equity, sustainability,
    participation or inclusiveness, accountability, effectiveness, coordination, and
    collaboration, the components encompass water conservation and efficiency, water
    quality management, wastewater treatment and reuse, ecosystem restoration and
    protection (Benson et al. 2020; Jimenez et al. 2020; UN Water 2021). The ultimate
    objective of SDG 6 is to secure the availability and sustainable management of
    water resources, ensuring the well-being of all life and preserving the planet’s
    ecosystems for current and future generations (UN Water 2018). Hence, while recognising
    the equal importance and vital contribution of all SDG 6, this review mainly focuses
    on four indicators that are also interdependent. For example, efficient water
    use in agriculture (SDG 6.4.1) is essential for supporting integrated water resource
    management (SDG 6.5.1), which is vital for effective cooperation in transboundary
    water management (SDG 6.5.2) and meaningful participation of water users (SDG
    6.b.1) in achieving comprehensive and sustainable water management. The main goal
    of this review was to provide a general overview of the progress made and challenges
    encountered regarding the selected four indicators. It also serves as a baseline
    for future research papers focused on this area, including those by the authors
    of this paper. While many studies exist on SDG 6, only a few have addressed more
    than one indicator of this target. Thus, this study distinguishes itself by comprehensively
    examining the progress and challenges encountered in the context of the selected
    four indicators. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this
    review, which lie in its inability to consider all the indicators. Future studies
    may include all other indicators to provide a broader perspective. 2 Methodology
    The present paper is a systematic, qualitative literature review wherein inclusion
    and exclusion criteria have been developed to meet the paper’s objective. The
    selection process has prioritised articles focused on global, continental, comparative,
    or international issues between 2016 and 2023, with the primary goal being to
    assess the progress made on four indicators of SDG 6 since the announcement of
    sustainable development goals in 2015. Additionally, the review includes articles
    that delve into topics such as water use efficiency in agriculture, integrated
    water resource management, cooperation in transboundary water management, and
    water user participation, while being limited to those written in English. Country-specific
    experiences, wastewater treatment, the water-food-energy nexus, cities, and industrial
    and municipal water aspects have been excluded from the scope of this review (Fig.
    1). Considering the review’s goal, the sources were searched on Scopus and the
    Web of Science. To locate the relevant material, Boolean literature searching
    methods such as water AND “sustainable management,“ water AND “agricultural technologies,“
    “water AND “integrated management,“ water AND “transboundary cooperation, and
    “water AND user participation” with a time span of 2016–2023 were used. A total
    of 216 sources, comprising articles, books, and conference papers, were downloaded
    for review. Data screening and extraction were performed, and 72 articles were
    used for the final analysis. Additional supplementary materials included four
    conference papers, six books and book chapters, nine United Nations documents,
    and other credible organisation documents. In general, 92 records were used to
    produce this review paper. Figure 1 presents a summarised methodological package
    used in this review paper. Fig. 1 Methodological framework for the literature
    review of sustainable water management Full size image 3 Discussion Before delving
    into the main discussion, a brief explanation of the distinction between water
    governance and water management is essential. Water management entails human involvement
    in planning, implementing, and managing water resources, while water governance
    is the political, socio-economic, and administrative structure that potentially
    influences water utilization and management (HE and James 2021; SIWI 2023; WB
    2023). Both are interconnected and complementary, with water management focusing
    on operational issues and water governance on mechanisms that facilitate these
    decisions. Central principles in water management and governance include cooperation,
    multi-level governance, transparency, accountability, policy harmonization, coordination,
    collaboration, participation, and education (Cai et al. 2021; Da Silva et al.
    2020; Jimenez et al. 2020; Rowbottom et al. 2022). These principles ensure or
    delay the implementation of water management and governance. 3.1 Water-efficient
    Agricultural Technologies and Practices Global efforts to minimise water use in
    agriculture include alternate wetting and drying, deficit irrigation, drip irrigation,
    micro irrigation, mulching, saturated soil culture, rainwater harvesting, and
    groundwater recharging (Srivastav et al. 2021; Zhao et al. 2020; Zhang et al.
    2023). Advancements in science, earth observation, hydrological modelling, computer
    capabilities, and analytical approaches have opened new possibilities. The Internet
    of Things (IoT) and Block Chain, Light Detection and Ranging (LidAR), and Geographic
    Information System (GIS) are used for modelling and recording water and related
    issues (Ahmed et al. 2021; Ani and Gopalakirishnan 2020; Krishna et al. 2020;
    Wang et al. 2022b). Alternate wetting and drying irrigation (AWD) is a promising
    and environmentally friendly method for water-efficient rice production (Ishfaq
    et al. 2020). Despite differences in air conditions, soil type, soil water content,
    dryness intensity, cropping season, crop types, and crop stage of growth, several
    studies have reported that AWD can save 20–70% of agricultural water use (Cheng
    et al. 2022; Ishfaq et al. 2020; Numery et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2023). Without
    any balancing intervention, AWD can increase water use efficiency by 31%, but
    at a 6% yield loss, so limiting overall organic carbon effect sizes to less than
    0.0003, pH above 0.015, and nitrate-nitrogen between 0.02 and 0.30 during AWD
    could boost rice yield by up to 4% (Zhang et al. 2023). Additionally, AWD can
    reduce water use in rice production when weeds are absent but can reduce yield
    when weeds are present (Dossou-yovo et al. 2022). Deficit irrigation, introduced
    in the 1970s, conserves water resources and maintains productivity by reducing
    irrigation flows during the growing season (Yu et al. 2020). It increases wheat
    crop water use efficiency by 6.6% but reduces yield by 16.2% (Yu et al. 2020).
    In their study, Kogler and Soffker (2017) also found 20–40% irrigation water savings
    with yield decreases up to 10%. Cheng et al. (2021) discovered deficit irrigation
    performed well in clay loam soils with low bulk density and > 200 mm precipitation,
    while Yu et al. (2020) found success in conditions with < 200 mm precipitation
    and loamy or sandy soils using border or furrow irrigation. The inconsistency
    is due to varying crops, soils, precipitation, and irrigation methods. To prevent
    yield reduction, deficit irrigation must be > 94.5% of total irrigation (Yu et
    al. 2020). Overall, deficit irrigation enhances water use efficiency and yield
    when considering method selection, timing, water, crop types, and season. Drip
    irrigation reduces agricultural water use and enhances water productivity by delivering
    water and fertiliser directly to plant roots. This method improves water efficiency,
    increases yields, and ensures food security by minimising runoff and percolation
    losses (Greenland et al. 2018). Subsurface drip irrigation has shown a 6.42% yield
    increase and 5.39% water use efficiency improvement (Wang et al. 2022a). However,
    barriers like high costs and poor uniformity due to emission clogging hinder its
    widespread adoption (Greenland et al. 2018). Moreover, Zhang et al. (2022) found
    that film-mulching drip irrigation increased crop and water use efficiency by
    20% and 30%, respectively. Mulching practises offer numerous benefits, improving
    soil quality and agricultural productivity. By minimising soil evaporation and
    preserving moisture, mulching conserves water resources and maintains favourable
    soil moisture levels for plant growth Kader et al. (2017). This reduces water
    loss and lowers crop water requirements. Additionally, mulching enhances soil
    water availability, making it more accessible for plant roots to uptake (El-beltagi
    et al. 2022). Furthermore, saturated soil culture, also known as hydroponics,
    is an agricultural technology that provides continuous irrigation, maintains steady
    water depth, and keeps the soil layer saturated (Ghulamahdi et al. 2023; Mallareddy
    et al. 2023). The saturated soil culture agricultural technology reduces water
    usage by up to 28% when compared to conventional flooded methods (Srivastav et
    al. 2021). Another study also found that using saturated soil culture agriculture
    technology decreased water inputs by 30–60% while reducing production by 4–9%
    (Mukherjee 2019). Rainwater harvesting (RWH) involves collecting, storing, and
    conserving rainfall for agricultural and other uses, serving as supplemental irrigation
    during water scarcity (Velasco-Muñoz et al. 2019). It is widespread in countries
    like Japan, Singapore, the USA, and others (Yannopoulos et al. 2019). RWH systems
    can provide 12–100% of potable water in developing nations, addressing water shortages
    in countries like Bangladesh, India, Kenya, and South Africa (Musayev et al. 2018;
    Yannopoulos et al. 2019). Semi-arid regions use road runoff for irrigation, while
    Latin American countries use roof RWH for domestic consumption (Yannopoulos et
    al. 2019). Another significant water source for agriculture is groundwater recharge,
    where water from precipitation infiltrates the soil and percolates towards the
    water table (Hartmann 2022). Groundwater recharge, a vital process, contributes
    to the replenishment of groundwater reservoirs and sustains water availability
    for agriculture and other purposes (Hu et al. 2023). In general, water use efficiency
    in agriculture increased by 8% between 2015 and 2018 (UN Water 2021). Table 1
    summarises water-efficient agricultural technologies, including their pros and
    cons. Table 1 Summary of Water Saving Agricultural Technologies Full size table
    In addition to the water-saving agricultural technologies, recent advances in
    computer technologies and modelling methods have significantly contributed to
    predicting, optimising, and monitoring equitable supply and distribution of water
    for sustainable agricultural practices (Srivastav et al. 2021). The Internet of
    Things (IoT) and Blockchain-based technologies also show potential for enhancing
    precision agriculture by incentivizing good water management practises (Pincheira
    et al. 2021; Velayudhan et al. 2022). IoT in water supply chain management addresses
    inadequate water monitoring and management (Ahmed et al. 2021). The benefits of
    blockchain operations outweigh the minimal increase in energy and storage use,
    with notable improvements in water management due to real-time data updates (Pincheira
    et al. 2021). Wang et al. (2022b) emphasise the significance of conventional water
    resource management, particularly in steep-slope agricultural systems. However,
    time-efficient and cost-effective remedies necessitate the adoption of creative
    techniques and technologies like high-resolution remote sensing (e.g., LiDAR and
    drone) and GIS-based modelling (Wang et al. 2022b). In a study conducted on groundwater
    simulation in the USA using AnnAGNPS and MODFLOW models, (Momm et al. 2022) revealed
    that enhancing groundwater levels could be achieved by reducing irrigation rates
    by 20–40%, emphasising the significance of adopting water-efficient irrigation
    methods for ensuring sustainable groundwater resources. Additionally, AquaCrop
    modelling aids in predicting crop production and water use efficiency during cultivation
    (Srivastav et al. 2021). Moreover, the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP)
    computer model predicts soil loss turbulence on hill slopes and in small watersheds
    across various land uses and environmental conditions (Mcgehee et al. 2023). The
    Integrated Excess Nitrogen Load Model (IENLM) estimates excess nitrogen load from
    agricultural activities (Feng et al. 2022), while the Soil and Water Assessment
    Tool (SWAT) measures watershed management and emission leakage into river basins
    (Ren et al. 2022). These technologies, among others, play a crucial role in evaluating
    and predicting water efficiency in agriculture for sustainable water management.
    Despite the potential for sustainable water management in agriculture, there are
    drawbacks resulting from efforts to advance crop-water use efficiency in this
    sector. For example, excess nutrients from agriculture cause acidification and
    salinisation in European waters, with 60% of water bodies failing to meet good
    ecological status targets (Nikolaidis et al. 2022). Plastic mulching leads to
    soil contamination due to its toxic behaviour, while rubber mulching can damage
    crop plants if proper precautions are not taken (El-beltagi et al. 2022). The
    use of chemical fertilisers increases crop yields but can result in water body
    pollution through agricultural runoff (Srivastav et al. 2021). Additionally, the
    leaching of arsenic, nitrate, and pesticides from agriculture poses water pollution
    risks (Carrijo et al. 2022; Syafiuddin et al. 2020). Moreover, Ren et al. (2022)
    found the corn-soybean rotation system accounts for 83% nitrogen, 88% phosphorus
    inputs, and 64% and 46% nitrogen and phosphorus removals in the US Corn Belt.
    In Central Asia, irrigation runoff washes an average of 25% nitrogen, 5% phosphates,
    and 4% pesticides into water bodies (Feng et al. 2022). Therefore, proper precautions
    must be taken to avoid agricultural water pollution. 3.2 Integrated Water Resource
    Management Integrated water resource management (IWRM) has been a prominent water
    management approach since its acceptance in 1990, advocating for structural considerations
    of water demand and supply, cooperation, coordination, consensus building, and
    collaboration in both transboundary and intra-boundary water resource management
    (Apostolaki et al. 2019; HE and James 2021). Benson et al. (2020) proposed seven
    principles for effective IWRM implementation: integration, multi-level governance,
    community participation, economic valuation, gender mainstreaming, and ecosystems.
    Many nations have adopted IWRM to promote water diplomacy, cooperation, international
    water policy, strategy, and law (Nkiaka et al. 2021). In 2017, global implementation
    of IWRM was at 49% (UN Water 2021). Bilalova et al. (2023) and Cai et al. (2021)
    found varying levels of implementation across regions, with Europe and Northern
    America at 67.4%, Australia and New Zealand at 72%, and other regions ranging
    from 34.1 to 54.8%. By mid-2020, global implementation had increased to 54%. Miranda
    and Reynard (2020) underlined that for the effective implementation of integrated
    water management, governments must make significant modifications to their legal
    and institutional frameworks. Moreover, integrated groundwater management is also
    gaining importance due to the rapid deterioration of surface water, with some
    countries facing overconsumption of groundwater. Globally, agriculture accounts
    for 69% of groundwater abstraction, with 31% used for households and industries
    (United Nations 2022). Nationally, more than 90% of groundwater was extracted
    for irrigation purposes in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Libya; over 80% in Bangladesh,
    Greece, India, and South Africa; and above 70% in Australia, the USA, and Argentina
    (Barnett et al. 2021; Cook et al. 2022; Syafiuddin et al. 2020; United Nations
    2022). To ensure groundwater sustainability, cooperation and mutual interests
    among water users are crucial for managing aquifers (Echeverria 2021). Effective
    strategies should include systematic assessments involving stakeholders, improving
    understanding, acknowledging uncertainty, and considering societal needs (Elshall
    et al. 2020). Incentives for wise use of common pool resources such as water would
    be critical to ensuring the aquifer’s long-term management (Echeverria 2021; Garrick
    et al. 2020). To enhance aquifer sustainability, long-term groundwater development
    plans, reasonable pricing, quality preservation, and environmental impact assessments
    are crucial, especially for large-scale irrigation projects (Goya et al. 2020).
    Integrated modelling (Momm et al. 2022) and conjunctive water management, which
    combines surface and groundwater management, should be integrated into national
    policies (Syafiuddin et al. 2020). Campos et al. (2020) urge water-stressed countries,
    especially Arab countries, to improve their IWRM in order to better manage limited
    water resources by boosting cereal grain imports; however, this has its own pressure
    on the water resources of grain exporting countries and overall sustainable water
    management. Challenges facing IWRM implementation include lack of transparency,
    multi-level governance, funding shortages, institutional complexities, information
    gaps, an undefined integration scope, insufficient methods for participatory and
    integrated monitoring and evaluation, conflict, and instability, which can also
    hinder IWRM efforts (Cook et al. 2022; Gain et al. 2021; HE and James 2021; Hjorth
    and Madani 2023). 3.3 Transboundary Water Management Cooperation Cooperation in
    transboundary water management involves establishing reliable relationships and
    reaping benefits for all parties involved. Over 310 transboundary rivers traverse
    more than 45% of the world’s land area, passing through 153 countries (McCracken
    and Wolf 2019; UN Water 2021; Yan et al. 2022), leading to various treaties and
    agreements, bilateral and multilateral, to facilitate transboundary water cooperation.
    Examples include the Colorado and Rio Grande River Water Treaties between the
    US and Mexico (Rivera-torres et al. 2021), the Indus Water Treaty between India
    and Pakistan (Rai et al. 2017, 2022), the Ganga Water Treaty between India and
    Bangladesh, and the Mahakali Treaty between India and Nepal (Kryston et al. 2022;
    Saklani et al. 2020). Despite over 600 treaties signed for international water
    cooperation and sustainability, only a few have fully delivered on their promises
    (Kryston et al. 2022). In 2020, global implementation of cross-border water cooperation
    was 58%, with only Europe, North America, and Sub-Saharan Africa on track to achieve
    the goal of 100% implementation in 2030, while only 24 countries had accomplished
    this goal in 2020 (UN Water 2021). Penny et al. (2021) highlighted the successful
    water governance cooperation between France and Switzerland through the Genevese
    aquifer treaty signed in 1978, aiming to address diminishing water supplies. Despite
    over 500 transboundary groundwater sources shared by 150 countries, only six (Genovese,
    SASS, ITAS, Nubian, Disi, and Guarani) have a dedicated transboundary treaty to
    govern their use (Gallagher and Gergel 2017; McCracken and Meyer 2018; Penny et
    al. 2021). The Guarani Aquifer, for instance, is one of the world’s largest trans-boundary
    aquifers, shared by Brazil (68%), Argentina (21%), Paraguay (8%), and Uruguay
    (3%), and governed by a regional cooperation initiative funded by the Global Environmental
    Facility (Hirata et al. 2020). Furthermore, the water cooperation between Bangladesh
    and India on the Ganga River was also perceived as fruitful (Kryston et al. 2022).
    However, many rivers, lakes, and aquifers lack operational water cooperation arrangements,
    particularly in Latin America, North Africa, Western Asia, Central and Southern
    Asia, and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (UN Water 2021). Mistrust, misinformation,
    unequal power dynamics, behavioural differences, and other factors have led to
    challenges in transboundary water management (Zareie et al. 2020). Additional
    obstacles include political disagreements, a lack of data sharing, language barriers,
    regional conflicts, competition, opportunism, weak stakeholder engagement, a lack
    of coordination, and cooperation (Al-saidi 2021; El-Nashar and Elyamany 2023;
    Nkiaka et al. 2021). Therefore, expanding collaboration between countries is critical
    to improve transboundary water cooperation (Ma et al. 2020). Transparency, accountability,
    stakeholder engagement, and collaboration are essential for achieving transboundary
    water cooperation and sustainable water management (Jimenez et al. 2020; Vaio
    et al. 2021). To enhance collaborative working and facilitate joint decision-making,
    regular information exchange and the production of common knowledge and tools
    among relevant parties are necessary (Kull et al. 2021). Improving multi-level
    governance and partnerships involving actors from all sectors at the local, national,
    and international levels can help overcome challenges to sustainable water management
    (Cai et al. 2021; Vaio et al. 2021). In addition, trust and fairness play pivotal
    roles in transboundary water cooperation, given their sensitivity and dependence
    on the political context and interests of the water-sharing countries. 3.4 Community
    Participation Community participation has become recognised as a viable solution
    for water resource management, with residents actively engaging in rural water
    management in Latin America to secure water access (Romano et al. 2021). Organised
    citizen and community participation can enhance water resource use, development,
    and decision-making procedures (Vaio et al. 2021). Despite being a buzzword among
    policymakers, scholars, and activists, community participation has seen limited
    success at the grassroots level, though national policies and laws are gradually
    acknowledging its value with increased participation rates (UN Water 2021). Broadening
    citizen participation and increasing their understanding of judicious water resource
    use can contribute to achieving water sustainability goals (Vaio et al. 2021).
    Promising activities have been observed in the literature. For example, in Mexico,
    local communities actively participate in water decontamination, flood regulation,
    carbon detention, temperature control, and habitat provision, while South African
    organisations focus on water provision through women’s training programmes and
    hiring for water protection and catchment species elimination (Kiss et al. 2021).
    Moreover, HE and James (2021) indicated successful participatory decision-making
    in the Colorado River Conservation Initiative involving seven US states. Gain
    et al. (2021) report extensive stakeholder participation in the “Room for the
    River” project in the Netherlands through participatory seminars. The Murray-Darling
    Basin in Australia is a recognised best practise example of participatory water
    management (Freak et al. 2022). In Brazil, participatory forums for basin governance
    have operated since 1996, involving civil society, private users, and government
    entities, promoting participatory water governance by limiting government representation
    to 50% (Mancilla García and Bodin 2019). Thus, promoting community participation
    in sustainable water management includes involving diverse stakeholders, such
    as residents, farmers, NGOs, and indigenous groups, in decision-making processes
    (Ruiz-Villaverde and García-Rubio 2017). This can be achieved through participatory
    forums, public consultations, and community-based projects. Fostering inclusive
    policies and laws that recognise and value local contributions is crucial for
    enhancing community involvement. The depth of community participation focuses
    on empowering communities to contribute effectively to sustainable water management.
    Promoting community participation in sustainable water management involves providing
    information, resources, and capacity-building programmes, encouraging ownership
    of water initiatives, collaborating with experts and the government, implementing
    locally relevant solutions, improving community engagement, knowledge co-production,
    and disseminating research findings in a format easily accessible to the community
    (Obiero et al. 2022). Engaging in meaningful dialogues and partnerships with communities
    ensures long-term commitment and sustainability in water management. Moreover,
    community education is an essential component of sustainable water management.
    For instance, (Da Silva et al. 2020) found that education plays a crucial role
    in a community’s capacity to understand and influence water resource management
    decisions, as evidenced in various indices such as the water sustainability index
    (WSI), the water poverty index (WPI), the Canadian water sustainability index
    (CWSI), and the West Java water sustainability index (WJWSI). Hence, a transparent
    and inclusive process would encourage community participation and consultation,
    as water-related decisions can have both positive and negative consequences for
    the whole population (Cook et al. 2022). Overall, community participation in all
    aspects of water management should be expanded to ensure the resource’s long-term
    viability. 4 Conclusion and Future Perspectives The 2030 agenda, with SDG 6, emphasises
    clean water and sanitation as fundamental pillars for sustainable development
    and global prosperity, aiming to ensure availability and sustainable water management.
    In alignment with this objective, the presented paper examined the progress and
    challenges encountered in four indicators of SDG 6. The paper discussed these
    four indicators separately to showcase the advancements made and the challenges
    faced with respect to each of them. By analysing each indicator independently,
    the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current status and highlights
    specific areas that require attention and improvement. 4.1 Water use Efficiency
    in Agriculture The use of advanced technologies and modelling tools, in conjunction
    with water-efficient practises like alternate wetting and drying, deficit irrigation,
    drip irrigation, mulching, and saturated soil culture, offers promising solutions
    to reduce agricultural water usage while maintaining productivity. However, the
    trade-off from most of these agricultural technologies through chemical fertiliser
    run-off can have a tremendous effect on the goal of SDG 6: clean water and sanitation.
    Therefore, proper management through capacity building for farmers at local levels
    is highly important. Although not specifically presented by most of the existing
    literature, large-scale agricultural projects like state farms and industrial
    farms in most developed and developing countries could take a lion’s share of
    leaching agrochemical inputs into surface and groundwater, so a necessary precaution
    must be taken. In addition, plastic mulching in agriculture has environmental
    problems like plastic pollution and microplastic contamination, which can be avoided
    by using more sustainable alternatives such as biodegradable mulch films composed
    of plant-based polymers or compostable materials. 4.2 Integrated Water Resource
    Management Integrated water resource management (IWRM) has gained popularity as
    a method of water management, emphasising cooperation and collaboration among
    different stakeholders. However, its practical implementation has faced several
    challenges, including a lack of transparency, multi-level governance, insufficient
    funding, complex institutional structures, and information gaps. The global average
    of IWRM implementation was around 54% in 2020. To improve IWRM, governments and
    water-stressed countries must address the identified bottlenecks, invest in better
    governance structures, increase funding, ensure transparency, and develop methodologies
    for participatory monitoring and assessment. By doing so, IWRM can contribute
    to sustainable water management and preserve water resources for future generations.
    4.3 Cooperation for trans-boundary Water Management Transboundary water cooperation
    is crucial for sustainable water management, but implementation varies globally.
    Progress has been made in Europe, North America, and Sub-Saharan Africa towards
    achieving transboundary water management goals. Challenges include mistrust, information
    gaps, power imbalances, conflicts, and weak stakeholder engagement. To ensure
    a sustainable future, prioritise enhanced collaboration, transparency, and stakeholder
    involvement. Regular information exchange and inclusive policies bridge gaps.
    Establish unwavering trust and fairness. Strengthen international partnerships
    for effective water management, mitigating water calamities, and fortifying water
    systems for generations to come. 4.4 Community Participation Promoting community
    participation in sustainable water management is a vital step towards ensuring
    the long-term viability and sustainability of water resources. To achieve this
    goal, it is essential to prioritise and implement a directive proposal that emphasises
    inclusive policies, resource allocation, and stakeholder dialogues. By recognising
    and valuing local contributions, meaningful dialogues can be fostered, leading
    to more effective decision-making processes. To empower communities, investment
    in education, capacity-building, and the provision of resources is necessary.
    Engaging residents, farmers, NGOs, and indigenous groups in decision-making processes
    through participatory forums and public consultations is critical for transformative
    change. Only through decisive action can we secure the future of our precious
    water resources and promote sustainable water management. Moreover, future research
    should prioritise investigating the role of indigenous knowledge in sustainable
    water management and its significance in addressing intergenerational equity issues,
    which have been largely underestimated in existing literature. Additionally, researchers
    should delve into the concept of rural-urban integrated sustainable water management,
    exploring the potential for public-private partnerships (PPP) in crisis-affected
    water sectors. Moreover, given the rapid growth of commercial bottled water supply,
    particularly in developing countries, there is a critical need to examine its
    impact on exacerbating water scarcity and seek ways to balance this trend for
    more sustainable water management. Data Availability The data sources are properly

  description: Groundwater depletion due to irrigation pumping in major food-producing
    regions has become a global concern. There is a need to establish a useful tool
    that can simulate the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Groundwater Continuum (SPAGC) system
    to evaluate various water-saving measures and agronomic practices for groundwater
    conservation and food security. This study developed an integrated APEX-SWAT-GW
    model, that could make full use of the advantages of APEX and SWAT-GW. The APEX-SWAT-GW
    model is applied to a representative groundwater overexploited area (22,753 km2)
    in the North China Plain (NCP). Good agreements were obtained in simulated results
    of wheat and maize yields, evapotranspiration (ET), and groundwater table depth
    in comparison with statistical data, remote sensing data, and monitoring well
    data. By testing simulations of water-limited irrigation and sprinkler irrigation,
    the model was found to be a useful tool for simulating agro-hydrological processes
    in areas where groundwater is over-exploited and selecting alternative irrigation
    management practices.

    and content Highlights • Integrated APEX-SWAT-GW model was developed to simulate
    agro-hydrological processes. • The coupling model takes full advantage of the
    strengths of APEX and SWAT-GW. • Sensitivity analysis R package was revised for
    watershed scale use. • Evaluations demonstrate the model''s superiority in the
    groundwater-fed watersheds. Abstract Groundwater depletion due to irrigation pumping
    in major food-producing regions has become a global concern. There is a need to
    establish a useful tool that can simulate the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Groundwater
    Continuum (SPAGC) system to evaluate various water-saving measures and agronomic
    practices for groundwater conservation and food security. This study developed
    an integrated APEX-SWAT-GW model, that could make full use of the advantages of
    APEX and SWAT-GW. The APEX-SWAT-GW model is applied to a representative groundwater
    overexploited area (22,753 km2) in the North China Plain (NCP). Good agreements
    were obtained in simulated results of wheat and maize yields, evapotranspiration
    (ET), and groundwater table depth in comparison with statistical data, remote
    sensing data, and monitoring well data. By testing simulations of water-limited
    irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, the model was found to be a useful tool for

    and validationNorth China Plain 1. Introduction Unabated groundwater depletion
    is becoming an issue of increasing concern globally, as more than one-third of
    the water used originates from underground worldwide (Famiglietti, 2014; Bierkens
    and Wada, 2019). Due to its inconspicuous presence compared with surface water,
    groundwater often eludes effective governance and management in countless regions
    (Villholth et al., 2018). As a result, more than half of the world''s major aquifers
    are being depleted, some of them at an alarming pace (Wu et al., 2020; Famiglietti
    et al., 2021). Notably, approximately 70% of global groundwater withdrawals are
    used in agricultural sector, especially in irrigated agriculture (FAO, 2020).
    Well-known large aquifer systems affected by significant long-term storage depletion
    are those of the Indo-Gangetic Plains, the North China Plain, the California Central
    Valley, the U.S. High Plains, and the Arabian Aquifer System (United Nations Educational,
    2022), which are also famous breadbasket in Asian and America. It is certain that
    groundwater depletion in the most area is related to irritation pumping (Wada
    et al., 2012), which pose a scientific challenge to agroecosystem research about
    how to balance groundwater sustainability and grain capacity with limited freshwater
    resources. Agricultural management plans (Fernández-Escalante et al., 2020; Singh
    et al., 2021) such as agronomical water-saving (Hu et al., 2010; Akbari et al.,
    2022), engineering water-saving (Fard et al., 2022; Li et al., 2019), biological
    water-saving (Bi et al., 2021; Mei et al., 2013), and planting structure adjustment
    (Gao et al., 2022; Candela et al., 2012) have become potential solutions to this
    issue in many groundwater overexploited regions. To examine and quantify the effectiveness
    of these measures, policy-maker must know how the grain yield may change and the
    extent to which shallow groundwater drawdown may be relieved under different scenarios.
    Therefore, establishing available modeling tools that could simulate the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Groundwater
    Continuum (SPAGC), as well as this combined system responses to various agricultural
    management measures are of critical importance to groundwater governance along
    with global water and food security. To simulate the interaction processes of
    crop growth, water cycle, and groundwater dynamic, some typical crop models were
    combined with groundwater flow models to conduct numerical modeling, e.g., EPIC-MODFLOW
    (Steward et al., 2011), DSSAT-MODFLOW (Xiang et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2022),
    DayCent-MODFLOW (Deng et al., 2021), WOFOST- Hydrus-1D (Li et al., 2014), SWAP-MODFLOW
    (Xu et al., 2012), and HYDRUS-EPIC (Han et al., 2015). However, there were some
    challenges in the model coupling processes due to the mismatch problem in scale
    and spatial heterogeneity as many crop models focus on the point-scale experimental
    station. Therefore, another solution has been pointed out, which attempts to couple
    the physically-based spatially distributed hydrological models (including crop
    growth module) and MODFLOW to simulate the groundwater-surface water interactions.
    Bailey et al. (2016) coupled SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) with MODFLOW
    and released a graphical user interface, which has been applied to several catchments,
    such as in the USA (Abbas et al., 2018; Bailey and Hosseini, 2023), Denmark (Semiromi
    and Koch, 2019; Frederiksen and Molina-Navarro, 2021), Canada (Chunn et al., 2019),
    Iran (Semiromi and Koch, 2019), Thailand (Petpongpan et al., 2022), and Japan
    (Sith et al., 2019). To further enhance the crop growth algorithms, Bailey et
    al. (2021) coupled APEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender) with MODFLOW
    and applied it to three watersheds (with areas of 3543 km2, 4886 km2, and 470
    km2) in the USA. The simulation using SWAT-MODFLOW and APEX-MODFLOW models highlighted
    the distributed calculating units, i.e., the Hydrological Response Units (HRUs)
    and subbasins of SWAT, as well as the subareas in APEX, allowed the linking and
    information transfer with the grid cells in MODFLOW. However, some difficulties
    and huge challenges might exist in the data collection and model establishment
    processes of MODFLOW, because a variety of parameters are essential for each grid
    cell (horizontal dimension) in each layer (vertical dimension), especially in
    the catchment with a deep unsaturated zone or a large area. Actually, the several
    hotspots of groundwater depletion are all large plains and endure declining water
    levels, which create more and more thick unsaturated zones (e.g., the averaged
    groundwater table depths are over 30–50 m in North China Plain, U.S. Ogallala
    Aquifer, and North-Western India), along with a harder work in MODFLOW simulation.
    To this end, the groundwater overexploited watersheds with a deep unsaturated
    zone need to explore a modeling tool that can simulate the groundwater table variations
    reasonably and simplify the procedures of obtaining unsaturated zone data at a
    regional scale. Both SWAT and APEX, include an equation of groundwater balance
    in the source code, despite they cannot simulate and output the groundwater table
    depth directly. In our previous study (Zhang et al., 2016), we modified the groundwater
    module and established the SWAT-GW model in the most typical region of the groundwater
    depression cone in China. The SWAT-GW model deals with the water movements of
    the unsaturated zone in a skilled way from a hydrology perspective. Whereas, the
    agricultural management practices are oversimplified in SWAT (e.g., no irrigation
    method changing, deep plowing, soil moisture conservation cultivation, etc.),
    which forms some obstacles in its further applications. In contrast, APEX has
    more robust crop growth routines and detailed agronomic management measures, irrigation
    options (e.g., sprinkler, drip, and furrow irrigation), manure management, nutrient
    cycling, and tillage module. Therefore, establishing a coupled APEX-SWAT-GW model
    can make full use of the strengths in agricultural techniques of APEX and the
    developed groundwater module of SWAT. This enhanced process-based model is a timely
    and crucial tool to watersheds wherein 1) extensively exploit groundwater to sustain
    grain production, 2) shallow groundwater table depth is deep (e.g., over 4 m)
    and thus results in a thick unsaturated zone and hence the difficulty in establishing
    groundwater flow model, and 3) agricultural techniques are important for solving
    the dilemma between groundwater conservation and crop production. Thereby, the
    objectives of this study are to 1) establish an integrated APEX-SWAT-GW model;
    2) test the newly developed model by achieving a satisfactory performance during
    both calibration and validation periods for the crop growth, water cycle, and
    groundwater variations; and 3) assess the model''s ability to simulate variations
    in crop yields and groundwater dynamics through various scenarios such as water-limited
    irrigation and sprinkler irrigation. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area
    and model setup The North China Plain (NCP) is a globally representative area
    that presents a sharp contradiction between water scarcity and food security,
    which produces approximately 30% of the national grain with a 305 m3 yr−1 per
    capita freshwater availability (accounting for 3.5% of the average level of the
    world) (Yang, 2002; Sun and Ren, 2013; van Oort et al., 2016). In the past 30
    years, more than 40% of the increase in grain production in China comes from the
    NCP, especially the crop yields of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer
    maize (Zea mays L.) (Xu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2013). The study area with an
    area of 22,753 km2 focuses on the typical shallow groundwater overexploited region
    in NCP (Fig. 1), and involves two hydrological regions, i.e., the Dianxi Plain
    of the Daqing River basin (DXP) and the Plain of the Ziya River basin (ZYHP).
    It belongs to the semi-humid, semi-arid, and monsoonal climate zone, with a predominant
    planting pattern of winter wheat (WW) and summer maize (SM) double cropping system
    (Fig. 1). However, the water demand of the WW-SM system is above 800 mm to maintain
    current crop yields (Wang et al., 2001), which far exceeds the 450–550 mm precipitation,
    thus dictates the need for irrigation. Because of the severe scarcity of surface
    water resources in this region, almost all of the irrigation source is from the
    shallow aquifer due to its good quality with low salinity (Chen, 1999; Liu, 2002;
    Ren et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2020). From 1980 to 2020, the shallow groundwater
    table has dropped by 20–60 m, with a drop rate of more than 1.0 m yr−1 (Zhang
    et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2017), raising an alarm of unsustainable
    signal to the water resources management in China and similar regions worldwide.

    distributions of winter wheat and summer maize. Note: the hydrogeological structure
    of the cross-section is modified on basis of Foster et al. (2004); the spatial
    distribution of winter wheat and summer maize is cited from Luo et al. (2020);
    the shallow groundwater overexploited and severe overexploited areas are drawn
    according to Zhang and Fei (2009). Based on our previous studies in terms of establishing
    the SWAT model in the study area (Zhang et al., 2016), the data (including DEM,
    stream, land use, soil, and weather stations) for model setup processes are able
    to be used continually. In detail, 10 subbasins in the DXP and 12 subbasins in
    the ZYHP were divided in SWAT, and the same spatial distributions of the 22 subareas
    were delineated using the APEX model. Three crop variety subzones, four planting
    and harvesting time subzones, and four irrigation scheduling subzones, along with
    the detailed irrigation and fertilizer application schemes for WW and SM were
    set for the 22 subbasins/subareas in sequence according to Zhang et al. (2016).
    2.2. Overview of the APEX, SWAT, and SWAT-GW models 2.2.1. APEX model The APEX
    model is a multi-field version of the Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC)
    agroecology simulation model (Williams et al., 1989), and it can be applied in
    a single field similar to EPIC, as well as for a whole farm or watershed (Williams
    et al., 2008). The model performs calculations on a daily time step and can be
    used for simulating the impacts of different tillage operations, conservation
    practices, alternative cropping systems, and other management practices on surface
    runoff, sediment loading, and nutrient losses. Specifically, agricultural management
    capabilities include irrigation (sprinkler, drip, or furrow), drainage, furrow
    diking, buffer strips, terraces, waterways, fertilization, manure management,
    lagoons, reservoirs, crop rotation and selection, cover crops, biomass removal,
    pesticide application, grazing, and tillage (Gassman et al., 2009). To date, unique
    input parameters have been developed for about 100 different crops and other vegetative
    species. APEX is capable of simulating growth for both annual and perennial crops.
    The model is also capable of simulating mixed stands of up to ten crops or other
    plants in a competitive environment. Thus, the APEX model has robust crop growth
    routines, detailed field conditions, and a wide range of alternative management
    practices, which makes it has been widely used in agroecosystem modeling worldwide
    (Pi et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2018). An equation of groundwater
    mass balance is included in APEX (Table 1), which involves rootzone percolation,
    reservoir seepage, return flow, and percolation out of the groundwater storage.
    However, the lack of an irrigation pumping process in this equation makes it unsuitable
    for simulating groundwater storage changes in a well-irrigated farming area with
    human activities. Table 1. Comparisons of major simulation components among APEX,

    the specific yield of the shallow aquifer. 2.2.2. SWAT and SWAT-GW models SWAT
    is a basin-scale distributed hydrological model, which is also developed from
    EPIC algorithm, with multiple model components, including weather generation,
    hydrology, sediment, crop growth, nutrient, and pesticide subroutines (Arnold
    et al., 1998; Neitsch et al., 2011). Compared to the APEX model, the SWAT model
    has more detailed calculation processes on hydrological components, including
    surface runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration (ET), lateral flow, percolation/deep
    seepage, consumptive use through pumping (if any), shallow aquifer contribution
    to streamflow for a nearby stream (baseflow), and recharge by seepage from surface
    water bodies, and it tends to be more suitable for simulations at the watershed
    with a large scale (Gassman et al., 2007; Neitsch et al., 2011). The groundwater
    module of the SWAT model is able to calculate water storage changes in shallow
    aquifers based on the water balance equation on a daily time step, considering
    vertical recharge, based flow, evaporation discharge, percolation to the deep
    aquifer, and anthropogenic pumping (Table 1). However, the original code of SWAT
    cannot print the groundwater table height to output files, which brings an obstacle
    to parameter calibration in terms of comparing with the observation data from
    wells. To overcome this drawback and promote the applicability of the SWAT model
    in the groundwater overdraft area, Zhang et al. (2016) modified the code related
    to groundwater calculating processes by FORTRAN and developed the SWAT-GW model.
    The processes and related equations of SWAT groundwater module modifications are
    provided in the Supplementary Material. In detail, four new parameters named SHIDEP
    (bottom bed burial depth of the shallow aquifer), SHPOR (porosity of the shallow
    aquifer), GW_SPYLD (specific yield of the shallow aquifer), and LARCHRG (amount
    of lateral recharge from mountainous area entering into the aquifer) were added
    to the .gw file of the SWAT TxtInOut to calculate shallow groundwater table variations
    (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material). Through the modified and added equations
    of the SWAT-GW model listed in Table 1, the SHGWHT (shallow groundwater table
    depth) is calculated and printed in the 11th variable in the subbasin output file
    and 69th variable in HRU output file. We shared the executable SWAT-GW.exe along
    with the examples of .gw file and file.cio texts on GitHub (https://github.com/Zhujiayaohello/APEX-SWAT-GW-model).
    2.3. APEX-SWAT-GW model The linked APEX-SWAT-GW model was constructed using the
    R code to transfer variable values between the APEX and SWAT-GW simulation subroutines.
    A technical roadmap for APEX-SWAT-GW model construction was provided in this study
    (Fig. 2), which indicates the processes of APEX and SWAT-GW simulations and integration.
    The APEX model simulated the soil water balance (including ET and root zone percolation)
    and crop yields. Simultaneously, the SWAT-GW model simulates the shallow groundwater
    balance (including vertical and lateral recharge, irrigation pumping, baseflow,
    etc.) and groundwater table depth. The linking of these two models is forced by
    transferring the updated percolation (root zone percolation, APEX variable) to
    GW_RCHG (SWAT-GW variable). Download : Download high-res image (902KB) Download

    Note: GWQMN is the threshold of the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer
    required for base flow to occur (mm); GWQWT is the threshold of the shallow groundwater
    table depth required for base flow to occur (m); REVAPMN is the threshold of the
    amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer required for ‘‘revap” to occur (mm);
    REVAPWT is the threshold of the shallow groundwater table depth required for ‘‘revap”
    to occur (m); ALPHA_BF is the baseflow alpha factor (1/days); GW_REVAP is the
    groundwater “revap” coefficient; SHALLIST change is the variation of water stored
    in the shallow aquifer (mm); WPRCP is the precipitation (mm); WIRGA is the irrigation
    (mm); WET is the evapotranspiration (mm); WWYLD is the water yield (mm); ΔSW is
    the amount of variation in soil water content (mm); and the meanings of the variables
    Wrchrg, Qgw, Wrevap, Wdeep, Wpump,sh, Wlarchrg, SHBD, SHGWT0, SHALLIST, SHPOR,
    and GWSPYLD are shown in Table 1. We used the R tool to conduct the integration
    processes of APEX and SWAT-GW by reading and assigning the related data to the
    same subbasins in these two models. The detailed steps are as follows: 1) Based
    on the DEM and stream network, the APEX and SWAT-GW models are constructed with
    the exact same subbasins (subareas); 2) R is used to read the monthly subarea
    file (***.MSA) output from the APEX model, and the ***gw.csv file made from the
    SWAT-GW model output groundwater files (***.gw); 3) Based on the output values
    of WPRCP (precipitation), WIRGA (irrigation), WET (evapotranspiration), and WWYLD
    (water yield) obtained from APEX (****.MSA), the value of updated percolation
    is calculated according to the water balance equation (Fig. 2); 4) The values
    of GW_RCHG is replaced with the values of the updated percolation, and combined
    with the Qgw, Wrevap, Wdeep, and Wlarchrg values in ***gw.csv file to calculate
    the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer (S) based on the groundwater
    balance equations; and 5) R code determines groundwater table variation (H) from
    S with different subbasin specific yield data and then outputs the groundwater
    table depth data. 2.4. Parameter sensitivity analysis Unlike crop growth parameters
    that have physical significance and in a relatively small number, the PARM****.DAT
    file in APEX has more than one hundred parameters that can be used to simulate
    ET, so a global sensitivity analysis was performed before ET calibration. The
    uncertainty range of APEX parameters was determined based on values recommended
    by Steglich and Williams (2019). The Morris sensitivity analysis method (Morris,
    1991) was implemented for short-listing the number of sensitive parameters. Then,
    an approach of the standardized rank regression coefficient (SRRC) (Helton, 1993)
    was used to rank sensitive parameters in terms of their total sensitivity indices.
    The sensitivity analysis methods were implemented using the APEXSENSUN package
    in the R tool (Talebizadeh et al., 2018), however, it had a drawback when applied
    to a watershed with multiple subareas. The APEXSENSUN package reads the output
    value of the ET in the watershed outlet file (****.DWS) when performing a sensitivity
    test on the ET, which means that only one subarea can be considered. However,
    for a watershed scale, multiple subareas divisions are necessary, and the ET values
    are different and varying due to the heterogeneity of meteorological conditions,
    land use, soil type, and management practices. So, the original APEXSENSUN package
    is not suitable for the sensitivity analysis of ET simulations at a regional scale.
    Hence, we modified the source code of the APEXSENSUN package by replacing the
    read-in DWS file with a read-in SAD file (the daily subarea file), which can print
    out the daily ET at each subarea. This made the modified APEXSENSUN package more
    flexible in performing sensitivity analysis with the functions of selecting different
    subareas and various crops. The specific calculating steps of the modified APEXSENSUN
    package work as follows: 1) The file path, type of sensitivity analysis method,
    parameters to be detected, and their ranges are all configured while reading the
    ****.SAD file output by APEX into R. 2) The modified APEXSENSUN package generates
    multiple parameter samples according to the selected sensitivity analysis method,
    and the generated parameter values are written into two input files containing
    global inputs for the APEX model (i.e., APEXCONT.DAT and PARM****.DAT files).
    3) If needed, different subareas and crops are set, the APEX executable file is
    performed in R, and the associated APEX outputs are stored in separate output
    files for each simulation. 4) After the completion of all simulations, the modified
    APEXSENSUN package loops through the APEX output files to calculate statistical
    model performance measures. 5) Finally, sensitivity indices are determined using
    the calculated model performance measures. The source R code of the modified APEXSENSUN
    package is shared on GitHub. 2.5. Model calibration and validation for multiple
    variables In this study, the APEX crop growth parameters for wheat and maize of
    the three crop variety subzones (Luancheng, Quzhou, and Jingjin subzones) were
    calibrated aiming at the statistical data from the Hebei Rural Statistical Yearbook
    (1995-2014). We used the area-weighted approach to aggregate the statistical data
    of each county to the subarea scale. Due to both SWAT and APEX crop modules are
    developed from the EPIC algorithm, many parameters are similar or have the same
    function in describing the process of crop growth (Table S1 in the Supplementary
    Material). Therefore, we initialized the crop parameters of wheat and maize with
    reasonable values from the calibrated SWAT model (Sun and Ren, 2014; Zhang et
    al., 2016), and adjusted some of them by referring to field experiments using
    a trial-and-error method to fit the observed data to avoid the physical significance
    distortion of the parameters. In the DXP and ZYHP, taking the statistical crop
    yields of 20 years as the objective, half of the subareas were chosen for calibration
    and the other half for validation. After the rectification of crop growth parameters,
    the hydrological cycle processes were calibrated aiming at the ET data because
    the water use was mainly consumed through ET in farming areas of irrigated plain.
    Based on the sensitivity analysis of different subareas obtained using the Morris
    sensitivity analysis method and SRRC approach in the modified APEXSENSUN package,
    the parameters related to soil water balance were adjusted. The original remote
    sensing monthly ET with a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km from 2002 to 2004
    was aggregated to the subarea scale to conduct comparisons. Similar to the processes
    of crop growth parameters, half of the subareas were chosen for calibration and
    the other half for validation. Following the ET calibration, the updated percolation
    by the APEX model was compared to the vertical recharge (GW_RCHG) by the SWAT-GW
    model to demonstrate the rationality of the APEX-SWAT-GW integration. At last,
    a detailed comparison between the simulated groundwater table depth and recorded
    data from monitoring wells was conducted to evaluate the performance of the integrated
    APEX-SWAT-GW model in reflecting groundwater table fluctuations. Continuous monitoring
    data during 1997–2009 from 16 national wells were used for the evaluation of 10
    subareas in the DXP and seven subareas in the ZYHP based on the closest distance
    principle. No national monitoring data were collected for the five subareas in
    the southern ZYHP, thus we used the regional investigation wells with available
    data during 2007–2012 to conduct a comparison. The positions of these wells are
    provided in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2016). The agreement between simulated
    and observed values was evaluated through a variety of evaluation indicators that
    account for the modeling performance from different perspectives. We choose five
    evaluation indicators that have been widely used for the evaluation of simulation
    accuracy, which are Mean Bias Error (MBE) (Willmott, 1982; Gupta et al., 1999),
    coefficient of determination (R2) (Santhi et al., 2007), Normalized Root Mean
    Square Error (NRMSE) (Jamieson et al., 1991), Percent BIAS (PBIAS) (Gupta et al.,
    1999), and index of agreement (d) (Willmott, 1981). (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) where
    Si is the simulated value; Oi is the observed value; O is the mean of the observed
    values; S is the mean of the simulated values; N is the number of observed values.
    The evaluation criteria of each index is as follows: 1) MBE: if it is greater
    than 0, it indicates the overestimation of the simulated values, and vice versa;
    2) R2: its variation range is 0–1, and the more R2 tends to 1, the better the
    simulation result is and its acceptable range is above 0.50; 3) NRMSE: if its
    value is less than 10%, the performance is very good, 10% < NRMSE < 20% for good
    performance, 20% < NRMSE < 30% for fair performance, and more than 30% for poor
    performance; 4) PBIAS: if its absolute value is less than 25% and greater than
    15%, the performance is satisfactory, 10% < |PBIAS| < 15% for good performance,
    and |PBIAS| < 10% for very good performance (Moriasi et al., 2007). The lower
    the absolute value of PBIAS, the better the model performance is; 5) d: the variation
    range is 0–1, when d is equal to 1, the simulated value and the measured value
    are in complete agreement. The closer d is to 1, the better the simulation is
    (Iqbal et al., 2014; Akumaga et al., 2017). 2.6. APEX-SWAT-GW model scenario settings
    To further test the established APEX-SWAT-GW model in simulating the SPAGC system
    under different agricultural management practices, two kinds of representative
    water-saving measures, i.e., reducing irrigation amount and transferring to sprinkling
    irrigation scheme, were designed as simulation scenarios. For the winter wheat-summer
    maize double cropping system, the precipitation is abundant during the summer
    maize growing season, so the changes in irrigation amount and irrigation method
    are applied to winter wheat only. During the winter wheat growing season, the
    average precipitation is 130 mm, which is far below the estimated evapotranspiration
    of 450 mm (Zhang et al., 2006). Farmers are used to applying 4-6 times irrigation
    for winter wheat in general (Sun and Ren, 2014), which lead to serious groundwater
    depletion. According to government policies and related literature (Hebei Bureau
    of Quality and Technical Supervision, 2008, 2012, and 2013; Sun and Ren, 2014;
    Chen et al., 2014; Zhong et al., 2017), the irrigation should be reduced by 1-2
    times to sustain crop production as well as mitigate groundwater decline. Therefore,
    the pumping amount was restricted to 225 mm with the limited irrigation scheme
    (irrigation frequency was three times and each application was 75 mm). Moreover,
    the effects of transferring traditional border irrigation to sprinkler irrigation
    were explored in scenario simulation. The irrigation frequency and irrigation
    quota in sprinkler irrigation schemes were referred from field experiments, local
    technical regulations, and relevant literature (Hebei Bureau of Quality and Technical
    Supervision, 2008, 2012, and 2013; Son et al., 2022). By setting up the APEX-SWAT-GW
    farming operation module, three scenarios were involved in this study: 1) Scenario
    1 (S1) as the basic scenario, the current irrigation schedule and irrigation method;
    2) Scenario 2 (S2), the limited irrigation scheme with traditional irrigation
    method; and 3) Scenario 3 (S3), the limited irrigation scheme with sprinkler irrigation
    method. Details are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Descriptions of simulated scenarios.

    Based on the calibrated crop growth parameters for the SWAT-GW model in the previous
    studies (Sun and Ren, 2013, 2014; Zhang et al., 2016) and referring to related
    field experiments in the study area (Wei et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2008; Fan et
    al., 2014), eight parameters for three crop varieties of WW and three crop varieties
    of SM were calibrated and validated in this study. The final value after calibration
    for each parameter is listed in Table 3. Table 3. The final results of the eight

    satisfactory simulation results for winter wheat and summer maize yields compared
    to the statistical data at the spatial scale of 22 subareas (Fig. 3). In general,
    the mean values of simulated winter wheat and summer maize yields were 5829 kg
    ha−1 and 6273 kg ha−1, respectively; the corresponded results from statistical
    data was 5823 kg ha−1 and 6265 kg ha−1. Specifically, for the calibration and
    validation processes in both DXP and ZYHP, the NRMSE of winter wheat was less
    than 15% and the absolute value of PBIAS was less than 5% (Fig. 3), which indicated
    a good agreement. The simulation accuracy of summer maize yield was not as high
    as that of winter wheat, but also denoted satisfactory results according to the
    evaluation indicators. Except for the validation in ZYHP with an NRMSE of 20.1%
    and a PBIAS of 10.6%, all the verification processes showed an NRMSE<20%, an absolute
    value of PBIAS<10%, and a value of d > 0.75 (Fig. 3). Overall, the crop growth
    module of the APEX-SWAT-GW model, transferring some calibrated parameters from
    previous studies, could reasonably simulate the crop yields along with the spatial
    variations at the watershed. Download : Download high-res image (694KB) Download

    agricultural water cycle At each subarea, the sensitivity index ranking of parameters
    for ET simulation obtained from the modified APEXSENSUN package was not exactly
    consistent in the two hydrological regions of DXP and ZYHP. In detail, the parameters
    with first-order and second-order sensitivity indexes were Soil_evap_plant_cover
    and Max_rain_intercept for all subareas in the DXP (Fig. 4). For the 12 subareas
    in the ZYHP, the two most sensitive parameters were Soil_evap_coeff and Soil_water_limit
    (Fig. 4). However, no matter in DXP or ZYHP, the top 6 parameters in sensitivity
    index ranking identified by SRRC approach were mainly Soil_evap_plant_cover, Soil_evap_coeff,
    Soil_water_limit, Biological_mix_efficiency, Runoff_CN_int_abs, and Rain_intercept_coeff
    (Fig. 4). The six sensitive parameters were chosen in the further calibration
    and validation processes aimed at observed ET data, and the final results were
    given in Table S2 in the Supplementary Material. Download : Download high-res

    and the index ranking of the parameters for ET simulations at the 22 subareas
    in the DXP and ZYHP. The R2 in DXP and ZYHP was larger than 0.60 and up to 0.77
    in both calibration and validation (Fig. 5), which indicated a satisfactory simulation
    accuracy. Meanwhile, the PBIAS was relatively small, with a mean value of 5.04%
    (calibration) and −11.31% (validation) in the DXP, and a mean value of 5.80% (calibration)
    and 4.84% (validation) in the ZYHP. The observed ET from remote sensing data was
    609.0 ± 47.8 mm, and the simulated ET after calibration was 664.7 ± 40.9 mm. The
    MBE was 46.27 mm and 22.44 mm for calibration and validation in the DXP, and the
    corresponding values were 88.60 mm and 58.34 mm in the ZYHP, which implied an
    overestimation of the ET using the APEX-SWAT-GW model in general. We also found
    that the simulated results were much larger than the observed ones when monthly
    ET was high (e.g., in April and August). This mismatch might come from the generalization
    of the cropping system in cropland as winter wheat-summer maize in the whole study
    area along with the high-water consumption (Sun and Ren, 2013). Nevertheless,
    the satisfactory evaluation indicators of R2, PBIAS, and MBE demonstrated that
    the accuracy of the APEX-SWAT-GW model in simulating ET, thus in estimating soil
    water balance and hydrological cycle, was acceptable in this well-irrigated plain.

    Fig. 5. Comparisons of the simulated and observed monthly ET and the evaluation
    indicators in the two hydrological regions. 3.3. Performance in simulating shallow
    groundwater variations For the hydrological cycle in an irrigated plain with a
    thick vadose zone, the accurate estimation of ET could reflect a reliable percolation
    from soil profile, and hence a reasonable recharge to shallow aquifer at the yearly
    scale (annual change in soil water content was close to zero). The annual percolation
    from soil profile (2 m) calculated by the APEX-SWAT-GW model was verified by comparing
    with the vertical recharge to shallow aquifer simulated by the SWAT-GW model (named
    GW_RCHG). According to the 1:1 line fitting diagram (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary
    Material), we could conclude that the linking of APEX and SWAT-GW by transferring
    the percolation variable using R tool was effective. In other words, the integrated
    APEX-SWAT-GW model should be a reasonable tool for simulating the vertical groundwater
    recharge by using the updated percolation value instead of the GW_RCHG value from
    the SWAT-GW model, and hence the newly developed APEX-SWAT-GW model has the capacity
    to model the shallow groundwater storage change and groundwater table variation
    under the anthropogenic pumping for irrigation. To further evaluate the simulation
    performance of this APEX-SWAT-GW model in modeling shallow groundwater table variations,
    a detailed comparison was conducted for each subarea in the DXP (Fig. 6) and ZYHP
    (Fig. 7) at the annual scale. Generally, both simulated and observed groundwater
    tables presented a continuous declining trend, and the two data sequences were
    basically similar. In DXP hydrological region, shallow groundwater table fluctuations
    of dx7, dx8, and dx9 subareas presented the best accuracy (Fig. 6). Whereas, in
    dx4 and dx6, the simulated declining rate in shallow groundwater table was overestimated
    in comparison with observed data. Due to the limited data availability, some generalizations
    might exist in the boundary condition setting processes, e.g., an overestimation
    in irrigation pumping amounts, neglecting a fraction of surface water irrigation
    areas, and simplifying all cropland to be a double-cropping system, which may
    increase the uncertainties. In ZYHP hydrological region, the variations in the
    simulated groundwater table presented a higher consistency with the observed data
    (Fig. 7). Overall, the reasonable evaluation results supported the reliability
    of the integrated APEX-SWAT-GW model in simulating the groundwater declining over
    decade and the heterogeneous spatial pattern in different subareas. Download :

    depths year by year and calculated the shallow aquifer water storage depletion
    over 20 years to analyze the groundwater sustainability under extensive pumping
    amounts (Fig. 8). Since the 1990s, the shallow groundwater table in the study
    area exhibited a drastic downward trend, with an average rate of 1.3 m yr−1 in
    DXP and 1.4 m yr−1 in ZYHP. In detail, the shallow groundwater table depth in
    DXP was 10.3 m on average, while it dropped to 35.1 m in 2012; for ZYHP, this
    downward was changing from 23.5 m to 51.2 m, indicating a more serious groundwater
    overexploitation situation. Download : Download high-res image (455KB) Download

    aquifer storage changes in the two hydrological regions during the entire simulation
    period. Due to the continuous overexploitation, a mass of groundwater storage
    was lost and caused an obvious groundwater depletion in this plain. The annual
    recharge to the shallow aquifer in the well-irrigated area (Hebei Provincial Department
    of Water Resources, 1990-2012) was 10.8 × 108 m3 and 12.9 × 108 m3 in DXP and
    ZYHP, respectively. But the corresponding discharge (including irrigation pumping,
    percolation to the deep aquifer, etc.) in these two hydrological regions was 18.2
    × 108 m3 and 27.1 × 108 m3 respectively. Thus, the shallow aquifer water storage
    of the well-irrigated cropland in the study area was depleted at a rate of 7.4
    × 108 m3 in DXP and 14.2 × 108 m3 in ZYHP. The above analysis showed that the
    full irrigation management to sustain grain yield caused a serious groundwater-exhausting
    crisis, effective agricultural management practices, such as water-saving plans,
    should be enforced to maintain the aquifer sustainability. 3.4. Scenario simulation
    results of the APEX-SWAT-GW model Simulated results showed that in comparison
    with basic scenario S1, the average winter wheat yield would decrease by approximately
    15% under S2 scenario, due to the reduction in irrigation amount. This reduction
    in the DXP was higher than that in the ZYHP (Table 4). If the irrigation method
    was transferred to sprinkler irrigation, i.e., from S2 scenario to S3 scenario,
    the yield loss would be reduced by half, changed to approximately 8.5%. This variation
    indicated the ability of sprinkler irrigation practices to increase winter wheat
    yields under limited irrigation scenarios in the study area. In terms of ET simulations,
    the reduction in ET for the S2 and S3 scenarios compared to S1 in the DXP was
    slightly higher than that in the ZYHP. For the whole study area, compared with
    basic scenario S1, the ET decreased by approximately 8.3% and 3.4% under the S2
    and S3 scenarios, respectively. Table 4. The effects on winter wheat yield, annual
    evapotranspiration (ET), and groundwater variation of the two water-saving scenarios

    DXP 41.65% 20.58% ZYHP 29.02% 12.98% Entire study area 34.51% 16.29% Conducting
    limited irrigation scheme could mitigate the groundwater table declining rate
    to some extent. If the pumping amount for irrigation was reduced from 356 mm under
    the basic scenario S1 to 225 mm under the S2 scenario, the average declining rate
    could be slower to less than 1.0 m yr−1 in the study area. Notably, the effects
    on shallow groundwater drawdown mitigation were more obvious in the DXP (Table
    4), which implied that although a higher yield loss was found in this hydrological
    region, it had an advantage in groundwater conservation, compared to the ZYHP.
    As has been noted, the contradiction between crop production and groundwater conservation
    has always existed in the study area. The sprinkler irrigation scenario S3 could
    increase wheat yield in comparison with S2, but a more serious groundwater depletion
    was presented consequently. As a result, if conducting sprinkler irrigation scheme
    under a limited pumping amount of 225 mm, the shallow groundwater declining rate
    could be reduced by approximately 16.3% compared to the current situation. The
    spatial distributions of winter wheat yield, ET, and groundwater variation under
    different simulation scenarios are provided in Figs. S3–S5 in the Supplementary
    Material. In summary, the calibrated APEX-SWAT-GW model could quantify the changes
    in crop yields, agricultural water cycle, and shallow groundwater vacations under
    various agricultural management scenarios, which can provide important data for
    policy-making in this region toward agricultural production and groundwater sustainability.
    It could serve as a useful tool for simulating and assessing the SPAGC system
    in NCP and other regions with an overexploited aquifer worldwide. 3.5. Limitations
    and future work This study introduces an integration of the APEX-SWAT-GW model
    that includes simulation of soil water balance of soil profile (2 m) by APEX and
    groundwater balance of shallow aquifer by SWAT-GW. The functionality of the linked
    APEX-SWAT-GW model is examined for a typical groundwater-fed breadbasket in NCP,
    which is a hotspot of shallow groundwater depletion globally. Model construction,
    parameter calibration, and comparisons of model results (crop yields, ET, groundwater
    table variation, and groundwater storage change) were conducted during 1993-2012.
    We chose these twenty years for several reasons as follows: 1) the pumping amount
    and frequency were reasonable to be generalized as the full irrigation schedule
    before 2012, because limited (or deficit) irrigation schemes were implemented
    in some local farmland as many water-saving policies were released by the Chinese
    government after 2014 (Zhang et al., 2018, 2021); 2) the irrigation source and
    recharge to aquifer were relatively simple, compared to the implementation of
    South-to-North Water Diversion Project after 2014; and 3) limitations of available
    groundwater table fluctuation data from monitoring wells and groundwater resources
    assessment results in recent ten years. Hence, during this period, we have confidence
    in integrating the APEX-SWAT-GW model with justified boundary conditions on the
    basis of supporting data, which is crucial to calibration and validation, and
    further to model application. Future work will be required to conduct scenario
    analysis considering multisource irrigation under more complicated boundary conditions
    if more detailed data are obtained. In addition, due to the large variability
    of precipitation during the summer maize growing period and the uncertainty of
    model generalization, the mean summer maize yield has a good accuracy, but the
    degree of dispersion for summer maize yield needs further improving. The R tool
    was used in the model integration processes in this study by reading and transferring
    data between APEX and SWAT-GW models for each subarea (subbasin). But now the
    data transmission is focused on inputting the values of water balance variables
    from APEX to the groundwater balance equation used by SWAT-GW in order to obtain
    the updated percolation value, in other words, a one-sided transformation (downward
    water movement). Therefore, the current APEX-SWAT-GW model could not reflect the
    movement of water into overlying unsaturated layers as a function of water demand
    for ET, because of a lack of transferring the REVAP data of SWAT-GW to the calculation
    of ET in APEX. The agricultural regions with a thick vadose zone (i.e., the shallow
    groundwater table depth is over 4 m) and hence barely phreatic water evaporation
    should be the potential district for applying the current version of the integrated
    APEX-SWAT-GW model. The modeling framework has incorporated the parameter of specific
    yield in the model to consider heterogeneity of aquifer at 22 subbasins, but some
    drawbacks of aquifer vertical heterogeneity, isolated aquifers, lateral flow between
    aquifers, and steady-state assumptions still exist, compared to groundwater flow
    models. The simulated results of APEX-SWAT-GW model could provide data support
    for policy maker in terms of annual crop yields and groundwater variation at the
    regional scale, simulations at finer scale and uncertainty analysis need to be
    further conducted, which should be supported by more collectible data and model
    integration. Another disadvantage is that before model linking, the APEX and SWAT-GW
    models should be established separately to create the TxtInOut files and then
    run the APEX.exe, SWAT-GW.exe, and R code in sequence. In future work, an improvement
    in model structure should focus on developing a modified code that could bidirectional
    transfer data and allow one executable file, to further extend the application
    range of the APEX-SWAT-GW model. Zhang et al. (2018, 2021) used the SWAT-GW model
    to predict and assess the variations in crop yields, ET, and groundwater changes
    under limited irrigation schemes and seasonal fallow schemes. However, due to
    the simplification of the crop growth module in SWAT, some agronomic practices
    aiming at reducing the impacts of limited exploitation on crop yields cannot be
    reflected in these studies. Through a meta-analysis based on experimental studies
    of NCP published in 47 papers, Ding et al. (2021) found that agronomic management
    practices such as increasing organic fertilization, improving planting density,
    straw mulching, deep plowing, etc. were effective to alleviate yield reductions
    due to the reduced irrigation. But the meta-analysis was unable to quantify the
    responses of crop yields to multiple practices, especially at a regional scale.
    The integrated APEX-SWAT-GW model has been used in this study to conduct simulation
    for water-limited irrigation and sprinkler irrigation scenarios. A detailed parameter
    representation related to the manure management, tillage, seeding density changing,
    and cover crop functions in APEX needs to be further conducted, which should be
    supported by more collectible data conducted in experiment stations. Based on
    this APEX-SWAT-GW model and further scenario simulations, quantified results would
    provide a reference for the trade-off between water and food in NCP through numerical
    modeling, as well as an effective and exercisable tool for other groundwater over-exploited
    regions (e.g., the U.S. High Plains and the Indo-Gangetic Plains). 4. Conclusions
    This study presents an APEX-SWAT-GW model, an integrated watershed-scale model
    that links the crop growth algorithms of APEX with the improved groundwater module
    of SWAT. Model linkage occurs between soil water balance and groundwater balance
    by transferring the APEX simulated root zone percolation to vertical recharge
    in SWAT-GW through the R language, which establishes a simulation tool combining
    the aboveground SPAC system with the underground aquifer system. This integrated
    APEX-SWAT-GW model is tested through application to a well-irrigated plain with
    a winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system in NCP. Parameters related
    to crop growth and agro-hydrological processes were calibrated aiming at observed
    crop yields and ET, and the groundwater module evaluation was conducted by comparing
    to monitoring wells at the 22 subareas. In two hydrological regions of DXP and
    ZYHP, the NRMSE of winter wheat and summer maize were lower than 25%, the absolute
    values of PBIAS were lower than 15%, and the d value is higher than 0.75 in both
    calibration and validation processes. Compared to the observed ET by remote sensing,
    the calibration and validation also resulted in values of R2 that were over 0.6,
    and the absolute values of PBIAS that were lower than 15%. In the 10 subareas
    in DXP and 12 subareas in ZYHP, data sequences of simulated and observed groundwater
    table depth were basically similar. Overall, the calibrated APEX-SWAT-GW model
    could satisfactorily simulate the variations in groundwater, water cycle, and
    crop yields in this typical well-irrigated plain. Due to the intensive pumping
    for irrigation, the shallow groundwater table has been declining at an average
    rate of 1.3 m yr−1and 1.4 m yr−1 in DXP and ZYHP, respectively, resulting in a
    groundwater depletion of 7.4 × 108 m3 and 14.2 × 108 m3, which is unsustainable
    obviously. According to the scenario testing of two irrigation management measures:
    water-limited irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, the rate of groundwater table
    decline could be mitigated by 34.5% in the study area with water-limited irrigation
    (225 mm irrigation) compared to basic scenario (356 mm irrigation), but at the
    expense of approximately 15% loss of winter wheat yield. Combined water-limited
    irrigation with sprinkler irrigation method, the yield reduction rate of winter
    wheat was within 10%, and the rate of groundwater table decline could be mitigated
    by 16.3% in the study area. Overall, the APEX-SWAT-GW model as presented in this
    study can be a useful tool for simulating agro-hydrological processes in areas
    where groundwater is over-exploited to sustain crop yield, particularly in areas
    wherein agricultural water-saving practices are urgent to be applied in groundwater
    governance. Name of software APEX-SWAT-GW model Developers Jiayao Zhu and Xueliang

    1. Introduction Stretching from 24o to 40o North latitude and from 44o to 64o
    East longitude, Iran is one of the largest countries in the Middle East, with
    a population of around 84 million in 2020 (https://www.amar.org.ir/). Drylands,
    characterized by high evaporation and erratic precipitation, cover more than 90%
    of the country (Nouri and Homaee, 2018, Nouri et al., 2022b). Agricultural production
    heavily relies on irrigation in the drylands of Iran (Bybordi, 2002). From around
    14.3 million hectares under cultivation in the last decade, 5.9 and 8.4 million
    hectares are under rainfed and irrigated conditions, respectively (Fig. 1a). However,
    about 92% of 95.2 million tons of crops is harvested from irrigated farms, thus
    highlighting the importance of irrigation in Iran (Fig. 1b). Download : Download

    production (million tons) and cultivation area (million ha) in 2011–2021 for Iran.
    The agricultural crops consisted of horticultural crops including greenhouse crops,
    medicinal plants, tropical and sub-tropical fruits, temperate fruits, citrus,
    berries, drupes, pomes, mushrooms, nuts, and other horticultural crops, as well
    as agronomic crops including cereals, legumes, vegetables, melons, fiber crops,
    industrial crops (i.e. fiber crops, oilseeds, sugar/energy crops, and tobacco)
    and other agronomic crops. (The data were retrieved from https://www.maj.ir/page-amar/FA/65/form/pId28998.).
    Based on the data presented in Fig. 2, the water use-to-availability ratio in
    Iran equals 0.9 (99 ÷ 110 = 0.9). Considering the stress threshold value of 0.4
    (Rockström et al., 2009), Iran experiences high water stress conditions. This
    is a mega-challenge, often called water crisis or water bankruptcy, leading to
    severe social, economic, and environmental problems (Collins, 2017, Ketabchy,
    2021, Madani, 2014, Madani et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res image (206KB)

    resources comprise the average annual flow of rivers and aquifer recharge resulting
    from local precipitation, as well as transboundary water resources originating
    from outside the country.) Official inquiry from Office of Basic Studies of Water
    Resources of Ministry of Energy and MOE (2018). Iran’s agricultural sector presently
    meets around 129 out of 152 million tons of food demand, accounting for 85% of
    food self-sufficiency (Mesgaran and Azadi, 2018, Soltani et al., 2020). Note that
    129 million tons of food production includes crops, red meat, chicken meat, forage
    (rangeland), milk, eggs, and fish. However, this sector accounts for around 89%
    of total renewable water withdrawal (Fig. 2b). Inefficient water use contributes
    to water scarcity in Iran (Barati et al., 2023, Goli et al., 2021, Madani, 2014,
    Oweis et al., 2008, Qureshi et al., 2010). In other words, the amount of agricultural
    production generated per unit of water consumed is relatively low. Moreover, climate
    drying/warming trends, along with more frequent and intense dry spells under climate
    change, have led to higher water demand and reduced water availability for the
    agricultural sector, intensifying water and food insecurity in Iran (Bijani et
    al., 2020, Mirzaei and Zibaei, 2020, Nouri and Homaee, 2020, Trigo et al., 2010).
    Furthermore, the growing population in Iran has contributed to a decrease in renewable
    water resources per capita, further worsening water scarcity (Barati et al., 2023,
    Zakeri et al., 2022). A few studies have addressed weak water governance structure
    as one of the key drivers of water scarcity in Iran (Mirnezami et al., 2019, Mirzaei
    et al., 2017, Nazemi et al., 2020). Water scarcity appears to be primarily attributed
    to water governance-related issues rather than technical factors (Madani, 2014,
    Nazemi et al., 2020, Sarami-Foroushani et al., 2023). However, more attention
    has been paid by decision-makers and scholars to technical issues rather than
    water governance-related issues (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (343KB)

    are listed in Table S1 in supplementary material. The consequences of agricultural
    water management have received significant attention within these publications
    on the Iran water resources and agricultural water management (Fig. 3a and b).
    Such consequences were classified into four primary categories: i) groundwater
    depletion (Ashraf et al., 2021, Mirnezami et al., 2018, Motagh et al., 2017, Rahmati
    et al., 2019, Salehi Moteahd et al., 2019), ii) deterioration of water resources
    quality (Babaei et al., 2019, Barzegar et al., 2017, Imani et al., 2017, Jalali,
    2005, Jalali, 2011, Ziaie et al., 2019), iii) reduction in environmental flows
    and desiccation of wetlands (Ahmadi et al., 2018, Moshir Panahi et al., 2022,
    Qaderi Nasab and Rahnama, 2019), and iv) water conflicts (Bijani et al., 2020,
    Mohammadinezhad and Ahmadvand, 2020, Nabavi, 2018, Veisi et al., 2020). As a substantial
    portion of water consumption is dedicated to irrigated agriculture, improving
    agricultural water management is crucial to overcome the water scarcity mega-challenge.
    Water productivity improvement and conservation interventions have consistently
    been prioritized in efforts to enhance agricultural water management. Related
    interventions have emerged as the predominant measures recommended by scholars
    and implemented by authorities (Fig. 3c). These strategies can be broadly categorized
    as follows: improvement of surface irrigation (Mehri et al., 2023, Radmanesh et
    al., 2023), modernization of irrigation technology (Albaji et al., 2010, Hassanli
    et al., 2010), adoption of efficient irrigation practices (Homayounfar et al.,
    2014, Razzaghi et al., 2020), water availability enhancement (Dortaj et al., 2020,
    Keshavarz et al., 2020), and promotion of water uptake (Baghbani-Arani et al.,
    2020, Nouri et al., 2017). Furthermore, the optimization of the water-food-energy
    nexus has been widely acknowledged as a promising approach to mitigate water scarcity
    in Iran (Fig. 3c). Strategies aimed at optimizing the water-food-energy nexus
    have concentrated on addressing the water crisis through modifying energy (Jamali
    Jaghdani and Kvartiuk, 2018, Jamali Jaghdani and Kvartiuk, 2021) and food policies.
    The food policy modifications involve altering cropping patterns (Sadeghi et al.,
    2020, Yazdandoost et al., 2021), reducing food waste (Karandish et al., 2020,
    Soltani et al., 2020), and promoting diet modifications (Soltani et al., 2020).
    These nexus-based strategies primarily aim to tackle the ongoing challenge of
    unbalancing food security (or food self-sufficiency) and water security in Iran
    (Karandish and Hoekstra, 2017), referred to as the dilemma in the current review.
    Limited literature has also addressed the water governance improvement to reduce
    the water scarcity in Iran (Mirnezami et al., 2019, Mirzaei et al., 2017, Nazemi
    et al., 2020). According to Fig. 3c, it is evident that less attention has been
    dedicated to bridging water governance gaps as a means to alleviate the water
    crisis in Iran, compared to the focus on nexus optimization and water productivity
    improvement. Some alternative economic instruments, such as water marketing (Jahanshahi
    et al., 2023, Jamali Jaghdani and Brümmer, 2016a) and water pricing (Jahanshahi
    et al., 2023, Nikouei and Ward, 2013), have also been proposed to enhance agricultural
    water management. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of these economic
    instruments have been a subject of debate due to potential adverse social and
    political consequences, as well as legal restrictions (Jamali Jaghdani and Brümmer,
    2016b, Momeni et al., 2019). There have been limited attempts to review the issue
    of water scarcity in Iran. However, these studies have primarily focused on specific
    basins or particular aspects of the problem (Amiraslani and Dragovich, 2023, Fatemi,
    2020). As a result, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of a holistic
    review addressing all the drivers, consequences, and potential strategies to combat
    water scarcity in Iran within the context of agriculture. Furthermore, as discussed
    previously, the existing literature has often overlooked the weaknesses of the
    water governance framework, instead placing greater emphasis on technical solutions.
    Hence, there is a critical need for a comprehensive review that takes into account
    the water governance conditions and provides strategies to address water scarcity
    in Iran, while giving due consideration to water governance improvement. The main
    objectives of this review paper are to shed light on the major challenges and
    the consequences of current agricultural water management practices, and to discuss
    the strategies to relieve water stress across Iran, with particular attention
    to water governance. 2. Water scarcity 2.1. Climate change and variability Water
    scarcity is currently a global issue, encompassing various aspects and presenting
    diverse challenges, particularly relative to climate change, which is having a
    noticeable impact on atmospheric variables on the globe (IPCC, 2013). Fig. 4a
    shows an increase of 0.32 oC per decade in the average temperature over Iran.
    Furthermore, there is a declining trend in precipitation, approximately 9 mm per
    decade during 1969–2016 (Fig. 4b). These results are in agreement with those reported
    by Rahimi et al. (2018). Hence, there is an overall warming and drying trend over
    the last half a century. This drying and warming trend has led to a downward trend
    in the renewable water amount in the country (Fig. 4c). This indicates that water
    supply has been, and is being, adversely affected by climate change. Moreover,
    climate change has also increased the atmospheric evaporative demand during half
    the century (Bannayan et al., 2020, Nouri et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res

    (The precipitation series is the average of observations from 476 rain gauge sites
    and the temperature series is the mean of measurements retrieved from 116 temperature
    stations in Fig. 1 and Table S2 of supplementary material. (a) The renewable water
    volume data were retrieved from Naseri et al. (2017). Climate change has not only
    impacted the long-term trends and means but also the climate variability (Trenberth
    et al., 2015). Drought, a prominent feature of climate variability in drylands,
    has become more intense and frequent in the last half a century in Iran (Bazrafshan,
    2017, Nouri and Homaee, 2020, Raziei et al., 2012). Climate change has likely
    influenced drought characteristics via affecting large-scale teleconnections,
    particularly the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) over central southwest Asia,
    including Iran (Kamil et al., 2019, Nouri and Homaee, 2020). Massive and prolonged
    La Niña-induced droughts noticeably decreased renewable water volume in 1998–2000,
    2007–2009, and 2010–2012 (Fig. 4c), causing water insecurity. Additionally, agricultural
    and livestock production was devastatingly influenced by the 1998–2000, 2007–2009,
    and 2010–2012 droughts, resulting in adverse socioeconomic consequences (Keshavarz
    et al., 2013, Nouri and Homaee, 2020, OCHA, 2000, Trigo et al., 2010). As more
    intense, frequent, and long-lasting droughts were projected to occur under climate
    change, mega-droughts are likely to occur in the future (Tabari and Willems, 2018,
    Yazdandoost, 2016). As a result, maintaining food and water security in the future
    is bound to be more challenging. 2.2. Water governance weaknesses vis-à-vis water
    scarcity In this review, we adopted the framework proposed by Charbit (2011) and
    Charbit (2020) to address the gaps of water governance structure in Iran, which
    are particularly important to deal with water scarcity. Thus, administrative,
    information, policy, funding, objective, capacity, and accountability gaps are
    analyzed herein focusing on the agricultural sector. The administrative gap is
    mainly rooted in the mismatch between the functional and administrative boundaries
    (Madani, 2014). Prior to 2005, the basin scale determined the administrative boundaries
    in the water governance system in Iran. However, the geographic scale of water
    management changed in 2005, from basin to province after implementing the law
    on “the conversion of provincial water departments into regional water companies”
    (Mirnezami and Bagheri, 2017). In other words, water management has become further
    fragmented as multiple regional water companies became involved in basin water
    management (Madani, 2014, Mirnezami and Bagheri, 2017, Nazemi et al., 2020). The
    lack of adequate and reliable data sharing among key actors and stakeholders in
    the current water governance of Iran creates an information gap (Enteshari and
    Safavi, 2020, Mirnezami and Bagheri, 2017). Water resources data are often provided
    as provincial or country scale reports, and are frequently associated with uncertainties
    (Enteshari and Safavi, 2020, Mirnezami and Bagheri, 2017). The information gap
    affects water withdrawal and consumption, transboundary waters, and groundwater
    recharge programs, thus can lead to conflicting findings and solutions. The Ministry
    of Agriculture (MOA) lacks updated and detailed reports on crop water requirements,
    cropping patterns, irrigation efficiency, and crop water productivity. Some data
    sources required to improve agricultural water management are missing or of low
    quality. Weather data are recorded and archived by the Ministry of Energy (MOE)
    and the Meteorology Organization (IRIMO) of Iran. While MOE data are registered
    monthly and may be of low quality, IRIMO data offer better quality with hourly
    resolution (Nouri and Homaee, 2021). However, IRIMO sites are point-based, sparsely
    distributed, and mostly cover plains (Nouri and Homaee, 2021). Although the Soil
    and Water Research Institute (SWRI) surveyed most irrigated soils, the reports
    and maps have a spatial scale mismatch. The sectoral fragmentation and “silo approaches”
    in the water governance structure result from the policy gap (Talebi et al., 2019,
    Vahid and Ranjbar, 2019). As per Iran’s constitution (Article 45) and the Act
    of Fair Distribution of Water, MOE is tasked with regulating water resources,
    granting water rights, and ensuring water delivery to agricultural fields. Meanwhile,
    MOA is responsible for managing field water use. These provisions highlight the
    public ownership of water in Iran, emphasizing that water is regarded as a public
    resource rather than a market commodity or private good (Bidabadi and Afshari,
    2020, Jafari Nadoushan and Shahin, 2019). The MOE and MOA are the primary actors
    in the governance structure, but they are reluctant to communicate or share information
    with other actors (Samadi-Foroushani et al., 2022, Vahid and Ranjbar, 2019). Despite
    the establishment of “the Supreme Water Council”, the institutional fragmentation
    in water management has not been successfully overcome (Mirnezami and Bagheri,
    2017). The unbalanced or insufficient financial mechanisms for water governance
    in Iran have led to a funding gap, hindering effective implementation of responsibilities
    at the subnational level (Mirnezami et al., 2019). The MOE frequently allocates
    financial resources toward water resources development plans, particularly damming
    and water transfer projects (Faramarzi et al., 2010a, Mirnezami et al., 2019,
    Nabavi, 2017). Fig. 5 illustrates a rising trend in total reservoir capacity,
    indicating that the capacity in 2028 is anticipated to reach 73.8 BCM, largely
    surpassing the current volume of surface water (65.5 BCM). Projects of basin water
    transfer aimed at agricultural activities and irrigation expansion are summarized
    in Table 1. After the Iran-Iraq war, MOA focused on funding pressurized irrigation
    infrastructures, leading to the expansion of pressurized irrigation areas from
    2800 ha in 1990–2.2 million hectares in 2021 (Fig. 6). However, this financial
    mechanism inadequately supports important projects that promote users participation,
    environmental flow, or groundwater sustainability (Faramarzi et al., 2010a, Mirnezami
    et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download

    The objective gap in water governance in Iran pertains to the contrasting objectives
    of the actors and stakeholders at different levels (Abedi, 2020, Morid, 2018).
    Agricultural water management planning displays a lack of coherent development,
    leading to disputes and contradictions between MOA, responsible for food security,
    and MOE, responsible for water security (Collins, 2017, Mirnezami and Bagheri,
    2017, Morid, 2018, Sharifinejad et al., 2020). As discussed previously, the high
    dependence on domestic water resources for agricultural purposes poses a risk
    to water security in Iran. This risk highlights the challenging need to reduce
    agricultural water use for an effective water security planning in Iran. There
    are some efforts undertaken to cap water consumption and meet water security.
    For instance, MOE (Water and Wastewater Macro Planning Bureau) announced the maximum
    allowable water withdrawal for different sectors (Soltani et al., 2020). Accordingly,
    agricultural water withdrawal should be decreased to 61.7 BCM, with 31.4 BCM from
    groundwater resources and 30.3 BCM from surface water resources (Soltani et al.,
    2020). The water use-to-availability index would then improve from 0.90 to 0.70
    even after this reduction, thus suggesting that a more substantial decrease in
    consumptive water use is necessary to address the water crisis. Nevertheless,
    food self-sufficiency is not only a sectoral goal of MOA but is also supported
    by the government, parliament, and high-ranking leaders (Collins, 2017, Jamali
    Jaghdani and Kvartiuk, 2021). This objective is designed to mitigate the adverse
    impacts of international sanctions due to political conflicts with the West (Collins,
    2017, Ketabchy, 2021, Mosavi and Esmaeili, 2012). Several plans, including articles
    31, 32, and 33 of the “Fifth Five-Year Development Plan”, and laws, e.g. “Regulation
    of unlicensed wells (2010)”, have been passed to enhance food security through
    self-sufficiency (Jamali Jaghdani and Kvartiuk, 2021, Morid, 2018). However, these
    efforts have inadvertently resulted in an increased consumptive water use (Jamali
    Jaghdani and Kvartiuk, 2021). These plans, portraying an objective gap, have resulted
    in water resources over-exploitation on the pretext of food security, rural development,
    and employment (Jamali Jaghdani and Kvartiuk, 2021, Mirnezami et al., 2019, Mirnezami
    and Bagheri, 2017). The capacity gap is another great challenge for the current
    water governance framework. Moghimi Benhangi et al. (2018), Moghimi Benhangi et
    al. (2020), and Nazemi et al. (2020) remarked that the water governance structure
    in Iran is quite inflexible in terms of coping with new challenges such as climate
    change. They also stated that this inflexible governance system always attempts
    to solve problems using technical-engineering-based approaches known as the “hydraulic
    mission paradigm”. The damming and water transfer projects (Fig. 5 and Table 1)
    vividly reflect this phenomenon. Moghimi Benhangi et al. (2018) analyzed the current
    water governance in Iran using the concept of social learning and found that the
    government and relevant authorities are constrained to single-loop learning. They
    also concluded that the top-down framework emphasizes engineering solutions, e.g.
    water desalination, pressurized irrigation techniques, water transfers, and damming,
    without considering the lessons learned from past failures. The accountability
    gap, caused by insufficient awareness, lack of stakeholder participation, and
    corruption, impedes transparency in decision-making practices (Enteshari and Safavi,
    2020, Mirzaei et al., 2017, Talebi et al., 2019). In addition to the lack of reliable
    and detailed information, the decision-making processes are not transparent in
    the current water governance (Enteshari and Safavi, 2020). In addition, the “revolving
    door” phenomenon leads to the lack of transparency in the roles and responsibilities
    of actors in the administrative and executive bodies (Enteshari and Safavi, 2020,
    Molle and Mamanpoush, 2012). The poor involvement of local stakeholders also contributes
    to the accountability gap in the water governance. Prior to the land reforms in
    1961, rural cooperatives such as Boneh, facilitated the cooperative involvement
    in water governance (Jomehpour, 2009). However, the establishment of new cooperatives
    was unsuccessful in the post-reform era (Ajami, 2021). Efforts have been made
    recently to establish Water User Associations (WUAs) in order to support Irrigation
    Management Transfer (IMT) and Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) (Ghorbanian
    Kerdabadi et al., 2020, Hassan et al., 2007, Omid et al., 2012). However, these
    plans faced challenges caused by policy and capacity gaps, leading to continued
    reliance on a top-down approach (Ghorbanian Kerdabadi et al., 2020, Mirnezami
    et al., 2019, Mirnezami and Bagheri, 2017). 2.3. Inefficient water use Inefficient
    water use has been identified as a contributing factor to water scarcity in various
    regions of the world (Aboelkhair et al., 2019, Jiang, 2009). This inefficiency
    implies that a larger amount of water is required to produce the same agricultural
    output, due to water or non-water limiting factors (Callejas Moncaleano et al.,
    2021). Accommodating both production and water use, physical water productivity
    (WP, the yield per unit of water used) mirrors inefficiency. Through an extensive
    literature review, the WP data were compiled for the main crops grown in various
    regions of Iran. This information was extracted from 25 selected articles (Table
    2), out of a total of 264 articles and reports addressing crop productivity values
    for Iran (Fig. S2 in supplementary material). In order to ensure data accuracy
    and relevance, we applied specific criteria to include certain documents from
    our analysis. The criteria were as follows: Table 2. The range of physical water

    b) Documents not addressing intercropping. c) Documents reporting WP based on
    evapotranspiration. d) Documents estimating WP for a specific crop, not focusing
    on an entire region or irrigation system. By applying these criteria, we aimed
    to focus on reliable and comparable WP data of main crops in Iran. In most cases,
    the average WP lies within the 25th and 50th percentiles of the global range of
    WP proposed by Molden et al. (2010) and Zwart and Bastiaanssen (2004). The average
    WP thus falls below the midrange of the global datasets. The majority of the research
    works given in Table 2 have been carried out in traditional irrigation systems.
    As traditional irrigation methods are prevalent across irrigated lands, the values
    listed in Table 2 are representative of WP in Iran. Some studies have evaluated
    WP under different irrigation systems. For instance, Dehghanisanij et al. (2023a)
    investigated the WP of corn under furrow and drip irrigation systems. They revealed
    that the WP values were 0.31 and 0.90 Kg m-3 for corn under furrow and drip irrigation
    systems, respectively. Dehghanisanij et al. (2023b) also reported WP of 0.91,
    1.47, and 1.70 Kg m-3 for wheat under surface, sprinkler, and drip irrigation
    systems, respectively. These results clearly illustrate a significant improvement
    in WP when transitioning from traditional surface irrigation to pressurized irrigation
    methods. An improved WP has been also reported through the modernization of irrigation
    systems in the related literature (Firouzabadi et al., 2021, Piri, 2018, Seyedan
    et al., 2018, Seyedan and Mottaghi, 2019). In addition to physical water productivity,
    the economic (i.e. US$ per cubic meter of water used) and nutritional water productivity
    (i.e. calories per cubic meter water used) have been suggested to be calculated
    to give a panoramic view of productivity (Molden et al., 2010). However, due to
    the high inflation rate and lack of reliable references on nutritional water productivity,
    we could not provide information on the economic and nutritional water productivity.
    The WP exhibits a quadratic relationship with increasing water supply (Dietzel
    et al., 2016, Pereira et al., 2002). When water supply is significantly restricted,
    providing additional water is expected to improve WP. This is highlighted in low-yielding
    dry-farming areas of Iran, where WP is inherently low due to high level of aridity,
    i.e. high ratio of atmospheric evaporative demand to precipitation (Tavakkoli
    and Oweis, 2004). In this phase, water deficit seems to be the main driving of
    low WP. However, beyond an optimal point, increasing water supply is likely to
    decrease WP in a given condition. In Table 2, we specifically focused on situations
    where water availability is not severely limited and low WP can be attributed
    to inefficient water use. 2.4. Population growth There was an increasing trend
    in the population growth of Iran during the last half a century (Fig. 7). Furthermore,
    Iran’s population is bound to increase from around 82.0 million in 2016 to a range
    of 90.2–102.2 million by 2050 (https://www.amar.org.ir). Therefore, the rising
    trend of the population is foreseen to continue by 2050. Besides severe recent
    droughts, the population growth has decreased the annual renewable water per capita,
    indicating water crowding (Fig. 8). According to the Falkenmark scarcity index
    (Falkenmark et al., 1989), Iran is currently in a state of water stress with total
    annual renewable water per capita ranging from 1000 to 1700 m3 (Fig. 8). Furthermore,
    it is projected that Iran will move towards water scarcity, with less than 1000 m3
    per capita, by 2050 due to climate change-induced droughts and population growth
    (Rijsberman, 2006, Rockström et al., 2009). This is likely to result in more water
    conflicts and also threaten water security in the middle of the current century.

    from https://www.amar.org.ir/). 3. Consequences 3.1. Groundwater over-depletion
    Iran was ranked as the second-largest extractor of groundwater in the world in
    2010 (Dalin et al., 2017), with the groundwater level decreasing by an annual
    average of 360 mm in the recent half a century (Fig. 9a). Approximately 140 billion
    m3 (BCM) of groundwater reserves have been depleted without being sufficiently
    recharged during 1973–2020 (Fig. 9b). The groundwater overuse has resulted in
    water table declines, as evidenced by the increase in prohibited plains from 20
    in 1970–410 out of 609 plains in 2020 (Fig. 9c). The unlicensed wells have also
    increased from 36,000 in 1976–420,000 in 2012 (Nabavi, 2018), indicating that
    interventions to regulate groundwater abstraction are merely encoded in water
    laws. Groundwater overexploitation in Iran can be attributed to the expansion
    of irrigation, as approximately 89% of the groundwater resources are extracted
    for agricultural purposes (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (231KB)

    Fig. 10. Volume (BCM) of groundwater abstracted for use in different sectors.
    (Data Source: Iran Water Resources Management Company). In some central, southern,
    and northeastern basins with hyper-arid, arid, and semi-arid climates, the groundwater
    level has fallen by more than 1.0 m and aquifer water resources have decreased
    by more than 100 million m3 (MCM) in 2020 (Fig. 11a and b). Unsustainable agricultural
    practices, particularly those associated with pistachio production, are the primary
    cause of aquifer exhaustion in the Rafsanjan plain. The groundwater level in this
    plain showed a decreasing trend of approximately 5.5 m per decade, exacerbated
    by the drilling of additional unlicensed wells (Mirnezami et al., 2018). This
    implies that groundwater depletion and quality degradation may occur not to improve
    food security but to yield economic benefits from producing exportable commodities
    such as pistachio. Note that approximately 40% of the pistachio produced in 2016–2021
    were exported, generating more than 1 billion dollars in revenue for the country
    (https://www.maj.ir/page-amar/FA/65/form/pId28998). Download : Download high-res

    groundwater storage MCM, b) groundwater drawdown per meter, c) spatial distribution
    of prohibited and critical prohibited plains in 2020, and d) map of sub-basins
    over Iran (MOE, 2021). (According to the government approval of “the Criteria
    for creating a balance between water supply and use” (https ://rc.majlis.ir/fa/law/show/134432),
    the term “no prohibition” refers to the plains where aquifer recharge exceeds
    groundwater abstraction. On the other hand, the term “prohibited plain” is used
    for plains where the extraction of groundwater exceeds the potential recharge,
    resulting in a continuous decline in the groundwater level without possibility
    of natural sustainability. The term “critical prohibited plain” is also used for
    plains where the groundwater table or the quality of groundwater resources of
    an aquifer consistently experiences a decline). Irrigation expansion may lower
    the quality of groundwater resources via salinization, fertilizer and pesticide
    contamination, and saltwater intrusion (Pereira et al., 2009a). Irrigation expansion
    resulted in both groundwater level decline and quality degradation, leading to
    the declaration of approximately 22% of plains (135 out of 609) as critical prohibited
    areas in 2020 (Fig. 11c). Excessive groundwater drawdown in some of the critical
    prohibited plains has also led to land subsidence, cracking, and collapse, as
    well as the formation of sinkholes (Motagh et al., 2017, Rahmati et al., 2019,
    Salehi Moteahd et al., 2019). 3.2. Quality deterioration of water resources The
    solute leaching, e.g. chlorine (Cl) and sodium (Na), often lead to salinization
    of groundwater, exacerbated by over-irrigation and the use of brackish or wastewater
    (Minhas et al., 2020). This can lead to an increase in electrical conductivity
    (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) of groundwater. In Iran, there are several
    examples of downward leaching of solutes deteriorating groundwater quality, e.g.,
    an increase in Na concentration in Hamedan plain (Jalali, 2009), TDS increase
    in Marand plain (Barzegar et al., 2017), and high concentration of Cl in Malayer
    plain (Jalali and Kolahchi, 2008). Water contamination also occurs due to over-fertilization
    and over-manuring, namely in non-modernized surface irrigation systems (Jalali,
    2006, Jalali, 2007, Jalali, 2009). Jalali (2005) and Jalali (2011) demonstrated
    that several areas in Iran have groundwater nitrate concentrations exceeding 50 mg l-1,
    thus unsuitable for drinking water according to the standards set by the World
    Health Organization (WHO, 2017). Surface water bodies have also been contaminated
    by irrigation and drainage activities (Liu et al., 2021). Discharging agricultural
    runoff and untreated drainage outflows bearing nutrients, such as nitrates and
    phosphates, is the main cause of eutrophication in the Zayandeh-Roud dam reservoir
    (Ziaie et al., 2019), the Dez River (Babaei et al., 2019), the Zaribar Lake (Imani
    et al., 2017), and the Ilam dam reservoir (Shourian et al., 2016). Over-pumping
    from production wells can lead to landward hydraulic gradients and saltwater intrusion
    in coastal aquifers, rendering groundwater resources unsuitable for domestic and
    agricultural purposes (Table 3). Excessive withdrawal in some areas, such as the
    Amol-Ghaemshahr plain and a central Iran aquifer, has resulted in the up-coning
    of paleo underlying saline groundwater, causing deterioration of fresh groundwater
    (Table 3). Mirzavand et al. (2020) also showed that up-coning in the Femenin-Ghahavand
    plain led to soil salinization caused by the use of salinized groundwater for
    irrigation. In addition to over-pumping, further salinization of water resources
    was caused by hydraulic structures implemented to expand irrigated land. A catastrophic
    example is the upper Gotvand dam, which was constructed on a halite-bearing geological
    formation (Gachsaran) and had a highly negative impact on freshwater resources
    (Jahangiry Fard et al., 2019, Jalali et al., 2019). The dam reservoir contains
    water with EC exceeding 3 dS m-1 at mid and large depths (Jalali et al., 2019),
    rendering it unsuitable for irrigation of most crops. The saline water from the
    upper Gotvand reservoir has also affected the quality of water flowing in the
    Karoon River (Fakouri et al., 2019, Jahangiry Fard et al., 2019). Table 3. Saltwater

    on wetlands and riparian life There are 84 internationally important wetlands
    in Iran (Sadeghi and Hazbavi, 2022). Across Iran, 25 wetland sites have been now
    officially designated by the Ramsar Convention covering approximately 1493,281 ha
    (https://www.ramsar.org/wetland/iran-islamic-republic-of). Soleimani (2016) showed
    that 31 wetlands in Iran, 14 of which with international importance, suffer from
    water shortage in different degrees (Table 4). Due to a decline in environmental
    flow, approximately 64% of the 1587,000 ha covered by these 31 wetlands dried
    up in 2012 (Table 4). Table 4. The dried area of wetlands in 2012 (Soleimani,

    and associated hydraulic projects are among the major anthropogenic factors leading
    to wetlands shrinkage in Iran (Gohari et al., 2013, Molle and Mamanpoush, 2012,
    Sadeghi and Hazbavi, 2022, Soleimani, 2016). The Hawizeh Marshes, Bakhtegan–Tashk
    Lakes, Urmia Lake, Gavkhoni swamp, and Jazmurian wetland are a few examples of
    wetlands shrinking due to increased agricultural water demand and related land
    use changes (Ahmadi et al., 2018, Molle and Mamanpoush, 2012, Moshir Panahi et
    al., 2022, Qaderi Nasab and Rahnama, 2019, Vahidipour et al., 2022). Decrease
    in environmental flows has also negatively impacted the health of riparian vegetation
    and life, particularly in dry seasons (Fazelpoor et al., 2021, Morid et al., 2016).
    Shrinkage of wetlands in Iran has also led to devastating environmental consequences,
    such as dust loading, land degradation, desertification, and habitat loss (Rashki
    et al., 2021, Sadeghi and Hazbavi, 2022). 3.4. Water conflicts Water conflicts
    occur when different beneficiaries compete for access to limited water resources
    (Gleick, 1993). The increase in water demand resulting from population growth
    and irrigation expansion exacerbates water conflicts. This is more evident for
    drylands, where precipitation is relatively low and atmospheric evaporative demand
    is high (Mohammadinezhad and Ahmadvand, 2020). Thus, water scarcity and water
    disputes are closely interconnected issues that are inherently linked (Unfried
    et al., 2022). Although water conflicts are mostly peaceful, they have the potential
    to escalate into violent confrontations, acting as the final catalyst that triggers
    dire consequences (De Châtel, 2014). Agricultural water conflicts have intensified
    over the past few decades, leading to tensions among farmers, as well as between
    farmers and canal/system managers or the government (Ganji et al., 2007, Mirnezami
    et al., 2019, Mohammadinezhad and Ahmadvand, 2020). These conflicts sometimes
    escalate to tragic outcomes, including death toll, as evidenced in Kazeroon (2018)
    and Ahwaz (2021) (http://www.worldwater.org/conflict/map/). Administrative and
    objective gaps have led to an increase in the number of stakeholders and limited
    accessibility to freshwater (Section 2.2). Thus, these governance gaps have turned
    water consumption into a contentious competition for limited water resources,
    resulting in social conflicts in Iran (Bijani et al., 2020, Nabavi, 2018, Veisi
    et al., 2020). Moreover, the lack of transparency in water allocation, lack of
    farmer participation, and governmentalization of decisions can lead to water conflicts
    in the absence of critical dialogue (Bijani et al., 2020, Mohammadinezhad and
    Ahmadvand, 2020, Veisi et al., 2020). Agricultural water conflicts are also sprung
    from inequity in water allocation and the sense of loss of water rights owing
    to water transfer from the agricultural sector to the municipal and/or industry
    sectors (Bijani et al., 2020, Mohammadinezhad and Ahmadvand, 2020). Agricultural
    water conflicts can result in a range of adverse consequences in Iran. These consequences
    include farmer migration, land abandonment, reduced employment opportunities in
    the agricultural sector, lack of maintenance leading to infrastructure degradation,
    and farmer resistance to development projects (Bijani et al., 2020, Mirnezami
    et al., 2019, Mohammadinezhad and Ahmadvand, 2020, Molle and Mamanpoush, 2012).
    4. Improvement alternatives 4.1. Governance improvement The Organization for Economic
    Co-operation and Development (OECD) has proposed “effectiveness”, “efficiency”,
    and “trust and engagement” as the three main dimensions of water governance (OECD,
    2015). These dimensions are applicable to all regions and countries, irrespective
    of their level of power centralization or socio-economic conditions. The “effectiveness”
    refers to setting clear objectives and targets of sustainable policy at all levels
    of government, implementing the policy’s goals as well as reaching the targets.
    The “efficiency” dimension addresses maximizing the benefits of sustainable water
    resources management and welfare at the least cost to society. The “trust and
    engagement” dimension includes generating public confidence and mobilizing full
    stakeholders participation via democratic and fair procedures. Each dimension
    covers four principles which have been clearly defined by Akhmouch and Clavreul
    (2016), Akhmouch and Correia (2016), and Akhmouch et al. (2017). This section
    provides a comprehensive discussion of the principles applicable to the case of
    Iran. Detailed suggestions are offered by taking into account the existing governance
    gaps and the possible solutions recommended in the literature. 4.1.1. Effectiveness
    principles 4.1.1.1. Clear roles and responsibilities This refers to clearly allocating
    and distinguishing responsibilities for all governmental and non-governmental
    agencies, including agents and stakeholders, namely WUAs and farmers. Their responsibilities
    should be clearly defined in the water governance system, particularly for those
    at the bottom of the current decision-making pyramid (Hassan et al., 2007, Heydarian,
    2013, Nabiafjadi et al., 2021). Assigning clear roles and responsibilities to
    WUAs and local stakeholders is vital for successful collective actions such as
    Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) and Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT)
    (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007). Hassan et al. (2007) and Heydarian (2013) proposed
    that “clarity on roles, responsibilities, and authority of public sectors” should
    be given paramount attention, particularly for WUAs, as they are the backbone
    of PIM and IMT. 4.1.1.2. Appropriate scales within basin systems This principle
    emphasizes managing water within integrated basin governance systems at suitable
    scales. According to the law on the conversion of provincial water departments
    into regional water companies, the boundaries of water management in Iran are
    provincial, not based on the basin limits (Madani, 2014, Mirnezami and Bagheri,
    2017). Shifting from provincial management to basin-scale management can be viewed
    as an essential prerequisite for addressing the administrative gap in water governance
    structure in Iran. The level of WUAs must also match the scale of farm water management
    as evidenced worldwide (Hu et al., 2014). 4.1.1.3. Policy coherence This is promoted
    by emphasizing effective cross-sectoral coordination. Agricultural water policy-making
    often appears incoherent because of contradictions among food and water security
    policies in Iran (Mirnezami et al., 2019, Morid, 2018). As discussed earlier,
    this disagreement among objectives, commonly referred to as the objective gap,
    stands as the most significant governance gap in Iran. The objective gap also
    widens the funding, capacity, and policy gaps. Coordinating mechanisms across
    the responsible ministries and agencies, in particular MOA and MOE, are needed
    to facilitate coherence between food and water security policies (Islami and Rahimi,
    2019, Mirnezami et al., 2019). In addition, policy-making and related implementation
    processes need transparency and monitoring, as well as measures promoting incentives
    and regulations to settle conflicts arising between MOE and MOA (Mirnezami et
    al., 2019). 4.1.1.4. Capacity This principle focuses on adjusting the capacity
    of governance system to match the complexity of challenges. The farmers are often
    not educated about innovative water-related issues, or are unwilling to actively
    participate in agricultural water management (Savari et al., 2023). Training farmers
    on water scarcity issues is a relevant program to address the capacity gap in
    Iran (Azizi Khalkheili and Zamani, 2009, Savari et al., 2023). This program aims
    to raise awareness, promote water-saving practices, and advocate for drought mitigation
    strategies, all aiming to optimize water use while maximizing productivity (Valizadeh
    et al., 2020, Zobeidi et al., 2021). Moreover, briefing WUAs about their responsibilities
    and roles is of critical importance for collective projects such as PIM and IMT
    (Heydarian, 2013). Hiring water and irrigation experts and professionals based
    on meritocracy can also boost the capacity of government and institutions to solve
    the water crisis (Mirzaei et al., 2019a). Moreover, training staff relative to
    innovative concepts and practices is a paramount capacity building action (Karamouz,
    2008). However, simply training experts may not solve the water crisis in the
    absence of appropriate organizational learning and policies that specifically
    address the current challenges (Heydari and Morid, 2020, Morid, 2018). 4.1.2.
    Efficiency principles 4.1.2.1. Data and information This principle refers to producing
    and sharing reliable water-related data in a participatory manner to bridge the
    information gap. Solving transboundary water disputes between Iran and neighboring
    countries is a good example, since an agreement requires producing and exchanging
    data and information (Mianabadi et al., 2020). As water authorities in Iran act
    as a repository of water data, reviewing, archiving and monitoring are needed
    to elude excessive data collection, and to ensure their quality. Recently, MOE
    has established a web-based water dataset (http://wrs.wrm.ir/amar), which may
    be considered as the initial step to improve the efficiency of water governance.
    Reanalysis and satellite retrievals are of much help to fill the information gap
    in Iran, as they produce gridded datasets representing spatially continuous data
    (Nouri, 2023, Nouri et al., 2022a, Nouri and Homaee, 2022, Sheffield et al., 2018).
    In addition, gridded alternate soil data can bridge the information gap and reduce
    the uncertainty of current soil surveys (Hengl et al., 2017). 4.1.2.2. Financing
    This principle ensures the efficient, transparent, and timely allocation of financial
    resources necessary to tackle the funding gap. This factor is essential for water-saving
    and participatory demand-side management projects (Talebi et al., 2019). Heydarian
    (2013) stressed that financial burden is a main obstacle for WUAs to assume their
    responsibility in IMT projects in Iran. Thus, the governance system should provide
    economic incentives for stakeholders of the private sector and individual farmers
    to actively participate in water projects. Since the WUAs’ members spend time
    and money on that participation, they should be financially assisted (Hassan et
    al., 2007). Additionally, it is essential to allocate funds for training and awareness-raising
    programs targeting WUAs and farmers. Such initiatives are crucial for promoting
    participatory water management and ensuring long-term sustainability (Savari et
    al., 2023). Although WUAs may initially be capable of addressing the challenge
    in the short term, persistent disincentives could have a detrimental impact on
    their aspirations and motivation. Therefore, it is crucial to design incentive
    policies that effectively encourage WUAs to enhance agricultural water management
    (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007, Hassan et al., 2007). In this regard, low-interest
    loans and/or small annual grants can serve as effective measures to incentivize
    farmers and WUAs to save water and use water effectively (Garces-Restrepo et al.,
    2007, Hassan et al., 2007, Pereira et al., 2002). 4.1.2.3. Regulatory frameworks
    This ensures effective implementation and enforcement. Regulatory frameworks are
    required to increase water productivity and limit water demand (Zibaei and Akhoond-Ali,
    2017). The lenient and ambiguous penalties for violators have proven insufficient
    in addressing the escalating issues of unlicensed wells, groundwater over-extraction,
    and contamination (Mirnezami et al., 2019, Mirnezami and Bagheri, 2017). Therefore,
    the regulations should be clear, proportionate, non-discriminatory, and capable
    of achieving the objectives outlined in water policies and strategies, with a
    particular emphasis on water-saving (Mirnezami et al., 2018). Moreover, the regulations
    must be designed and implemented in a participatory manner, involving WUAs and
    farmers. 4.1.2.4. Innovative governance A good governance system should draw lessons
    from the failures and successes of pilot and past experiences. This is of high
    importance for the projects of upgrading irrigation infrastructures, in which
    conflicting results have been reported (Batchelor et al., 2014, Grafton et al.,
    2018, Wheeler et al., 2020). In addition, enhancing social learning capacity can
    contribute to the effectiveness of adaptive and innovative water governance (Garces-Restrepo
    et al., 2007, Moghimi Benhangi et al., 2020). In other words, a society can effectively
    address water crisis when it can comprehend historical trends related to water
    resources. 4.1.3. Trust and engagement principles 4.1.3.1. Integrity and transparency
    This factor contributes to solving the accountability gap. There is a need for
    clear mechanisms to diagnose the potential drivers of opacity, corruption, and
    unaccountability within the various levels of the water governance system. Some
    legal and institutional frameworks are also required to ensure the accessibility
    of stakeholders to reliable data and information, rendering decision-makers and
    stakeholders accountable (Enteshari and Safavi, 2020, Mirzaei et al., 2019a).
    4.1.3.2. Stakeholder engagement This principle also helps the governance system
    to fill the accountability gap. Supporting effective and efficient WUAs is of
    vital significance for engaging stakeholders and enforcing the IWRM principles
    (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007). There is no fixed algorithm to follow for forming
    WUAs due to the complexity of rural communities reflected in the diversity of
    landholdings, water rights, irrigation methods, and cropping patterns (Hu et al.,
    2014). However, WUAs formation under unsound governance framework may not be fruitful.
    Therefore, the followings should be addressed prior to WUAs establishment (Abadi,
    2019; Dukhovny et al., 2013; Enteshari and Safavi, 2020; Hu et al., 2014): • The
    role and responsibility of WUAs should be clearly defined and determined. • The
    administrative scale of WUAs should match the scale of local management, so bridging
    the administrative gap. • Farmers should be trained and educated on the importance
    of WUAs, their responsibility, and their participation in addressing water-saving
    issues. • The WUAs should be financially sustainable. • More attention should
    be paid to under-represented actors, e.g. women and the poor. • The WUAs formation
    process should be transparent. Changing attitudes toward stakeholder participation
    on both sides, authorities and farmers, can encourage stakeholder involvement
    for resolving water conflicts (Mirzaei et al., 2019a). The PIM is an attitudinal
    reform to facilitate the involvement of stakeholders in different steps of agricultural
    water management such as planning, designing, decision-making, operation and maintenance,
    and evaluation (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007). The PIM seems to be a prerequisite
    to the official transfer of governance, management, and financing of irrigation
    infrastructure from the governmental authorities to WUAs, known as Irrigation
    Management Transfer (IMT) (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007, Sinclair et al., 2013).
    The PIM has been practiced in some regions in Iran (Azizi Khalkheili and Zamani,
    2009, Omid et al., 2012). Omid et al. (2012) listed the dissatisfaction of farmers
    with the projects, network ineffectiveness, inequitable water distribution, distrust
    of farmers towards decision-makers, and WUAs’ lack of coherency as the problems
    of PIM pilots in Iran. The success of IMT pilot projects definitely requires the
    involvement of farmers and the formation of tiered WUAs. Handing over water management
    to private companies instead of WUAs resulted in ineffectiveness and unsustainability
    of IMT projected in Kermanshah plain. However, transferring management and governance
    to tiered WUAs led to successful IMT in Qazvin (Hassan et al., 2007). 4.1.3.3.
    Trade-offs across users, rural and urban areas, and generations This principle
    encourages water governance frameworks to manage trade-offs among stakeholders,
    areas, and generations. Managing trade-offs has been neglected in the current
    water governance system in Iran (Molle and Mamanpoush, 2012, Nazemi et al., 2020,
    Talebi et al., 2019). For instance, droughts and water shortage impacted the agricultural
    sector more adversely as compared to the domestic, municipal, and industrial sectors
    in the Gavkhoni Basin (Yousefi et al., 2017). Furthermore, within the agricultural
    sector, downstream farmers have suffered more damage than upstream farmers (Ganji
    et al., 2007, Molle and Mamanpoush, 2012, Nikouei and Ward, 2013, Talebi et al.,
    2019). Promotion of non-discriminatory participation of all water users and sectors
    in decision-making processes and co-designing contingency plans with all stakeholders
    appear vital for alleviating agricultural water conflicts in Iran (Bijani et al.,
    2020, Mohammadinezhad and Ahmadvand, 2020). 4.1.3.4. Monitoring and evaluation
    This is crucial for promoting effective decision-making and mitigating unfavorable
    consequences. As an example, the performance of water productivity and saving
    projects should be monitored so as to avoid negative consequences (Grafton et
    al., 2018, Lankford et al., 2020). However, enhancing institutional capacity and
    stakeholder participation is necessary for a reliable monitoring and evaluation
    system and to guide water plans, namely contingency plans (Mirnezami et al., 2019).
    Alternative datasets, such as reanalysis and satellite products, are of much help
    to bridge the information gap and improve monitoring in data-poor regions of Iran
    (Nouri and Homaee, 2021). 4.2. Water productivity enhancement and conservation
    Boosting WP has been proposed as an effective strategy not only to improve water
    use efficiency but also to elude food insecurity under climate change (Fader et
    al., 2013, Pereira et al., 2012). There exists a good potential for increasing
    productivity in Iran since WP of most staple crops is low (Table 2). There is
    a body of methods and techniques to not only augment WP (Table 5), but also to
    improve environmental flow, save water, energy and labor, and permit water reallocation
    (Pereira et al., 2009c, Pereira et al., 2012, Pereira et al., 2002, Rockström
    et al., 2010). However, efforts to improve water productivity and conservation
    may lead to the “rebound effect” or “Jevons’ paradox”, where resource efficiency
    improvement leads to an overall increase in resource consumption (Grafton et al.,
    2018, Perry et al., 2017, Wheeler et al., 2020). Improved water productivity and
    conservation at the individual farm level may not result in overall water savings
    at the basin (Batchelor et al., 2014). The rebound effect can be explained by
    the concept of “scale” (Grafton et al., 2018, Lankford et al., 2020, Linstead,
    2018). Decision-makers aim to enhance WP at the field scale and save water at
    the basin scale. However, increased WP at a farm may lead to decreased return
    flow, expansion of cultivated lands, or a shift in cropping patterns to higher-value
    water-intensive crops, all of which can raise water use (Grafton et al., 2018,
    Wheeler et al., 2020). Improving water governance can help avoid the rebound effect
    as it is more of a governance issue than a technical challenge (Gleick et al.,
    2011, Wheeler et al., 2020). Table 5. Summary on the water productivity and conservation

    et al., 2017, Rockström et al., 2010, Van Opstal et al., 2021) * The purposes
    commonly reported in the literature ** The strategies for irrigated agriculture
    Some water productivity and conservation interventions (WPCs), such as cropping
    pattern optimization, deficit irrigation, upgrading irrigation systems, improving
    soil retention capacity, and optimizing cropping calendars, have been proposed
    in macro-level documents in Iran (Heydari and Morid, 2020, Zarezadeh et al., 2023).
    These policies have been designed to save water, enhance WP, adapt to climate
    change, and combat droughts. The proper implementation of WPCs, however, requires
    several essential prerequisites, including education and training, information
    and awareness, monitoring, financial support, and environmental compatibility
    (Grafton and Wheeler, 2018, Pereira et al., 2009c, Perry et al., 2017, Wheeler
    et al., 2020, Zarezadeh et al., 2023). Key items to be considered by decision-makers
    dealing with water scarcity and low productivity relative to the Iran agricultural
    sector are discussed in the following based on international and national experiences.
    i) Preparation of executable plans. 4.2.1. Defining the “status quo” precisely
    and realistically For this purpose, water accounting at both basin and field scales
    yields invaluable data regarding the potential for reduction of non-beneficial
    consumptive water use (e.g. soil moisture evaporation) and non-recoverable non-consumptive
    water use (e.g. drainage outflow to saline waters) as discussed by Pereira et
    al. (2012). The use of updated information on crop water requirements is also
    greatly recommended (Allen et al., 1998, Pereira et al., 2021). Remote sensing
    techniques and geographic information systems are useful tools to estimate actual
    evapotranspiration, the key component for crop water management and water accounting
    in the context of water-saving (Owens et al., 2022). However, such insights should
    be integrated with participatory actions via WUAs to interpret and use the resulting
    information. 4.2.2. Attempting to bridge the governance gaps The WPCs, particularly
    upgrading irrigation systems, are likely to result in rebound effect under improper
    governance framework (Grafton et al., 2018, Molle and Tanouti, 2017). This has
    been proven in different parts of the world including Iran (Berbel et al., 2014,
    Molle and Tanouti, 2017, Raeisi et al., 2019, Scott et al., 2014, Song et al.,
    2018, Wheeler et al., 2020, Zibaei and Akhoond-Ali, 2017). Three main governance-related
    issues have received much attention for successful water-saving via WPCs. Firstly,
    reliable and sufficient data should be available to implement water accounting
    at different scales (Richter et al., 2017, Wheeler et al., 2020). Secondly, water
    delivery should be metered (Cairns, 2018, Wheeler et al., 2020). Lastly, a well-enforced
    water rights system is crucial for regulating water withdrawals, maintaining flexible
    allocation based on varying availability and demand, and incentivizing right holders
    to reduce consumption and transfer unused rights (Debaere et al., 2014, Dumars
    et al., 2003, Richter et al., 2017). 4.2.3. Delineation of the exact goals and
    exceptions As already noticed, formulating clear policy objectives is a key factor
    for governance effectiveness. The WPCs may have a wide range of benefits (Table
    5) but the major ones should be prioritized (Batchelor et al., 2014). For instance,
    water-saving and environmental flow restoration should be commonly placed at the
    top of the agenda in the regions with prohibited aquifers. ii) Selection of strategies.
    A number of social, cultural, economic, and technical items should be considered,
    highlighting the pivotal importance of WUAs. The willingness of farmers to implement
    is also a crucial factor for selecting WPCs (Perry et al., 2017). Water saving
    and enhanced productivity can be achieved by employing more economical interventions,
    such as mulching, without the need for implementing costly projects (Nouri et
    al., 2019, Perry et al., 2017). Thus, the benefit-to-cost analysis is a main tool
    for policy making at diverse levels (Chai et al., 2015, Perry et al., 2017). Further,
    WPCs in rainfed systems may narrow the yield gap and enhance productivity at a
    lower cost (Rockström et al., 2010, Tadayon and Hosseini, 2022). This is of great
    importance in Iran since the rainfed yield gap is large and there is a good potential
    for increasing green water productivity (Rockström et al., 2009). Supplemental
    irrigation enhances WP in low-yielding dry-farming areas across Iran (Tavakkoli
    and Oweis, 2004). However, this should not add further strain to the already depleted
    water resources. In this context, managing non-water factors, such as adjusting
    sowing date, emerges as an economically viable strategy to boost WP in dry-farming
    areas in Iran without requiring additional precious water resources (Nouri et
    al., 2017, Soltani et al., 2015). It is crucial to underline that water and non-water
    factors contribute equally to improving WP in regions practicing dry-farming across
    the Middle East and North Africa (Rattalino Edreira et al., 2018). iii) Implementation
    of the plans. The WPCs should be tested at a pilot scale, and then be scaled up
    to larger areas after achieving successful results (Hassan et al., 2007, Mirzaei
    et al., 2019a). Since WPCs are recommended to be executed cooperatively, WUAs
    should be at the core of related projects, while education and training programs
    must be performed to brief farmers (Hassan et al., 2007, Hu et al., 2014). For
    irrigation improvement (Table 5), selected measures should be implemented when
    adopting reliable crop irrigation scheduling, optimizing demand delivery, and
    allocating water according to cropping systems (Pereira et al., 2009c). iv) Monitoring.
    Water accounting across different spatiotemporal scales is essential for the regular
    monitoring of WPCs (Grafton et al., 2018, Wheeler et al., 2020). Monitoring results
    display gaps, pitfalls, and uncertainties, and support project redirection to
    objectives. The application of decision support systems for scenario analysis
    is an effective approach for assessing policy effectiveness and identifying potential
    negative consequences (Zarezadeh et al., 2023). The response of stakeholders to
    WPCs should be also monitored to identify the incentives required for success
    (Grafton et al., 2018). Monitoring should identify the incentives and orient decision-makers
    to prioritize control measures, e.g. decreasing irrigated acreage and transitioning
    to less water-dependent activities when a WPC project fails to achieve environmental
    sustainability (Dalin et al., 2015, Deines et al., 2019, Zarezadeh et al., 2023).
    The WUAs are of much help in monitoring and data interpretation. 4.3. Water-food-energy
    nexus (WFEN) optimization The strategies for improving the water condition by
    manipulating the energy and food components of WFEN are complex because changes
    in one component have complex impacts on the others (Sorek et al., 2022, Zhang
    et al., 2022). Subsidizing energy, both fossil fuels and electricity, stimulates
    excessive groundwater extraction, which highlights the current need for appropriate
    energy policies and related price reform (Collins, 2017, Mirzaei et al., 2019b,
    Ravar et al., 2020, Sharifinejad et al., 2020). Good governance principles, particularly
    policy coherence, must be met if policymakers intend to curb agricultural water
    demand via energy price reforms (Jamali Jaghdani and Kvartiuk, 2018, Jamali Jaghdani
    and Kvartiuk, 2021). The failure of the law on “targeted subsidy plan”, passed
    to reduce consumptive water use via energy tariff policy in Iran, clearly shows
    the need for governance improvement prior to WFEN optimization (Jamali Jaghdani
    and Kvartiuk, 2018, Jamali Jaghdani and Kvartiuk, 2021). The agricultural water
    demand can be managed by manipulating the food component of WFEN (El-Gafy et al.,
    2017). Changing cropping pattern based on the nexus approach can be a water-saving
    strategy (El-Gafy et al., 2017; Karandish et al., 2020, Ravar et al., 2020, Sadeghi
    et al., 2020, Samadi-Foroushani et al., 2022, Sharifinejad et al., 2020, Zarezadeh
    et al., 2023). The MOA has long aimed to manage agricultural water use by modifying
    food production and cropping pattern (Bookers Agricultural and Technical Services
    Ltd, Hunting Technical Services Ltd, 1975). Currently, MOA is actively pursuing
    this goal as a crucial strategy to achieve a balance between food security and
    water security, aiming to alleviate the growing water crisis (Mardani Najafabadi
    et al., 2019). It is worth noticing that this intervention needs to consider the
    economic returns of farmers, and the habits and responses of the consumers. Sharifinejad
    et al. (2020) and Ravar et al. (2020) stressed that economic water productivity,
    when considering the full costs of water and yields, can be a reliable index to
    maintain the farmers’ economic benefits. New cropping pattern should be in accordance
    with social and cultural conditions (Ghafoori-Kharanagh et al., 2021, Samadi-Foroushani
    et al., 2022), underlining the importance of WUAs for establishing collective
    cropping pattern. Reducing food waste and loss is also a food-based water-saving
    strategy in the WFEN context (Kibler et al., 2018, Philippidis et al., 2019).
    Shabanali Fami et al. (2019) reviewed a body of literature on the food waste in
    Iran and concluded that 18.5–35% of food produced in Iran is wasted in the entire
    supply chain. This highlights the substantial magnitude of food waste in Iran.
    The largest portion of food loss and waste is attributed to vegetables, primarily
    in farms and storage stages (https://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste/flw-data/en/).
    Karandish et al. (2020) estimated approximately 0.9 million ton waste of wheat,
    rice, and barley production in Iran in 2010. This cereal waste is associated with
    around 2 BCM of water footprint, 27% of which is blue water footprint. Another
    food-related strategy to optimize WFEN is modifying the food diet. Soltani et
    al. (2020) proposed a strategy to decrease the national demand for plant products
    by 17.3 million tons in 2030 without significantly altering the level of per capita
    calorie intake. The proposed strategy involves replacing 30% of red meat with
    chicken meat and 30% of rice with wheat, as well as substituting 30% of chicken
    meat with pulses, along with a 15% reduction in food loss and waste. If high water
    stress cannot be resolved through lowering food waste and loss, diet modification,
    and WPCs, partially sacrificing food self-sufficiency appears inevitable. Soltani
    et al. (2020) projected a decline in the current food self-sufficiency (only for
    plant production) from 83% to a range of 35–69% to improve water security by 2030.
    This implies that increased food import may become unavoidable to meet food and
    water security in Iran. Some economic instruments including water marketing and
    water pricing have been proposed to address the water crisis in Iran (Balali et
    al., 2011, Nikouei and Ward, 2013). However, implementing such interventions under
    weak water governance and lack of required infrastructure, e.g. volumetric water
    distribution system, is likely to be counterproductive (Ghafoori-Kharanagh et
    al., 2021, Jamali Jaghdani and Brümmer, 2016a). Moreover, the socioeconomic condition
    of farmers prevailing in a given area must be well noticed. Momeni et al. (2019)
    stressed that water price adjustment may not render significant effects on agricultural
    water use but increases the cost for farmers under the current unsound governance
    structure. Additionally, despite the existence of spot water markets, formal water
    markets do not exist in Iran due chiefly to legal obstacles (Jamali Jaghdani and
    Brümmer, 2016a). Given their socioeconomic implications, economic instruments
    should be treated with care in Iran (Ghafoori-Kharanagh et al., 2021, Samadi-Foroushani
    et al., 2022), necessitating further discussions and assessments. 5. Concluding
    remarks Water scarcity is a cause célèbre in Iran, needing to be reviewed thoroughly.
    Approximately 3000 documents on water resources management were reviewed with
    a particular focus on the agricultural sector and the water governance in Iran.
    The review concludes that current water management in the agricultural sector
    has resulted in excessive groundwater depletion, deterioration of water quality,
    reduced environmental flows, depletion of wetlands, and water conflicts. To cope
    with water scarcity, several challenges have to be faced, mainly the water governance
    gaps, climate change-induced stresses, and inefficient water use. Looking at the
    future, some major strategies were further addressed focusing on narrowing the
    governance gaps, augmenting water productivity, and water-food-energy nexus optimization.
    The alleviation interventions may, however, backfire in practice under a weak
    water governance structure. Consequently, the improvement of water governance,
    particularly promoting users and stakeholders involvement, is a prerequisite for
    effective water-saving and productivity enhancement. Narrowing the water governance
    gaps needs a holistic improvement of governance across various sectors beyond
    agriculture. It is particularly important to ensure compatibility between agricultural
    and water resource solutions and environmental considerations, such as wetlands
    conservation and the improvement of related ecosystem services. The current study
    highlights that the various solutions cannot be implemented in isolation. Instead,
    they need to be considered collectively, with priorities determined by regional
    issues and societal and environmental conditions. Climate change and the increased
    societal demands pose significant challenges, necessitating the urgent development
    of a societal attitude favoring water saving. This attitudinal shift is crucial
    for supporting the implementation of new policies aimed at addressing the water
    crisis. It is noteworthy that there is no single panacea to solve water bankruptcy
    in Iran. Thus, if the pointed out alternatives are insufficient, other strategies
    such as shifting to less water-intensive businesses should be considered, which
    require rethinking the economic and political paradigms. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: The identification of zones within an agricultural field that respond
    differently to environmental factors and agronomic management is a key requirement
    for the adoption of more precise and sustainable agricultural practices. Several
    approaches based on spatial clustering methods applied to different data sources,
    e.g. yield maps, proximal sensors and soil surveys, have been proposed in the
    last decades. The current availability of a huge amount of free remote sensing
    data allows to apply these approaches to agricultural areas where ground or proximal
    data are not available. However, in order to provide useful agronomic management
    information, it is essential that the zoning obtained by clustering is linked
    to the underlying spatial variability of soil properties. In this work we explore
    the hypothesis that the response of crop vigor to temporal climate variability,
    assessed by remote sensing data time series, selected to correspond to specific
    growth phases and seasonal climate patterns, provides indications on the variability
    of soil properties within agricultural fields, for both herbaceous and tree crops.
    NDVI time-series for 38 years (1984–2021) were obtained for fourteen non-irrigated
    herbaceous and tree crop fields in Central Italy, from multispectral satellites
    data (Landsat 5/7/8, Sentinel 2). The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) was used to classify time series into three climatic classes (dry/normal/wet)
    for five different periods of the growth season, covering the main phenological
    phases. K-means clustering was used to identify patterns of crop growth from climatically
    classified image sets, as well as for all the bulked images for comparison (bulk
    clustering). Clustering results were compared with soil maps obtained from spatialized
    ground data, for soil texture (clay, silt and sand), soil organic matter and available
    soil water (ASW). The agreement between the different clustering results and soil
    maps was assessed by the Adjusted Rand Index. Agreement with soil maps varied
    depending on the field, the phenological phase considered and the soil property
    considered. Climate driven clustering from long, late growth season periods best
    matched soil properties, both for herbaceous and tree crops, despite being based
    on a limited number of images. The clustering from images spanning a longer growth
    period for dry years systematically outpaced the bulk clustering for silt, sand
    and ASW, while the clustering for normal climatic conditions was the best for
    organic matter. The performance of the matching between clustering and soil maps
    increased with soil variability significantly more (P < 0.05) than in the bulk
    clustering (mean slopes respectively 0.468 ± 0.167; 0.113 ± 0.270). The integration
    of the SPEI climatic index into the clustering procedure systematically improved
    the identification of zones with homogeneous soil properties, highlighting that
    a greater attention should be posed to the climate-crop-field interactions when
    using remotely sensed images.

    The ability to quantify the patterns of soil spatial variability within agricultural
    fields accurately, rapidly and at low cost is a key requirement for the implementation
    of advanced farm management practices to optimize the use of limited resources
    such as agricultural inputs (water, energy, and fertilizer), while maximizing
    yield (Castrignanò et al., 2018, Maestrini and Basso, 2018). In the context of
    precision agriculture, partitioning agricultural fields into relatively uniform
    management zones (MZs) is a common approach for addressing spatial variability,
    that allows to apply agricultural inputs depending on site-specific soil and crop
    conditions (Mulla, 2013, Zhang et al., 2002). MZs are sub-units of a field, expected
    to maximize homogeneity in crop response to environmental and agronomic factors
    within the sub-unit, while maximizing heterogeneity among them. Homogeneous applications
    of agricultural inputs to each MZ have been shown to suit crop requirements more
    efficiently than when applying a uniform dose to the whole field (Ge et al., 2011).
    Precision management through MZs has been shown to increase crop yield (Breunig
    et al., 2020), reducing at the same time the environmental impact associated,
    for example, to fertilizer or herbicide applications (Gavioli et al., 2019), as
    compared to conventional uniform field management. Several approaches have been
    proposed to characterize soil spatial pattern, as well as agronomic and yield-limiting
    factors (Nawar et al., 2017), most of which are based on the exploitation of dense
    and multivariate information layers (Dhawale et al., 2014, Saifuzzaman et al.,
    2019). Clustering methods have been proposed to include information layers regarding
    the soil (Ortega and Santibáñez, 2007), topographic maps (Johnson et al., 2003),
    yield maps, data from several seasons (Diker et al., 2004) or a combination of
    these methods (Franzen and Nanna, 2002). The determination of MZs through clustering
    approaches based on remote sensing (RS) data has become increasingly popular (Albornoz
    et al., 2018, Castrignanò et al., 2017, Dhawale et al., 2014, Saifuzzaman et al.,
    2019), thanks to the ease of access of a large amount of up-to-date spatial RS
    information regarding agricultural fields. RS of vegetation alone, or in combination
    with other information layers, such as proximal sensing data, has been widely
    used as stand-alone information to define MZs. Breunig et al. (2020) defined MZs
    starting from aboveground biomass (AGB) estimated via remote sensing. Maestrini
    and Basso (2018) suggested combining RS-based crop information (red-band spectral
    reflectance, NDVI and plant surface temperature) with the use of historical yield
    maps from multiple years. Their results showed that the best predictor of within-field
    spatial variability is the historical yield map for areas with stable productivity
    (high, medium, low) over time, while spatial variability of areas with unstable
    productivity was better predicted by within-season RS images, thus creating an
    operational basis for the definition of MZs. Fontanet et al. (2020) delineated
    MZs based on crop (remotely sensed NDVI time-series) and soil (soil moisture sensor
    measurements) information to support management decisions that considered the
    interactions between crop production, environment, and agronomic operations. Ohana-Levi
    et al. (2019) and Saifuzzaman et al. (2019) combined topographic data, soil information
    (electrical conductivity and bare soil indices) and crop information (satellite
    vegetation indices) to determine MZs. Understanding the drivers of the spatial
    distribution of yield within the ﬁeld is essential to define uniform management
    zones (Schepers et al., 2004). However, in-season measurements are not sufficient
    to fully understand the complex interaction of soil characteristics, weather and
    landscape position that concur in determining crop yield, especially in unstable
    areas (Maestrini and Basso, 2018). Particularly, the weather pattern plays an
    important role in determining yield (Chen et al., 2004). Temperature and precipitation
    patterns during the growing season are capable of explaining a great deal of crop
    yield variability (Moore and Lobell, 2014, Osborne and Wheeler, 2013, Powell and
    Reinhard, 2015, Ray et al., 2015). Relationships between weather and yield depend
    on the interactions between local biophysical conditions and crop management practices
    (Delerce et al., 2016). For example, Basso et al. (2011) insisted that spatial
    variability per se, estimated during a single season, is not sufficient to plan
    fertilization, if weather interactions are not considered. In proposing an optimized
    strategy for wheat fertilization in Southern Italy (Mediterranean climate), the
    authors demonstrated that high yielding zones exposed to low precipitation rates
    may face a reduction in grain yield in case of high nitrogen fertilization. This
    is due to the fact that high nitrogen doses in very vigorous crops may cause the
    use of relatively high water volumes before flowering stage, thus potentially
    limiting water availability in following phenological phases, with consequent
    premature crops senescence and low grain yield. Information relevant for delineating
    sub-units of a field is easy to obtain at the required spatial resolution, from
    free access remote sensing data, e.g. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, in terms of normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is related to green biomass and thus
    to chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI). Therefore, unexpectedly low
    values occurring within part or the whole field may result from nitrogen deficiency,
    but also from other plant stresses, such as water deficit (Wang et al., 2016).
    Despite being easier to obtain than ground data, the limitations of using crop
    vigor indices such as NDVI, to identify stable MZs within cropped fields, also
    persist when multi-temporal and multi-annual time series are considered, and integration
    with ground data is still advised (Marino and Alvino, 2018). Climatic indices
    like the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (Mckee et al., 1993) and the Standardized
    Precipitation-Evapotranspiration index (SPEI) (Vicente-Serrano and Beguería, 2018)
    can be used to classify a cropping season into climate classes. Both indices provide
    a functional definition of drought. SPI and SPEI use long-term weather data (at
    least 30–40 years) of a pre-specified period of the year to quantify, for each
    year, how the selected period is far from the normalized long-term climate average
    of that same period over multiple years, in terms of wetness or dryness. Therefore,
    they may prove useful to categorize NDVI datasets depending on the meteorological
    conditions affecting crop growth, at the time the original multispectral images
    were acquired. In this paper we propose to classify the different parts of each
    growing season occurring for an agricultural field based on a climatic index (SPEI).
    These are used to discriminate years with similar weather pattern (dry, normal,
    wet) and aggregate the corresponding imagery on which to perform multi-temporal
    clustering of RS-derived NDVI maps, as per climate category. This climate-driven
    clustering is proposed to delineate MZs that should be representative of crop
    vigor, accounting for the variation brought in by meteorological conditions. Since
    crop vigor for a given climatic condition depends largely on soil properties,
    it can be used to map field-scale soil heterogeneity. We compared clustering results
    to ground-truth maps of soil texture and available soil water content. The agreement
    between the NDVI clustering of climatically classified images and soil maps is
    quantified and compared to the agreement achieved by a more classical multi-temporal
    NDVI bulk clustering, that does not differentiate growth seasons in terms of weather
    pattern. The objective was thus to investigate if the proposed climate-driven
    clustering could be used to delineate field zones based on the actual spatial
    variability of soil properties of agronomic relevance. 2. Materials and methods
    For this study, 14 agricultural fields were used, 12 with herbaceous crop rotations
    and 2 with trees crops, distributed across two Central Italian regions: Umbria
    and Lazio (Fig. 1). Of the fields 5 were in hilly areas and were sloping or gently
    sloping whereas the others were in flat terrain (Table 1). Multi-temporal datasets
    of images acquired by Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellites acquired during 37 years
    (1984–2021) were gathered and used to compute the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) time series for these fields (details are provided in Section 2.1)
    (Fig. 2). The NDVI time series were pre-processed to improve consistency and remove
    potential outliers (see Section 2.1). Images were filtered to cover the growing
    season only of non-irrigated herbaceous and tree crops (see Section 2.1.1), in
    order to exclude the influence of irrigation on temporal and spatial patterns
    of crop vigor. Meteorological data acquired nearby the monitored fields were collected
    and gap filled (see Section 2.1.2). They were then used to compute the Standardize
    Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) (Vicente-Serrano and Beguería, 2018)
    for periods of different duration, i.e., three and five consecutive months, in
    order to classify growing seasons into three climatic classes: dry, normal and
    wet. Satellite images covering specific phenological phases of the crops were
    thus classified based on the SPEI (see Section 2.1.2). Within-field patterns of
    crop growth were identified by applying a k-means clustering to images of the
    same climatic class. These patterns were compared to those detected by a conventional
    bulk clustering, without considering any climatic classification of the images
    (see Section 2.1.3). Soil texture, soil organic matter and available water content
    maps were obtained from a field survey, followed by spatial analysis and application
    of pedotransfer functions (see Section 2.2). The agreement between spatial patterns
    of plant growth and soil properties was assessed by means of a spatial index (see
    Section 2.2.1). Download : Download high-res image (201KB) Download : Download

    image Fig. 2. Overall data processing workflow. 2.1. Satellite and meteorological
    data processing In order to depict crop responses for the same fields under different
    weather conditions occurring during the crop growth season, we used long term,
    free access imagery, acquired by Landsat 5, 7 and 8 (30 m spatial resolution)
    and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution) satellites. Polygon vector files of the agricultural
    fields borders, extended by a 60 m buffer were used, within the Google Earth Engine
    platform (GEE) (Gorelick et al., 2017), to identify images available for the areas
    of interest. Here, all clear sky images covering the fields and acquired by the
    satellites during the period January 1984 - June 2021 were considered (Table 2).
    The NDVI was computed for each image on the area covering the field. Bands 8 (red)
    and 12 (NIR) were used for Sentinel-2 (S2); bands 3 and 4 for Landsat-5 (L5) and
    for Landsat-7 (L7); bands 4 and 5 for Landsat-8 (L8). The resulting field-specific
    NDVI time-series were downloaded from the GEE platform. All following processing
    was performed in the R statistical environment (R Core Team, 2020). Table 2. Details
    on satellite imagery used in this study. Satellite Starting date Ending date Filter

    multiple images were available for the same field and date only the image with
    the highest spatial resolution and acquired with the most recent satellite was
    kept. The signal from pixels lying along the edges of agricultural fields is likely
    affected by elements other than the crop (such as roads, buildings, dikes, or
    other vegetation types). To avoid their inclusion in the clustering algorithm,
    images were inspected to exclude potential outliers near the borders of the fields.
    For any image, pixels were split in two groups: border pixels lying near the field
    border (less or equal to 30 m for Landsat; less or equal to 10 m for S2), and
    inner pixels. Border pixels whose values exceeded 1.5 times the Inter Quartile
    Range (IQR) of NDVI values of the inner field pixels, were considered outliers
    and were assigned the NA value. A moving window (3 ×3 pixels) was then used to
    iteratively fill the NAs values with the median NDVI value of non-NA pixels in
    the window. This improved the correspondence between clustering and soil maps
    (Section 2.2.1) as compared to clustering in the absence of this pre-processing
    step. To ensure co-registration, images were then resampled (bilinear method)
    to a 5 m resolution (Pascucci et al., 2018), reprojected to the coordinate reference
    system of the corresponding soil map, and finally cropped to its extent. 2.1.1.
    Assembly of NDVI time-series To consider the influence of climate on crop response,
    while reducing the influence of management practices such as irrigation, the images
    were only selected from non-irrigated fields. Considering herbaceous crops, reliable
    data on irrigation practices for long time periods were not available. For this
    reason, we decided to use only images from winter crops, as these are usually
    not irrigated in Central Italy. For any growth season, images acquired between
    the previous November 1st and September 31st were selected. The median NDVI value
    for the field was calculated for each day. A LOESS function was fit to the yearly
    time-series of median NDVI values computed from each image. Local maxima and minima
    of the fitted function were extracted. To select winter crops, only data with
    NDVI maxima occurring between December 1st and May 30th were kept. The local minima
    immediately preceding and following the selected maxima were considered as the
    earliest and latest images representing the winter crop for the current year.
    Other images of the same year were excluded from further processing. Regarding
    tree crops, changes in crop type are likely to occur over several decades, related
    to tree aging and replanting. In this study, crop type changes occurred in both
    the considered fields during the last 20 years. In addition, one of the fields
    was equipped with an irrigation system in recent years (farmer’s communication),
    time from which images do not comply any more with the assumptions of the study.
    This implied that the NDVI time series portraying tree fields were reduced from
    40 years each, to just nine and 12 years. The images considered were those acquired
    between April 1st and September 30th or October 30th, respectively for grapevine
    and olive, as approximately corresponding to their vegetative periods. Finally,
    independent of the crop type, only images containing more than 70% of pixels with
    NDVI equal or higher than 0.7 were considered as representing fields covered by
    the crop and thus kept for further analysis (Pascucci et al., 2018). 2.1.2. Meteorological
    data processing and SPEI calculation Weather data were collected from the historical
    dataset of the hydrographic service of Umbria Region and the Regional Agency for
    Development and Innovation in Agriculture of the Lazio Region (ARSIAL - L′Agenzia
    Regionale per lo Sviluppo e l′Innovazione dell’Agricoltura del Lazio). Daily rainfall,
    minimum and maximum temperatures were collected from one or two of the closest
    weather stations to each field, within a maximum range of 5 km, depending on data
    availability. Some stations were equipped with only a rain gauge. Since meteorological
    monitoring was discontinuous, the Joint Research Center (JRC) dataset Agri4Cast
    Gridded Agro-Meteorological Data in Europe version 3.0 (https://agri4cast.jrc.ec.europa.eu/DataPortal/)
    was used to fill missing values. This dataset provides daily meteorological data
    spatialized from weather stations observations on a 25 × 25 km grid between 1979
    and 2020. Observed (stations) and predicted (JRC) meteorological variables were
    well correlated, respectively with a R2 of 0.64 and 0.61 for 3-months and 5-months
    cumulative rainfall, and with a R2 of 0.97 and 0.90 for daily minimum and maximum
    temperature. This provided a satisfactory fit for the purpose of gap filling,
    considering how these variables and timeframes were used for calculating a climatic
    index, as detailed in Section 2.1.2. This permitted us to obtain a weather dataset
    of at least 41 years (1979 – 2021) for each field. Daily reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) was then calculated from minimum and maximum temperature and extraterrestrial
    radiation obtained from the station latitude, using the Hargreaves – Samani equation
    (Danlu et al., 2020). The climate characterizing each field was synthesized by
    means of the SPEI climatic index (Vicente-Serrano and Beguería, 2018), for periods
    of 3 and 5 months covering specific phenological phases, as detailed hereafter.
    The SPEI index (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) is calculated
    from rainfall and reference evapotranspiration of the considered period, comparing
    them to their long-term (> 30 years) values, resulting in a functional definition
    of drought. Calculations were performed using the “SPEI” R package (Beguería and
    Vicente-Serrano, 2018), obtaining a 3-months and a 5-months SPEI time-series for
    each field. To climatically characterize different phases of crop development
    in a field, we considered SPEI values for 3 shorter and 2 longer crop growth periods,
    using the 3-months and 5-months SPEI time-series respectively. For herbaceous
    crops, the short periods roughly correspond to the following developmental phases:
    a) the period around crop emergence, i.e. from November to January included (coded
    as SW1h, i.e. for short-winter-herbaceous); b) the maximum LAI development period,
    i.e. from January to March (SW2h); and c) the period around flowering and grain
    filling, i.e. from March to May (SSh, short-spring). The longer periods correspond
    to longer parts of the crop growth season: the five months from November to March
    (LW, long-winter) and from January to May (LSh, long-spring-herbaceous). For tree
    crops, the short periods correspond to: a) budburst from January to March (SWt);
    b) early leaf development, i.e. from March to May (SSt); and c) the warmest summer
    period during yield formation, from June to August (SSmt, short-summer). Long
    periods for tree crops were: a) from release of dormancy to leaf development,
    i.e. from January to May (LSt1) and b) most of the vegetative period, i.e. from
    April to August (LSt2). SPEI time-series values for the above periods were then
    classified as corresponding to: dry periods with SPEI less than − 1; normal periods
    with SPEI comprised between − 1 and 1; wet periods with SPEI higher than 1. Such
    a classification was preferred to the usual eight classes employed for SPEI (Mckee
    et al., 1993), as it provided a higher number of images per field to each class,
    while reducing the number of classes and thus simplifying data analysis. Subsequently,
    the images acquired during each one of the periods, were classified accordingly,
    as occurring during dry, normal or wet weather conditions. The classification
    resulted in fifteen, partly overlapping, climatic periods for each field, given
    by the combination of five (three shorter and two longer) periods of the year
    and three SPEI classes. 2.1.3. Spatial clustering of agricultural fields Prior
    to calculating clustering, temporal comparability of NDVI data from the same field
    was enhanced by applying a Z-score spatial normalization. This returned images
    with the same standard deviation and zero mean (Pascucci et al., 2018). To identify
    spatial patterns of plants vigor, we applied a k-means (k = 3) clustering to each
    time series of images obtained after climatic classification, hereafter called
    climate-based clustering. As a comparison, we also applied the k-means to the
    whole set of images available for each field, without climatic distinction, hereafter
    called bulk clustering. This produced up to sixteen clustering results for each
    field, depending on the availability of images for each combination period and
    climatic class. Clustering results were represented as maps of the fields, split
    into three classes. For visualization reasons, an order was given to the classes,
    so that zones with a high/intermediate/low median NDVI would be represented by
    the same color in all maps resulting from clustering. 2.2. Comparison of clustering
    spatial patterns to field soil maps To test whether the spatial patterns identified
    by the different clustering procedures corresponded to underlying soil properties,
    we derived soil property maps for silt, clay, soil organic matter (SOM) and available
    soil water (ASW) for each field. These were then classified into three classes
    and compared with the results of the clustering previously computed from the NDVI
    time-series images. SOM and soil texture maps (clay, sand and silt) were generated
    from soil sampling data, spatial covariates and spatial predictions. A total of
    5–24 soil samples were collected in each field in 2019, each being a composite
    of three or more samples collected within a 2 m radius of a georeferenced sampling
    point, using an Ejkelkamp auger in the 0–40 cm depth layer. Samples were analyzed
    in the laboratory to determine clay, silt and sand using the pipette method according
    to the USDA textural thresholds, and SOM content using the Walkley-Black method.
    Spatial covariates included apparent electrical resistivity maps, Digital Elevation
    Models (DEMs) and the Bare Soil Index (BSI) (Chen et al., 2004, Mzid et al., 2021),
    the latter obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite images (Table 1). Resistivity maps
    were obtained for some of the fields by means of an Electro Magnetic Agro-Scanner
    (EMAS) system (SOING, Livorno, Italy) (McBratney et al., 2005). This is an electromagnetic
    induction (EMI) sensor, that provided measurements of the apparent electrical
    resistivity for three soil depth layers. In the present work, the 0–50 cm layer
    was used. The DEMs (spatial resolution of 1 m) were obtained from LiDAR data and
    were downloaded from the geoportal of the Italian Ministry of the Environment
    and Territory (http://www.pcn.minambiente.it/viewer/). The use of DEM as covariate
    was limited to non-flat fields. Additionally, the BSI was used as covariate. We
    calculated the BSI from Sentinel-2 imagery, acquired after the harvest and before
    the following crop’s emergence on each field, so that only bare soil or crop residues
    were visible. The covariates used for each field are reported in Table 1. Soil
    prediction models were built to spatialize sand, silt, clay and organic matter
    sampling points to the whole fields, by exploiting the above-mentioned covariates.
    Either Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Regression Kriging (RK) or Block Kriging
    (BK) (Malone et al., 2017) were used, depending on the available covariates and
    the number of soil samples (Table 1). BK was used where an intensive soil sampling
    had been carried out (such as for the fields in the Maccarese area), using a block
    size resolution of 10 m. MLR and RK were employed for the fusion of remotely sensed
    and geo-physical data, the first when only a few soil samples were available (N = 5),
    while the second for fields with a higher number of samples. Model performances
    were evaluated by means of cross-validation, assessing the coefficient of determination
    (R2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Soil water content at permanent wilting
    point and at field capacity were estimated from soil properties (silt, clay and
    organic matter) using pedotransfer functions (Saxton and Rawls, 2006). Their difference
    provided an estimate of the maximum plant available soil water (ASW). 2.2.1. Assessment
    of the matching of NDVI clusterings with soil maps Soil properties maps were first
    classified by means of k-means clustering (k = 3). The soil classes resulting
    from clustering soil maps were ordered to represent high/intermediate/low soil
    property values with the same colors, as for the zones identified by the NDVI
    clustering (Section 2.1.3). The agreement between the clustering on soil properties
    maps and on the normalized NDVI time series was evaluated by means of the Adjusted
    Rand Index (ARI) (Albatineh et al., 2006, Heil et al., 2019). ARI indicates the
    degree by which couples of pixels, either belonging to the same or to different
    classes in a map, do the same in the companion map. It takes a value near to zero
    for correspondence of random sets, and a value of one for full correspondence,
    with increasing values for increasing similarity between the maps. The clustering
    procedure is meant to identify soil property classes, especially when soil presents
    relatively large variability. In our case, clustering performance varied considerably
    both across and within clustering parameter sets. To elucidate whether clustering
    performances in matching soil property maps were affected by soil heterogeneity
    of the different soil properties, we assessed the linear relationships between
    heterogeneity (expressed by the coefficient of variation) in soil properties and
    the correspondence (in terms of ARI) between the NDVI series and each soil property
    map. A comparison of the slopes of linear relationships was then used to assess
    the different sensitivity (paired t-tests) to soil heterogeneity of the best performing
    climatic clustering in respect to the bulk clustering. 3. Results The number of
    NDVI images selected according to the criteria defined above and thus available
    for the following clustering procedure, strongly depended on the occurrence of
    rather specific weather conditions (Supplementary Table 1). Especially for the
    short-early season (e.g. SPEI SW1h) sometimes no images were available, because
    particularly dry and wet years according to the SPEI classification did not occur,
    and thus clustering could not be performed. This occurred for example for the
    Bertoldo field (Fig. 3) for which no results were available for SW1h. This is
    likely due to the cloudy sky and low vegetation vigor in winter, since when field
    images had less than 70% of pixels with NDVI higher than 0.7 they were discarded,
    in addition to fewer years with particularly dry or wet seasons in respect to
    normal ones. From Fig. 3 it appears clearly that bulk clustering (Figs. 3b to
    3f) and many of the climate-based clustering results did not match what was observed
    from ground soil mapping data (Fig. 3a), i.e. identified a reversed pattern in
    terms of high or medium soil AWC. However, the clustering carried out considering
    only NDVI images occurring during dry seasons, covering the period from January
    to May (LSh), was able to identify the correct AWC pattern (Fig. 3j) and had an
    ARI value of 0.128, the highest among all clustering results. Download : Download

    The Available Soil Water (ASW) map obtained from clustering of ground data is
    reported for comparison (A). Maps (B) to (F) were obtained by bulk clustering
    (all NDVI images); maps (G) to (J) from clustering only images from dry years;
    maps from (K) to (N) only from images from normal weather years; maps (O) to (R)
    from images from wet years. Rows indicate clustering time span: see text for code
    meaning. Below each map are reported the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and the number
    of images used for the clustering. In general, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI),
    used for comparing clustering results to soil maps, showed a remarkable variability
    across agricultural fields for all soil properties. A higher median ARI value
    was often associated with a larger variability (Fig. 4). The mean ARI for arable
    fields covered by herbaceous species, varied depending on the soil property considered,
    with the highest ARI values for sand (min = 0.027, max = 0.165, mean = 0.093),
    then clay (0.024, 0.116, 0.087), ASW (0.022, 0.120, 0.080), organic matter (0.036,
    0.112, 0.076) and silt (0.030, 0.128, 0.071) (Fig. 4, Table 3). For clay, bulk
    clustering obtained better results than climate-based clustering, for all phenological
    phases. However, for all other soil properties, climate-based clustering was consistently
    better than bulk clustering, when performed over long spring periods (LSh). Bulk
    clustering obtained higher ARI values than most climate-based early season clustering
    (SW1h, SW2h and LW). The clustering obtained over the short spring period (SSh),
    i.e. from March to May, had ARI values similar or lower than the bulk clustering
    for dry seasons, and generally similar or even higher for wet seasons, except
    for ASW. The clustering that best matched soil maps, both for sand, silt and ASW,
    was based on images acquired during the long spings (LSh) in dry years (Table
    3). Considering the match with clay maps, the wet LW clustering gave a slightly
    better score than the LSh (0.117 vs 0.112), but with much larger variability (respectively
    CV = 139% vs 80%) (Table 3). Considering organic matter, its best mean score was
    obtained once again by a long spring clustering (LSh), but under normal climatic

    field dependent, with some fields obtaining a relatively short range of ARI values
    (e.g. Biavati), no matter the clustering parameter set, while others (e.g. Tamburini)
    achieving a wider distribution. The variability across fields is shown in Fig.
    5 for ASW. Climate-based clustering results obtained higher ARI values, i.e. matched
    better the ground truth ASW maps, than bulk clustering for all fields. Despite
    the highest mean values presented by the LSh dry clustering, other late season
    climate clusterings often obtained the best matches with soil maps in individual
    fields (Fig. 5). The number of images available for each clustering spanned across
    two orders of magnitude, depending on the clustering parameters set. Nonetheless,
    clustering parameter sets with the highest number of images never obtained the
    best match, which was generally obtained by clusterings based on 25 images ore

    to the individual clustering. The limited number of years for which NDVI time-series
    were available for tree crops made it impossible to obtain most of the dry climate
    clusterings (only except the SSt), and limited the variety of wet climate clusterings.
    However, except for organic matter for the olive field (Zuccari), climate-based
    clustering always provided better correspondence with soil maps than the bulk
    clustering. In particular, the period from April to August (LSt2), for wet years,
    gave the best results for the vineyard (Bennicelli) for all soil properties except
    for silt. The same type of climate-based clustering was not available for the
    olive field (Zuccari), for which the shorter summer period, i.e. June to August
    (SSmt), for normal years provided the best correspondence, except for organic
    matter. Similarly to what observed for fields covered by arable crops, also in
    this case the highest scores were more related to the specific soil parameter
    than to a higher number of images. Considering all the fields, both covered by
    arable and tree crops, in general the climate-based clustering that best matched
    soil maps was the one based on the weather pattern occurring in late season, for
    longer periods (LSh and LSt2). In the case of herbaceous species, the relatively
    higher number of available fields allows to investigate whether the mean best
    match, obtained by the LSh clustering in dry years, is due to some particularly
    high scoring field, or to a more general good agreement with soil maps. For this
    reason, results of the dry years LSh climate-based clustering are presented field-wise,
    in comparison to the bulk clustering in Fig. 7. ARI of the dry LSh clustering
    was systematically higher in respect to the bulk clustering for almost all fields
    for silt, sand and ASW, whereas it provided results similar or alternately better
    and worse, depending on the field, for clay and organic matter (Fig. 7). As mentioned
    above, the best results for soil organic matter were obtained by the long spring
    clustering (LSh), based on normal climate years, which outpaced the bulk clustering
    on nine fields out of twelve (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (341KB)

    depending on the field, even for the best scoring seasonal clustering, we questioned
    whether some characteristics of the fields may be related to better or worse results.
    Inspection of the correlation between the clustering scores (ARI) obtained for
    the different soil properties and some soil properties statistics (mean, skewness
    and coefficient of variation), indicated that the coefficient of variation (CV)
    was the metric with the highest correlation values with ARI. In particular, ARI
    values obtained by the LSh clustering for dry years presented a higher number
    of significant correlations (n = 5) than the bulk clustering (n = 3). Besides
    any specific significant threshold, the slopes of the relationships between the
    variability in soil properties and ARI (Fig. 9), were significantly higher (P < 0.05)
    for the LSh clustering in dry years (0.468 ± 0.167) than for the bulk clustering
    (0.113 ± 0.270), indicating a higher sensitivity of the climate-based clustering
    in matching soil properties, when these are highly variable. In greater detail,
    while relationships with similar slopes were obtained for clay and ASW, a higher
    sensitivity was present for silt, sand and organic matter. Download : Download

    4. Discussion The need to improve the efficiency of agricultural management, by
    adoption of site-specific agronomic practices, has been constrained by the lack
    of information on the actual soil properties patterns occurring within agricultural
    fields. A very widespread precision agriculture approach is that of subdividing
    fields into smaller sub-units, sometimes called uniform management zones (MZ),
    which are considered to have a rather more homogeneous response to environmental
    and agronomic factors, as compared to the whole field (Nawar et al., 2017). Naturally,
    this more homogeneous response of MZs depends largely on the homogeneity of the
    underlying soil properties. Several methods based on the analysis of multi-temporal
    remote sensing imagery have been proposed for zoning agricultural fields and identifying
    the patterns of soil spatial variability. These include those based solely on
    remote sensing data (e.g. Blasch et al., 2015; Pascucci et al., 2018), as well
    as those including other co-variates such as topography, proximal sensing geophysical
    data, soil sampling and yield maps (e.g. Khosla et al., 2008; Miao et al., 2018;
    Scudiero et al., 2018), or plant structural properties in interaction with climate,
    such as LAI and evapotranspiration (Ohana-Levi et al., 2021, Shuai and Basso,
    2022). The results of different zoning procedures obtained for one field from
    different approaches tend to differ, depending not only on the data source, but
    also on the clustering method used (Pascucci et al., 2018). From the perspective
    of the user, it is important to know how the different sub-areas of the field,
    or MZs, will respond in different years characterized by contrasting weather patterns.
    Maestrini and Basso (2018) observed that temporally stable or unstable yielding
    zones of agricultural fields, across years, are characterized by different topographic
    wetness indices. Areas characterized by a low topographic wetness index (proxy
    for areas with probability of lower water content) always perform poorly (low
    and stable yield), whereas mid-high wetness index areas have high and stable yield.
    Unstable areas are those with a very high wetness index, corresponding to depression
    areas, waterlogged and poorly yielding in wet years, but high yielding in dry
    years. These authors emphasize the need for a different management approach, respectively
    strategic or tactical, for stable and unstable yielding areas of a field. To our
    knowledge, the present study is the first attempt of exploiting the use of climatic
    indices, together with multi-spectral indices of crop vigor, to improve the identification
    of soil property zones. The main hypothesis of the proposed method is that a specific
    seasonal weather pattern may exacerbate the differences in suitability for crop
    growth, and thus plant response, resulting from the different soil conditions
    present within a field. The higher correspondence between multiple climate-based
    clusterings and soil maps, in respect to the bulk clustering, confirms the soundness
    of this hypothesis. The assessment of the climate-based clusterings obtained by
    different parameters sets showed that several of them outpaced the conventional
    bulk clustering (Table 3), in both herbaceous and tree crop fields (Fig. 4, Fig.
    5, Fig. 6). In addition, the deeper analysis on the best scoring climate-based
    clustering on herbaceous fields (Fig. 7, Fig. 8) showed that this performed consistently
    better than the bulk clustering in almost all analyzed fields, especially for
    silt, sand and ASW. In short, our results demonstrate that climatic criteria are
    appropriate to improve filtering of RS imagery for the identification of MZ. We
    highlighted that the clustering parameter set had a far larger influence in matching
    soil properties, than the number of images contributing to the clustering (Fig.
    5, Fig. 6). Improvements in matching soil properties cannot come mostly from increasing
    the size of the acquired RS dataset, but should be based on a greater attention
    to the climate-crop-field interactions, leading a thoughtful process of image
    selection. The aim of a clustering is to find the differences present in a field,
    especially where these are major. In this respect, it is important to stress that
    the climate-based LSh clustering for dry years seemed to be more sensitive to
    soil variability than the bulk clustering (Fig. 9), increasing in accuracy where
    most needed, namely in fields with more heterogeneous soil properties. This property
    is fundamental, as it implies a higher probability to correctly identify soil
    classes where higher heterogeneity is present, and therefore distinction is needed.
    The most effective climate for selecting appropriate imagery was the dry one for
    herbaceous species. In a dry climate, the evapotranspiration demand is high in
    respect to precipitation, likely determining water limiting conditions for the
    plants. Considering the increases in the evapotranspiration demand and relative
    imbalance with precipitations due to global warming (Lionello and Scarascia, 2018)
    it is likely that image selections driven by climate criteria may become increasingly
    effective in identifying homogeneous soil zones over time. As a second hypothesis,
    a crop was thought to immediately respond (as portrayed by instantaneous NDVI
    snapshots) to a given climate, thus permitting to split the images acquired during
    a single crop growth cycle into multiple groups, each one reflecting plant responses
    possibly to contrasting climates. As an example, a field characterized by sandy
    and clay soil zones may show high differences in plants growth across zones after
    a water deficient early season period, but may recover after a subsequent wet
    late season. Our results do not contradict the validity of this hypothesis but,
    by obtaining better results for longer climatic periods, they suggest that the
    cumulative effects of climate on plant development over long periods are more
    effective for identifying subtending soil zones than shorter term effects of possibly
    more extreme climates. The effects of a given weather on plants may be somewhat
    delayed, especially for deep rooted plants such as perennials, and for drought
    tolerant species (such as grapevine and olive). An assessment of this delay would
    need to be made before introducing such a feature into the selection of imagery.
    The presented method classifies climate and images of the crop based on fixed
    periods: this implies cutting off images outside pre-defined dates. Considering
    that the dates of a plant growth cycle vary from year to year, and that clusterings
    based on long climatic periods performed best, we suggest that future development
    of a climate-based clustering should include image selection based on dynamic
    dates, following phenological development. This would allow to more closely follow
    the crop growth cycle, and the cumulative effects of weather on plant development.
    The limited number of available fields may have restricted the power of our analysis,
    indeed our tests were run for a total of 14 fields, 12 of which with herbaceous
    and two with tree crops. Despite the first results for the case of tree crops
    are promising, a larger number of sample fields occupied by the same tree species
    for a long time would likely allow to draw more solid conclusions on best clustering
    parameters sets for tree crops as well. In addition, any pixel from the considered
    satellites may contain signals from multiple rows and inter-rows, so that the
    proposed method cannot discriminate between adjacent plants. As such, it should
    be considered that, when applied to tree crops, this method assesses an average
    vegetation vigor, integrating both the target tree species and herbaceous species
    possibly present around the trees, both responding to the soil conditions. In
    addition, the derived NDVI values may underestimate the differences between high
    and low vigor plants when images are acquired soon after mowing or tree summer
    pruning. Further, also in the case of herbaceous fields, soil maps based on a
    higher number of sampling points, would lower the effects of random errors, thus
    increasing the power of the analysis. 5. Conclusions This is, to the authors knowledge,
    the first soil zoning study based on clustering remote sensing imagery, in which
    the identification of management zones in agricultural fields is improved by integrating
    a climatic index among the image selection criteria. Our analysis on NDVI time-series
    revealed that, both the climatic conditions occurring in the field during image
    acquisition and the considered crop growth period play a major role in the ability
    of a clustering algorithm to identify soil property zones. In particular, using
    time-series from long, dry and wet, late growth season periods significantly increased
    the ability to identify homogeneous soil zones, in respect to the absence of climatic
    criteria, both in herbaceous and tree crop fields, and consistently across most
    of them. Further, the method showed to be significantly more sensitive to soil
    heterogeneity, in respect to the reference bulk clustering, thus better identifying
    management zones in fields where a proper soil zoning is most needed. This study
    highlights that considering the climate-crop-field interactions is crucial to
    increase the accuracy in the identification of management zones in agricultural
    fields. The proposed method is likely to improve its performance over time, when
    applied to the increasingly water stressed crops undergoing the exacerbated climatic
    extremes imposed by global warming. CRediT authorship contribution statement Francesco

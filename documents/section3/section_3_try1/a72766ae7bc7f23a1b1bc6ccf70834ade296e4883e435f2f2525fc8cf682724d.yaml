    Abstract Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based smart irrigation solutions rely on
    sensors for data reporting, a central infrastructure for generating irrigation
    parameters and a mobile machinery called Linear for irrigating. In this scenario,
    change in soil and environmental properties is referred as an event. Spatial distribution
    of such properties leads to multiple event regions in farmland. Identifying Boundary
    Nodes (BNs) of an event region is a well investigated problem in WSN, however,
    data reporting from BNs that caters to application specific requirements have
    rarely studied. To this end, an energy efficient data harvesting protocol for
    smart irrigation is designed that integrates three modules. First, to reduce number
    of source nodes and hence, energy consumption, a distributed Representative Node
    (RN) selection mechanism is proposed to identify a subset of BNs as the source
    nodes. Information from these RNs ensures correct actions even when nodes of more
    than two event regions lie nearby that is not achieved by existing RN selection
    mechanisms. Second, stop time of Linear must be adequate to collect data from
    RNs for ensuring proper actions. However, existing mechanisms limit to optimizing
    network lifetime. Calculation of data collection dependent stop time of Linear
    without having any information of RNs is proposed. Third, Reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme is proposed that uses single message transmission by a node for Linear
    location information dissemination. Results indicate that at least 58% of BNs
    are required for accurate region construction and overall, 12% to 56% less energy
    is consumed in the data harvesting process. Similar content being viewed by others

    © 2023 Wireless Sensor Network Fault Detection and Isolation for Smart Irrigation
    Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction Smart irrigation or Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)
    is an emerging technique for precision agriculture where an area is irrigated
    according to its requirement. A field is divided into smaller sub-regions (event
    regions) of varying water requirement subject to soil texture, topography, crop,
    and environmental parameters. These event regions are called Management Zones
    (MZs). In traditional VRI setup, an irrigation machinery called Linear is guided
    by Base Station (BS) to move on a predefined linear path and irrigate the field.
    To generate control actions for irrigation, BS collects data from sensors in two
    ways. First, sensors send data to BS (placed outside the farmland) via multi-hop
    in flat [1, 2] or clustered architecture [3]. Second, data is collected from the
    nodes deployed in MZs of farmland having similar soil properties and irrigation
    requirement [4, 5]. These arrangements suffer from high energy consumption in
    data transmission from sensor nodes to BS for community agriculture where a large
    farmland is to be irrigated. Moreover, studies from agronomy [6] report the need
    of dynamic identification of MZs for monitoring purpose. MZs are spatio-temporally
    varying. To make the information regarding this change available near real-time
    at the Linear, is a key challenge. To accomplish this, Boundary Nodes (BNs) and
    non-BNs of MZ are marked in distributed fashion in our previous work [7]. The
    next step is to send information of BNs to Linear for generation of actions. Hence,
    the proposed work investigates the challenges of data harvesting from BNs of MZs.
    We assume that BS is mounted on Linear that stops at on-the-go identified locations,
    collects data from BNs, generates control actions and irrigates field while moving.
    In this work we intend to explore following research questions: Can a subset of
    BNs be identified as source nodes without loss of information of the event region
    boundary? How can stop time of Linear at a location be calculated at BS without
    any information of BNs? How does a Linear disseminate its location information
    with reduced network traffic and how a path is constructed from BNs to Linear?
    Will partial event region information be able to facilitate required action? What
    are the other applications where similar problem of data harvesting from BNs exists?
    Fig. 1 Data collection from a small region (Source: http://www.valleyirrigation.com)
    Full size image Figure 1 presents a scenario of data collection from BNs. A large
    irrigating machinery called Linear is guided by BS to move on a predefined linear
    path and irrigate the field. Linear moves at a low speed (\\(\\approx 2 m/s\\))
    or stops at some locations depending on the control action generated by BS. Data
    from the sensor nodes in a small region in front of Linear is collected at the
    BS, which then controls the sprinklers (actuators) mounted on Linear accordingly.
    For example, in Fig. 1, Linear is at position A and irrigating the region around
    it. The next region to be irrigated is B (enclosed by red line). Therefore, the
    information from sensors deployed in the shaded region must be delivered before
    Linear moves from position A and enters region B. Region B may consist of more
    than one event regions (sub regions of different irrigation requirements). Partial
    boundary information of all the sub regions facilitate irrigation schedule for
    region B. If all BNs send data to BS, the boundary information received at BS
    will be correct and proper actuation is ensured. However, if the number of BNs
    is large in a sub-region, network traffic increases. So, to reduce network traffic,
    the proposed work identifies a minimal set of BNs as sources laying in an event
    region. The minimal set must be selected such that the information from identified
    nodes suffice for the decision at BS. The nodes belonging to such minimal set
    are called Representative Nodes (RNs). Information from these nodes are sufficient
    to construct event boundary at BS. To demonstrate the impact of reducing BNs and
    hence, loss of information at BS, concept of event region map construction is
    introduced. Event region map is the virtual boundary of event regions created
    at BS from the position and data information of RNs. An example scenario (see
    Fig. 2a) consists of three event regions (MZs) A, B, and C where BNs 1–10 form
    boundary of A, 11–15 and 16–22 are the BNs of B and C, respectively. Suppose the
    RNs for construction of the event regions A, B, and C are \\(\\{2, 4, 6, 7, 10\\}\\),
    \\(\\{12, 13, 15\\}\\), and \\(\\{16, 17, 19, 21\\}\\), respectively. The coarsely
    constructed local map at BS from the information of these RNs, is shown in Fig.
    2b. Exclusion of any of these nodes will result in incorrect event region map
    and addition of other BNs to the set of RNs will fine grain the coarsely constructed
    boundary, however, increase the energy consumption. Thus, a trade-off between
    network traffic and information loss is to be maintained. Fig. 2 Minimal set of
    BNs Full size image Construction of event region map is limited to our work and
    actual decision making process depends on the algorithm running on BS. This work
    identifies a minimal set BNs as sources and explores the challenges of mobility
    assisted data collection (as explained with the help of Fig. 1). These challenges
    are application specific and vary from application to application. For example,
    in enemy troop detection [8], where soldiers move in their own area of surveillance,
    if there are some intruders, it becomes important to be aware of the area ahead
    of the troop. The problem is same to that of VRI, however, precise boundary information
    is required for this application. In automated brooding systems (chick, quail,
    goose, ducks) [9], temperature and humidity sensors are deployed to report different
    temperature zones. The problem of local map construction is similar to VRI, however,
    network of sensors is three dimensional. Thus, for enemy detection and livestock
    monitoring, the proposed scheme must be modified according to the challenges posed
    by specific scenario. This work takes VRI as use case and investigates the challenges
    of energy efficient data collection for reconstruction of event region map at
    Linear. Having discussed the application specific scenario and the other application
    where the problem may find its place, the essential features of the problem considered
    in the work are presented as follows: To minimize the traffic and energy consumption,
    a minimal set BNs known as RN is identified in such a way that correct actions
    are ensured at BS using the information of these nodes. Fig. 3 Taxonomy of data
    harvesting schemes in WSAN/WSN. Deploying Linear as a data harvesting and processing
    infrastructure for smart irrigation is proposed for the first time in this work
    to the best of our knowledge. This taxonomy presents existing mobility assisted
    data harvesting techniques Full size image Considering the RNs are identified
    through a distributed scheme, another challenge is posed by data acquisition from
    these RNs. Linear stops at some locations and collects data from the BNs laying
    in sub-region ahead, constructs a local view of the sub-region and generates control
    actions. In this context, the stop time of Linear must be adequate to collect
    data from all RNs. Inadequate stop time can result into insufficient information
    from RNs leading to inaccurate event decision at Linear. Hence, a data collection
    dependent stop time of Linear at a location is proposed. Moreover, to reduce energy
    consumption in location information dissemination, a reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme is proposed where a node transmits only one location information message.
    Temporal and spatial suppression of information is prevalent to reduce energy
    consumption of nodes. For example, authors in [10] have reduced the volume of
    data by modified version of KNN algorithm on sensor node and further aggregation
    of data at Cluster Head (CH). Authors in [11] proposed Data Transmission (DaT)
    Protocol for suppressing redundant data to save the energy while maintaining a
    suitable level of accuracy. Other temporal data compression techniques to reduce
    the energy consumption is proposed in [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Spatial information
    suppression focuses on reducing number of source node in the network. The existing
    algorithms for identifying RNs as source nodes are designed for boundary monitoring
    [18,19,20,21]. These schemes are energy efficient and select lesser number of
    BNs, however, construct incorrect event region in the case of more than two subregions
    (A, B, and C in Fig. 2). The mechanisms give inaccurate result when neighbors
    of a sensor node lay in two different event regions. For example, BN 4 and its
    neighbors 15 and 16 in Fig. 2a. Node 4 suppresses the data of its neighbors and
    sends information to BS that 15 and 16 are BNs of another region. However, while
    constructing the event region map, BS can not visualize that nodes 15 and 16 are
    the BNs of two different subregions. Detailed discussion is presented in Section
    4.2.2 with the help of Figs. 17, 18, and 19. Moreover, these schemes do not investigate
    data acquisition from RNs. There is a plethora of mobile infrastructure based
    data collection schemes (a taxonomy is presented in Fig. 3). In most of these
    works, the stop time is either independent of data collection [22, 23] or negligible
    [24, 25] for a mobile BS. A few research works have modelled the stop time of
    mobile BS. Table 1 discusses these works and the limitations regarding applicability
    to the scenario under consideration. The paper aims to design a distributed Lightweight
    Event Region map Construction based data harvesting protocol LERC, for delay tolerant
    applications with following contributions: To reduce network traffic, RNs are
    identified as data transmitters. The scheme identifies RNs that in turn construct
    correct event region map even when BNs of more than two event region lay in the
    neighborhood (explained in Section 4.2.2). BN calculates the gradient (defined
    in the first paragraph of Section 3.3) of line joining it to previous RN. If the
    gradient is greater than an application dependent threshold, BN marks itself as
    RN. The decision of BNs is evaluated by plotting the boundary of event region
    at Linear in which less number (at least 58%) of BNs are required for correct
    event region construction. A reduced overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for
    path construction that ensures only one message transmission by each node. It
    restricts transmission of multiple copies of location information message of Linear
    in the network. The efficiency of this scheme is measured in terms of energy consumption.
    Reduced overhead broadcast decreases the energy consumption of network by 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    with respect to the limited broadcast scheme proposed in [26]. Sojourn locations
    of Linear are identified on-the-go and data collection dependent stop time at
    a location is modelled. The modelled stop time is adequate to collect data from
    all RNs laying in the event region ahead that in turn ensures correct event region
    map construction at BS. Modelled stop time is the sum of maximum time required
    for dissemination of location information to the farthest BN of the region and
    data transmission from it to Linear. 2 Related work This section discusses the
    research related to RN selection, limited broadcasting, stop time, and stop location
    modelling. A summarized discussion of the research gaps with respect to the applicative
    scenario’s requirements, follows. 2.1 Selection of RNs (data reporting nodes to
    sink) In [19] energy efficient Continuous Boundary Monitoring (COBOM), only one
    BN is selected randomly as RN among its neighbor BNs. Selected RNs maintain and
    transmit a BN-array to sink that includes the boundary information around the
    RN. First all nodes send their position to sink to maintain a neighborhood map
    at sink. In each iteration, only one BN sends the data to sink along with the
    status of its neighbors as BN or non-BN. COBOM suppresses the BNs and achieves
    desired accuracy when nodes are belonging to only one event region that is either
    a node is inside the event region or outside of it. However, for smart irrigation
    there may be more than one event regions present. A node’s neighbors may belong
    to different event regions and in such condition boundary construction at sink
    will fail. It is proved by simulation in Section 4.2.2 with the help of Fig. 17.
    Authors in [20] have proposed a BN selection algorithm that identifies a small
    set of BNs independent of node density and provides well-balanced RN selection
    from the small set. It chooses only the closest sensor nodes to the boundary of
    an object as BN. A Neighbor Descriptor Table (NDT) that includes neighbor location
    information and event detection status is maintained as each node. From the selected
    BNs, the algorithm tries to choose only one RN per each radio range regardless
    of node density. The algorithm selects a BN as RN if no RN selection message arrives
    from its neighbor BNs and the two most distant neighbor BNs are selected as left
    and right RNs. Since the RN selection algorithm identifies only one RN per each
    radio range, it is not suitable for the applications where one-hop neighbors belong
    to different event regions. For the applicative scenario considered in our work
    one-hop neighbors may lay in different event regions and selection of only one
    BN among neighbors as RN lead to information suppression and incorrect decision.
    Hence, the above mentioned scheme is not applicable to the applications mentioned
    earlier in Section 1. Energy-efficient DEtection and MOnitoring for COntinuous
    objects in wireless sensor networks (DEMOCO) [21] focuses on reducing the number
    of BNs that eventually results in lowering the number of RNs to reduce traffic
    as well as communication between sensor nodes. It selects the nodes inward to
    the boundary of continuous event as RNs and ignores the outward BNs. It reduces
    number of RNs to half in comparison to COBOM. In this work, minimizing number
    of RNs and hence, overall energy consumption in data reporting are the main objectives.
    However, event region construction at BS is ignored. Hence, DEMOCO is not suitable
    for the applications where information from RNs facilitate construction of event
    region at BS. In [18], authors have proposed BN detection and boundary refinement
    scheme for continuous boundary monitoring in heterogeneous Internet of Things
    (IoT). Boundary of event region consists of resource rich backbone nodes that
    are assisted by resource constrained edge nodes. Planarization algorithms are
    applied to generate a coarse boundary region. Sensory data of edge nodes is estimated
    by backbone nodes by applying interpolation techniques. For boundary refinement,
    mobile BS visits each BN to collect data. The path of mobile BS is optimally planned
    by applying models including the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) with
    time constraints and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), to enable the near real-time
    requirement of domain applications. The scheme identifies less number of BNs,
    however, the accuracy of boundary region decreases. Moreover, the scheme is centralized
    and hence, not suitable for automated smart irrigation scenario where BNs are
    identified by a distributed algorithm. 2.2 Limited broadcast Authors in [27] have
    proposed a limited broadcast scheme, where an actor transmits the location information
    in its Voronoi cell. Authors have assumed that sensors belonging to the Voronoi
    cell of an actor, are one-hop distant to it. Hence, number of messages transmitted
    for location update reduces. However, in applications such as VRI a few RNs may
    or may not be one-hop neighbors of Linear at its current stop location. In such
    scenario, the above mentioned scheme tends to perform as flooding. A Mobile Actor
    Routing Protocol (MARP) for data transmission in mobile Wireless Sensor and Actuator
    Networks (WSAN) is proposed in [28]. Actors stop at some locations for random
    time and broadcast two control signals to construct cluster around it. Cluster
    members send data to the actor within its pause time at that location. Stop locations
    and stop time are independent of data collection. The location information dissemination
    is restricted to the nodes belonging to the cluster around stop location of actor.
    However, the approach is still flooding that causes high energy consumption and
    moreover, if cluster size or node density increases energy consumption increases
    exponentially. Authors have proposed sensor-actor coordination mechanism in [29]
    where network is divided into grids and a CH is chosen for each grid. Actor broadcasts
    its location information while moving and CHs further floods it to other CHs and
    sensor nodes. The location information dissemination is restricted to the grid
    however, flooding of location messages consumes much energy. Moreover, if size
    of grid or density of nodes increases energy consumption increases exponentially.
    A limited flooding mechanism for cluster formation is proposed in [26], in which
    mobile BS broadcasts beacon periodically. Beacon contains hop count, energy, source
    address, and time to live (ttl). A node discards a packet if hop count of received
    packet is greater than the hop count stored at the node. If hop count is less
    than current value, it is updated and broadcasted again. Cluster formation stops
    if ttl has expired. Though limited flooding consumes less energy than flooding,
    the repetitive transmission by a node till ttl is reached, causes significant
    energy consumption in larger networks and hence is not scalable. 2.3 Stop time
    modelling A taxonomy of research works utilizing mobile BS is shown in Fig. 3.
    In WSAN (where mobile BS works as actuators), mechanisms of periodic visit are
    not appropriate to the problem under consideration, as the stop locations depend
    either on the nearness of previous stop point [30] or on the probability of event
    occurrence [31] and thus, are independent of data collection. However, for Linear
    move irrigation, next stop locations and stop time should take decision making
    and actuation into account. In existing works of on-demand visit [32], the key
    concern is to select an optimal actuator to take action in the event region. Table
    1 Evaluation of stop time based models Full size table In Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN) (where mobile BS acts as a data collector), for Linear visiting each node
    [38], the stop time is modelled for one hop transmission taking buffer constraint
    and speed of mobile BS into account. Another way of data collection is to visit
    a subset of nodes such as Rendezvous Points (RPs) [24, 25, 39,40,41] or Rendezvous
    Area (RA) [42, 43]. The stop locations are RPs that are decided by BS and known
    a priori to mobile data collector. Stop time at RPs are negligible most of the
    time. These algorithms do not fit for the applicative scenarios’ requirement as
    BS mounted on Linear has no prior knowledge of the BNs. Moreover, BNs are subject
    to change, so every time transmitting location of all BNs for calculation of stop
    locations will be wastage of constrained resources. In RA based mechanisms, stop
    time and stop location are random. When RPs are selected along the path of mobile
    BS, stop time is either negligible or modelled for one hop transmission. To the
    best of authors’ knowledge, none of the works design stop time and stop location
    taking the crucial aspects (collision, number of hops) of multi hop data collection
    into account. Apart from stop time and stop location, neither RP nor RA can furnish
    Linear with the event region boundary information. The mechanisms that model stop
    time are discussed in Table 1. 2.4 Discussion Limited flooding mechanisms broadcast
    location updates in a smaller region rather than entire network and hence, perform
    better than flooding. However, nodes are involved in repetitive transmission that
    consumes a considerable amount of energy. Stop time modelling in literature is
    either negligible or dependent on the energy consumption of the nodes for lifetime
    maximization. However, in application under consideration, stop time of the Linear
    should be adequate to collect data from enough BNs to construct a map of the event
    region. For reducing network traffic, data aggregation on CHs is a much prevalent
    method. However, CH election and cluster formation itself consume a considerable
    amount of energy [19, 20]. Moreover, CHs are not able to demarcate the boundary
    of a subregion (detailed discussion is presented in [7]). On the other hand, the
    RN selection schemes are energy efficient, however, fail to construct accurate
    map at sink when neighbors of a node lies in two different subregions. In VRI,
    incorrect boundary identification at sink hampers the decision making and actions
    to event region. 3 Lightweight Event Region Construction (LERC) protocol This
    section discusses the proposed methodology for data collection from BNs of a MZ.
    First, system framework and problem formulation are presented. Next, the three
    modules of the proposed methodology namely, reduced overhead broadcasting method
    (Section 3.2), RN selection scheme (Section 3.3), and calculations of stop time
    and next stop location (Section 3.4) are discussed. 3.1 System framework In this
    subsection, first we present the network model, energy model and problem formulation
    follows. 3.1.1 Network model Figure 4 depicts a scenario of farmland where a set
    of sensor nodes S = {\\(s_1, s_2...., s_n\\)} are deployed in an irregular polygon
    shaped field. The uniformly distributed sensors form a network represented as
    a graph \\(G=(S,E)\\) where sensor nodes form the vertices and connection among
    them is represented by a set of edges E = {\\(e_1, e_2...., e_m\\)}. \\(\\forall\\)
    s\\(_i\\), \\(\\exists\\) NB\\(^{d}_i\\) where NB\\(^{d}_i\\) is the one hop Neighborhood
    set of \\(s_i\\) with d members and \\(d <n\\). A node \\(s_j \\in\\) NB\\(^{d}_i
    \\iff \\left| s_i-s_j \\right| \\le\\) 2r, where \\(\\left| s_i-s_j \\right|\\)
    is the Euclidean distance between \\(s_i\\) and \\(s_j\\) and r is the communication
    range of \\(s_i\\). A multi attribute sensing sensor node \\(s_i\\) is capable
    of measuring different soil properties (for example soil moisture, temperature,
    AWC). In Fig. 4 there are two categories of nodes, namely, Boundary Nodes (BNs)
    and Interior Nodes (INs) where boundary of a MZ is demarcated by the BNs (solid
    circles). A node \\(s_i\\) marks itself as BN or IN depending on the measurements
    and position information received from the nodes in NB\\(^{d}_i\\). Each node
    upon receiving data from its neighbors runs MZ delineation algorithm (for details,
    please refer [7]). A list of symbols is presented in Table 2. Table 2 List of
    symbols Full size table BNs represent the MZ, on boundary of which, these are
    laying. To collect data from the BNs, Linear are deployed in the field. BS is
    responsible for data collection and generation of control actions and is mounted
    on a self propelled Linear move irrigation machinery (shown in Fig. 1). The actuators
    (mounted on Linear) control the rate, amount, timing of irrigation as well as
    the on/off mode of sprinklers according to the location of BNs. Fig. 4 An example
    scenario with multi Linears Full size image Linear (\\(Linear_1\\) or \\(Linear_2\\))
    starts from the periphery of the farm that is the first stop location of it. It
    gathers data from RNs (a subset of BNs), construct MZ map, generates control actions
    and irrigates the field while moving. Thus, there are two states of Linear namely,
    Stop and Collect (S&C) and Move and Irrigate (M&I). The assumptions made are based
    on the various real life VRI systems. VARIwise [44] is an autonomous control platform
    developed to generate Prescription Map for automated VRI. In an another project,
    VRI system developed by University of Georgia [45], for generating dynamic Prescription
    Map takes feedback from the sensor network. The University of Georgia Smart Sensor
    Array (UGA SSA) consists of smart sensor nodes and a base station that form a
    mesh network. 3.1.2 Energy model In this setup, sensor nodes are deployed in the
    field having transmission range equal to r. Nodes remain in sleep state till a
    control signal from Linear arrives to wake these nodes. Energy consumption of
    a node is the sum of the energy consumed in various states of a node namely, idle
    (\\(E_{idle}\\)), transmit (\\(E_t\\)), and receive (\\(E_r\\)) as proposed in
    [46, 47]. Where, \\(E_{idle}\\) is the energy consumed in Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access (CSMA) backoffs and idle state (waiting for data or control packet). Since,
    we are not optimizing any parameter of idle state, energy consumed is depicted
    as \\(E_{idle}\\) to keep it simple. Energy consumed in transmit state (\\(E_t\\))
    and receive state (\\(E_r\\)) are as follows [46]: $$\\begin{aligned} E_t= (e_t+e_{d}r^{p})B.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (1) $$\\begin{aligned} E_r=e_{r}B. \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where,
    \\(e_t\\) is the energy/bit consumed by the transmitter electronics, and \\(e_d\\)
    accounts for energy dissipated in the transmit op-amp. r is the transmission range
    and p is the channel path loss index. B is the bit rate of radio. The first phase
    of LERC protocol is Reduced Overhead Broadcast, where, each node receives a control
    message from all its predecessors and broadcast one message to its successors.
    Thus, in this phase, a maximum of k messages are received and one message is transmitted
    for a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{ROB}_i
    = (k_i*E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where, \\(k_i\\) is the number of neighbors
    of node \\(s_i\\). A node enters in RN selection phase after it receives a control
    message \\(RN_c\\) from its predecessor (explained in the first paragraph of Section
    3.3). It broadcasts this control message after deciding about its role as RN or
    non-RN. Thus, in this phase at most one message is transmitted and received by
    a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{RN}_i
    = n_{BN}(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where, \\(n_{BN}\\) is the number of BNs.
    Though size of packets in downstream, upstream and RN selection phase differs,
    it is ignored to make calculations simple. After deciding its role as RN or non-RN,
    a node transmits its data towards Linear (via the path constructed in reduced
    overhead broadcasting phase) if it is a RN or waits for the data from RNs to forward,
    otherwise. In worse case, a node may forward data packets of all RNs. So, for
    upstream data transmission, a node receives and transmits messages equal to number
    of RNs. So, the maximum energy consumption is written as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    max E^{DT}_i = n_{RN}*(E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (5) Thus, the maximum energy
    consumption of a node \\(s_i\\) is written as: $$\\begin{aligned} max E_i = E_{idle}+
    (k_i*E_r+E_t)+(n_{RN}+n_{BN})*(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where, \\(E_{idle}\\)
    is the energy consumed in idle state for during all phases mentioned above. LERC
    aims to reduce number of transmissions of a node for location information dissemination.
    Moreover, it selects a subset of nodes as the source nodes that further decreases
    in-network traffic. Thus, LERC regulates \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\), and \\(n_{BN}\\).
    The objective function of the proposed work can be formulated as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\forall {s_i\\in S} \\hspace{.1in}Minimize \\sum _{i=1}^{|S|} E_i \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) Subject to constraints: $$\\begin{aligned} Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge R_0.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (8) $$\\begin{aligned} D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN) \\le
    T. \\end{aligned}$$ (9) where, the constraints in Eqs. (8) and (9) are explained
    as follows: 1. Minimum reliability constraint \\(Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge
    R_0\\) The constraint depicts that number of RNs must not be reduced beyond \\(R_0\\),
    where, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs to achieve correct event region
    map at BS. In this work, we define reliability (Re) with respect to MZ map construction.
    It is the number of BNs sending data to Linear for MZ map construction. If all
    BNs transmit data to Linear, Re is 100% and the map constructed is correct and
    can be treated as the reference. However, in-network traffic and energy consumption
    in this case is high. Let us define a set of BNs as \\(BN=\\{BN_1, BN_2...., BN_{n_{BN}}\\}\\).
    To reduce in-network traffic, a subset of BN defined as \\(RN= \\{RN_1, RN_2....,
    RN_{n_{RN}}\\}\\) is chosen as source nodes such that \\(RN \\subseteq BN\\) and
    \\(n_{RN}\\le n_{BN}\\). As the number of selected RNs decreases, the constructed
    map can deviate from the correct (reference). After one point, the deviation in
    map hampers the decision making and implementation of actions (explained by Figs.
    14 and 15 in Section 4.2). The number of RNs at this point is defined as the minimum
    reliability \\(R_0\\). Thus, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs required to
    demarcate the boundary of MZs at Linear such that the decision and implementation
    remains same to the reference. A generalized approach to calculate \\(R_0\\) is
    not mentioned in the proposed work since it is topology and event region dependent.
    Minimum number of BNs to construct an event region (MZ) at BS is \\(R_0\\) and
    its value ranges from 1 to \\(n_{BN}\\). So, an event region may be represented
    by 1 BN or may be represented by all BNs laying in that event region. As the soil
    parameters change, shape of event region (MZ) changes and so the BNs representing
    the MZ. Thus, proposing a method to calculate the exact number of \\(R_0\\) is
    out of scope of this study. However, an empirical study is shown with the help
    of Figs. 14 and 15. 2. Delay constraint \\(D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN)
    \\le T\\) T is the stop time of Linear at a location for data acquisition. If
    delay of a packet is greater than T, it will be discarded by Linear. Thus, D is
    the maximum end to end delay of data transmission of a RN that is selected as
    data transmitter to construct MZ map at Linear. Fig. 5 Flow chart of the proposed
    method Full size image Thus, the work intends to minimize energy consumption of
    sensor nodes. The energy consumption of a node depends on \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\),
    and \\(n_{BN}\\) (as represented by Eq. (6)). These variables are in turn depend
    on the number of transmissions of control packets in disseminating the location
    information of Linear and data packets in sending information from source nodes.
    To minimize the number of messages during location information dissemination of
    Linear a Reduced Overhead Broadcast mechanism (explained in Section 3.2) is proposed
    where nodes receive control packets from all predecessors and transmit only one
    message. To reduce number of data packets, number of source nodes are minimized
    by selecting a sub-set of BNs namely, RNs, where the number of RNs must be sufficient
    to construct boundary of event region at Linear. RN selection mechanism minimizes
    \\(n_{BN}\\). It is an angle-based greedy approach where each BN marks itself
    as RN or non-RN depending on the angle formed with previous RN (explained in Section
    3.3). Since, RNs are identified in a distributed fashion, stop time (T) of Linear
    must be adequate to collect data from all RNs to ensure the correct construction
    of event region boundary at Linear. A data collection dependent stop time is modelled
    and explained in Section 3.4. Section 3.5 discusses the RN selection when one-hop
    neighbors belong to multiple MZs and data collection by multiple Linears. A flow
    chart of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 5. 3.2 Reduced overhead broadcasting In
    S &C state, at a stop location, Linear sends two control signals. First control
    signal is broadcasted with a transmission range R that is greater than the transmission
    range of sensor nodes (r). This control signal is sent to wake up the nodes from
    sleep state. R depends on the Region of Action (ROA) of Linear that in turn depends
    on the length of field (L) and number of sinks deployed. For example, in Fig.
    4, \\(R=L/4\\), to cover the ROA of Linears. However, for single sink in the same
    region R will be L/2. Fig. 6 Structure of start message Full size image Next,
    a control message start is transmitted with a transmission range of r. start is
    sent for path construction from BNs to Linear. It contains the coordinates of
    Linear (coordinate), hop, residual energy (energy), and sleep time = present time
    + stop time (time) of nodes as shown in Fig 6. Nodes receiving start from neighbors,
    will increment value of hop by one and store its remaining energy in residual
    energy field. Every node will broadcast only one start message to its neighbors
    to reduce network traffic. To ensure reduced overhead broadcast, once a node receives
    first start message (at time \\(t_{start}\\)), it will wait for time \\(t_w\\)
    (Please refer Eq. (15) in Section 3.4), to collect start messages from other neighbors.
    Among all of its neighbors, a node will select one having smallest hop as next
    hop node, for upstream data transmission. If two nodes with same hop are there,
    then a node with largest energy is selected. If multiple nodes with same energy
    and hop are there, randomly a node will be selected as next hop. After next hop
    selection, each node will broadcast its start message to neighbors. Any start
    message received after this broadcast will be discarded. For example, please refer
    Fig. 7 that represents a small portion of a larger network. It consists of a Linear
    (diamond shaped) near node 41 and 42 and BNs (laying on the boundary of network
    and MZ). Let us suppose all nodes shown in the figure are in receive state and
    waiting for start message. Linear broadcasts start message that is received by
    the one-hop neighbors of Linear, nodes 41, 42, 40, 39, 38, 37, 33, and 32. Since
    these nodes are one-hop neighbors of Linear (hop = 0), they update hop and energy
    of the start message and broadcasts it. After this broadcast, these nodes start
    contending for data transmission (explained in the second last paragraph of right
    column on page 12) and discard the start message received from their one-hop neighbors.
    Fig. 7 An example scenario for start message dissemination and RN selection Full
    size image Next, we take example of node 27 to elaborate the reduced overhead
    broadcast scheme. It will wait for \\(t_w\\) time (depends on the maximum transmission
    time of all neighbors), after it receives first start message. After \\(t_w\\)
    time expires, it has start messages from nodes 33(hop = 2), 34(hop = 3), and 26(hop
    = 2). It does not receive start from nodes 35 and 30, since these nodes will broadcast
    start after \\(t_w\\) for node 27 is expired. It selects node 33 or node 26 depending
    on the energy as its next hop since hop is least for them. Node 27 then broadcasts
    start message. Figure 8 depicts various states of Linear and activities associated
    with it. S &C state comprises of three states namely, transmit, wait, and receive.
    In transmit state, Linear sends two signals, wake and start. It then switches
    to wait state, where it waits for a time T (calculation is shown Section 3.4).
    If data packets are received from sensor nodes, it switches to receive state and
    start preparing the Prescription Map (PM) that is set of control actions such
    as rate, location, on/off state for sprinklers, etc. When timer T expires Linear
    switches to M &I state and irrigate the field according to the PM generated. When
    the next stop location is reached, calculation of which was done in S &C state,
    Linear switches to next S &C state and repeats the above mentioned activities.
    Fig. 8 State space representation of Linear Full size image 3.3 Representative
    Node (RN) selection Key idea of RN selection scheme is to select a BN as RN if
    it lies on a large gradient (\\(\\theta\\)) with respect to previous RN. Large
    \\(\\theta\\) depicts a significant change in the shape of event region. Each
    BN marks itself as RN or non-RN. One hop neighbors of Linear (nodes 41, 42, etc.)
    and corner nodes, for example nodes 36 and 37 in Fig. 7 (for corner node identification
    please refer Outward Nodes in the algorithm proposed in [7]), are RNs by default.
    One hop neighbors of Linear are RNs as only one hop transmission is required for
    these nodes. Corner nodes are RNs as these nodes are key enablers to achieve minimum
    reliability (shown by Fig. 15 and discussed in the last paragraph of left column
    on page 18). These nodes broadcast a control message \\(RN_c\\) to inform others
    that they are default RNs. Other nodes, when receive this message, first calculate
    Euclidean distance from Linear. If the calculated distance is in between \\(R-r\\)
    and \\(R+r\\), the BN marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message. If the
    calculated distance is less than \\(R-r\\), BNs calculate angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with its neighbor RN. \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1})\\)
    if \\(y_2-y_1 < x_2-x_1\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{x_2-x_1}{y_2-y_1})\\),
    otherwise. (\\(x_2, y_2\\)) is the coordinate of neighbor RN and (\\(x_1,y_1\\))
    is the coordinate of the node calculating \\(\\theta\\). If \\(\\theta\\) is less
    than \\(\\theta _0\\) (an application dependent threshold discussed in the next
    paragraph), it marks itself as non-RN and as RN otherwise. A non-RN node sends
    \\(RN_c\\) message containing coordinate of RN with which it has calculated the
    angle \\(\\theta\\). The BN receiving this message calculates the angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with the coordinate received in the message. A BN receiving multiple \\(RN_c\\)
    messages will decide according to the lowest \\(\\theta\\). Exact \\(\\theta _0\\)
    can be calculated in a distributed fashion by local talk of sensor nodes where
    nodes between two corner nodes can decide among themselves the value of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) for that setting. However, when boundary pattern changes significantly re-tuning
    \\(\\theta _0\\) is required. Exact mechanism for fixing \\(\\theta _0\\) is a
    work in progress. For the sake of simplicity, in this work, we assume that the
    boundary does not change significantly to change \\(\\theta _0\\). However, a
    safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) is provided by recording the effect of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) on energy consumption and reconstruction of coarse boundary by simulating
    various networks (explained in Section 4.2.1). We elaborate RN selection by an
    example scenario, shown in Fig. 7. The one hop neighbors of Linear (node 41, 42,
    37, 38, 39) excluding the non-BNs (32 and 40) mark themselves as RN and send \\(RN_c\\)
    message to their neighbor node. Moreover, the corner nodes (36 and 37) also mark
    themselves as RN by default. Among neighbors of node 42, only node 33 calculates
    the angle \\(\\theta\\) since others are either non-BNs or RNs. Suppose \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\) for this case. \\(\\theta\\) for node 33 is \\(32^\\circ\\)
    and hence, node 33 marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message to its neighbors.
    Angle \\(\\theta\\) for nodes 34, 26, 27, 29 are \\(4^\\circ\\), \\(12^\\circ\\),
    \\(17^\\circ\\), and \\(38^\\circ\\) respectively. Node 29 marks itself as RN.
    However, when node 29 receives message of node 27 and calculates angle with node
    27 (it is an RN because distance from Linear is \\(R-r\\)) that is \\(6.7^\\circ\\),
    it marks itself as non-RN. Nodes 34 and 35 will mark themselves as non-RN with
    respect to node 33. Node 30 will mark itself as RN with respect to node 36. All
    default RNs (one hop neighbors of Linear and corner nodes) start contending for
    channel access through Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
    (CSMA/CA) [48] scheme as soon as they receive start message. Other nodes contend
    after marking themselves as RNs or non-RNs. If a RN has residual energy less than
    a threshold, it informs its neighbors about the situation and go to sleep. Its
    neighbors transmit data and its position information to next hop neighbors. Figure
    9 shows various states of sensor nodes and actions associated with it. Each sensor
    node can be in one of the four states namely, sleep, receive, wait, and transmit.
    Sensor nodes switch from sleep state to receive state when they receive wake signal
    from Linear and go to sleep state when timer T expires. When start message is
    received, a node (BN or non-BN) broadcasts it by changing hop and residual energy.
    A BN first decides whether it is a RN or not. If it is RN, it follows CSMA/CA
    mechanism. Various activities associated with it is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 State
    space representation of a sensor node Full size image 3.4 Stop time modelling
    and next stop location calculation for the Linear Stop time of Linear at a location
    depends on the data collection delay from all RNs. This delay in turn is the sum
    of propagation time of start message to the farthest RN (within range R) and data
    transmission time from this RN to Linear. The stop time (T) can be calculated
    as: $$\\begin{aligned} T = h_{max}*(delay_{d,max} + delay_{u,max}). \\end{aligned}$$
    (10) where, \\(h_{max}\\) is the maximum number of hops between Linear and the
    farthest RN, \\(delay_{d,max}\\) and \\(delay_{u,max}\\) is the one hop delay
    of downstream and upstream traffic respectively. \\(h_{max}\\) is calculated from
    the probability density function (pdf) of distance covered in one hop proposed
    in [49]. The pdf depends on the number of neighbors of a node that can forward
    data towards Linear, transmission range of nodes (r), and the maximum transmission
    range of Linear (R). The maximum one hop delay in transmitting start message to
    the farthest RN is the sum of the waiting time (\\(t_w\\)) a node waits for its
    neighbors to send start message and the time required for that node to successfully
    broadcast it. $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{d,max} = t_w + t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) where, \\(n_R\\) is the average number of retransmissions and \\(t_{tx}\\)
    is the total time required for transmission of a packet that depends on the back
    off time (\\(t_{BO}\\)), Clear Channel Access (CCA) time (\\(t_{CCA}\\)), transmission
    time of a packet (\\(t_{txn}\\)), and transmission of an acknowledgement (\\(t_{Ack}\\)).
    $$\\begin{aligned} t_{tx}=t_{BO} + t_{CCA} + t_{txn} +t_{Ack}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (12) The upper bound of \\(t_{BO} + t_{CCA}\\) is reached when a node extracts
    highest back off timer at each back off stage, and at each back off stage it finds
    the channel busy. The value is 120*\\(t_b\\), where \\(t_b\\) is the duration
    of one time slot [48]. The average number of retransmissions \\(n_R\\) is modelled
    using Geometric distribution, that is the probability of number of failures before
    first successful transmission [50]. $$\\begin{aligned} n_R= (1-p)/p. \\end{aligned}$$
    (13) where, p is the probability of successful transmission given by: $$\\begin{aligned}
    p=\\frac{1}{n_c}. \\end{aligned}$$ (14) where, \\(n_c\\) is the number of nodes
    contending for channel access. For the worse case analysis, number of nodes contending
    is taken as number of nodes of the network (n) as stated in [48]. Based on the
    above discussion, \\(t_w\\) of a node can be calculated as the time required for
    receiving start message from all neighbors. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} t_w = k*(t_{tx}+
    n_R*t_{tx}). \\end{aligned}$$ (15) where, k is the average degree of the network.
    Similarly, \\(delay_{u,max}\\) can be written as: $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{u,max}=
    t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$ (16) Next stop location of Linear The data
    packets received in S &C state contain the coordinates of source RNs. The farthest
    RN in the direction of move of Linear will be its next stop location. However,
    there may be a situation where no data packet is received from the farthest RN.
    Such situation may arise due to two reasons: first, there are no BNs (in receive
    state) in the direction of move of Linear and second, data packet from BN may
    be lost due to various reasons (congestion, link quality, etc.). In this case,
    Linear stops at a location that is R meters away from present stop location. Although
    the probability of packet loss is low due to re-transmission, however, loss of
    packet of corner nodes for \\(Re \\ge R_0\\) and of RNs for \\(Re=R_0\\), can
    effect the decision of Linear. 3.5 Critical cases In this subsection, we discuss
    some critical situations that may occur during data acquisition. These situations
    are discussed separately for ease of understanding. 3.5.1 How will a BN mark itself
    as RN if BNs of two MZs are in receive state Fig. 10 BNs laying in different MZs
    Full size image The example discussed for RN selection in previous subsection
    assumed that BNs of one MZ are in receive state. However, in some cases BNs of
    two adjacent MZs may be in receive state as shown in Fig. 10. Nodes 6, 17, 20,
    29, 26, 27, and 30 are the BNs of one subregion. Nodes 7, 19, and 18 are the BNs
    of second subregion and nodes 8, 9, and 21 are the BNs of third subregion. We
    propose a rule based scheme for marking a BN as RN, when BNs of two MZs are in
    receive state. When all neighbors of a BN are BNs of another MZ: The BN will mark
    itself as RN, since it is the only BN of its MZ, among its neighbors. For example,
    refer Fig. 10, where BNs of three subregions are shown, as mentioned above. Node
    8 is a BN of third subregion, and all other neighbors are the BNs of second subregion,
    Hence, node 8 marks itself as RN. When only one neighbor of a BN is in its MZ
    and others are in different MZs: The BN will mark itself as RN, since it is the
    node laying on the corner of its MZ. For example please refer nodes 7, 19, 9,
    and 21 in Fig. 10. For nodes 7 and 19, node 18 is the only neighbor BN in their
    subregion. Similarly, node 9 and node 21 are the only BN neighbors of each other
    laying in same subregion. Thus, these nodes mark themselves as RNs. When more
    than one neighbors of a BN are its MZ and others are in different MZs: The BN
    will measure angle \\(\\theta\\) with RN of its MZ, and declare itself as RN if
    \\(\\theta > \\theta _0\\) (as explained in Section 3.3). For example, refer nodes
    27, 26, 29, 20, and 17 of the first subregion and node 18 of second subregion
    in Fig. 10. These nodes will calculate \\(\\theta\\) from neighboring RN and will
    decide accordingly. 3.5.2 How will data collection be accomplished by multiple
    Linears We have discussed data harvesting by single Linear, so far. However, for
    a large area multiple Linears can be utilized for data collection. Figure 4 shows
    data acquisition by two Linears, where each Linear has a fixed area in which it
    can collect data, named as its ROA. It is equal to \\(\\frac{L}{S}\\), where,
    L is length of the field perpendicular to the direction of move of Linear and
    S is number of sinks. The area is divided into three subregions namely, A, B,
    and C. RN selection, next stop location, and stop time calculation remain same
    for multiple Linears to that of single Linear. However, the maximum range (R)
    with which Linear transmits control signal to wake the nodes, changes for multiple
    Linears. R should be selected in such a way, so that it covers the nodes laying
    in the ROA of the Linear horizontally. Thus, \\(R=\\frac{L}{2S}\\) for proper
    functioning of the proposed protocol. However, the BNs laying near to the dividing
    boundary of ROAs of both sinks (nodes 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 4) may receive signals
    from both Linears. These nodes can send data to any of the Linear, and Linears
    can exchange data before the generation of control actions. The range R decreases
    with increase in number of sinks and so does the area from which data is to be
    collected for current S &C state. However, number of sinks must be bounded by
    a value where R becomes 2r. Since increasing number of sinks beyond this point
    will result in a collecting region as small as the sensing range of a sensor node
    that in turn leads to one hop data collection by Linear. Number of collecting
    regions are \\(\\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil\\) for one sink where W is the length
    of the area along the direction of move of Linear. Lemma 1 Total energy consumption
    of the network decreases by \\(\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}\\) for S Linears.
    Proof Let us assume that energy consumption of the network with \\(N_b\\) sources
    (BNs) and one sink is \\(E_T\\), where, $$\\begin{aligned} E_T= N_{b}h_{avg}E_b.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (17) where, \\(E_b\\) is the average energy consumed in one hop
    transmission and is calculated taking the various factors (backoff and retransmissions)
    into account, as discussed in Section 3.4 and \\(h_{avg}\\) is average number
    of hops between source and destination. As number of sinks increases by 1, ROA
    and R of a sink shrink by a fraction of 2. Number of collecting regions are \\(\\lceil
    \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S\\), from which data is to be collected for S sinks. Energy
    consumption for S sinks is: $$\\begin{aligned} E_{T}^{''}= \\lceil \\frac{W}{R}
    \\rceil SE_S. \\end{aligned}$$ (18) where, \\(E_S\\) is energy consumption for
    one collecting region and is given by: $$\\begin{aligned} E_S= N_b^{''}h_{avg}^{''}E_b=\\frac{N_b}{
    \\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S}h_{avg}^{''}E_b. \\end{aligned}$$ (19) where, \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is the average number of hops when distance between source and destination in
    one collecting region with reduced range R. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{E_{T}}{E_{T}^{''}}=\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (20) Validation of the proposed lemma is done through numerical
    analysis and network simulation. For numerical analysis, \\(h_{avg}\\) and \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is calculated by the pdf given in [49] and \\(E_b\\) is calculated as the sum
    of energy dissipated in different states namely, idle, transmit, and receive.
    In idle state, average number of backoffs is calculated by the equation proposed
    in [48]. Energy in transmit and receive states are calculated taking average number
    of retransmissions (discussed in Section 3.4) and packet size into account. Values
    are calculated and simulated for two networks of 42 nodes (low average degree
    \\(\\approx\\) 6) and 150 nodes (high average degree \\(\\approx\\) 20) deployed
    in an area of \\(900\\times 500\\) \\(m^2\\). For network simulation, average
    of 100 runs is considered as the values saturate after this point. The result
    shown in Fig. 11 depicts that numerical analysis matches with the simulation.
    Number of sinks is varied from 1–2 for this network since, range of sink R reduces
    to 125m that is less than 2r (160m). 4 Results and discussion Fig. 11 Validation
    of Lemma 1 through numerical analysis and simulation Full size image Table 3 Simulation
    setup Full size table The section discusses the performance of the three modules
    of LERC. Simulation is performed on the discrete event simulator NS3.30.1 and
    various simulation parameters are mentioned in Table 3. Experiments are performed
    on a data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes deployed in a \\(900\\times 500 m^2\\)
    area. The range of sensor nodes is set as 80m as this is the minimum range for
    connected graph. The data set [51] consists of soil moisture values and position
    information at 42 locations in a farm. The proposed work identifies source nodes
    (RNs) among BNs that in turn depend on position information of sensor nodes. Moreover,
    the proposed work intends to reduce energy consumption in data collection from
    RNs. Thus, the data set is apt to add a realistic flavor for simulating the impact
    of the proposed work. First, energy consumption in reduced overhead broadcast
    is discussed in comparison to cluster trail [26] and MARP [28]. Since, reduced
    overhead broadcast does not depend on the data values of sensor nodes, different
    networks are created keeping transmission range constant. Number of nodes are
    increased randomly to vary average degree of the network by 2. Average degree
    is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. In Section 4.2, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear and event region map construction at Linear
    for different value of \\(\\theta _0\\) is discussed. RN selection depends on
    BN identification (proposed in [7]) that in turn is data dependent. Scarcity of
    available agriculture data set restricts the evaluation of RN selection, stop
    time modelling and total energy consumption to one data set [51]. However, robustness
    of RN selection is shown in different topology by varying \\(\\theta _0\\). RN
    selection is scheme is compared with the recent state-of-the-art methods in terms
    of event region map construction in Section 4.2.2 for \\(\\theta _0=0^\\circ\\).
    Stop time modelling is evaluated by comparing the end to end delay in transmitting
    data from RNs to Linear with the modelled stop time of Linear. End to end delay
    is recorded for different values of \\(\\theta _0\\). Total energy consumption
    of the proposed scheme compared with CH based data transmission, cluster trail,
    and MARP is presented in Section 4.4. Total energy consumption of data collection
    is the sum of energy consumed in BN detection, RN selection and transmission from
    identified RNs to Linear. BN detection mechanism [7] is our previous work and
    is evaluated in same simulation environment and data set. Thus, reduced overhead
    broadcast, RN selection, and stop time modeling are evaluated by simulation in
    this work and total energy consumption includes simulation results from our previous
    work in same simulation environment. 4.1 Analysis of reduced overhead broadcast
    Energy consumption in dissemination of start message for the proposed reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme, cluster trail scheme, and flooding is shown in Fig.
    12. The proposed mechanism is tested for different networks, keeping transmission
    range constant. Number of nodes are increased to vary average degree of the network
    by 2. Average degree is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. The proposed
    reduced overhead broadcast scheme consumes 33.3%\\(-\\)61.1% and 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    less energy than the flooding scheme [28] and cluster trail [26] respectively.
    A node receives k number of messages and transmits only one message as opposed
    to multiple message transmissions in others. Fig. 12 Energy consumption in start
    message dissemination Full size image 4.2 Analysis of data transmission from BNs
    to Linear and construction of MZ map at Linear In this subsection, variation in
    number of RNs and corresponding energy consumption of the network, with respect
    to the tuning of angle \\(\\theta _0\\) is presented. As \\(\\theta _0\\) increases,
    number of RNs (source) decreases and so is the energy consumption (as shown in
    Fig. 13). The values written in brackets are the number of RNs for corresponding
    \\(\\theta _0\\). \\(\\theta _0\\) is varied from 0\\(^\\circ\\) to 45\\(^\\circ\\)
    (maximum \\(\\theta\\) is 45\\(^\\circ\\) from the formula given in Section 3.3),
    with an interval of 1. However, only those values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in the figure for which there is a change from previous value. When \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\), all BNs act as data transmitters to Linear. A BN does
    not mark itself as a RN if its \\(\\theta\\) (angle of the gradient of line joining
    it to its previous RN) is less than \\(\\theta _0\\). Thus, number of RNs keeps
    on decreasing with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\),
    number of RNs and energy consumption are minimum. For this value, only the BNs
    that are one hop neighbors of Linear and the corner nodes act as RNs. However,
    this value is not the optimum one to achieve reliability (Re), since it depends
    on the MZ construction at Linear. Fig. 13 Variation of energy consumption in data
    transmission from RNs to Linear with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Fig. 14 MZ map at Linear for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 0 Full size image Fig. 15 Variation
    in the construction of MZ at Linear with varying \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Linear constructs MZs, depending on the data and position information received
    from RNs. Constructed MZs at Linear for some values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in Figs. 14 and 15. When \\(\\theta _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\) (refer Fig. 14), all
    BNs send data to Linear and MZ is constructed with 100% reliability. As \\(\\theta
    _0\\) increases, number of RNs decreases gradually and MZ at Linear changes. For
    example, when \\(\\theta _0\\) is 5\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 34
    do not mark themselves as RNs. However, exclusion of these nodes have insignificant
    impact on construction of MZ at Linear (it can be clearly seen in Fig. 15a). Similarly,
    for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 15\\(^\\circ\\) nodes 15, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31 are excluded
    (Fig. 15b) and for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 20\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 17 and 20 are removed
    from RN set having a negligible variation in MZ map at Linear (Fig. 15c). When
    node 30 marks itself as non-RN node for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) (Fig.
    15d), distortion in MZ map is seen with respect to the original MZ for \\(\\theta
    _0\\) = 0\\(^\\circ\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\) only corner nodes
    and one hop neighbors are marked as RNs. (refer Fig. 15e). Thus, it can be inferred
    from the above discussion that as value of \\(\\theta _0\\) increases, number
    of data transmitter BNs and overall energy consumption decreases. However, after
    a certain value of \\(\\theta _0\\), data collected from RNs become insufficient
    to construct a correct MZ map at Linear. For the topology under consideration
    \\(\\theta _0\\) should be less than or equal to 20\\(^\\circ\\) for a reliable
    construction of MZ map at Linear. Moreover, Fig. 15f shows the constructed MZ
    map for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) without corner nodes 4 and 12. The
    map shows that corner nodes are key enablers for MZ map construction and hence,
    must be selected as RNs. 4.2.1 Safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) To test the variation
    of MZ map with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) further, networks are deployed by varying
    number of nodes from 50–150 with an increase of 1 in average degree in the area
    900\\(\\times\\)500 \\(m^2\\). Change in boundary and BNs was insignificant for
    the networks of more than 150 nodes. RNs are identified by varying \\(\\theta
    _0\\) from \\(0^\\circ -45^\\circ\\) and effect on the boundary is observed. As
    \\(\\theta _0\\) increases number of RNs decreases and so is the energy consumption
    of the network. However, the reconstructed boundary of MZs deforLinear with decrease
    in number of RNs. \\(\\theta _0\\) after which no significant change in energy
    consumption is recorded for various networks is shown in Fig. 16. The results
    show that the minimum value among all recorded values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(20^\\circ\\).
    Maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) to retain the shape of coarse boundary is shown in Fig.
    16. For correct reconstruction of boundary, maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\).
    Thus, \\(\\theta _0\\) must be tuned between \\(20^\\circ\\) and \\(30^\\circ\\).
    \\(\\theta _0\\) selected in this range reduces energy consumption while maintaining
    the correctness of coarse boundary of reconstructed MZ map. Limitation Exact tuning
    of \\(\\theta _0\\) is a limitation of the proposed work as mentioned in Section
    3.3. Fig. 16 Optimal values of \\(\\theta _0\\) for energy consumption and correct
    MZ map reconstruction Full size image 4.2.2 Comparison with RN selection schemes
    The RN selection algorithm of the proposed LERC protocol is compared with COBOM
    [19], DEMOCO [21], and the algorithm proposed in [20]. Figures 17, 18 and 19 show
    the selected RNs among BNs and the demarcated boundary map by the algorithms.
    Both the algorithms identify lesser number of RNs than the proposed scheme, however,
    give ambiguous and incorrect results. Fig. 17 RNs and event region construction
    by COBOM [19] Full size image As shown in Fig. 17, COBOM identifies 9 RNs among
    20 BNs. If a node has different reading (depending on threshold) than its neighbors,
    it is marked as BNs. RNs are selected among BNs by suppressing the neighbors.
    A node in COBOM declares itself as RN if none of its neighbors broadcast their
    status as RN within a predefined time. RN transmits its data and its neighbors’
    IDs. Thus, every two-hop neighbors are marked as RNs. Node 27 informs the sink
    that its neighbors, nodes 18, 19, and 22 are in different subregion. On the other
    hand, node 21 informs that nodes 9, 13, and 22 are in same subregion. Nodes 17
    and 8 informs that nodes 7 and 18 are in different subregion. According to these
    reports, sink draws a boundary as shown in Fig. 17 where nodes of two different
    subregions are merged (please refer Fig. 14 for correct map). COBOM is designed
    for continuous object boundary monitoring, where only two subregions exist: one
    in which object is present and second in which object is not present. Fig. 18
    RNs and event region construction by DEMOCO [21] Full size image Fig. 19 RNs and
    event region construction by the scheme proposed in [20] Full size image DEMOCO
    reduces number of BNs and hence, number of RNs to minimize number of source nodes.
    It enhances COBOM by selecting only \"IN\" nodes as BNs leaving \"OUT\" nodes.
    Thus, it selects BNs that lay on one side of the boundary. BNs, RNs, and the event
    region boundary constructed at BS by DEMOCO is shown in Fig. 18. It reduces number
    of RNs to 5, however the event region boundary formed at BS is Incorrect. The
    BNs belonging to four event regions are entirely suppressed since, DEMOCO selects
    nodes laying one side of the boundary as BNs. Thus, neighbors of BNs laying in
    different event regions are not selected as BNs and RNs. DEMOCO reduces number
    of RNs to a great extent, however, this in turn leads to suppression of information
    from different event regions. The algorithm proposed in [20], identifies a node
    as BN if its data value is different from at least one neighbor and distance from
    this neighbor is least among the distances from all of its neighbors. Every two
    hop neighbor among BNs is selected as RN. In this course, the algorithm reduces
    RNs by 72% as compared to LERC. However, such suppression leads to information
    loss and the constructed event region map is faulty as shown in Fig. 19. 4.3 Stop
    time for the Linear In this subsection, the modelled stop time is evaluated by
    varying the application dependent threshold \\(\\theta _0\\) as shown in Fig.
    20. Calculated stop time is 30seconds for network of 42 nodes and simulated End
    to End (E2E) delay for \\(\\theta _0\\) = \\(0^\\circ\\) is 23.5seconds. The E2E
    delay decreases slightly with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\), as number of RNs decreases
    with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\) (explained in previous subsection). Decrease
    in number of source nodes in turn decreases in-network traffic and retransmissions.
    Hence, E2E delay decreases. However, for \\(\\theta _0>40^\\circ\\) E2E delay
    saturates at 23.05seconds as decrease in number of RNs seizes beyond this point
    (shown in previous subsection). The modelled stop time for two sinks is lesser
    than that of one sink because of the number of hops between Linear and farthest
    RN. E2E delay for two sinks is less than the modelled stop time and decreases
    slightly with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). Hence, it can be concluded that modelled
    stop time of Linear is adequate to collect data from all RNs. Fig. 20 Variation
    in end to end delay with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image 4.4 Overall
    analysis of the system The proposed scheme is compared with a clustering based
    data collection by mobile BS moving on fixed trajectory [41], to prove the efficacy
    (in terms of energy consumption) of data transmission from BNs to Linear over
    the data transmission from CHs to mobile BS. Next, the proposed scheme is compared
    with MARP that is a recent sensor actuator coordination protocol. Further, the
    proposed scheme is compared with two recent agent based routing protocols. Energy
    efficient Geographic Routing Protocol based on mobile sink (EGRPM) [23] is mobile
    BS based data collection protocol, whereas, Energy Efficient Layered Routing Protocol
    (EELRP) [52] is a static BS based layered routing protocol. In addition, the proposed
    scheme is compared with cluster trail [26] that is a communication protocol implementing
    limited broadcast for mobile BS location information dissemination. Experiments
    are performed on the data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes. Total energy consumption
    is the energy consumed in transmitting start message from Linear to nodes and
    data transmission from RNs to Linear. To test reduced overhead broadcast scheme
    we varied number of nodes since BNs are not required for it. However, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear for varying number of nodes requires selection
    of BNs in each setting. Scarcity of available agriculture data set restricts the
    performance evaluation to this data set [51]. However, variation in number of
    nodes can be done by extrapolation technique. Fig. 21 Comparison of total energy
    consumption with recent protocols Full size image The proposed scheme performs
    better in terms of energy consumption as shown in Fig. 21. For network of 42 sensors,
    there is 12 %, 19%, 24%, 34%, 56% decrease in energy consumption with respect
    to EGRPM, CH based scheme, cluster trail, MARP, and EELRP, respectively. Total
    energy consumption of the proposed scheme is the sum of energy dissipation in
    BN selection (algorithm proposed in [9]), start message dissemination, and data
    transmission from selected RNs to Linear. For CH based data transmission, there
    are two phases namely, initial and collection. Initial phase involves control
    message flooding from mobile BS to the sensor nodes, hop count transmission from
    each node to BS, and maximum and minimum hop count flooding from BS to sensor
    nodes. Flooding of several control messages incur high energy consumption, however,
    it is a one time process. In collection phase, CHs are elected by several control
    message transmission, sensor nodes are attached to CHs as Cluster Members (CMs),
    and CHs choose another CH as next hop for forwarding of data transmission. At
    the end, data is transmitted from CMs to respective CHs and is forwarded to BS
    via another CHs. In the proposed scheme, BN selection algorithm consumes approximately
    529 mJ in which identification of BNs laying on network boundary (one time process)
    consumes 400 mJ (for details please refer [7]). The initial phase of [41] consumes
    less energy (=350 mJ) than the proposed scheme despite of more number of message
    exchanges. The reason behind this decrease is the size of packets. In BN identification,
    data packets are transmitted in addition to the control packet transmission whereas,
    in [41], only control packets are flooded. However, in collection phase the CH
    election, cluster formation, and data transmission consumes more energy than reduced
    overhead broadcast and data transmission from selected RNs. EELRP [52] divides
    the network into sectors centered at the BS that sits in the middle of it. Each
    node transmits three control packets to select agent of their sector and sends
    data to the agent via multi-hop. Agents of the sectors aggregates and forwards
    the data to BS via multi-hop. The proposed scheme performs better than EELRP since
    selecting agent involves multiple messages and moreover, multi-hop data transmission
    between sensor nodes to agent and agent to BS causes high energy consumption.
    Table 4 Key findings of the research Full size table EGRPM [23] divides the network
    into similar grids where the size of grid is decided based on the length and width
    of the network. Each cell nodes flood control messages to identify agent of the
    cell. Mobile BS traverses through the network and stops at four locations on the
    periphery of the network. Each cell node sends data to the agent of cell via one-hop
    or multi-hop. The agent then transmits data to mobile BS via one-hop or multi-hop.
    LERC performs better than EGRPM in terms of energy consumption as in EGRPM selection
    of agent is an energy consuming process due to flooding of control messages. Moreover,
    all nodes are source nodes and forwards data towards agent via multi-hop. Moreover,
    agent forwards data to mobile BS via multi-hop. Average path length is 5 for EGRPM.
    LERC achieves less energy consumption by reducing number of source nodes and minimizing
    location information messages of mobile BS. Energy consumption of cluster trail
    is more than the proposed scheme as mobile BS location information broadcast consumes
    much energy as shown in previous subsection. Data transmissions from sensor nodes
    consume slightly more energy due to the movement of sink. In some cases, BS moves
    before data is received by it. In such cases, nodes follow the trail generated
    and ends up into many multihop transmissions. The proposed scheme consumes less
    energy than MARP [28], because of two reasons. First, the reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme and second is the selective sources. In MARP, actuator floods its control
    message to establish a path from each source to it. Flooding causes high energy
    consumption as already shown in previous subsection. Moreover, all nodes transmit
    sensed data to the actuator during its pause time that consumes more energy than
    the data transmission from a few RNs in the proposed scheme. A summary of the
    key findings in this research is presented in Table 4. 4.5 Interpretability and
    explainability of performance gain over existing methods The performance gain
    of the proposed mechanism is twofold: Correct map construction and Low energy
    consumption. Correct map construction is achieved by transmitting data from RNs.
    The existing mechanisms for RN selection mechanism are developed for selecting
    appropriate nodes among BNs. However, these methods do not include the communication
    cost from RNs to BS. Therefore, to evaluate the communication cost of the proposed
    mechanism, it is compared with existing communication protocols. Thus, the proposed
    scheme is compared with two class of state-of-art mechanisms: RN selection mechanisms
    and communication protocols. Correct map construction is achieved by the proposed
    mechanism even if nodes of more than two event regions lie nearby. The existing
    methods fail to reconstruct the boundaries at BS in such a scenario (As described
    in Introduction section and shown in the results (Figs. 17 and 19). However, in
    case of two event regions sharing a single boundary, existing methods perform
    better than the proposed mechanism as less number of RNs are selected by existing
    mechanisms. As RNs are the sources for data transmission, less number of RNs result
    into reduced energy consumption. There are two components contributing for low
    energy consumption in data transmission for local map construction than the existing
    methods. First component is the reduced overhead in Linear location information
    dissemination. Each node waits for its neighbour to transmit the control packet
    having Linear location information and sends only one message. Second component
    is the reduced number of sources. However, for a particular boundary, decrease
    in number of RNs beyond a point reduces the energy consumption but hampers the
    correctness of map constructed at Linear. Selection of this point is the limitation
    of our work as mentioned in above subsection. The cost of correct local map construction
    with low energy consumption at Linear is increased delay. Linear waits for a certain
    period of time modelled as the Stop Time before decision making and actuation.
    This time includes the waiting time of nodes for location information dissemination
    of Linear and the data transmission time from the farthest RNs to Linear. The
    waiting time for Linear location information dissemination ensures reduced energy
    consumption and data transmission time guarantees the correctness of constructed
    map. However, the application under consideration can tolerate the increased delay.
    5 Conclusion The paper develops a distributed lightweight scheme for event region
    map construction at Linear. It identifies minimal set BNs as source nodes and
    models stop time of Linear to collect information from these nodes. A reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for location information dissemination where
    each node transmits only one message. This scheme addresses the challenge of reducing
    message overhead in location information dissemination. Stop time is modelled
    as the sum of control message transmission to the farthest BN, and data packet
    transmission from it to Linear. The challenge of modelling adequate stop time
    for data collection is addressed in this module. Next, to reduce network traffic,
    a minimal set BNs are selected as data transmitters (RN) to Linear. The RNs are
    selected such as the data transmitted by them must construct a correct map at
    Linear. Moreover, data collection in multiple Linear scenario is investigated.
    Simulation results demonstrated a significant decrease in energy consumption with
    respect to the state-of-art mechanisms. Data availability Not applicable. References

    Abstract: Due to the cost-effective nature and deployment flexibility of wireless
    sensor network (WSN), it has been extensively used in many real world applications.
    Sensor nodes are relatively inexpensive and capable of data processing and wireless
    communication with some level of intelligence, they play a key role in real world
    applications. Precision irrigation in agriculture is a key application of wireless
    sensor network. Typically, a sensor node is powered by its on-board battery source.
    This limitation fully or partially contributes to causing many problems in the

    Moreover, available number of sensor types in a sensor node is typically limited

    to extend the number of sensor types. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sensor
    node system combining a flexible hardware prototype and innovative energy harvesting

    SECTION I. Introduction Advanced environment monitoring is a key technology for
    the progression of sustainable development. Due to the cost-effective nature and
    deployment flexibility, networks of tiny autonomous sensors capable of wireless
    communication, have been successfully used in a wide range of applications [1]–[3].
    With the help of WSN a very precise knowledge of the evolution of an ecological
    system can be gained. This precious information helps to understand natural phenomenas
    like animal tracking, prevent natural disasters such as bush fires and flooding
    or allow a fine tuning of resources allocation in resource-constrained areas like
    irrigation control. Precision agriculture using WSN has been an emerging field
    of interest in the research community [4]–[6] as it has shown many advantages
    over the traditional techniques such as availability of real-time measurement
    and huge time reduction in measurement collection. However, management and installation
    of WSN is still a costly and complex operation. Moreover, WSN is severely constrained
    in processing speed, memory, adaptability and energy availability. It has been
    evidenced that these constraints adversely affect the WSN''s performance [7].
    For instance, loss of connectivity of a critical sensor node, known as orphaned-node,
    due to depletion of energy may result in degradation of the whole network connectivity.
    A collaborative research project between the University of Melbourne and TU Darmstadt
    aims to address this issue by investigating a cost-effective, robust, and energy-efficient
    solution. An overview of an adaptive system combining a flexible hardware prototype,
    innovative energy harvesting techniques and optimized network organization techniques
    is described in this paper. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section II introduces the proposed modular sensor node hardware design. Novel
    energy harvesting circuits for outdoor environments are presented in Section III.
    The contribution of this proposed modular towards the orphaned node management
    is described in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes with a strategy for elaborating
    the topology of large sensor networks for irrigation monitoring whilst minimising
    the effect of orphaned-nodes in the network. SECTION II. Flexible Sensor Interface
    Deployment costs of wireless sensor networks for precision agriculture, farming
    and similar outdoor applications are still very high. The context specificity
    necessitates the development of custom hardware that supports the requirements
    of a given application. This step, which involves high development costs, is mandatory
    to achieve very low power and energy-efficient operation with hardware specially
    adapted for the target environment. This run to energy-efficiency results in the
    development and the production of application-specific platforms that dramatically
    increase the deployment costs of such applications. Such expenses are still prohibitive
    for end users and limit the return on investment of these systems. A solution
    to this issue is the utilization of a generic hardware platform that may be adapted
    to a maximal range of situations. Large amount of such reusable modules can be
    produced in order to decrease the overall costs and make the installation affordable.
    The performance and power consumption cost induced by the genericity can be covered
    by novel heterogeneous energy-harvesting techniques as it will be demonstrated
    in the next section. A. Modularity The most obvious design feature to improve
    flexibility is modularity. A wireless sensor node is typically divided in four
    main components: the radio interface, the processing unit, the sensors and the
    power management unit. Developing each of these components in a separate way with
    predefined interfaces allow an easier hardware customization. Modules may be interchanged
    according to the application needs such as higher transmission range, powerful
    computing unit, etc). Stackable boards enable a Lego-like personalization of the
    mote [8], [9]. Depending on the sensor network environmental conditions, custom
    energy harvesting techniques can be selected to maximize the power generation.
    Solar cells are preferable for smart agriculture whereas piezoelectric patches
    are more suitable for motor condition monitoring for example. B. Adaptability
    Each sensor used for the application requires a custom hardware (analog to digital
    converter or communication interface) and software interface. Besides, the limited
    connectivity of low power microcontrollers traditionally used with wireless sensor
    nodes highly restrict the number of pluggable sensors. These problems can be solved
    by extending the processor with a dynamically configurable component with a large
    number of I/Os. These requirements are fulfilled by Field Programmable Gate Arrays
    (FPGAs). These chips can be programmed with custom digital hardware architectures
    allowing a energy-efficient and faster implementation of sensors interfaces as
    shown in Figure 1. Moreover, the size of the configuration data of this family
    of devices may be reduced to a few amount of bytes. This enables dissemination
    of interfaces upgrades into low bandwidth wireless sensor networks. Thus, a new
    sensor may be dynamically plugged at run-time to a node and remotely activated
    via the base station of the network. This operation do not require programming
    hardware or complex manipulation and thus reduce the maintenance costs of the
    network. For applications generating data at high sample rates, FP-GAs can be
    used to preprocess the data at very low energy costs. Useful information is extracted
    from the data locally, thus reducing the traffic of the network and the global
    energy consumption. [10] SECTION III. Energy Harvesting Additional power consumption
    costs introduced by the generic platform solution may be compensated by an efficient
    power management based on energy harvesting. Sensor nodes powered only by batteries
    usually have a lifetime limited to some months. Using energy harvested from the
    surrounding environment, this lifetime may be extended to years, making the sensor
    node totally autonomous from the energy point of view [11]. For outdoor deployments,
    photovoltaics is the most common approach. However alternative sources exist and
    may be used instead of or in combination with solar panels when the energy scavenged
    from the sun is not sufficient: Piezoelectric Harvester: Using piezo-electric
    material, energy can be harvested from vibrating structures. Enough energy can
    be accumulated to recharge the battery of a sensor node by optimizing the power
    management circuit to work at the resonance frequency of the vibrating mass. Such
    systems can be used for example on animals: their movements will create the energy
    necessary to power the sensor nodes they are wearing. Other possible sources are
    pump motors used for irrigation. Thermoelectric Harvester: Thermogenerators are
    small planar modules that can generate energy from temperature difference. Based
    on the Seebeck effect, these thermoelectric converters may be used in addition
    to solar panels in very hot environments. The sun will directly heat one side
    of the generator, creating a potential difference large enough to contributes
    to the charging of the sensor node battery. Efficient isolation between the hot
    side and the cold side as well as optimized circuitry will increase the performance
    of this solution. Fig. 1. Architecture of an Adaptive Node Show All These energy
    sources can be used independently or together in order to reduce the maintenance
    of the sensor network. This autonomy makes the hardware more reliable and adaptable
    to a larger number of environments. A. Hybrid Energy Harvesting Circuit A specific
    circuit has been developed at TU Darmstadt to combine thermoelectric and solar
    energy in a single system. Both converters are based on a single-ended primary-inductor
    DC/DC converter (SEPIC) controlled by a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal. The
    duty cycle cycle of this signal has a direct influence on the efficiency of the
    conversion and on the amount of scavenged energy. For given environmental conditions
    (light and temperature for a solar panel for example), there is a maximum power
    output corresponding to a specific PWM duty cycle value. This is illustrated for
    a solar panel in Figure 2 with different light conditions (from cloudy weather
    up to direct summer sunlight). The duty cycle of the SEPIC must then be dynamically
    adapted according to changing environmental conditions in order to maximize the
    power output. This process is referenced as the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT).
    For small scaled systems like wireless sensor nodes considered in the frame of
    this paper, the energy spent to adapt this duty cycle is not negligible and should
    be included in the balance for computing the efficiency of the whole energy harvesting
    circuit. Classical MPPT algorithms are based on “Perturb and Observe” methods
    [12]. Different values of duty cycles are tested until the maximum is found. This
    may however requires a significant amount of measurements until the maximum point
    is found, which is undesirable for the energy efficiency and the response time
    of the system. We therefore base our approach on the relationship between the
    open circuit input voltage and the optimal input voltage at the maximum power
    point, also known as the fractional Open-Circuit voltage method [13]. This further
    gives a relationship between the open circuit voltage and the optimal PWM duty
    cycle (as it can be observed in Figure 3). Fig. 2. Measured Output Power v.s.

    v.s. the Open Circuit Voltage Show All Based on this relation, a Look-up-table
    has been elaborated to map measured open circuit voltages with duty cycles of
    the PWM generator circuit. This circuit has been realized with custom digital
    logic in a low-power FPGA (Microsemi IGLOO AGL060). Lower power consumption can
    be achieved by designing a mixed-signal Application Specific Integrated Circuit
    (ASIC) integrating all components. Because of the high production cost of such
    chips in small quantities and our desire to principally demonstrate a methodology
    and design concepts, we restricted the evaluation to the FPGA-based energy-harvesting
    circuit. The fabricated prototype of the whole system can be observed in Figure
    4. Fig. 4. HaLOEWEn [9] with Hybrid Energy Harvesting Module Show All For demonstration,
    the power harvested by the solar cell is used to charge the Li-ion battery of
    a capacity of 4.6AH. Two charging procedures with and without MPPT algorithm are
    recorded simultaneously, as shown in Figure 5. The charging procedure has been
    started on 01.09.2011 and stopped on 13.09.2011 for a period of 12 days. The right
    hand side of the y-axis shows the strength of the radiated light recorded with
    measuring the induced voltage of an open-loaded solar cell (indicated by gray
    line). The left hand side of the y-axis shows the charging procedure with the
    MPPT algorithm – Fractional Open Circuit Voltage indicated by blue line, while
    the charging procedure with a fixed duty cycle is represented by the green line.
    The results show that the battery is charged much faster by employing the MPPT
    algorithm. When sunlight is not available, energy can still be harvested from
    other sources. The Energy Harvesting Module includes additional circuitry for
    thermoelectric power generation making it hybrid. Accumulated heat can be thus
    converted in electrical energy and charge the sensor node battery at the same
    time as the solar harvester. The circuit is based on a SEPIC converter, whose
    PWM signal is generated in an identical way as the solar harvester. The implementation
    of the thermoelectric MPPT algorithm on the same FPGA allows a share of available
    ressources. Even if the amount of harvested energy is significantally lower than
    the solar part, it is still sufficient to charge the battery and increase node
    lifetimes. When either accumulated heat and light are not sufficient to efficiently
    harvest energy, the control circuits (PWM generator and MPPT modules) are automatically
    powered down by using hysteresis comparators and power gating. The modules are
    only switched on when the potential energy is sufficient to supply the control
    circuit itself. Fig. 5. The Battery Charging Procedure with (Blue Line) and without
    MPPT Algorithm (Green Line) Show All SECTION IV. Orphan Nodes A sensor node delivers
    its measurements by establishing a connection to the base station (or coordinator)
    through single or multiple hop communication. To establish a network connection,
    it is required to obtain a network address from a router-capable parent node [4].
    In practice, this might not occur, if the parent node is running out of network
    addresses due to inefficient address assignment or very low signal level received
    at the node caused due to obstacles and undesirable atmospheric conditions. The
    existence of large number of orphaned nodes adversely affects the performance
    of wireless sensor network applications such as real time sensor-based automated
    irrigation control systems where wireless sensor network is used not only to collect
    measurements from the environment but also to control the irrigation actuators.
    Considering a scenario where a sensor node, which controls the irrigation actuators,
    is not connected to the network resulting in lost of control signal from base
    station and caused damage to crops due to either shortage or excessive amount
    of water. Even though the impact of orphaned nodes on the system is the same as
    the exhausted or dead nodes, it is possible to restore them back to the network.
    However, connecting orphaned nodes back to the network may require some compromises
    since a parent node can possess only a limited number of children nodes. Developing
    protocols to manage the orphaned nodes in real time to optimise the performance
    of wireless sensor network is a challenging task in harsh environmental conditions.
    In our previous study, we developed orphaned-node managing algorithms focused
    on restoring connections of selected orphaned nodes back to the network despite
    sacrificing some of the connected nodes to improve the performance of the WSN
    [14]. Soil moisture level and air temperature were collected using the WSN and
    considered for the irrigation strategy. Since the sensor measurement are corrupted
    by noise, we estimated their real values using extended Kalman filtering. A simulation
    result from our previous study is illustrated in Figure 6 shows that the orphaned
    node management improved the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated states
    (soil moisture and temperature). With the development of this proposed adaptive
    sensor node, we can incorporate various sensors such as wind direction and canopy
    level to make the irrigation strategy more robustic. Currently, we are working
    on adopting our orphaned node management algorithms considering the supplementary
    energy resources provided by this proposed adaptive sensor node. Fig. 6. Sum of
    RMSE of the estimated states with and without using orphaned node management algorithm
    Show All SECTION V. Conclusion The application of wireless sensor network in agriculture
    industry offers a wide range advantages over traditional techniques used for monitoring
    and irrigating large farms. However wireless sensor network suffers from various
    problems as addressed in this paper: inflexible in hardware/software interfaces,
    limited energy resources and presence of orphaned nodes. We are focusing on developing
    inexpensive, energy efficient and robust hardwares to support real-time reconfiguration
    of modules and protocols to increase the performance of the wireless sensor network
    while reducing the network traffic in harsh environmental conditions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT
